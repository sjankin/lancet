It requires that we annually report our activities and results related to the human rights employee rights, environment and anti-corruption principles stated in the initiative. The Group’s report on sustainability serves as such report – a COP (Communication on Progress). More information about Global Compact can be found at www.unglobalcompact.org GLOBAL REPORTING We use GRI Standards for voluntary reporting of sustainable development. INITIATIVE (GRI) The guidelines include financial, environmental and social dimensions related to the organisation and is the leading global initiative in this area. In 2017 we carried out a materiality assessment to identify the main sustain­ability topics for KONGSBERG and for our most important stakeholders. This is described in detail on page 42–43. Our reporting is in our opinion, on the whole, in accordance with the GRI Reporting Principles. GRI applies a classification that shows to what extent a company uses GRI’s definitions and disclosure requirements, namely Core or Comprehensive. KONGSBERG has decided to report on Core level. On our website, under www.kongsberg.com/investor-relations/reports-­andpresentations/, there is an index showing the GRI standards and indicators that are reported and where the information is found in the company’s Annual Report and Sustainability Report. More information about GRI can be found at www.globalreporting.org THE NORWEGIAN The Norwegian Accounting Act requires that large enterprises report on corporate ACCOUNTING ACT social responsibility in the Directors’ report or in a separate report. The report must include information about human rights, employee rights and social conditions, the environment and anti-corruption work. In our opinion, the Sustainability Report for 2018 fulfils these requirements.

In our opinion, a responsible approach to taxation is decisive for our long-term activities in the countries in which we operate. This includes identifying and complying with current tax legislation, disclosing all the necessary information to the relevant authorities, and taking prudent tax positions where tax legislation allows different interpretations or choices.

Our approach to tax risks follows the same principles that apply to all other business risks. We consider reputation and corporate social responsibility as well as purely financial impacts. When making decisions on tax we take into account the materiality of any item, as well as the costs of effective risk mitigation actions. By being compliant in terms of local tax legislation, we aim to minimize tax risk.

In addition to reducing NOX and CO2 emissions, Yara Birkeland will improve road safety *by removing up to 40,000 truck loads per year from the roads in populated and urban areas. KONGSBERG is responsible for the development and delivery of all key technology on board the Yara Birkeland. It was announced in August that Yara Birkeland will be built by VARD in Brevik. Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg attended the signing of the agreement between Yara and VARD in Brevik. Nine Ro-Ro vessels to the Italian Grimaldi Group In August 2018, it was announced that Kongsberg Maritime, together with the Chinese company Nanjing Jinling Shipyard, had been awarded a contract for nine roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Ro) vessels to the Italian company Grimaldi Group. These are hybrid technology ships powered by electricity when they are docked and by conventional fossil-based fuel during transportation. Photo: Courtesy of Knud E. Hansen One Ro-Ro vessel will weigh 64,000 metric tonnes; it will be 238 metres long and 34 metres wide. “We are happy to have secured these contracts that will strengthen our position in the hybrid ship market. The project will involve resources from both Norway and China”, says president of Kongsberg Maritime, Egil Haugsdal.

By the year 2030, global food production must increase by 70 per cent – with less use of resources and a minimal ecological footprint. Two-thirds of the earth’s surface is covered with water, but only 2 per cent of this is used for food production. KONGSBERG are working together with Ocean Farming to develop the world’s first digital ocean farm, “Ocean Farm 1”. The first generation of farmed fish was harvested in January 2019. However, the real leap is expected to come with the “Smart Fish Farm”, which will be twice as big as the ocean farm and is set to be launched in 2022. Satellites for monitoring illegal fishing Illegal fishing is a global problem and a serious threat to fish populations and marine ecosystems. Kongsberg Satellite Service (KSAT) com­ municates with satellites every time they pass over the ground station on Svalbard. Much like the Troll research station in Antarctica, they receive information from the satellites that circle the Earth in as little as 100 minutes. In the fight against illegal fishing, these satellites can supply radar images or high-­ resolution images to identify vessels, etc. Combined with the AIS (automatic identification system), this can help detect vessels that are in places where they are not supposed to be.

Safety is always most important. Our HSE culture is built on being proactive, and on transparent reporting, which ensures learning and continuous improvement. The HSE culture will be part of our business processes. In 2018, KONGSBERG continued working towards our HSE vision. The Group’s HSE forum, which consists of HSE managers from all business areas, is responsible for carrying out joint activities that apply to the entire Group. A milestone in 2018 was establishing and arranging KONGSBERG Global HSE Day, where “Awareness” was an overarching topic. Local initiatives adapted to the individual risk environments were encouraged. This event also included the presentation of Safe@Kongsberg, our very own HSE brand. Our HSE KPIs have also seen a positive development. The number of incidents with and without absence has been reduced. This year there was a focus on reporting more near-accidents and observations, which has contributed to the reduction. Travel activity is one of our greatest risk areas. Systematic training of managers and employees has helped ensure proper conduct and safe journeys. An emergency team has been established to handle any incident that might occur in connection with our employees’ travels. Going forward, our HSE work will still strive for continuous improvement. In addition, the companies that are set to become part of KONGSBERG in 2019 will provide valuable knowledge. A fire drill was one of many activities during the “KONGSBERG Global HSE Day”. This is from our premises in China.

The importance of this work is reflected in our HR strategy and by the Board. We work systematically and purposefully to recruit, develop and retain people of different age groups, ethnicity and gender. Recently, the main focus has been on the gender balance. The focus on diversity must be implemented in promotion, recruitment and management development, with periodic measurement and follow-up. In common with other technology companies, KONGSBERG is facing challenges in that the proportion of women choosing a career in technology continues to be low. In 2018, the percentage of women in technology careers was recorded as 19.9 per cent. The percentage of women in the company is increasing and is now at 22 per cent. The proportion of female managers at KONGSBERG has also increased noticeably. There are multiple reasons for this. The most important thing is to have ambitions and targets, and then measure the results driving behavioural change. The HR strategy includes several concrete measures supporting these targets. One of our initiatives to motivate women to apply for management roles has been Female Forum. The intention behind the forum is to give female managers an opportunity to meet and use the network as a tool. In 2018, Female Forum was implemented in China, in addition to Norway. Within the recruitment of women, for example, we have in recent years worked actively internally to bring women into senior positions, and externally to help more women choose a career in technology. A key factor has been awareness when hiring new managers. This has produced results, and is a consequence of targeted work and concrete measures. In 2018, Female Forum was implemented for Lorum the ipsum first her time står bildetekst in China. til bildet.

This is a 48 hour case competition, where groups of 2–5 students work on solving a hypothetical future scenario where sustainability and technology are at the core of the problem. The purpose of the competition has been to motivate students to complete their degrees, due to the significant drop-out of first and second-­ year students in certain subjects, and to relate their theoretical knowledge to solving practical problems they may encounter in working life. In 2018, the topic of the competition was “The ocean space – food production at sea”. The challenge presented was to describe how to exploit the opportunities of the seas and create a sustainable aquaculture and food production on an industrial scale. The students were asked to design the “from sea to plate” value chain on an overarching level, reflect on technical and societal issues connected to sea-related food production, and subsequently describe the solution and go into detail regarding one or two of the technical solutions proposed. This year’s winner was the team “Worst Case Scenario”. Their proposal was based on circular economic theory which entails designing an industry so that the fewest possible resources are wasted. In their entry, the team demonstrated the use of technology and expertise in an innovative and sustainable way. Their solution addressed five criteria: Problem delimitation, innovation, feasibility, sustainability and market potential. The winners were named by a jury consisting of Geir Håøy, CEO and president of KONGSBERG, Pål André Eriksen, KONGSBERG’s Technology Forum, Gunnar Bovim, rector at NTNU, Martha Kold Bakkevig, KONGSBERG board member and Alexandra Bech Gjørv, CEO of SINTEF. “Worst Case Scenario” presented their winning concept at KONGSBERG’s executive management meeting in January 2019.

The Report is the responsibility of and has been approved by the management of the Company. Our responsibility is to draw a conclusion based on our review. We have based our work on the international standard ISAE 3000 “Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The objective and scope of the engagement were agreed with the management of the Company and included the subject matters on which we provide our conclusion below. Based on an assessment of materiality and risks, our work included analytical procedures and interviews as well as a review on a sample basis of evidence supporting the subject matters. We have conducted interviews of managers responsible for preparing the Report and for sustainability aspects at corporate level. We believe that our work provides an appropriate basis for us to draw a conclusion with a limited level of assurance on the subject matters. In such an engagement, less assurance is obtained than would be the case had an audit-level engagement been performed. Conclusions Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention causing us not to believe that:  Kongsberg Gruppen has applied procedures to collect, compile and validate sustainability information for 2018 from its reporting units to be included in the Report, as summarised on pages 35 – 36.  Information presented for 2018 is consistent with data accumulated as a result of these procedures and appropriately presented in the Report.  The Report fulfils the content requirements for reporting in regards to sustainability as stated in the Norwegian Accounting Act, § 3-3c, article one.  Kongsberg Gruppen applies a reporting practice for its sustainability reporting that is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards’ reporting principles and the reporting fulfils the in accordance level Core according to the GRI Standards. The GRI Index referred to from page 43 in the Report appropriately reflects where information on each of the reported standard and specific disclosures of the GRI Standards is presented.

Code of Practice DEVIATIONS FROM THE CODE OF PRACTICE According to the Group’s own evaluation, KONGSBERG deviates from the code of practice on one major point: Item 6 – General Meeting There are two deviations on this point: I. The entire Board has not usually attended the General Meeting. Thus far, the items on the agenda of the General Meeting have not required this. One or more Board representatives are always present to respond to questions. Other Board members participate on an ad hoc basis. From the Group’s perspective, this is considered to be sufficient. II. Article 8 of the Articles of Association specifies that the General Meetings are to be chaired by the Chair of the Board. If the Chair is absent, the General Meeting is chaired by the Board’s Deputy Chair. In the absence of both, the Chair shall be elected by the General Meeting. This is a departure from the recommendation regarding an independent chair. The arrangement has been adopted by the shareholders through a unanimous resolution of the General Meeting and has worked satisfactorily thus far. management have developed 1 REPORT ON 2 OPERATIONS strategies in marketing, business CORPORATE areas, acquisition, competence, GOVERNANCE social responsibility, technology Articles of association and finance, as well as capital Kongsberg Gruppen ASA is a structure.

Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace has mostly government customers and is therefore not that exposed to credit risk. Kongsberg Maritime generally serves customers from the private sector, and is more exposed to credit risk. Unrest in the shipyard and shipping industry increases the credit risk in the markets addressed by Kongsberg Maritime. Kongsberg Maritime has made provisions to take this into account. Kongsberg Maritime has its own credit manual and dedicated employees to monitor and reduce the credit risk. Credit insurance is used only to a limited extent, but is considered in certain cases. The Group has a policy decision of maintaining a responsible balance between increasing sales at good margins and the risk of losses. In addition, large parts of the Group operate on the basis of specially adapted credit manuals including routines for debt collection. Concerning credit risk, KONGSBERG has strict requirements for creditworthiness.

For both Kongsberg Maritime and Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace, there will not be an impairment situation before relatively large changes in the key assumptions, and these changes are considered to be outside the probable outcome. Estimation uncertainty There will always be uncertainty related to the estimate of value in use. The assessments are based on key assumptions as described above, and are to a large degree influenced by market data for comparable companies, interest rates and other risk conditions. These calculations are based on discounted future cash flows, in which judgement was used as regards future profit and operation. Significant changes in the cash flows will affect the value of goodwill.

This has no effect on the tax expense in the income statement, but as a consequence, tax payable will fluctuate over time. Correction of taxes payable for previous years The effect is mainly due to changes in previous years’ NOKUS taxation, Permanent differences as well as judgements by Norwegian tax authorities relating to internal pricing. The judgements are being appealed. The effective tax rate is affected by source tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, adjustments for previous years and the fact that shares of net income from associated companies are recognised after tax. In addition, the tax-reducing differences consist of emissions costs recognised directly in equity, partly offset by non-deductible transaction costs in connection with the purchase of shares.

Cash flow hedging is considered to be efficient and all the effects of a currency rate change will thus be recognised in comprehensive income. For fair value hedges, neither comprehensive income nor the annual results will be affected as long as the hedges are 100 per cent efficient. When KONGSBERG has a hedging strategy that generally hedges all contractual currency flows and receivables in foreign currency, fluctuations in the exchange rate will have minor effect on the profitability of the contracts.

The effect on results that occurs will be recognised and realised in line with the progress of the projects. The capitalised value associated with the rolled cash flow hedges amounts to MNOK 76 at 31 December 2018 (MNOK 122 at 31 December 2017). 2) The net effect from the cash flow hedges before tax that are recognised in comprehensive income amounts to MNOK 65 in 2018 (MNOK 509 in 2017). In the comprehensive income, there is a change of MNOK 86, and the deviation of MNOK -21 is due to a change in the fair value of interest rate swaps of MNOK 1 and basis swaps of MNOK -22. If an expected project is contracted and a fair value hedge is established, the hedge reserve is recognised as transferred from comprehensive income to the capitalised value of the hedged project. If an expected cash flow occurs and does not result in a project hedge, the hedge reserve is recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transactions. In 2018, no effects were recognised related to inefficient cash flow hedges in the ordinary results (MNOK -237 in 2017). Hedge inefficiency on cash flow hedges is also included in the record “recognised gains/losses in the period” in the table above.

No adjustment is made with respect to these prices. Level 2: Fair value is measured based on data other than the list prices covered by level 1, but which is based on observable market data either directly or indirectly. These methods have some uncertainty in the determination of fair value. Level 3: Fair value is measured using models that substantially employ non-observable market data. This involves more uncertainty connected to the determination of fair value. See also Note 4 “Fair value” for a discussion of the fair value measurement. H) Estimate uncertainty KONGSBERG has a range of financial instruments that are recognised The assessments are always based on KONGSBERG’s best estimates, at fair value. When market prices cannot be observed directly through but it is still likely that the observable market information and the traded prices, fair value is estimated by using different models that assumptions will change over time. Such changes can affect the either build on internal estimates or input from banks or other market calculated values of financial instruments considerably, and thereby players. The assumptions for such assessments include spot prices, result in gains and losses that will affect future periods’ income forward prices and interest curves. statements. How such changes affect the income statement depends on the type of instrument and whether it is included in a hedging relation. 21 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Nominal amounts in MNOK 31 Dec 18 31 Dec 17 Bank deposits 10 038 2 956 Total 10 038 2 956 Bank guarantees have been furnished for funds related to withholding tax for employees of MNOK 273 (MNOK 274 in 2017).

The process of measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligations and selecting the method of measuring this progress, involves judgement and estimates by the management. It may be uncertainty in relation to the transaction price, allocation of the transaction price, and in the estimated expenses in fulfilling the contract. The recognition of customer contracts over time is a key audit matter, due the extent and complexity of ongoing projects in the Group with duration over several years, and where management exercises judgement to estimate the progress, including expected transaction price and expenses to fulfil the contract. We evaluated the application of accounting principles, including the implementation of IFRS 15, methods for estimating the projects’ progress, routines for monitoring projects and tested controls over project assessments and recognition. We discussed estimated total project expenses, including provisions for guarantees, with project management. We evaluated these estimates against comparable projects, and analysed the development in margins for selected projects and the total project portfolio. For selected contracts, we tested estimated revenues against agreements, incurred expenses against invoices and hours against project reports, and assessed the total estimated project expenses. In addition, we have analysed actual margins on selected completed projects against estimated total margins during the project period in order to evaluate management’s accuracy in judgments and estimates. We refer to note 2 for details on estimation uncertainty and note 7 on customer contracts in the Groups’ financial statements. Cur r ency hedging of futur e cash flows in for eign cur r ency A large part of the Group’s cash flows is in foreign currencies. The Group hedges contractual cash flows and a part of highly probable future cash flows by entering into forward currency contracts. The use of hedge accounting and documentation of hedges might require management judgement and require close follow up. Due to the amounts involved, we view currency hedging of future cash flows in foreign currency as a key audit matter. We assessed the design and tested the effectiveness of internal controls over designation and follow up of the hedging relationships, including testing of hedge ineffectiveness. We assessed if the documentation relating to the currency hedging was in accordance with requirements in the accounting standards. We considered the Group’s process of follow up of forward contracts entered into against expected cash flows and tested reconciliations between supporting source systems and documents used to manage and document hedging relationships. We obtained external fair value confirmations of unrealised hedging instruments at year end, and we assessed the Group’s presentation and classification of currency hedges in the financial statements, including note disclosures. We refer to Note 3 for details on accounting principles and note 20 on financial instruments in the Group’s financial statements. Other information Other information consists of the information included in the Company’s annual report and sustainability report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer (management) are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with law, regulations and generally accepted auditing principles in Norway, including ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: ► identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ► obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control ► evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. ► conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. ► evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. ► obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Opinion on the Board of Directors’ report and on the report on corporate governance and corporate social responsibility Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Board of Directors’ report and in the report on corporate governance and corporate social responsibility concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption and proposal for the allocation of the result is consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations. Opinion on registration and documentation Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have considered necessary in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, «Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information», it is our opinion that management has fulfilled its duty to ensure that the Company's accounting information is properly recorded and documented as required by law and bookkeeping standards and practices accepted in Norway.
