The Three Corporate Principles were formulated in 1934, as the action guidelines of Mitsubishi Trading Company (Mitsubishi Shoji Kaisha), based on the teachings of Koyata Iwasaki, the fourth president of Mitsubishi. We look to the Three Corporate Principles as the source of inspiration for our business activities and also for our initiatives to fulfill our responsibilities toward the global environment and society. Corporate Philosophy—The Three Corporate Principles Corporate Responsibility to Society “Shoki Hoko” Strive to enrich society, both materially and spiritually, while contributing towards the preservation of the global environment. Integrity and Fairness “Shoji Komei” Maintain principles of transparency and openness, conducting business with integrity and fairness. Global Understanding Through Business “Ritsugyo Boeki” Expand business, based on an all-encompassing global perspective. (The modern day interpretation of the Three Corporate Principles, as agreed on at the Mitsubishi Kinyokai meeting of the companies that constitute the so-called Mitsubishi group in January 2001.) Corporate Standards of Conduct 1 Aim of Corporate Business Activities Through its business activities, Mitsubishi Corporation will endeavor to increase its value. At the same time, the company will strive to enrich society in all ways, developing and offering its customers the best services and products, with the highest regard for safety. 2 Fairness and Integrity in Corporate Business Activities Mitsubishi Corporation will continue to develop its business activities in compliance with all relevant laws, international regulations and internal rules. The company will act responsibly and will respect the highest social standards. 3 Respect for Human Rights and Employees Mitsubishi Corporation will respect human rights and will not engage in any discrimination. The company will preserve and improve its corporate strengths through the development of its employees, all the while respecting the character and individuality of each employee. 4 Information Security and Disclosure While Mitsubishi Corporation will continue to develop, implement and improve the effectiveness of its information security management system, at the same time the company will disclose information accurately and in a timely fashion, so as to maintain transparency and be correctly understood by both its stakeholders and the general public. 5 Consideration for Environmental Issues Mitsubishi Corporation understands that an enterprise cannot continue to prosper without consideration for its environmental performance, and will strive to protect and improve the global environment and pursue sustainable development through all aspects of its business activities. 6 Contribution to Society As a responsible member of society, Mitsubishi Corporation will actively carry out philanthropic programs in an effort to promote the enrichment of society. Moreover, the company will support efforts of its employees to contribute to society. 06 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2018 MC’s Value Creation Process By harnessing management capital backed by a robust management platform, MC will strive to deliver ­sustainable growth by simultaneously generating economic, societal and environmental value through initiatives focused on the seven Key Sustainability Issues—management priorities we must address and tackle.

The strategy has the following four components. * Simultaneously generating economic, societal and environmental value through our businesses Business Portfolio • Portfolio-Based Decision Making 1 Strategy • Strategy Creation through Multi-Dimensional Portfolio Analyses • Value-Added Cyclical Growth Model & Improved ROE 2 Growth Mechanisms • Enhancement of New Business Concepts & Digital Strategies • Continuous Development of Highly Skilled Management Professionals 3 HR System Reforms • Redesigned Evaluation and Compensation Systems to Ensure Reciprocal Growth Between the Company and Employees 4 Financial Targets & • Financial Target for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2022: ¥900 billion Capital Policy • Financial Discipline and Extension of Progressive Dividend Scheme 12 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2018 Message from the President and CEO CORPORATE VISION Assessing Changes in the Business Environment — Awareness of the External Environment Shaping Our Strategy — FRONT LINES OF VALUE CREATION A Tide of Business Model Transformation Sweeping across Industries and a Changing Geopolitical Landscape First, I will explain the external environment that has shaped Midterm Corporate Strategy 2021—Achieving Growth Through Business Management Model. FRAMEWORK SUPPORTING VALUE CREATION To start, we expect to see more advances being made in digital technologies and more platform businesses emerging, trends that will likely trigger business model reforms that will cut across various industries. In fact, such developments are already underway in the automotive and power industries, and it is fair to say that we are now truly in the midst of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It would not be a stretch to suggest that in the future, the world economy will be driven by these new businesses. These changes have also brought new challenges, some faced by general society, REFERENCE INFORMATION such as how to better protect personal information, and others faced by corporations, such as how to adapt existing business models. Determining the best approaches to digitization and platform businesses is a crucial issue for MC as well. Our choices related to these issues will no doubt play a big role in shaping our Company’s future. Another factor that demanded our attention in conceiving this strategy is the world’s ever-changing geopolitical dynamics. It appears that the US and China trade tensions will not ease for some time, but despite that, it is unlikely that the world economy will enter a major recession, nor will their situation pose any threat to the fundamentals of economic development. Even with some restrictions on Chinese exports to the US, domestic demand remains robust in China and its economic influence on other countries continues to grow, so we see the possibility of a major slowdown as low. Furthermore, demand is healthy in the US and around the world, and the shift in manufacturing from China to other countries will very likely stimulate those economies. Looking forward, I am confident that changes in supply chains will create opportunities and ultimately invigorate the world economy. There are concerns that the friction caused by the contrasting political and economic structures in the US and China might eventually escalate into a geopolitical confrontation, but we see little likelihood of that happening anytime soon, and we expect the world economy to continue growing at its current pace. That said, the Company must nonetheless consider worst-case scenarios when analyzing its portfolio, including incidental military conflicts. MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2018 13 1 Proactively Adapting Our Business Portfolio to the Changing Times — Business Portfolio Strategy — The Twelve Sectors Comprising Our Business Portfolio Structure As mentioned before, we have a responsibility to stay on top of the changing times and proactively adapt our portfolio to find the optimal structure for each period. Under the new strategy, MC will be implementing a framework of portfolio-based decision-making to enable a holistic view across numerous industries. We will then determine which fields we need to be more proactive in and where we need to replace our assets, based on changes in our operating environment. MC’s portfolio will be structured as a 12-sector matrix, with upstream, midstream and downstream areas along the vertical axis, and four categories along the horizontal axis—Living, Mobility & Infrastructure, Energy & Power Generation and Services—the last of which will include businesses in IT, logistics, finance and so on. Provided MC improves its performance according to its current business plan, it should generate approximately three trillion yen in capital over the next three years. Our biggest challenge over that period will be determining the allocation and management of that capital. MC is strong in the Living, Mobility & Infrastructure, and Energy & Power Generation categories, but from here on, developing businesses in the downstream areas where MC has yet to firmly establish itself will be a matter of urgency. Meanwhile, more and more heavyweights backed by large customer bases are jostling for position in the Services sectors, where market growth is accelerating due to the rapid deployment of digital technologies. Midterm Corporate Strategy 2021 will give MC a three-year window to determine whether or not it should enter those sectors. We will optimize our business portfolio by applying MC’s unique multi-dimensional matrix. By considering not only quantitative aspects, but also vantage points such as region, industry presence and management engagement, we will develop a structure for constantly considering the best form for our portfolio. 14 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2018 Message from the President and CEO CORPORATE VISION FRONT LINES OF VALUE CREATION FRAMEWORK SUPPORTING VALUE CREATION Business Portfolio Strategy : Investment Balance (as of March 31, 2018) : Sectors REFERENCE INFORMATION Meat, Fish & Vegetables Upstream Communications Grains & Mineral Resources Natural Gas Data Assets Food Raw Materials Daily Necessities Motor Vehicles LNG Midstream Processing & Logistics Machinery & Power Generation Manufacturing Equipment Leasing Petrochemicals Healthcare Steel Downstream Mobility Services Distributed Power E-Commerce Retail Generation Urban Development Internet Services Living Mobility & Infrastructure Energy & Power Generation Services (IT, Logistics, Finance, etc.) MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2018 15 2 Aiming for Sustained Improvement in ROE through a Value-Added Cyclical Growth Model — Growth Mechanism — Potential Growth Sources ➡ Growth Drivers ➡ Core Businesses Our new growth model will enhance business value through this divestment‐to‐reinvestment cycle 16 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2018 Message from the President and CEO CORPORATE VISION MC’s objective is to identify Potential Growth Sources, nurture them into Growth Drivers, and increase their value to create next-generation Core Businesses. When we are no longer able to add value to a particular business, we will redirect capital to other businesses where we can add value. This virtuous growth cycle has long defined MC’s approach. Naturally, MC will continue this cycle, but moving forward it will be even more focused on maintaining an optimal portfolio balance. Should any of its businesses reach a point where the Company is no longer able to add value, MC FRONT LINES OF VALUE CREATION will not hesitate to divest from and replace that business, even if it is a Core Business. MC must be financially disciplined, but at the same time forward-looking, in order to identify attractive Growth Driver candidates that could represent the Company’s next generation of Core Businesses. Asset replacements will generate capital gains, meaning that as long as MC can continue this cycle, it can expect to maintain or even grow its return on equity (ROE). MC’s strengths are its holistic view across numerous industries, its expertise in conceiving new businesses, and its wealth of management talent to run them. I am confident that by applying those strengths to the full extent, the Company will be able to take its cyclical growth model to another level.

MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2018 17 Ten-Group Structure Underpinning the Business Portfolio Strategy Most of MC’s Business Groups have been around for many years, and the walls between them have gradually ­widened. Those walls must start coming down, and my feeling is that we must act now. So with that in mind, I decided to reorganize all of MC’s Business Groups to promote Companywide unity and adaptability. To build MC’s envisioned portfolio and boost its growth potential, operations that are capable of standing on their own as Core Businesses will form new Business Groups. Furthermore, some operations will be integrated in industries where we feel MC’s redefined position could leverage new business opportunities. Following these reorganizations, MC will have ten Business Groups, three more than it has at present. Its most important challenge will be to foster reciprocal growth between the Company and its employees, so a fundamental driver behind these reorganizations is to stimulate career development throughout MC. Six of the new Business Groups will represent Core Businesses: Natural Gas, Mineral Resources, Automotive & ­Mobility, Food Industry, Consumer Industry and Power Solution. MC’s near-term policies in all six of those Groups have been clarified, and the Company’s primary mission will be to build on its existing strengths. The mission in the other four Groups (Industrial Materials, Petroleum & Chemicals, Industrial Infrastructure and Urban Development) will be three-pronged and much more challenging. Firstly, these Groups will seek to identify Potential Growth Sources emerging from MC’s redefined New Structure from April 2019 President & CEO Executive Committee Corporate Staff Section (Position) Committees relevant to Midterm Business Investment Business Investment Management Dept.

Secondly, they will generate growth by integrating businesses from fresh perspectives. Thirdly, they will rearrange or restructure businesses in which additional growth is unlikely. MC’s history has shown us that the more complex the operating environments, the greater the opportunity for professional development, so naturally my expectations are high for our people working in these four Groups. I will be looking to them to produce MC’s next generation of Growth Drivers and Core Businesses. Each of these missions was formulated based on MC’s guiding philosophy, the Three Corporate Principles, and on its pledge to simultaneously generate economic, societal and environmental value. FRONT LINES OF VALUE CREATION I would like us to continue to reflect upon these principles whenever we consider specific strategies going forward. With all of that said, MC’s structure will not be set in stone. Should any developments in the external operating environment or business strategies warrant it, the Company will adapt as necessary. We must become an extremely flexible organization. MC’s corporate structure will also be rearranged to focus on the main themes of its new midterm strategy, namely its business portfolio, HR development and digital strategies. In addition to placing greater weight on the work done by the Investment Committee and the Human Resources Development Committee, MC will be establishFRAMEWORK SUPPORTING ing a Digital Strategy Committee that will report directly to the Executive Committee.

MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2018 19 Missions of the New Business Groups The demand for liquid natural gas (LNG), a principal source for both power generation and industrial applications, is growing. However, energy mix diversification driven by changes to the industrial Natural Gas structure, including the liberalization of the Japanese gas and power market, is increasing demand for the role of LNG supply/demand matching and adjustment. Our mission is to improve our value by meeting the needs of this new era. Against a backdrop of an increasingly competitive environment, diversifying materials needs are likely to present new business opportunities. Our mission is to redefine the role MC can play in providing Industrial Materials solutions to the industries in which it operates and focus resources in areas where the Company can leverage its strengths and capabilities. The transition to a low‐carbon society and increasing importance of environmental action continue to have an impact on the petroleum and chemicals industries. Our mission is to find solutions to global Petroleum & Chemicals issues by concentrating on Core Businesses in these industries where MC can demonstrate its strengths and functions. With metallurgical coal and copper as our main pillars, our mission is to further enhance the cost Mineral Resources competitiveness and the quality of our world‐class assets, while delivering long-term sustainability for our business in terms of both the environment and supply stability. More and more market players are looking to go digital and reduce their environmental footprints. Our mission is to redefine MC’s position in each industry by leveraging its existing machinery, ship Industrial Infrastructure and plant and engineering sales businesses and transitioning to high-value‐added business models providing solutions for those industries. Our mission is to capture demand and leverage MC’s formidable business foundations in the evolving automotive and mobility industries, which are embracing digital technologies and services encapsulated Automotive & Mobility by CASE (Connected, Autonomous, Sharing and Electric). The Group will endeavor to build business models aimed at solving peopleand goods-related mobility issues. Our mission is to help solve the societal challenges surrounding supply chains and build a stable and sustainable business model. The Group also contributes to Japanese companies by Food Industry expanding their high-quality products and services into overseas markets, thereby creating new growth opportunities. Our mission is to spearhead solutions to societal challenges in the retail and distribution industries and maximize the value of MC’s physical assets as social infrastructure, including its network of Consumer Industry retail stores. The Group will also effectively combine its physical assets with digital technologies to build ­consumer‐oriented retail and distribution platform businesses. Our mission is not only to contribute to stable power supplies, but also to create new added value Power Solution for power customers by combining renewables and other environmentally friendly energy sources with digital technologies. Our mission is to establish highly-value‐added and large-scale businesses, through combining MC’s Urban Development expertise in areas including urban development, infrastructure development and asset finance to meet societal and environmental needs such as urbanization and reduced carbon footprints. 20 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2018 Message from the President and CEO Enhancement of New Business Concepts & Digital Strategies CORPORATE VISION When reviewing the business landscape, we will reassess MC’s portfolio from top to bottom from a holistic industry viewpoint while keeping in mind industry restructuring, technical innovations and other global megatrends to identify Potential Growth Sources. MC will be appointing General Managers for Business Creation to all ten of its Business Groups, which will allow it to be even more proactive in identifying Potential Growth Sources. We will also be setting up a Business Creation Office in our Corporate Strategy & Planning Department, the mission of which will be to pick up on potential opportunities that FRONT LINES OF VALUE CREATION may be overlooked by the Business Groups and their various divisions. Internal systems and protocols will be put in place to facilitate collaborations between this new office and the Business Groups.

We have entered a new era, when digital technologies will be essential, not only for identifying Potential Growth Sources, but also for raising the value of MC’s current businesses. Part of MC’s new midterm strategy will be to address these developments via its Digital Strategy Committee, and the Company will also be appointing a Chief Digital Officer (CDO) and setting up a Digital Strategy Department under the CDO’s charge. General Managers for Digital Strategy will also be assigned to each of the Business Groups. The Digital Strategy Committee will work closely with the Business Creation Office and the Groups’ General Managers for Business Creation to promote business model reforms at MC Group companies and new business development in the areas outlined in orange in MC’s Business Portfolio Strategy matrix*, namely all of the Services sectors as well as all downstream businesses. * Please refer to the Business Portfolio Strategy matrix on page 15. MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2018 21 3 Overhaul the HR System — HR System Reforms — Continuously Produce Highly Skilled Management Professionals Capable of Exceling in Different Fields With the rapid pace of change in MC’s operating environment and increasingly common industry integration, societal needs are starting to change in a big way. In order to develop human resources capable of responding to such developments, MC has been considering an overhaul to the HR system over the past three years, and will now undergo its first major reform in some 20 years. The overarching objective of Midterm Corporate Strategy 2021 is “Achieving Growth Through Business Management Model.” To achieve that objective, MC must accelerate the development of future management professionals by providing them with varied experience, by being more meritocratic and by ensuring that the right people are assigned to the right positions. A key theme of MC’s strategy will be utilizing its management talent more broadly throughout the MC Group. Becoming a management professional demands certain know-how and expertise, and up to now, MC has required its employees to have around 20 years of experience before they can be promoted to such positions. However, going forward, the Company will ensure that its people gain basic management competencies within their first 10 years, so that they can be appointed to management positions at an appropriate time, regardless of age. To accomplish that objective, MC will be creating broader grade categories that will enable it to appoint and utilize its human assets more flexibly. Posts and personnel above a certain level will be managed Companywide rather than at the Business Group level, so as to speed up the development and deployment of management professionals throughout the Company. Under its new strategy, MC will also be more meritocratic, and employee remuneration will be based on the job level difficulty and performance. Furthermore, MC will be providing share-based compensation in addition to cash remuneration packages for certain employees in order to foster reciprocal employee-Company growth. MC’s evaluation system will also be changing. While the basis for employee evaluations will continue to be made by their direct superiors, the Company will also introduce a multilayered evaluation framework to ensure that employee performance is assessed from numerous perspectives, which will help MC to assign the right people to the right positions. One of the most important missions of all superiors will be to closely follow their employees’ progress and support their growth.

MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2018 33 Feature: The Challenge of Development and Innovation in the Automotive Industry Breakthrough Innovation 2 Breakthrough Point 3 Management Personnel Striving to Transform the Automotive Industry Refer to MC’s training policy on pages 64–65 The very structure of the automotive industry is about to change dramatically as a result of an epoch technological innovation referred to as “CASE” (Connected, Autonomous, Shared/Service, Electric). How are we to respond to this wave of change here in Indonesia, where we have grown the automotive business over many years around the core businesses of distribution, automobile financing, and local assembly? Faced with the pressing need to determine our path forward, I have been thinking daily about how to create new businesses. As I do so, the most important focus for me is customer needs. The answer can always be found with the customer. Our dealers and staff gather customer feedback from the front lines, and I visit our branches myself to hear directly from customers. This helps with creating businesses and making management decisions. Grasping the massive environmental changes surrounding the automotive industry in recent Atsushi Kurita President Director times, we will increase our earnings throughout the entire value chain and aim for sustainable Krama Yudha Tiga Berlian Motors (Indonesia) growth by further expanding our business domains, centered on our existing distribution and financing businesses.

This includes strengthening management supervision through such measures as appointing Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members who satisfy the conditions for Independent Directors or Independent Audit & Supervisory Board Members, and establishing advisory bodies to the Board of Directors where the majority of members are Outside Directors, Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members and Outside Members. At the same time, MC uses the executive officer system, etc., for prompt and efficient decision-making and business execution.

Since then, two and a half years have passed. MC achieved all of the quantitative targets we had announced in Midterm Corporate Strategy 2018—Evolving Our Business Model from Investing to Managing by the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The systems introduced during this period are already making steady progress and delivering results. To accelerate our initiatives for further growth, we formulated a new management direction for the three years starting from the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 and called it Midterm Corporate Strategy 2021—Achieving Growth Through Business Management Model. In this integrated report, we present our specific initiatives aimed at maximizing corporate value by focusing on the MC Group’s strengths and transcending business group boundaries to steadily develop new pillars of future growth. Looking ahead, we will continue to do our utmost to ensure that our Integrated Report serves as an effective communication tool that positively ­contributes to constructive stakeholder dialogue. To do so, we will strive to improve the clarity of our reporting based on the valued feedback we receive from our stakeholders. In the course of preparing this report, we have worked closely with each of our internal departments to provide a summary of our holistic perspective on the MC Group as a whole. In the process, we have referred to the reporting framework propounded by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and other guidelines. We hereby affirm the legitimacy of both the preparation process and the content of disclosure with respect to this Integrated Report.
