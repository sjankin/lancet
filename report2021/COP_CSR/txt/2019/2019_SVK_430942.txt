AUGMENTED REALITY VOICE TECHNOLOGY IN The technology behind Augmented Reality (AR) enables MANUFACTURING bridging the physical environment of a shop’s floor with its We are developing an automatic identification technology virtual counterpart in the form of a digital twin. The virtual based on the recognition and digitization of human voice. layer provides immediate access and visualization of the right What’s more, we have made the system’s interpretation of the data on the site of production process directly. As a result of data from a human voice feasible, thanks to the specialized this, production personnel could aptly dispose situations with mobile terminal. an up-to-the-minute overview of production processes OR have at hand the information necessary to efficiently manage Users are not receiving information visually, but aurally. Voice maintenance operations or interventions per a particular commands confirm their activities. We are widely using the machine or equipment. system PickByVoice, which enables employees to move freely. TELEMANIPULATION GESTURE NAVIGATION THROUGH DYNAMIC CONTROL VISUAL ELEMENTS We monitor moving objects via a set of software solutions It’s a projection of a technological procedure or navigational based on state-of-the-art technologies that process images information into the operational space of an employee directly. obtained from an online video. Thanks to advancements in Eventually, we will be installing Head-Up displays onto a car’s motion and position detection, both of which could sense front windscreen or another reflex glass; and thereafter, signal an operator’s movement in space, we have introduced new lights in designated positions. possibilities that can be used to control production lines with This way, we would achieve a more precise navigation system; an operator’s gestures. Besides the immense advantages of hence an employee would be afforded a free hand and do not contactless control, this technology makes it possible to perform need to take eyes off their display devices while working. An 3D scanning of an operator’s motions, which is applicable in the employee could ably interpret a change of color as an alteration training of an assembly line’s operations at a factory’s training in the state of a machine, equipment, or material. The examples center(s). of such navigation are PickByLight and PickByPoint systems or different variation of ANDON system. PREDICTION OF DEMAND IN LOGISTICS PRODUCTION PLANNING AND Big Data presents an inspiration to develop new business PREDICTIVE MANUFACTURING models for logistics services. As a result of it, we can analyze Based on the analysis of production data, we can easily large volumes of heterogeneous data and unveil patterns predict the origin of scraps, downtimes, and delays in the of behavior and relations. It lets us identify anomalies in manufacturing process. This tool notifies supervisors upfront automatized production’s data. We could anticipate delays in about the possibility of an emergency or reclassifies the order of supply chain and devise an appropriate workaround to tackle production to minimalize the risk of incident. them during logistics services, thereby achieving higher client’s satisfaction. PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE We are working with a tool that extends the existing maintenance plan through statistics and data mining methods. This tool notifies the operator of when the next interference would occur because it detects when a machinery or equipment is liable to succumb to high-risk failure. On the reverse, the tool, based on predictive maintenance, evaluates an equipment’s condition and can call off planned maintenance if the equipment does not neccesitate one. Next generation automation enables us to integrate a machine or equipment’s diagnosis into the operational systems directly. The industrial Internet of Things (IoT) provides a platform through which information can be shared, while Big Data analyzes and stores the information. OPERATIVE DISPATCHING AUTONOMOUS LOGISTICS SOLUTION Each machine or equipment operating in a factory or enterprise BASED ON THE MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM communicates, thus they generate an extensive amount of Each unit (i.e., equipment, accessory, vehicle) is assigned a data. Fittingly, employees are unable to keep track of all those virtual agent in the cyber system. The system, based on the information and notifications. principles of interconnectivity and decentralization, synchronizes We are analyzing these Big Data directly in our systems to and coordinates units as a whole entity. These aggregations control manufacturing operatively. Implemented self-learning (regarding their mutual information and availability) perform algorithms and artificial neural networks provide already their tasks in an especially optimal fashion. consolidated information to users—in the right amount and moment—so that they can take practical and apposite decisions. WAREHOUSE POSITIONING OPTIMIZATION We predict the most appropriate positioning of goods in a warehouse in proportion to the expected quantity in a way that makes the best use of the warehouse’s space. Autonomous, self-learning, and genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks are the leading concepts of production automation in managing manufacturing operations and processes in real time. The algorithms are also serviceable in planning in the form of forecasts and prognosis for the optimization of industrial processes.

Our supplier provides Consumption of Packaged Paper us with an overview of all cooling equipment in operation with (in pieces) more than 3 kg of refrigerant in cooling circuits. R410A is the fluorinated greenhouse gas used by ANASOFT. The total quantity of fluorinated greenhouse gases in such equipment for 2018 is 50 kg. It is impossible to define the quantity of emissions prouced by company vehicles as this data was not monitored in 2017. We also cannot provide NOX, SOX or data on other categories of atmospheric emissions for the same reason. 113 107 99 WASTE 2016 2017 2018 Waste sorting has become a common practice. All employees are obliged to sort their waste. Every area is provided with containers for paper and plastic waste in order to facilitate waste separation. The ANASOFT turns over all electronic waste to a company with proper permits, which save the company significant expenses. Anti-Corruption Disseminating the Principles of Responsible Business Behaviour Practices ANASOFT is actively involved in disseminating the principles of Slovakia ranked about in the middle of the scale of responsible business practices and in raising awareness among 1 to 100 assessing success in creating conditions for entrepreneurs and the general public.
