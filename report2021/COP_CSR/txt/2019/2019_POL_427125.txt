Year 2018 abounded in interesting and important events for the energy industry. Which of them were of the most significance to PGE Group ? The past year was characterised by transformation. Poland’s energy industry began changing, and nothing will stop this evolution. We, energy community of PGE Group, have been seeing the need for wise changes in the energy industry for some time. As the leader in electricity and heat production in Poland, we feel obligated to initiate these changes and stimulate changes in the entire sector. We want to be the leader of Poland’s energy transformation. PGE Group’s flagship investments in Opole and Turów are of key importance to us. The construction of these modern and efficient generating units came close to the finish line in 2018. We are also implementing other projects, which are less spectacular but equally important. These include numerous modernisation works that improve production efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint. Last year was also a time of decisions concerning the entire industry. The capacity market counts among the most significant ones, creating an opportunity for a sustainable transformation of the sector, while retaining energy security. The rising volatility of our surroundings requires flexibility from us, which is why we have made the decision to build two gas units at the Dolna Odra plant, with a capacity of 700 MW each. What else has PGE done towards transformation? PGE has begun changing, and we have strong arguments for it. Thanks to an RES auction that we won, we began implementing a nearly 100 MW onshore wind farm complex. We are also launching an ambitious offshore programme in the Baltic Sea. Halfway through the next decade, we want to have built the first 1 000 MW, and increase this to 2 500 MW by 2030. This is a gigantic undertaking, which is why we are also looking for partners who will support us in implementing our offshore plan. At the same time, we are waiting for specifics regarding Poland’s future energy policy to 2040, the final shape of which will let us decide which of the Group’s development paths to take after 2020. What is PGE Group doing with regard to the challenges of climate policy, emission reductions and concern for air quality? Implementing the investments we have already planned will contribute to avoiding 60 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in years 2016-2026. These plans are not just about modern conventional energy in Opole and Turów or the already mentioned onshore and offshore wind projects. These are also investments in efficient and low-emission production of heat in cogeneration – in line with the District Heating Strategy, we are planning to increase the share of low-emission fuels in the energy mix of PGE Energia Ciepła, our company responsible for district heating, to 50% by 2030. The battle for clean air is a very up-to-date and important topic, but its success depends on actions on many fronts. First of all, we are reducing emissions at our industrial power and combined heat-and-power plants through investments and modernisations that bring us closer to more eco-friendly energy operations. In fact, we are already seeing success in this area. Over the past three decades, PGE’s power plants reduced the emissions of sulphur by 93%, nitrogen by 61% and particulate by 99%. Given the climate changes taking place and CO2 emissions, diversification of generation sources towards zeroand low-emission ones and thus also reducing exposure to increases in the prices of emission allowances is a natural challenge. This is a factor that influences our investment decisions. We are actively fighting low emission, what is a strong incentive for development of modern cogeneration based district heating. Many of our branches recorded the highest ever numbers of connections and customers in the city district heating network in 2018. The rising demand for district heating is motivating us for further investments. Building a new CHP, Czechnica, in the town of Siechnice is one of the key projects. The Group’s largest investments are nearly finished. How are these capital-intensive projects affecting the Group’s financial situation? As our flagship projects move towards the end of the investment cycle, this will translate into lower investment expenditures for PGE Group. On the other hand, new capacities are providing us with larger revenue from the sale of electricity from highlyefficient sources. I consider the Group’s results for 2018 as good in the current market context. I am looking into the future with optimism and I am confident of the positive results of the activities undertaken by the entire Group. 3 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 KEY FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE PGE CAPITAL GROUP Year ended Year ended Key financial data Unit % change December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 PLN Sales revenues 25 946 23 100 12% million PLN EBIT 2 471 3 552 -30% million PLN EBITDA 6 364 7 650 -17% million EBITDA margin % 25% 33% PLN Recurring EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for one-offs) 6 701 6 479 3% million Recurring EBITDA margin % 26% 28% PLN Net profit 1 511 2 605 -42% million PLN LTC compensations -120 1 284 million PLN LTC revenues -120 1 215 million Reversal of LTC write-offs (other operating PLN 0 69 revenues) million PLN Capital expenditures 6 856 6 751 2% million PLN Net cash from operating activities 5 102 7 934 -36% million PLN Net cash from investing activities -6 465 -7 775 -17% million PLN Net cash from financial activities 91 -274 million PLN Working capital -3 509 524 million Net debt EBITDA x 1.51 0.99 One-offs affecting EBITDA PLN LTC compensations -120 1 284 million PLN Change in reclamation provision -146 -42 248% million PLN Change in actuarial provision -71 -71 0% million PLN Total -337 1 171 million 4 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 2018 CALENDAR PGE Ventures invests in first JANUARY start-ups Result of tender offer for MARCH shares of KOGENERACJA S.A.

Realisation of strategic goals LEADER IN ELECTRICITY GENERATION, ACTIVELY SEEKING DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES PGE Group’s aspiration is maintaining after 2020 the leading position in the area of electricity generation with more than 40% share in the domestic market. PGE Group is continuing its flagship investments in Opole and Turów and has a flexible approach to plans for developing new generating capacities, opting to take the most economically and technically beneficial decisions on a case by case basis, taking into account the specific location and technological conditions of each asset. The company carries out modernisations of conventional plants and combined heat-and-power plants in an optimal scope so that they are adapted to new industrial emission standards BAT. The implementation of a capacity market, being a mechanism enhancing the national energy security, will have a positive impact on the economic effectiveness of modernisation projects. The purchase of EDF Polska's assets was finalised on November 13, 2017. With this agreement, PGE Group's installed electricity capacities increased by 25% to 16.23 GWe at the end of 2018. PGE Group strengthened its top position in the power segment and became the largest supplier of heat in the country, with a 18% share of the Polish district heating market. PGE Group's District Heating Strategy was unveiled on December 14, 2017, which highlights our ambitions in this area, inter alia:  increase of local market share to two-thirds for district heating networks managed by PGE Energia Ciepła,  construction of 1 000 MWe of new cogeneration capacities,  increase of low-emission fuel's share in fuel mix to 50%. PGE Group intends to strengthen its position in the renewables segment, with a target of approx. 25% of national renewables output by 2030. Having succeeded in RES auctions in November 2018, project Klaster, which involves the development of three wind farms with capacity totalling 97.17 MW, together with ancillary infrastructure and grid connections, will be implemented by mid-2020. On December 5, 2018, PGE Group invited over a dozen potential business partners for talks regarding the construction and operation of wind farms in the Baltic Sea with capacity totalling up to 2 545 MW as the first stage of PGE Group’s offshore programme. A decision on the investment’s environmental conditions is expected to be received in 2019. According to the schedule, electricity should start flowing from PGE Group’s first offshore wind farm around 2025, while commercial operation is expected to begin in 2026. Increased involvement in the photovoltaics and dispersed sources segment will contribute towards achieving an ambitious renewables target. PGE Group is implementing a number of pilot projects in micro-grids and energy clusters, which are to help in creating optimal business model. To retain its leading position in the generation segment over the long term, PGE Group has three strategic options, thanks to which it can make an optimal choice in the context of future energy and climate policies:  construction of offshore wind farms with capacity totalling up to 2 545 MW,  construction of Poland’s first nuclear power plant, once a model ensuring the investment’s economic feasibility is developed and taking into account Group’s investment capabilities,  modern coal-based energy, including the development of new lignite deposits, in the event that climate policy is substantially relaxed. 12 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 Key How we intend to achieve the target by Implementation 2017-2018 Progress and target indicators 2020 and in later years LEADER IN GENERATION, ACTIVELY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES  Optimal adaptation of power plants and  Continuation of CHP plants to new industrial emission construction of 2 units at standards BAT.

PGE Group intends to build up its brand of a leader on the energy efficiency market. New ESCO (Energy Saving Company) activities will provide clients with benefits such as reduced energy consumption costs, supply continuity and improved image. This will enable PGE Group to develop long-term beneficial relations with customers. A wide scope of initiatives to improve the effectiveness of energy infrastructure and buildings belonging to the Group will also be implemented. PGE Group’s activities in the area of equity investments in innovative start-ups are carried out through PGE Ventures sp. z o.o. – a specialised CVC fund, which intends to invest up to PLN 100 million in the most innovative projects by 2025. Moreover, using funding available from programmes operated by the Polish Development Fund (PFR) and the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBiR), PGE Ventures sp. z o.o. is co-creating external venture-type investment funds with total capitalisation amounting to PLN 140 million. PGE Group’s activities related to start-up incubation and acceleration at the earliest growth stage are conducted by PGE Nowa Energia sp. z o.o., which intends to spend up to PLN 1.5 million annually on acceleration activities. Some of these projects are being implemented in cooperation with business lines, which co-finance certain stages of projects. STRATEGIC OPTIONS OF PGE GROUP AFTER 2020 Retaining the top position on the electricity generation market in the long term necessitates market and regulatory analyses, continuous development and innovativeness. PGE Group has a programme of technologically diverse investment projects that address the three strategic options embedded in PGE Group’s strategy for 2016-2020. Selection of the Group’s development path will largely depend on the national and foreign surroundings. The final shape of Poland’s Energy Policy 2040, the EU’s climate and energy policy, the power system’s needs as well as market model and the cost to finance specific undertakings – all of this will have impact on the investment decisions concerning specific projects. Main strategic options after 2020 are:  Construction of off-shore wind farms,  Construction of first Polish nuclear power plant,  Development of modern coal-fired generation connected with new lignite deposits, mainly Złoczew deposit. 16 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 ACTIVITIES RELATED TO OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY Offshore programme – background and work status PGE Group’s Offshore Programme was launched in 2009. In 2012, SPVs Baltica 1, 2 and 3 received permits to build and use artificial islands for installing offshore wind farms with total maximum capacity of 3.5 GW. Works that are currently underway are focusing on the Baltica 2 and 3 sites – jointly called the “Baltica” project. The Baltica 1 area is being considered for a prospective location for another stage of the Programme. In 2014, Baltica 3 signed a connection agreement with PSE S.A. for 1 045 MW. In January 2019, Baltica 2 received technical conditions for connecting 1 498 MW. Activities in Project Baltica’s technical area are mainly focusing on:  conducting works intended to secure a decision on environmental conditions – an application for issue of such a decision was submitted to the Regional Directorate for Environmental Protection in Gdańsk in December 2017,  conducting wind speed measurements using floating lidar and obtaining wind speed measurements from other reference sources,  designing an optimal distribution of turbines and preparing preliminary productivity analyses,  developing a concept for capacity offtake and securing land for connection paths and the end station,  preparing preliminary geotechnical surveys intended to examine the geological and geotechnical conditions at Project Baltica’s sites in order to select optimal types of foundation. Characteristics of offshore projects and development supporting solutions are presented on different forums, including works of parliamentary groups. Business partnership In order to minimise project risk and maximise the learning curve, PGE intends to implement the Programme’s first stage, i.e. Project Baltica with capacity of up to 2.5 GW, with an experienced industry partner. In December 2018, PGE’s Management Board agreed to begin a process intended to bring in an industry partner for this Project and send out transaction documents as an invitation to participate in this process. In January 2019, 13 entities with extensive experience in building and operating offshore wind farms expressed interest in purchasing a 50% stake in Baltica 2 and 3. The process to select a partner is expected to be completed by the end of 2019. Offshore wind energy and Poland’s energy policy Offshore wind farms feature prominently in Poland’s draft energy policy sent out for consultations on November 23, 2018 and the draft National plan for energy and climate for 2021-2030, published on January 19, 2019. According to the draft energy policy, offshore wind capacities are to reach 4.6 GW by 2030, 6.1 GW by 2035 and 10.3 GW by 2040. The development of offshore energy will contribute to implementing objectives that are significant from the viewpoint of Poland energy policy: it is cost-effective, contributes to meeting the EU’s renewables targets, lowers exposure to CO 2 emission costs and additionally has a positive impact on economic growth. Regulatory environment The Act of February 20, 2015 on renewable energy sources makes it possible to seek government support for offshore wind farms that have a connection agreement and a decision on environmental conditions as part of an auction system. Offshore wind farms compete in one “basket” with other technologies that have similar energy generation costs: hydro, biogas and geothermal plants. However, due to a potential lack of a sufficient number of projects to ensure competitiveness in this technological “basket,” the drafts of Poland’s energy policy and national plan for energy and climate include the option to introduce a support mechanism dedicated for offshore wind farms. Social acceptance Given that PGE Group’s offshore wind farms’ location is beyond territorial waters, i.e. more than 12 nautical miles from the coast (over 22 km), no significant risk of a lack of social acceptance for the Offshore Programme is identified. It should be emphasised that the experience of western European countries shows that if other users of maritime areas are respected, especially the fishing community, then the development of offshore energy is accompanied by a positive social attitude, mainly thanks to development of the local value chain and new job creation. These experiences should also prove true in Poland’s case, given the existing industrial and ship-building infrastructure in our country, which provides components to build offshore wind farms. 17 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 ACTIVITIES RELATED TO NUCLEAR ENERGY Business partnership PGE EJ1 sp. z o.o. (“PGE EJ1”) is PGE Group’s entity directly responsible for preparing the investment process, conducting environmental and location surveys, obtaining all of the necessary decisions for the construction of the first Polish nuclear power plant, and implementing the investment. In the future, PGE EJ1 will serve as the nuclear plant’s operator. PGE EJ1 was established in 2010. In 2014, a shareholder agreement was signed, pursuant to which Enea S.A., KGHM Polska Miedź S.A. and TAURON Polska Energia S.A. (the “Shareholders”) each purchased from PGE a 10% stake in PGE EJ1 (30% in total). The shareholder agreement requires the parties to jointly finance, proportionately to the stakes held, activities related to implementing the investment. In the fourth quarter of 2018, PGE’s Management Board expressed preliminary interest in purchasing all of PGE EJ1’s shares from the remaining Shareholders. PGE aims to carry out operational and cost restructuring at PGE EJ1 and integrate it within PGE Group, which would ensure that the Group’s intellectual and organisational potential in the area of nuclear power is utilised in an optimal manner. All of the Shareholders have confirmed their preliminary interest in selling their stakes in PGE EJ1. The execution of transaction will be possible after the preparation of valuation of PGE EJ1 by the independent adviser and after obtaining corporate approvals from all concerned parties. Site characterisation and environmental surveys PGE EJ1 is currently conducting location and environmental surveys at two potential sites in the Pomeranian Voivodeship – “Lubiatowo-Kopalino” in the Choczewo municipality and “Żarnowiec” in the Gniewino and Krokowa municipalities. The surveys focus on activities necessary to prepare a report on the undertaking’s environmental impact and a site report. Selecting an appropriate location is one of the key aspects in ensuring nuclear safety and the efficient and reliable operation of a nuclear power plant. The results of these works are necessary in order to develop solutions that ensure the power plant’s safe operation and minimise its impact on the natural environment and the everyday life of local residents. Social acceptance At the same time, with a view toward ensuring social acceptance for the project to build the first Polish nuclear power plant, PGE Group is conducting activities aiming to maintain a high level of community support at the planned nuclear plant sites and to deliver knowledge about nuclear power. In 2018, works were continued within the Site Municipality Development Support Programme intended to reinforce partner relations with the local communities and authorities of the municipalities by providing support to initiatives that are of significance to the residents and development of the region. Prospects for the project implementation and financing capabilities Decisions with regard to the continuation of the Programme will be made based on decisions by the Minister of Energy concerning a role of nuclear energy in Polish fuel mix, mode for the procurement of nuclear power plant technology, investment financing model and an updated Programme for Poland’s Nuclear Power. Compensations from WorleyParsons WorleyParsons initiated a lawsuit for payment of PLN 59 million for due remuneration, according to the claimant, and return of an amount unduly collected, according to the claimant, by PGE EJ1 from a bank guarantee, and subsequently expanded its claim to PLN 104 million (i.e. by PLN 45 million). On March 31, 2018, the company filed a response to WorleyParsons’ expanded claim. PGE Group does not accept the claim and regards its possible admission by the court as unlikely. 18 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 ACTIVITIES RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT OF ZŁOCZEW DEPOSIT Development of the Złoczew deposit can only be implemented once the conditions specified in the Programme for the lignite mining sector in Poland, adopted by the Council of Ministers in 2018, are met. These conditions especially include:  a directional decision being made regarding the role of lignite in the national energy mix in the long term,  development and implementation of solutions ensuring the economic feasibility of new deposit projects (these solutions must be approved by the EU),  securing funding for this undertaking. Implementation of the strategic options will thus largely depend on the national and international regulatory environment. The final shape of Poland’s energy policy, the EU’s climate and energy policy, permissible emission from installations fuelled by fossil fuels, the needs of the power system or the market model and the cost to finance specific undertakings – all of this will have an impact on the investment decision regarding implementation of specific investments. Development of Złoczew deposit – background and status Work on the project “Obtaining a concession for mining coal from the Złoczew deposit” began in 2008. In 2008-2018, a range of studies and documentation were prepared, providing information on the deposit, including its structure, quality parameters, hydrogeology, technological conditions related to coal mining. Works aimed at obtaining a concession were conducted in parallel. These include:  activities intended to obtain a decision on environmental conditions for the “Złoczew deposit development” undertaking,  works related to adapting spatial development conditions and directions for all four municipalities within which the Złoczew deposit is located,  application to the Minister of the Environment for granting of a concession. Due to appeals being lodged against the environmental decision and spatial development studies, the concession award date is unknown at this point. Securing the concession without including the investment in these studies and without a legally binding environmental decision is not possible. Current development concept for Złoczew deposit Works intended to determine the preferred approach to coal development at the Złoczew deposit were also conducted in recent years. The base scenario for Złoczew deposit development currently is to build the Złoczew mine and maximally use the existing infrastructure at the Bełchatów power plant. This concept would necessitate the transport of coal from the Złoczew open-pit mine to the Bełchatów plant. At the current stage of conceptual work, two variants are being contemplated – conveyor belts and rail transport. 19 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 2.3.

Financial results achieved by the PGE Group and available credit limits secure sufficient resources to achieve its midterm investment goals, including capital investments. Scale of development of the Group’s efficiency, particularly lowering the operating expenses, will be significant for the ability to finance the investment program in the long term. For selected undertakings, PGE Group will also consider financing in project finance formula. 22 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 3. Risks in the Group’s operations 3.1. Risk management PGE S.A., as the Corporate Centre managing the Group, creates and implements integrated risk management architecture at PGE Group. In particular, it shapes PGE Group’s risk management policies, standards and practices, designs and develops internal IT tools to support these processes, specifies global risk appetite and adequate limits as well as monitors these. PGE Capital Group companies, as well as other entities from the electrical and power sector, are exposed to a number of risks and threats resulting from the specific operating activities and operating in specific market and regulatory environment. In PGE Group risk management process is pursued based on the GRC (Governance Risk Compliance) model. It allows adaptation and integration of each of the operational areas at all levels of management. Having established a top-level Risk Committee, which reports directly to the Management Board, supervision over the effectiveness of risk management in the Group is ensured. Function definition within corporate risk management allows an independent assessment of particular risks, their impact on PGE Group and limiting and controlling major risks using the capital exposed to risk concept via dedicated instruments. Formation of a separate compliance function within the Group guarantees that PGE Group’s activities are in line with legal conditions and ensures observance of the adopted internal standards. The PGE Capital Group has consequently developed a comprehensive risk management system. We measure and assess risks in the key companies of the Group. Mechanism allowing identification of areas exposed to risk and risk level measurement methods are constantly verified and developed. Thanks to that, the significant risks concerning various areas of operations are identified and kept within the assumed limits by reducing negative effects of such risks and by taking preventive or corrective measures, in accordance with the presented cycle. 23 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 3.2.

Strategic risk PGE Group does not focus exclusively on risks concerning on-going activities. Risks that may have an impact on the Group's functioning in a longer timeframe are also subject to identification, assessment and analysis. Assessment of impact on the Group's objectives, image and business continuity is performed at the top management level. This allows us to prepare for arising challenges and ensure the Group's development in the long term. Unlike threats to PGE's day-to-day business and results, strategic risks might have an impact on strategy implementation and the future of the entire organisation. Their identification is the key to ensuring PGE Group's sustainability. Presented below are the key identified strategic risks along with their assessment. Impact      very low low medium High very high  Cybersecurity Risk associated with intentional disruption of generation and distribution assets and IT systems used at PGE Group.  Forces of nature Risk associated with more frequent extreme weather events having impact on ability to generate and distribute electricity, as well as prices of generation and distribution costs of electricity and heat.  Legal Risk associated with the changes of national legislation governing PGE Group’s activities and an increase in the volume and scope of EU regulations having impact on the Group  Environmental restrictions Risk connected with stricter environmental restrictions applicable to PGE Group's electricity and heat production and mining activities  Energy policy Risk associated with changes in the concept for the energy sector in Poland and PGE Group’s role in it  Human resources Risk associated with restricted availability of employees who are of key importance to PGE Group's processes  Employee and client safety Risk associated with unexpected events that generate naturally irreversible material losses and heavy injuries or deaths  Competition Risk associated with the development by competition of a product offering that would decrease PGE Group's share of the energy market  Technological revolution Risk of technological change causing a limited competitiveness of electricity and heat production in baseload assets owned by the Group and their distribution using grid assets owned by PGE Group  Macroeconomics and geopolitics Risk associated with changes in economic and geopolitical situation, causing swings in macroeconomic indicators and commodity prices that have impact on PGE Group’s activities In analysing these risks as threats for PGE, the Company tries at the same time to identify any opportunities that such changes might bring about. Countering risks becomes an opportunity for the Group’s development if we manage to adapt to a changing world in advance. 28 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 4. Electricity market in 2018 and regulatory and business environment 4.1. Macroeconomic environment PGE Group’s main operating area is Poland, and the domestic macroeconomic backdrop has a substantial impact on Group’s results. At the same time, the condition of Poland’s economy remains largely tied to the situation across the European Union and in global markets. The Group’s financial results are affected by both the situation in specific segments of the economy and the financial markets, which affect the terms of PGE Group’s debt financing. As a rule of thumb, there is a historical correlation between rising electricity demand and economic growth in Poland. Considering PGE Group’s position on the Polish power generation market, as well as its substantial share in the electricity sales and distribution market, changes in power and heat demand may have a significant impact on the Group’s results. In 2018, gross electricity consumption went up 1.7 y/y. The increase was higher than in the previous year, when consumption went up 2.1% compared to 2016. Economic trends in 2018 remained positive in general. According to estimates by Central Statistical Office of Poland, real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 4.6% y/y.

The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for industry reached 52.1 points on average in 2018 (53.6 points on average in 2017), what is a result above 50 points, above which the respondents expect the sector’s situation to improve. However in December 2018 PMI declined from the November reading of 49.5 points to 47.6 points, signalling deterioration in the Polish industrial sector. Production volumes and new orders also declined. The number of new export orders and production backlog declined for the fifth month in a row, while employment did not meaningfully change since November. The Eurozone PMI in 2017 averaged 57.4 points, compared to 55.0 points in 2018 (PMI Manufacturing for the Eurozone in December 2018 recorded 51.4 points).

In 2018 it went up by 5.8% y/y, compared to 6.6% in 2017. The change resulted from increase in industrial production by 5.7% y/y in 2018 versus 7.3% in 2017. Production in the whole energy sector increased by 9.0% y/y in 2018 vs 5.5% in 2017. The value of industrial manufacturing depends on volumes of goods produced and prices. PPI in 2018 amounted to 2.1%. CPI reading in 2018 amounted to 1.1% y/y. 4.2.

The increase in price was due to the situation on related markets: CO2 emission allowance prices in the fourth quarter of 2018 were by 166% higher than in the same period of base year. Moreover, an increase in coal prices was observed – the average level of the PSCMI1 in the fourth quarter of 2018 reached PLN 11.22/GJ, i.e. 18% higher than in the comparative period (PLN 9.54/GJ) of the previous year. The growth in electricity prices also had to do with weather conditions and a 20% y/y decline in energy supply from wind assets in the National Power System. In full year 2018, the average price on the day-ahead market was PLN 223/MWh, which is 41% higher than the price recorded in the preceding year (PLN 158/MWh). The increase in price on the day-ahead market was due to cost pressure and the situation on related markets. CO2 emission allowance prices in 2018 were 177% y/y. The PSCMI1 index in 2018 averaged PLN 10.98/GJ up by 19% y/y i.e. from PLN 9.26/GJ. Wind-based generation declined 16% y/y cumulatively.

Revenues from electricity sales are recognized along with the delivery of electricity (not contracting) – growth of forward prices will be visible in the Group’s revenues in 2019. Growth of prices results from pressure on variable costs side. The increased volume on forward market is connected with the amendment of the Energy law, which obliges the energy companies to sell all produced electricity on the commodity exchange or on regulated markets.

Source: TGE, EEX, EPEX, Nordpool, OTE a.s., PXE. In the fourth quarter of 2018, growth in wholesale electricity prices in neighbouring countries was in the range of PLN 8592/MWh (i.e. 61-64% q/q). From this perspective the price growth in Poland by PLN 80/MWh (i.e. by 49%) is in line with the regional trend. The common electricity price growth driver in the region was the situation on related commodity markets: growth in prices on the coal market and the CO2 emission allowance market. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the average electricity price in Poland was higher than in Sweden (by PLN 21/MWh), Germany (by PLN 16/MWh) and the Czech Republic (by PLN 7/MWh). At the same time, the price differential between Poland and its neighbours decreased on a y/y and q/q basis. On a y/y basis, the average energy price in neighbouring countries increased by PLN 41-64/MWh (i.e. by 26-44%). From this perspective, the PLN 65/MWh (i.e. 42%) y/y growth in price in Poland is in line with the regional trend. In 2018, the average energy price in Poland was PLN 25-32/MWh higher than in Sweden, Czech Republic and Germany. The price differential between Poland and its neighbours was greater than in the previous year resulting in growth in net imports. 32 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 International trading Chart: Monthly imports, exports and cross-border exchange balance in 2017-2018 (in GWh). 1000 800 600 400 200 GWh 0 -200 -400 -600 -800 Import Export Balance -1000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 2017 2018 Source: own work based on PSE S.A. data. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Poland remained a net importer of electricity: trading balance reached 1.0 TWh (import 2.0 TWh, export 1.0 TWh). It is a result similar to the analogical period of 2017, when a trading balance reached 1.1 TWh (including import 1.8 TWh and export 0.7 TWh). In full year 2018 trading balance amounted to 5.7 TWh (import 8.2 TWh, export 2.5 TWh). In previous year Poland also was a net importer of electricity with trading balance of 3.4 TWh (import 6.6 TWh, export 3.2 TWh). In the whole year 2018 net import increased by approximately 2.3 TWh compared to the base period. Diagram: Geographical structure of commercial exchange in 2018 (GWh).

The fiscal system, regulation mechanisms and support schemes in particular countries all have significant impact on 2 the final price of electricity. In Poland in the first half of 2018 an additional burden for individual customers accounted for approx. 34% of the electricity price and in comparison to EU average of 31%. In Denmark and Germany the proportion of additional charges in the price of electricity exceeded 50%. 3 Chart: Comparison of average prices for individual customers in selected EU countries in the first half of 2018 (prices in PLN/MWh, average exchange rate EUR/PLN 4.22).

Prices of certificates In the fourth quarter of 2018, the average price of green certificates (index OZEX_A) reached PLN 149/MWh and was 243% y/y. The price growth resulted from demand factors (a regulation of the Minister of Energy that introduced an obligation to redeem green certificates from 15.4% in 2017 to 17.5% in 2018 and to 18.5% in 2019) and supply factors (wind-based generation down by 20% y/y in the fourth quarter of 2018 and limited co-firing). Additionally, the decrease in certificates supply was driven by the closure of a certification system for new units and the upcoming end of a 15-year support period for new installations that had entered the system in 2005. The average prices of green certificates in all four quarters of 2018 were above the substitute fee due to a limited capability of paying the substitute fee. The average price of yellow certificates in the fourth quarter of 2018 reached PLN 111/MWh and was 5% lower than in the same period last year. The decline in prices results from a 34% y/y increase in the supply of energy produced in gas-fired cogeneration sources in full year 2018. The fourth quarter of 2018 was marked by comparable production on a year-on-year basis, which reduced the down trend from the previous quarter. The obligation to redeem yellow certificates increased to 8% in 2018, compared to 7% in 2017. Chart: Average quarterly prices of certificates.

The yellow certificates prices presented on the chart are weighted average blended price – for products PMGM-16, PMGM-17, PMGM-18. 4.4. Prices of CO2 emission rights EUA (European Union Allowances) prices are one of the key factors determining wholesale energy prices and PGE Group’s financial results. Installations emitting CO2 in the process of electricity or heat production bear the expenses for purchasing EUA allowances to cover the deficit (i.e. the difference between CO 2 emissions at PGE Group’s generating units and the free-of-charge allowances received under derogation in accordance with the National Investment Plan). Wherein, last allocations granted free of charge are planned for realisations of investment tasks for 2019, what means that the free allocations in accordance with the currently used method will end in 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the weighted average price of EUA DEC 18 reached EUR 19.66/t and was 166% q/q higher than the average price for EUA DEC 17 (EUR 7.38/t). In full year 2018, the weighted average price for EUA DEC 18 reached EUR 16.51/t, up by 177% y/y from the average price for EUA DEC 17 (EUR 5.96/t). The increase in CO2 emission prices observed in 2018 is a result of market perception of the EU ETS reform – this issue is illustrated on the chart below. 35 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 Chart: Prices of CO2 emission rights. 30 100 Volume EUA_DEC (right axis) 90 25 EUA_DEC (left axis) 80 (volume thousand tonnes) EUA_DEC annual average 19.66 70 20 EUA_DEC Q4 average 16.51 60 EUR 15 50 40 10 7.72 30 5.96 20 5 10 0 0 2017-01 2017-02 2017-03 2017-04 2017-05 2017-06 2017-07 2017-08 2017-09 2017-10 2017-11 2017-12 2018-01 2018-02 2018-03 2018-04 2018-05 2018-06 2018-07 2018-08 2018-09 2018-10 2018-11 2018-12 Source own work based on ICE quotations. EMISSION RIGHTS GRANTED FREE OF CHARGE FOR YEARS 2013-2020 The Regulation of the Council of Ministers, that sets the allocation of allowances for particular units of electricity producers in period 2013-2020, was adopted on April 8, 2014. Analogically, allocations of allowances for heat producers were set by the Regulation of the Council of Ministers of March 31, 2014. PGE’s installations accounts were credited with free allowances for heat for 2018 and energy for 2017, while free allowances for electricity for 2018 will be received by the Group by the end of April 2019, after verification of reports from investments submitted to the National Investment Plan. At the same time, redemption of emission rights resulting from CO2 emissions in 2017 was completed in April 2018.

Competitive environment The electricity sector in Poland comprises four operating segments:  generation of electricity,  transmission, responsibility of the transmission system operator – PSE S.A.,  distribution,  retail sales. District heating sector may be also distinguished, within which PGE is active in heat generation, distribution and sales. The key participants of the electricity market in Poland are four nationwide, vertically integrated energy groups: PGE Group, capital group of TAURON Polska Energia S.A., capital group of Enea S.A. and capital group of Energa S.A. After the acquisition of EDF Polska assets, PGE Group strengthened its position in the generation segment and is the undisputed leader, with a 43% market share. The Group produces more electricity than all of the competitors on the consolidated market combined, whilst having the largest achievable capacities, both conventional and renewable. Aside from integrated energy groups, significant producers on the market include Zespół Elektrowni Pątnów Adamów Konin S.A. ( ZE PAK ), PKN Orlen S.A. ( Orlen ) and PGNiG TERMIKA S.A. ( PGNiG ). Although ZE PAK's production is based on industrial plants, Orlen's and PGNiG's production is based on CHPs, the output of which depends on demand for district heating. ZE PAK's market share declined due to the shut-down of the Adamów plant from 2018, while Orlen's share significantly grew with the launch of gas-and-steam units in Włocławek and Płock. Nearly half of the electricity produced in the country is hard coal-based and this is a key fuel for PGE Group's competitors. One-third of the electricity produced in Poland is lignite-based. Aside from PGE Group, ZE PAK also bases its electricity production on lignite. The use of other fuels is of relatively low significance from the viewpoint of the national power system, although it should be noted that an increase in gas-based production is related to Orlen's new assets.

(”ARE”). The heat production market in Poland is highly dispersed, with the four leading producers accounting for less than 40% of production countrywide, and thanks to the acquisition of EDF's cogeneration assets, PGE Group became the undisputed leader of this market, too with a share reaching almost 18% in the first half of 2018. This market is of a local nature and bears the traits of a natural monopoly, with heating prices being set in an administrative procedure – tariffs approved by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office. The dominant producers focus their production activities in different urban areas therefore sector competition is limited. With this transaction, PGE gained access to district heating markets in the Wrocław agglomeration, Tri-City area, Kraków, Toruń and Zielona Góra. Besides PGE Group, the key producers of heat are PGNiG (focused on production mainly in the Warsaw agglomeration) and Veolia Group (Poznań agglomeration, Łódź). Energy production from renewable sources is much more dispersed than the conventional generation market. Energy from biomass is produced at both dedicated installations and in a co-firing process with other energy sources across the country. In 37 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 previous years wind power sector was the most dynamically developing sector, with PGE Group’s leading role. Having delivered four new wind projects in 2015, PGE Group became an entity with the largest installed wind capacity – 550 MW (through PGE EO S.A.). PGE Group has approximately 9% share of total wind capacity in Poland, which reached close to 5.9 GW in 2018. Other notable wind farm operators include: EDP Renováveis Polska sp. z o.o., innogy Renewables Polska sp. z o.o., Vortex Energy Polska sp. z o.o., Polenergia S.A., TAURON Ekoenergia sp. z o.o., ENERGA Wytwarzanie S.A. and E.ON Energie Odnawialne sp. z o.o., ENGIE Zielona Góra sp. z o.o. Competition among the existing wind assets covers competition on the electricity market (given that as of January 1, 2018 the obligation to purchase electricity from renewable energy sources of 500 kW or more was cancelled) and competition related to to participation in green certificates scheme. They are subject of free market trade, however, due to significant oversupply this are administrative decisions with regard to the level of obligation to redeem that essentially influence the prices. The competition within new support scheme for RES takes place in auctions via lower offered amount of support. In the distribution area, the country is divided into regions, with five large distribution system operators (the “DSO”) on the market, who are required to carve out distribution activities from their other business. Aside from the above-mentioned energy groups, another significant entity is innogy Stoen Operator sp. z o.o. (formerly RWE Stoen Operator sp. z o.o.), an RWE Group company responsible for electricity distribution in Warsaw, as well as PKP Energetyka S.A. managing the railway electric network throughout the country. A historical division of the distribution areas has substantial impact on the operating conditions of the business, and this specific situation is reflected in the distribution tariffs approved by the URE president. PGE Group operates in 2 an area that is less urbanised and industrialised, meaning that it has 5.4 million clients throughout an area of 122 ths km . For comparison, TAURON has a similar number of clients in an area nearly twice smaller and distributes a larger amount of energy. Chart: Areas of operation of Polish distribution system operators.

In the retail segment, which covers sales to end customers – individual, small and medium enterprises as well as large industrial customers – most of the sales are conducted by the four largest energy groups and innogy Polska S.A. (formerly RWE Polska S.A.). PGE Group and TAURON remain the leaders, having approximately 60% of the market. Both PGE and TAURON sell electricity to over five million clients. Despite a growing number of competitors in the segment, including companies for which electricity is not a core product, companies from outside the four largest Polish groups continue to control little market share. The leaders control close to 90% of the market, while other significant player is innogy, based on sales connected with serving as distributor for the Warsaw area, as well as PKP Energetyka. ENERGY GROUP PROFILES The electricity sector is divided into segments, what is reflected in the operating segments of the respective energy groups. In contrast to the other energy groups in Poland, whose dominant EBITDA driver is the electricity distribution segment, PGE Group derives much of its operating profit from the generation segment, even though the group is the country’s second-largest electricity distributor by volume. This allows to optimally deploy its competences and capitalise on opportunities arising in the generation area (both conventional and renewable) as well as in wholesale energy trade, whilst generating high and stable EBITDA on regulated activities. With acquisitions of the Bogdanka mine and Połaniec power plant and the launch of a new unit at the Kozienice power plant, Enea increased its share of EBITDA from the generation segment. This brought Enea’s profile closer to that of PGE Group. A key feature of all the groups is a relatively small contribution of retail sales to operating profit, which is a result of low sales margins, driven by strong competition in the segment.

Supply markets Lignite, hard coal, natural gas and biomass are key fuels used to generate electricity and heat by power plants and heat and power plants belonging to the PGE Group. The cost of fuel procurement constitutes a major share in electricity generation costs. PGE S.A., on the ground of Agreement for Commercial Management of Generation Capacities, secures hard coal, gas and biomass supplies to the companies. Lignite supplies are carried out within a framework of regular cooperation between branches operating in the structure of PGE GiEK. The KWB Bełchatów mine supplies lignite to the Bełchatów power plant and the KWB Turów mine supplies it to the Turów power plant. The Group set up internal rules with respect to the performance and settlement of lignite supplies between individual branches of PGE GiEK. The main supplier of the hard coal for the electricity and heat production needs in branches of PGE GiEK and PGE EC S.A. and its subsidiaries is Polska Grupa Górnicza S.A. Biomass is obtained via procurement procedures mainly from suppliers operating on the Polish biomass market. Main supplier of gas for production needs of electricity and heat in the branches of PGE EC and its subsidiaries is PGNiG S.A. As regards fuel supplies at PGE Group in 2018, no threats were identified such as could have disrupted continuity of the production process. 49 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 5. Activities of PGE Capital Group in 2018 5.1. Business model PGE Capital Group is Poland's largest vertically integrated producer and supplier of electricity and largest producer of district heating. Operations cover the entire value chain: from lignite extraction through production of electricity at power plants and CHP plants as well as renewables to electricity distributions and sales. * Estimated data concerning sales to final off-takers and distribution. PGE Group generates 43% of the electricity (including Conventional Generation approx. 42%) produced in Poland and 25% of heat from cogeneration. Additionally, 9% of domestic renewable energy comes from our assets. PGE Group's distribution lines cover approx. 40% of Poland's territory and supply electricity to 5.4 million final customers, i.e. 25% of the country's users. We have 5.3 million clients on the retail market, accounting for approx. 30% of the final off-takers in Poland. In 2018, PGE Group generated EBITDA of approx. PLN 6.4 billion. The Conventional Generation segment, which includes the conventional generation of electricity and heat, made the largest contribution to revenue and EBITDA. Investment expenditures of approx. PLN 4.9 billion were made in the Conventional Generation segment. Half of these expenditures are incurred in connection with development investments the construction of high-efficiency conventional generation capacities – 1 800 MW units in Opole and a 490 MW unit in Turów. The other significant investments are intended to raise the efficiency of existing assets and environment-related modernisations. The Distribution segment is the second largest business line in terms of its share in PGE Group's results. The segment is responsible for providing electricity supply services. Investment expenditures in this segment reached approx. PLN 1.9 billion, mainly related to grid modernisation and replacement and new off-takers connections. The Renewables segment is responsible for the generation of electricity from renewable sources and management of pumped storage capacities. The Group is actively investing in the development of renewable energy sources. Having won a RES auction in 2018, it is developing a wind farm with capacity of nearly 100 MW. PGE Group pursues one of the Group's strategic development options after 2020, i.e. it’s implementing a project to develop offshore wind farms. The Group’s plan is to reach 1 GW in 2026 and 2.5 GW by 2030. The Supply segment focuses on wholesale and retail trade of electricity and related products. 50 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 5.2.

PGE Group's key financial results 5 The best way to measure the profitability of energy companies is EBITDA . This is a result before depreciation, amortization, income tax and interest from drawn interest bearing debt. It reflects cash flows from operating activities and makes it possible to compare the results of companies regardless of the value of their assets, level of debt and existing income tax rates. PGE Group's consolidated results are composed of the financial results of each of its operating segments. The Conventional Generation segment made the largest contribution to the Group's result, accounting for nearly half of annual EBITDA. The Distribution segment had the second-largest share, accounting for almost 40% of EBITDA. The Renewables and Supply segments contributed respectively 7% and 4% to the Group’s EBITDA.

The difference presented in point D results from the necessity to cover grid losses in the distribution business (Distribution System Operator), consumption of energy at lignite mines and consumption of energy at pumped-storage plants. The higher volume of sales to end customers resulted from recognition of sales generated by PGE Energia Ciepła S.A. The higher sales volume on the wholesale and balancing market results mainly from placing generation capacity of the newly acquired assets. Additionally, the volume growth was driven by favourable market conditions. Production of electricity Table: Production of electricity (in TWh).

Out of this value, 4.5 TWh results from inclusion of full year of Rybnik power plant’s generation, while in 2017 it included only generation from the period under consolidation, i.e. from November 14, 2017 until December 31, 2017. Higher generation at Opole power plant resulted from larger use of the power plant’s units by PSE S.A. and repair-related downtime being lower by 960 hours (unit no. 3 remained in medium overhaul from March 3, 2017 till May 4, 2017). Higher production at Opole power plant compensated for lower output at Dolna Odra power plant, due to lower use of units by PSE S.A. Hard coal-based CHP plants produced by 2.82 TWh more electricity. Out of this 2.81 TWh results from recognition of full-year production of Gdańsk CHP, Gdynia CHP, Wrocław CHP, Czechnica CHP and Kraków CHP, while in 2017 it included only generation from the period under consolidation, i.e. from November 14, 2017 until December 31, 2017. The growth in production at gas-fired combined heat-and-power plants is 1.25 TWh. Main reason is the recognition of full-year production of Toruń CHP, Zielona Góra CHP and Zawidawie CHP (up by 1.46 TWh), while in 2017 it included only generation from the period under consolidation, i.e. from November 14, 2017 until December 31, 2017. The decline in electricity production was recorded in the gas-fired CHPs previously owned by the Group. Production in lignite-based power plants and biomass CHP plants was similar y/y. The lower output at wind farms results from worse windiness than expected, mainly in February and period MayDecember 2018. Output at hydropower plants is lower y/y, resulting from less favourable hydrological conditions (mainly in May, June, August, September, October, November and December 2018) – due to hydrological drought. Slightly lower production in pumped storage power plants results from the nature of these generation units, which in 2018, were used to a lower extent by PSE S.A. Table: Production of heat (PJ).

Higher heat production volume in 2018 y/y resulted mainly from the higher generation in the Acquired assets due to the recognition of full-year production of Rybnik power plant, Gdańsk CHP, Gdynia CHP, Kraków CHP, Wrocław CHP, Czechnica CHP, Toruń CHP, Zielona Góra CHP and Zawidawie CHP, while in 2017 it included only generation from the period under consolidation, i.e. from November 14, 2017 until December 31, 2017. Sales of heat In 2018 the heat sales volume in PGE Capital Group totalled 49.66 PJ and were higher by 24.81 PJ y/y. The above growth includes recognition of full year sales of heat by the Acquired assets from Conventional Generation segment, while in 2017 it included only heat sales from the period under consolidation, i.e. from November 14, 2017 until December 31, 2017 (increase by 25.52 PJ) and lower sales by branches of PGE GiEK S.A. (-0.71 PJ), what resulted largely from decreased demand for heat caused by the higher average outside temperatures. 58 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 5.4. Operational segments CONVENTIONAL GENERATION Segment description and its business model This segment includes lignite mining, generation of electricity and heat in conventional sources as well as the transmission and distribution of district heating. *in accounting terms. The main source of revenue in the Conventional Generation segment is revenue from the sale of electricity on the wholesale market, based on electricity prices that are shaped by supply and demand mechanisms, taking into account the variable costs of generation. At the same time, the segment's key cost items, given their size and volatility, and thus their impact on operating results, are the cost of production fuels used, mainly hard coal and natural gas, as well as fees for CO2 emissions. Lignite-based production, which is of key significance for the Group, is based on own mines, therefore its cost is relatively stable and reflected mainly in fixed-cost items, i.e. personnel costs, third-party services and depreciation. The segment's second source of revenue is revenue from the sale and distribution of heat. This is regulated revenue. Energy companies independently set tariffs and present them to the President of the Energy Regulatory Office (URE President) for approval. Heat production at PGE Group takes place in cogeneration units, which offer the opportunity to set tariffs for heat using a simplified approach (compared to tariffs based on a full cost structure), based on reference prices, which are mainly based on the average sales prices for heat generated in units with specific fuel other than cogeneration units. They are published each year by the ERO President. Tariffs for heat production for cogeneration units in a given tariff year thus reflect changes in the costs of heat-generation units (not co-generation units) in the previous calendar year. The cost approach is applied in the case of tariffs for heat distribution, which allows to cover justified costs (mainly the costs of heat losses and property tax) and a return on invested capital, in line with guidelines from the ERO President. Distribution tariffs for heat are in place at branches in Gorzów and Zgierz, as well as by Kogeneracja S.A., PGE Toruń and Zielona Góra CHP. Electricity production in high-efficiency cogeneration is additionally compensated. Until 2018, CHPs generated revenue from the sale of energy origin certificates, i.e. cogeneration certificates (yellow and red). From 2019, due to a change in support model, they will receive support at a level covering increased operating costs related to production. For large units, this will be set on an individual basis. A similar support mechanism is in place for biomass-fired generating assets. This type of production is also additionally compensated by awarding origin certificates, i.e. green certificates, the sale of which generates additional revenue for units in the conventional generation segment. A significant item in the segment's revenue constitutes revenues from the provision of regulatory system services based on an agreement with the Polish transmission system operator, PSE S.A. This revenue is in parallel to revenue generated on the electricity market and is related to the need to ensure stable operations for the national power system. Regulatory system services are provided by power plants of PGE GiEK and by Rybnik power plant. 59 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 ASSETS Conventional Generation in PGE Capital Group includes PGE GiEK S.A. based in Bełchatów. As at December 31, 2018 the company comprised of 12 branches which are located in nine voivodships. Branches included 2 lignite mines, 4 conventional power plants and 8 CHP plants. From November 14, 2017 Conventional Generation segments included also part of assets acquired from EDF i.e. 5 companies, including 1 conventional power plant and 8 CHP plants. On January 2, 2019 6 CHP plants were separated from PGE GiEK and transferred to PGE EC (see p. 7.1 of this report). 6 The Group is the leader of lignite mining (its share in the extraction market of this raw material accounting for 87% of domestic 7 extraction), it is also the largest generator of electricity as it generates approx. 43% of domestic gross electricity production 8 (including approx. 42% by Conventional Generation) and largest heat producer. The generation is based on lignite extracted from mines owned by the company as well as hard coal, gas and biomass.

One-offs which reduce EBITDA reported in 2017 One-offs which increase EBITDA reported in 2018 Key factors affecting the recurring EBITDA result of Conventional Generation segment in 2017 on y/y basis included:  Increase in electricity sales prices, which caused an increase in revenue from sales. (see p. 4.2 of this report).  Higher electricity production volume in PGE GiEK S.A. by 0.66 TWh, due to higher degree of use of units by PSE S.A. resulting from increased demand in NPS and lower wind generation, with lower repairs at centrally dispatched generation units by 8 189h (see p. 5.3 of this report).  Lower result on optimisation of electricity portfolio, due to lower margin realized on electricity trading by PLN 41/MWh as a result of higher purchase price of electricity mainly caused by higher prices of CO2 emission rights (impact on result PLN -383 million) with the higher volume of electricity trading by 3 TWh (impact on result PLN +115 million).  Lower revenues from ancillary control services, mainly lower revenues from Operational Capacity Reserve (“OCR”) due to lower volume of OCR in Opole and Dolna Odra power plant due to higher trading factor of those power plants.  Higher fuel consumption costs, mainly hard coal, what was caused by the higher prices of that raw material on the domestic and international market, what directly translated into higher contractual prices, and higher production based on this fuel. Main changes on different types of fuel are presented on the chart below.  Higher CO2 costs as a result of higher price of allowances. This effect was accelerated by unfavourable impact of lower allocation of allowances granted free of charge and higher emission of CO2 resulting from increased production.  Higher repairs expenses mainly as a result of higher number of tasks pursued.  Higher capitalised costs, mainly as a result of greater involvement of own services into investment execution. The above effect was offset by lower capitalisation of overburden removal costs in mines due to lower N:W ratio (mainly due to significantly higher growth of lignite mined in relation to growth of overburden mining in Szczerców field).  Difference on EBITDA generated by the Acquired assets in 2018 as compared to the result achieved in the period subject ot consolidation in 2017, i.e. from November 14, 2017 until December 31, 2017. The reported EBITDA was also impacted by one-offs: LTC compensations, change in reclamation provision and change in actuarial provision. 63 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 Chart: Costs of production fuels consumption in Conventional Generation (in PLN million). 4 000 3 500 Acquired 3 000 assets* 1 677 Acquired PLN m assets* 2 500 242 -0.04 + 0.73 1.84 + 4.01 0.63 + 3.12 + 4.88 PLN m + 8.80 PLN/GJ GJm PLN/GJ GJ m PLN/GJ GJ m PLN/GJ GJ m 2 000 1 500 PGE GiEK S.A.

The Conventional Generation area is constantly improving its environmental performance and is more effective every year. The environmental management system Branches of PGE GiEK and PGE EC have applied Integrated Management System Model, which covers among other things an Environment Management System in accordance with PN-EN ISO 14001. This is an internationally recognised standard that sets out the methods for implementing effective environment management systems. The main objective of the ISO 14001 standard is contributing to protecting the environment and preventing pollution in a manner that takes into consideration both social and economic needs in line with the idea of sustainable development. The concept of a unified Environment Management System is intended to harmonise documentation and improve effectiveness of managing the environmental protection area. This includes, among other things, central management of environmental aspects across all of the branches of the companies. This documentation is subject to updating during cyclical reviews. Audits re-certifying the environmental management systems at PGE GiEK and PGE Energia Ciepła branches and companies took place in 2018, confirming compliance with the ISO PN-EN 14001:2015 standard. The audit results showed that both the developed regulations and the actions taken within the environmental management system are compliant with the standard's requirements and represent good practices that raise operational performance. Additionally at the company's branches: Zespół Elektrowni Dolna Odra and Opole power plant, and at PGE Energia Ciepła S.A. Branch Wybrzeże in Gdańsk, an eco-management and audit system (EMAS PI:2999) is in place, which together with an environmental declaration was subject to review in 2018 by an accredited independent reviewer in accordance with new requirements. Registration in the EMAS system means compliance with the highest standards in environmental management and audit. Air protection The production of electricity and heat from fossil fuels has an impact on the quality of air, which is why PGE Group places strong emphasis on minimising emissions and avoiding the most harmful ones. Installations of PGE GiEK and PGE EC operate in line with emission standards set out in the IED Directive or use the derogation mechanisms provided therein. Derogation is intended to give existing installations additional time to technically adapt to the more rigorous emission requirements specified in the IED or exempt them from the requirement to observe these if modernising such a facility would be unjustified due to a limited expected lifecycle. Regardless of the permissible norms, PGE Group strives to meet the highest standards and that’s why we began an adaptation programme for BAT standards, taking into account the best available technologies. Due to consistent pro-environmental investments, the Group’s generation assets systematically lower emissions of NOx, Sox and dust in the air. In 1989-2018, the Group's power plants: Bełchatów, Opole, Turów, Dolna Odra and Rybnik, reduced emissions as follows: SO2 by 93%, NOx by 61 %, particulate matter by 99%. 68 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 Diagram: Emission of NOx, SO2 and particulates into the air (in kg/MWh) in the Group’s power plants. CO2 emissions The third settlement period within the EU ETS (Emissions Trading System), covering years 2013-2020, began in 2013. During this period, rules for allocating free allowances for CO2 emissions to all EU ETS participants changed, in particular for producers of electricity and heat. As a rule, starting from 2013, each subsequent year of the third settlement period is a line decline of the number of free CO2 emission allowances allocated to installations. It is estimated that PGE GiEK S.A. installations will receive a total of 145 296 727 allowances during the 2013-2020 period, including:  7 301 373 allowances for heat production,  137 995 354 allowances for electricity production (without allowances for new capacities). It is estimated that PGE EC S.A. installations will receive a total of 42 938 820 allowances during the 2013-2020 period, including:  10 505 171 allowances for heat production,  32 433 649 allowances for electricity production (without allowances for new capacities). The volume of free allowance in PGE GiEK and PGE EC constitutes approx. 30% of companies’ installations needs. The volume of CO2 emissions for 2018 in installations of PGE GiEK (not verified yet) amounts to 58 916 246 tons. Based on the balance of allowances and actual CO2 emissions, a shortage of 46 839 067 allowances exists. This shortage is compensated through the purchase of allowances on the market. The volume of CO2 emissions for 2018 in PGE EC S.A. (not verified yet) amounts to 11 269 883 tons. tons. Based on the balance of allowances and actual CO2 emissions (not verified), a shortage of 9 276 706 allowances exists. This shortage is compensated through the purchase of allowances on the market. A breakdown of CO2 emissions in main installations of Conventional Generation is presented in p. 6.7 Selected indicators in environmental issues in PGE Capital Group of PGE Group's report on non-financial data for 2018. Management of waste and by-products Waste is mainly produced directly in combustion processes or in ancillary processes to the generation of electricity and heat. PGE Group companies are consistently improving and expanding the scale of application for their combustion waste. Very good economic results from the use of these substances are generated as regards ash and slag from hard coal combustion and gypsum from flue gas desulphurisation. The economic effects of ash from lignite combustion may still be increased. The lower share in 69 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 industrial use of limestone ash from lignite combustion has to do with its chemical and physical properties and considerable price volatility. The scale of use for such waste is also of significance. The use of such waste is determined also by the use of mainly ash from hard coal combustion, which features much better properties and outperforms combustion waste from lignite firing. Over 7 million tonnes of combustion waste was generated at PGE GiEK's installations in 2018. Approx. 560,000 tonnes of combustion waste was generated at PGE EC's installations. Waste from lignite combustion account for more than 90% of all combustion waste produced in PGE GiEK. The specific properties of ashes from lignite combustion and the high variability of their parameters limit the potential for the commercial use of these substances. This results in the necessity to deposit them at storage sites (Bełchatów power plant) or filling unused transformed land therewith. Such recovery process is being applied at Turów power plant, where waste is deposited together with overburden at the landfill of the mine KWB Turów (lignite mine). Combustion waste from burning hard coal, given their attractive properties, have a range of applications in the cement industry, construction and road building. Some of this waste is deposited at combustion waste landfills or temporarily at waste warehouses. Approx. 600,000 tonnes of hard coal-combustion waste was generated at PGE GiEK's installations and approx. 560,000 tonnes of hard coal-combustion waste was generated at PGE EC's installations. A significant portion of the ash generating in hard coal and lignite firing as well as part of the synthetic gypsum are generated as a by-product and are not classified as waste. In 2018, PGE GiEK created 1.5 million tonnes of by-product, including approx. 800,000 tonnes of by-product from hard coal firing, approx. 400,000 tonnes of by-product from lignite firing and approx. 300,000 tonnes of by-product from flue gas desulphurisation. PGE EC and Kogeneracja S.A. identified approximately 1.5 million tons of byproducts from coal combustion, specifically 1 073 000 tonnes of ash and 225 000 tonnes of slag and 189 000 tonnes of gypsum. A breakdown of the total weight of waste generated by companies of PGE Group's Conventional Generation segment (PGE GiEK and PGE EC) is presented in p. 6.7 Selected indicators in environmental issues in PGE Capital Group of PGE Group's report on nonfinancial data for 2018. Management of waste water Conditions for managing waste water are specified in relevant permits, including in particular integrated permits and water-law permits. In branches od PGE GiEK and PGE EC monitoring is conducted on an on-going basis as regards the quantity and quality of water collected and waste discharged. For technological purposes, in PGE GiEK water is collected from groundwater. At PGE EC, water for technological purposes is collected from surface waters, groundwater or water-supply networks, depending on location. In order to limit the quantity of raw water consumption, closed-circuits are used, and old technological water and waste water are used in other processes. Waste water created as a result of power plant and heat-and-power plant production activities is subject to a purification process, including multi-stage cleansing, and subsequently discharged to groundwater or transferred to municipal companies. Mining of lignite in an open-pit mine, which takes place at two PGE GiEK S.A. lignite mines – Bełchatów and Turów, requires the rockmass to be initially dewatered, which has substantial impact on hydrogeological conditions. Water management at lignite plants is related to dewatering both inside the rockmass and at the surface of the pit. Water from the pit is taken out to field reservoirs, the task of which is final purification of water through natural sedimentation of suspensions, assisted by plant filters. Once the water is purified, it is at least class II in purity terms. A breakdown of the overall volume of waste water generated by companies of PGE Group's Conventional Generation segment (PGE GiEK and PGE EC) is presented in p. 6.7 Selected indicators in environmental issues in PGE Capital Group of PGE Group's report on non-financial data for 2018. Reclamation of adversely transformed land Post-mining areas that are no longer used for deposit mining and storing overburden are subject to on-going reclamation during the entire period of mining activity in accordance with conditions specified by the proper environment protection authorities. In the light of existing legal regulations (Act on protection of farming and forest land, Geological and mining law), post-mining terrain must be rehabilitated, and the rehabilitation requirement applies to the natural or legal persons who remove such land from production and cause it to lose value. Reclamation performed at the Conventional Generation segment consists of returning useful and natural values of land (as close to natural as possible). Land reclamation is performed through technical reclamation (land shaping and construction of essential technical infrastructure) and biological reclamation (ground preparations, introduction and maintenance of plants). Rehabilitation 70 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 of sites significantly reduces fugitive emissions (for example pariculates from landfills or heaps) and improves the quality of water being discharged into surface water reservoirs. Within Conventional Generation segment large-scale reclamations are mainly being conducted within the following open-pit lignite mines: KWB Turów and KWB Bełchatów. Large-scale production entails substantial obligations towards the natural environment. Years of experience and the implementation of innovative and effective eco-friendly technological solutions allows to significantly mitigate the effects of lignite mining. Reclamations conducted thus far have given rise to vast forest and water complexes where many animal and plant species are present. Already in the near future, the main reclamation task for the KWB Bełchatów will be the reclamation of both end-excavations in the water direction and the creation of a landscape with a large leisure complex. This undertaking will reach the scale of the difficulties which have no equivalent in our country. Targeted reclamation activity of this mine will be determined by need of water filled reclamation of the excavation. Therefore, research, design and implementation works in this direction are carried out well in advance of the end of exploitation date, and in the first place relate to the nearby post-exploitation excavation of the Bełchatów Field, although water reclamation will be possible only for both end excavations at the same time. Mitigation of noise emissions PGE GiEK and PGE EC are in continuous operation. Permitted level of noise emissions to the environment is determined in law and permits issued for the companies. Noise emission measurements are performed every two years or ad hoc upon request or complaint by external entities. Noise emission measurements taken in 2018 in branches of PGE GiEK (Gorzów CHP, Rzeszów CHP, Zgierz CHP, Bydgoszcz CHPs, Turów power plant, Opole power plant, Bełchatów power plant and ZEDO) and branches and subsidiaries of PGE EC did not show breaches of permissible noise emission levels. Measurements taken in 2018 within the impact areas of lignite mines (KWB Turów, KWB Bełchatów) did not show any larger breaches. In one case at KWB Bełchatów, the terms of a decision regarding permissible noise at night were breached. In order to further reduce noise emissions on the areas of the open pit mines, the steel idlers are continuously being replaced with silent idlers. 71 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 RENEWABLES Segment description and its business model This segment is involved in the generation of electricity from renewable sources and in pumped storage plants. * in accounting terms. The Renewables segment is mainly based on revenue from the sale of electricity, however contrary to production at industrial plants within the Conventional Generation segment, this revenue is subject to a larger degree to changes in weather conditions and prices on the spot market due to the renewables sales model in place. Electricity output volume translates into property rights (green) and revenue from the sale of energy origin certificates obtained by the segment's assets, excluding hydropower plants over 5 MWe. A stable part of the segment's results is related to the provision of system services using pumped-storage plants, which is performed on the basis of an agreement with the transmission system operator, PSE S.A. On the cost side, the most important items include: depreciation of segment assets, use of energy to pump water at pumpedstorage plants and third-party services, mainly in the form of repair services. Property tax and employee wages also constitute a significant cost item in this segment. Assets The PGE Capital Group’s operations in renewable energy are managed by the PGE Energia Odnawialna S.A. Assets in the segment include:  14 wind farms,  1 photovoltaic power plant,  29 run-of-river hydro power plants,  4 pumped-storage power plants, including 2 with natural flow. 72 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 Diagram: Main assets of the Renewables segment.

Key factors affecting the results of Renewables in 2018 y/y were:  Decrease in revenues from electricity sales from wind farms resulting mainly from decreasing electricity sales volume by 273 GWh, connected with less favourable wind conditions in February and in period May-December 2018.  The increase of revenues from sales of certificates from wind farms resulting from: (i) realised sales of certificates and revaluation of inventories, what attributed to the increase of revenues by approx. PLN (+) 35 million; (ii) valuation of certificates at a price approx. PLN 43/MWh higher in 2018, which increased revenue y/y by approx. PLN (+) 32 million, at the same time with the lower production of certificates by approx. 221 GWh due to less favourable wind conditions in February and in period May-December 2018;  The increase of sales revenues of electricity from hydro power plants mainly due to sale price higher by PLN 48/MWh y/y.  The increase of revenues from sales of certificates from hydro power plants resulting from: (i) valuation of ongoing production of certificates at a price higher by approx. PLN 51/MWh in 2018 what attributed to the increase of revenues y/y by approx. PLN (+) 4 million; (ii) realised sales of certificates and revaluation of inventories, what attributed to the increase of revenues by approx. PLN (+) 1 million.  Higher sales revenues from ancillary control services result mainly from valorisation of remuneration for services provided by pumped storage power plants, in accordance with the provisions of the contract.  Decrease in costs results mainly from mainly from a correction of property tax concerning wind farms due to changes in legislation.

The energy produced in the Renewables segment could not be produced without natural resources: water, wind and sun. Taking this into account, PGE Group in its daily activities follows a responsible approach to the environment, in which segment’s assets operate and uses resources in rational way – especially water, that drives the turbines od hydro power plants and pumped storage power plants. Segment’s generation sources Investing in renewable sources since 2007, the wind asset portfolio currently has approx. 550 MWe. The renewable energy segment's assets include the largest pumped storage plants in Poland that contribute to system stability during peak demand for electricity as well as numerous run-of-the-river hydro-power plants. Aside from generating clean and ecological energy, PGE Group's hydroelectricity assets, which have their own reservoirs, play a very important role in flood control. They can divert and smooth out flood waves in rivers and thus control their safe discharge in volumes that cause no losses or damages. Water storage at hydro-power plants' reservoirs is also of key significance during draught. By supplying additional water to rivers, they support local fauna and flora. In addition, the operation of turbines adds oxygen to the water, which has a positive impact on the entire ecosystem. All hydro-power assets in the renewable energy segment have modernised installations that have no adverse effect on waters and do not change their physical and chemical properties, e.g. temperature. PGE Energia Odnawialna runs monitoring of birds and bats on its wind farms. Aim of this research is determination of real impact of wind farm operations on animals. Constructions of towers and wind turbines are also used – they prevent from nesting, and special marking on ends of windmill blades, which allow to see potential obstacles. Renewables segment companies pursue investments that focus on maintaining riverbeds, participating in the costs being incurred by river administrators and participating in the costs of restocking, which is a way of compensating for making fish migration more difficult on account of damming facilities being built across rivers. In accordance with environmental protection requirements, PGE Energia Odnawialna builds hydro-technical fish ladders at its facilities their task is to make it possible for fish and invertebrates to safely and comfortably migrate. Another one was built in 2018, at the Krzywaniec barrage. A breakdown of the data on waste water generated by PGE EO is presented in PGE Group's report on non-financial data for 2018 in chapter 6.7 Selected indicators in environmental issues in PGE Capital Group. Environmental development projects The Renewables segment is also implementing development projects that focus on the use of wind energy, water energy also offshore and photovoltaics. According to PGE Group's strategy, PGE plans to achieve a 25% share of the domestic renewables market by 2030. Development investments in this and other areas take into account the present economic situation. One of PGE Group's strategic options is to build offshore wind farms. PGE aspires to build approx. 2.5 GW of installed capacity in offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea by 2030. This aim will depend on the final version of Poland's energy policy. This project is to be developed in the southern part of the Baltic Sea, approx. 30 km from the coastal towns of Ustka, Łeba and Władysławowo. This investment will be an important development impulse for Poland. Gdańsk, Gdynia, Szczecin and Świnoujście can become the main construction centres for offshore energy in the southern section of the Baltic Sea, while Łeba, Ustka and Darłowo can become important service hubs. PGE Group is currently conducting a two-year wind measurement campaign in the Baltic Sea and is awaiting an environmental decision. Subsidiaries Baltica 2 and Baltica 3 have obtained terms for grid connection from PSE (approx. 2.5 GW of installed capacity). Works on securing the connection path on land are also under-way, and rights to properties are being secured. Preliminary geological and geotechnical surveys will be conducted in the nearest future in order to select the optimal type of foundation. PGE Group also sees potential to further develop onshore wind energy. This is proven by the project to build three wind farms: Starza, Rybice and Karnice II, together with associated infrastructure and power off-take. The investment in the Zachodniopomorskie Voivodship with total installed capacity of approx. 97 MW will bring PGE's total installed wind capacity to nearly 650 MW and strengthen its position as the largest producer of green energy in Poland. Realisation of the project will be possible thanks to the win of Klaster in auction for sale of electricity in RES installations. Auction organized by the ERO was directed to producers of electricity in PV plants and wind farms with a total installed capacity of more than 1 MW. 76 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 Also of significance are investments being implemented by companies in the renewable energy segment that focus on maintaining riverbeds, participating in the costs being incurred by river administrators and participating in the costs of restocking, which is a way of compensating for making fish migration more difficult on account of damming facilities being built across rivers. 77 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 DISTRIBUTION Segment description and its business model Core business of the segment includes supply of electricity to final off-takers through the grid and HV, MV and LV infrastructure. *in accounting terms. Segment revenue is based on a tariff for electricity distribution services, which is approved by the ERO President every year at company request and is regulated. The tariff allows costs related to the distribution system operator's on-going activities to be transferred. These are both justified operating costs, depreciation as well as costs related to the necessity to cover grid losses on electricity distribution or the purchase of transmission services from the transmission system operator. At the same time, the tariff reflects the transferred costs in fees such as the RES fee, transition fee or starting from 2019 cogeneration fee (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). The key element shaping the distribution segment's result is return on PGE's invested capital. This is based on the Regulatory Asset Base (“RAB”), which is established on the basis of completed investments and taking into account asset depreciation. The Regulatory Asset Base serves as the basis for calculating return on capital, using weighted average cost of capital, which is published by the ERO President in accordance with a set formula and using as the risk free rate the average yield on 10-year State Treasury bonds with the longest maturity during the 18-month period preceding the tariff application submission, as quoted on the BondSpot treasury market. Moreover, the level of return on capital depends on achievement of individual quality targets set by the ERO President for efficiency indicators that cover: interruption time, interruption frequency, connection time and (not yet taken into account) time to provide metering and settlement data. 78 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 VOLUME, CUSTOMERS AND OPERATING DATA PGE Dystrybucja S.A. operates in the area of 122,433 sq. km and delivers electricity to approximately 5.4 million.

This also involves investment and repair tasks that are conducted in such a way as to minimise their burden and impact on the surrounding natural environment. The construction of new power facilities or the conversion of existing facilities is based on decisions on environmental conditions. The matter of environmental decisions was included in the appropriate procedure. PGE Dystrybucja S.A. has been implementing a project to limit grid losses for years, mainly by replacing transformers with lowloss equipment and by converting and modernising the grid. These investments are contributing to the improvements in quality parameters of electricity supplies and to reducing grid operation costs. In 2018, as a result of a number of efficiency initiatives, the grid loss ratio was reduced from 5.4% to 5.1%. Distribution segment is subject to mandatory notification of installations that emit an electromagnetic field. New or modernised installations being operated by PGE Dystrybucja S.A. are notified to the relevant environmental protection authorities on an ongoing basis. In 2018 PGE Dystrybucja undertook a number of activities intended to maintain the natural character of the environment. The most important activities included:  conducting environmental impact assessments at the technical design stage of investment processes,  continuing activities intended to protect the natural environment from insulating oil pollution in the event of an emergency leak from transformers used on 110 kV substations, by constructing sealed containers (basins) under power transformers,  continuing activities within a programme to protect white stork nests, consisting of installing special structures on low-voltage lines facilitating the set up and protection of stork nests,  introduction of modern small-format power equipment and grid elements in order to decrease area occupied by infrastructure,  replacement of transformers in order to limit electricity grid losses. 81 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 SUPPLY Segment description and its business model Supply segment activities include Group’s wholesale and retail trading of electricity. Wholesale trading include mainly electricity trading on behalf of and for Conventional Generation segment and Renewables segment. *in accounting terms. As part of retail-market activities, the key source of revenue is sale of electricity to final customers.

In order to effectively manage liquidity, within the Group we have introduced a cashpooling system, with participation of 27 Group companies. Until 2014, PGE maintained a net cash position and investment expenditures were financed from operating cash flows. However, an ambitious investment programme of approx. PLN 34 billion scheduled for 2016-2020 requires long-term planning and external financing. The most important available external financing sources for PGE Group are as follows:  Domestic bond programme of PLN 5 billion.  Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) bond programme of up to EUR 2 billion.  2 credit facilities from Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego as part of the Inwestycje polskie (“Polish investments”) programme, amounting to PLN 1.5 billion in total.  Syndicated loan of PLN 5.5 billion, including a term facility of PLN 3.63 billion and revolving facility of PLN 1.87 billion.  PLN 2 billion credit facility from the European Investment Bank PLN 1.5 billion will be used for projects related to distribution network modernisation and expansion, while PLN 490 million will be used to finance and re-finance the construction of cogeneration units.  PLN 500 million credit facility from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to support implementation of a long-term programme for distribution network development and modernisation.  Syndicated revolving loan of PLN 4.1 billion intended for financing of the ongoing operations, financing of the investment and capital expenses and refinancing of the financial liabilities.  Current-account overdraft facilities. PGE Group's financing policy features diverse maturities for specific financial instruments, which along with the diversification of financing sources, helps the Group to optimise its financing costs. The Group aspires to implement a responsible financial policy, which entails maintaining its net debt to EBITDA ratios at a level that makes it possible to retain investment-grade ratings.

(ZHZW). In addition, growth of revenue results also from higher value of electricity under management on behalf of PGE GiEK.  Lower result on gas sales is mainly result of balancing the transactions with PGE Obrót S.A. and Enesta sp. z o.o. through purchase of gas on spot market. Gas delivered to PGE Obrót S.A. and Enesta sp. z o.o. as a consequence of non-balancing of offtaker’s demand, was sold to those companies at fixed price.  Lower result on other operations was mainly caused by decrease of revenues from support and licence agreements.  Increase in operating costs due to higher personnel expenses as a consequence of increased (inter alia in July 2018 60 employees were relocated from PGE Energia Ciepła S.A. to PGE S.A.), growing expenses for sponsoring and advertising and higher costs of IT services. 97 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 Table: Financial operations.

Growth of volume of electricity sales in 2018 y/y is a result of increase in trading volumes, mainly in transactions with PGE Obrót S.A. Sales to PGE Obrót S.A. are realised in order to secure the demand of the retail customers for electricity supplies. Table: Volume of natural gas sales. Sales volume 2018 2017 zmiana % Sale of natural gas to the Group 2.99 3.21 -7% Sale of natural gas outside the Group 2.68 4.31 -38% Total natural gas sales 5.67 7.52 -25% Lower sales volume of natural gas y/y is a result of decreasing sales to entities outside the PGE Group and on the exchange. This results from lower competitiveness of PGE S.A. offer, what is caused by the fact that from the second half of 2017 an act on inventories came into force, upon which gas importers are obliged to maintain/ purchase inventory capacities, where PGNiG S.A. is the monopolist on Polish market. Considering the costs of this type of services, PGE S.A. does not import price-competitive foreign gas mainly from Germany, that could be later offered on OTC market to large customers or be actively traded on TGE exchange. Sales of gas to the Group decreased largely due to lower demand of generating units of PGE GiEK. Supply volume to PGE Obrót S.A. also decreased, what results mainly from decline in sales to large customers from professional segment, an effect of losing two customers with significant gas consumption (Grupa Żywiec and Nida Media), whereas no other high volume consumption customers were not acquired. 6.3.

In accordance with statutory provisions, the State Treasury may demand in writing that the Management Board convene the General Meeting, demand that certain matters be placed on the agenda, submit draft resolutions pertaining to matters placed on the agenda of the General Meeting or matters which may be placed on the agenda. The State Treasury is authorised to appoint one member of the Supervisory Board by means of a written statement submitted to the Management Board of the Company. Such nomination or dismissal takes effect from the date on which the relevant notification is delivered to the Management Board and does not require a General Meeting resolution. The State Treasury may exercise this power regardless of the voting right when appointing other members of the Supervisory Board. On the ground of the Statutes, the State Treasury holds special right with regard to selection of the Supervisory Board members. Selection of half of members of the Supervisory Board, appointed by the General Meeting, shall be elected from among persons indicated by the State Treasury. The Supervisory Board selects the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board from among its members wherein the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board shall be elected from among persons indicated by the State Treasury. This State Treasury’s right is valid until its stake in the Company falls below 20%. LIMITATIONS REGARDING EXERCISE OF THE VOTING RIGHTS FROM THE EXISTING SHARES As from June 29, 2011 the Statutes of the Company provide the limitations regarding exercise of the voting rights in shares. The voting right of shareholders shall be limited in such manner that at the General Meeting, none of them may exercise more than 10% of the total number of votes existing in the Company as at the date of holding the General Meeting, subject to the provision that for the purposes of determining the obligations of entities acquiring considerable blocks of shares as provided for in the Act on public offerings, conditions for introducing financial instruments to an organised trading system and public companies of July 29, 2005, such limitation of the voting right shall be regarded as non-existent. The above limitation does not apply to the State Treasury and shareholders acting with the State Treasury on the basis of agreements concerning the joint exercise of the voting right related to shares. In addition, for the purposes of limiting the voting right, votes belonging to shareholders between whom there exists a relationship of domination or dependence (Shareholders Group) shall be cumulated; in the event that the cumulated number of votes exceeds 10% (ten per cent) of the total number of votes in the Company, it shall be subject to reduction. The accumulation of votes shall consist in the summing of the number of votes remaining at the disposal of shareholders belonging to a Shareholders Group. The reduction of votes shall consist in decreasing the total number of votes in the Company to which shareholders belonging to a Shareholders Group are entitled at the General Meeting to the threshold of 10% (ten per cent) of the total number of votes in the Company. The accumulation and reduction of votes together with the detailed description of the shareholders between whom there exists a relationship of domination or dependence are governed by the principles included in the Company’s Statutes. Moreover, each shareholder who intends to participate in the General Meeting, directly or by proxy, shall be obliged, without a separate call, to notify the Management Board or the Chairperson of the General Meeting of the fact that he holds, directly or indirectly more than 10% (ten per cent) of the total number of votes in the Company. This obligation does not apply to the State Treasury. A person who has failed to comply or has complied improperly with that obligation to provide information may exercise the voting right exclusively from one share until the remedy of such failure to. The exercise of the voting right from the other shares by such person shall be ineffective. Irrespective of the above provision, in order to establish a basis for the accumulation and reduction of votes, a shareholder, the Management Board, the Supervisory Board and the particular members of these bodies may demand that a shareholder provide information whether he is a person having the status of a dominant or dependent entity with respect to another shareholder. The right referred to in the preceding sentence shall also cover the right to demand that a shareholder disclose the number of votes that such shareholder holds independently or together with other shareholders. 109 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 At the time when the share of the Company's share capital held by the State Treasury falls below 5%, the limitation of the above voting right shall expire.

Details on the composition of the Audit Committee in 2018 are presented in a further part of this report. The Supervisory Board Audit Committee at PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. held 12 meetings in 2018. Given the need to determine detailed tasks and operational rules for the Audit Committee as a consequence of new tasks being assigned to audit committees following entry into force of the act on statutory auditors, audit firms and public oversight (Journal of Laws of 2017, item 1089), Regulations for the Audit Committee at the Supervisory Board of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. were adopted in 2017. On October 10, 2017 the Audit Committee at the Supervisory Board of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. adopted a Policy and Procedure for selecting audit firms to conduct audits and a Policy for providing services unrelated to audit by the audit firm performing the audit, its related parties and members of this audit firm's network (“Permitted services policy”). In accordance with the adopted Permitted services policy, a statutory auditor or audit firm conducting a statutory audit at PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. or any of its network members may not provide any prohibited non-audit services directly or indirectly to PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Group companies. Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities and repealing Commission Decision 2005/909/EC (EU Official Journal L.2014.158.77) and the Act on statutory auditors, audit firms and public oversight (Polish Journal of Laws of 2017, item 1089), prohibited non-audit services, in accordance with the Permitted services policy, are all services with the following exceptions:  conducting economic and financial due diligence,  issuing of comfort letters in connection with prospectuses issued by the audited entity, conducted in compliance with the national standard for related services and consisting of agreed procedures,  assurance services as regards pro forma financial information, earnings forecasts or estimated results published in a prospectus of the audited entity,  auditing of historic financial information for the prospectus referred to in Commission Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 of 29 April 2004 implementing Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards information contained in prospectuses as well as the format, incorporation by reference and publication of such prospectuses and dissemination of advertisements, 119 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018  verification of consolidation packages,  confirming compliance with conditions included in credit agreements based on analysis of financial information from financial statements audited by the audit firm,  assurance services concerning reporting on corporate governance, risk management and corporate social responsibility,  services consisting of evaluating the compliance of information disclosed by financial institutions and investments firms with information disclosure requirements concerning capital adequacy and variable pay components,  assurances concerning financial statements or other financial information intended for supervision authorities, supervisory board or other supervisory body of the company or owners, exceeding the scope of statutory audit and intended to help these entities in compliance with their statutory obligations,  open workshops, thematic conferences, industry meetings or other events that are open in nature and are not prepared for or adapted to the needs of PGE S.A., PGE Group companies or their employees. The provision of these services by a statutory auditor or audit firm performing a statutory audit of PGE S.A. or by members of the network to which the statutory auditor or audit firm belongs for PGE S.A. and PGE Group Companies is possible only in as far as this is not linked to tax policy after the Audit Committee at PGE S.A.'s Supervisory Board carries out an assessment of independence threats and precautions as referred to in the Act on statutory auditors, audit firms and public oversight (Polish Journal of Laws of 2018, item 1089). In 2018, the audit firm Ernst & Young Audyt Polska sp. z o.o. sp.k. auditing the financial statements of PGE S.A. provided permitted non-audit services based on consent given by way of resolutions by the Supervisory Board Audit Committee. Prior to these services being rendered, the Audit Committee performed an assessment of independence threats and precautions, as referred to in the Act on statutory auditors, audit firms and public oversight (Polish Journal of Laws of 2018, item 1089). Furthermore, the Audit Committee periodically analyses reports from performance of permitted services by audit firms for PGE Group companies. In accordance with the Policy and Procedure for selecting audit firms to conduct audits, selecting audit firms to audit the Company's financial statements and PGE Group's consolidated financial statements takes place in accordance with the rules specified in this Policy and Procedure, with observance of the laws, especially the Act on statutory auditors, audit firms and public oversight (Polish Journal of Laws of 2018, item 1089), Accounting Act (Polish Journal of Laws of 2018, item 395) and Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities and repealing Commission Decision 2005/909/EC (EU Official Journal L.2014.158.77), and taking into account guidelines from the Prime Minister on procedures for selecting and cooperating with audit firms auditing the annual financial statements of companies with a State Treasury shareholding. The Supervisory Board selects the audit firm to conduct an audit of financial statements. The first agreement concerning the audit of financial statements with an audit firm is executed for a period not shorter than two years, with an option to extend it for subsequent two-year periods. The maximum time for continuous financial statement audit commissions by the same audit firm or an audit firm linked to this audit firm or any member of a network operating in EU member states to which these audit firms belong may not exceed five years, with the stipulation that the lead statutory auditor may audit financial statements again after at least three years from the end of the most recent audit of financial statements. Executing an agreement for audit of financial statements is preceded by a procedure intended to ensure that the audit firm is selected in an independent and impartial manner. The procedure to select an audit firm is prepared and conducted in accordance with rules for fair competition, equal treatment of audit firms, proportionality and transparency. Prior to starting the procedure to select an audit firm, the Audit Committee specifies and presents to the Supervisory Board a recommendation on the procedure to select an audit firm. By way of a resolution and based on this recommendation, the Supervisory Board sets at least the following:  criteria for selecting the audit firm,  methodology for evaluating proposals for audit of the Company's financial statements,  the content of the notice or invitation to submit proposals for audit of the Company's financial statements. 120 of 130 Management Board’s report on activities of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. and PGE Capital Group for year 2018 Based on a Supervisory Board resolution, the procedure to select an audit firm is conducted by a tender commission, appointed in accordance with the Procurement Procedure in place at PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. On July 17, 2017, an agreement was executed with the audit firm Ernst & Young Audyt Polska sp. z o.o. sp.k., based in Warsaw. The subject of the agreement was audit of annual and consolidated financial statements for 2017 and 2018. The procedure to select a statutory auditor preceding the selection of Ernst & Young Audyt Polska sp. z o.o. sp.k. had began and ended before the Act on statutory auditors, audit firms and public oversight (Polish Journal of Laws of 2018, item 1089) entered into force. Given the above, in accordance with the interim provision specified in art. 283 of the aforementioned act, art. 130 sec. 2-7 of the aforementioned act did not apply in selecting the above-mentioned audit firm. Thus, the provision concerning the conditions for and content of the Audit Committee recommendation did not apply in selecting Ernst & Young Polska sp. z o.o. sp.k. The Corporate Governance Committee The Corporate Governance Committee evaluates the implementation of the corporate governance principles in the Company and presents the Supervisory Board with initiatives in this area, provides opinions on normative acts and other documents of the Company presented to the Supervisory Board, which considerably affect the corporate governance, initiates and prepares proposals of changes for normative acts of the Supervisory Board.
