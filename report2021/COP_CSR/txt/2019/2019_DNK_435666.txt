FARMING W I T H N AT U R E 2018/19 INGLEBY FARMS & FORESTS APS SLOTSGADE 1A, 4600 KØGE, DENMARK | WWW.INGLEBYFARMS.COM 2 This report is based on the combined worldwide data relating to harvests of the financial year from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019 (2018/19). All production, fertilisers, pesticides, and water use data reflects the harvest of 2018/19, although, for some regions, these input data were applied during 2017/18. We use quantifiable measures for production, resource use efficiency, employee health and safety, and community outreach all to promote good governance, sustainable production and to reduce risks. With this report, Ingleby Farms & Forests ApS reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. In this, our fifth annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We are also committed to sharing this information with our stakeholders. INGLEBY FARMS & FORESTS APS // FARMING WITH NATURE 2018/19 1.

A B O U T Sheep grazing, Tasmania. Photographer: Mette Bøgeløv Erichsen ABOUT 5 INGLEBY FARMS We are proud farmers and food producers. Our goal is to produce healthy, wholesome food on thriving and living farms. Farming is one of the most important jobs in the world. Having to work with soils, crops and animals while dealing with unpredictable weather and pests takes skills and experience. We use regenerative farming principles to improve the ecosystems on our farms. We grow a wide variety of plants and crops and aim to always keep our soils covered. We graze our animals in ways that mimic their typical or historic movements in natural settings. All this helps us to continuously improve our farms, build our soils, protect our waters and enhance the biodiversity.

The event generated a lot of interest in our Aberdeen Angus genetics. We aim to breed animals which can be raised and finished purely on grass and still produce excellent meat quality, flavour and healthy fatty acid composition. Our animals received many favourable comments and achieved a good validation from the market. SYNTHETIC PESTICIDE-FREE Since the early sixties, farming has become a chemical business. In a world of synthetic pesticides, we have lost our roots and much of our knowledge about holistic farming with nature. This cannot continue. With up to 70% of all insects gone over the last 30 years in Europe, and growing weed resistance, the way we farm must change. In November 2018, the Ingleby Board decided that Ingleby should become synthetic pesticide-free by 2030. We believe future generations will not accept any risk of residues from harmful pesticides in their food. They will want healthy, natural food and we will be ready to provide it. NATIVE PLANTS NURSERY, PERU We have created our own nursery named Viva El Cholocal for native Peruvian species. We produce the plants with technical assistance of the international organisation Rainforest Concern. We currently have more than 4,600 plants from 70 different native species. We also have more than 1.2 million seeds stored in our seed bank. We donate the native plants to the local schools as well as sell them to local farmers, who have shown an interest in increasing the biodiversity on their farms. ABOUT 9 TOWARDS ZERO ACCIDENTS Thanks to our teams’ continued focus on safety worldwide, we have reduced our number of accidents worldwide during the last four years. Latvia and Lithuania, lead this positive trend, with zero accidents recorded in 2019. It is a reminder to us all that achieving zero accidents is within our reach. INGLEBY GUIDELINES 2019 We have published a new THE IMPORTANCE OF edition of our guidelines book.

With more than 40 different crops grown in 9 countries on 4 continents, Ingleby has a resilience towards the increasing effects of climate change, especially regional droughts and floods. BLUEBERRIES, ROMANIA We have completed the final blueberry plantings in Romania, two years ahead of our initial plan. We now have a total of 200 hectares of blueberries in production, making us one of the largest blueberry producers in Romania. INGLEBY FARMS // FARMING WITH NATURE 10 CEO'S REVIEW During 2018/19, we have continued our strong focus on sustainable farming, enhanced by our new goal of all Ingleby farms and forests becoming synthetic pesticidefree by 2030. ALWAYS SAFETY FIRST SYNTHETIC PESTICIDE-FREE The safety and well-being of our employees is our In November 2018, we set a goal of becoming highest priority. In 2018/19, we had no fatal accidents synthetic pesticide-free by 2030. This might seem and thanks to our teams’ continued focus on safety, ambitious, but we believe it will become a minimum we have reduced the number of accidents by requirement to farm sustainably by 2030. 33% from 2017/18. In addition, our lost time injury frequency rate in 2018/19 was 50% below our peer Our teams have embraced this challenge with enthubenchmark. But even one accident is one too many, siasm and dedication, and they are investigating new and we will continue focusing on health and safety in and innovative ways of farming. In many ways, our 2019/20. 2030 goal has revitalised Ingleby.

In the coming years, we will intensify our research into life cycle carbon calculations while Based on the positive responses and innovation actively working to minimise our carbon emissions. generated by our 2030 goal, I believe we should set further ambitious goals in Ingleby. One new goal is having zero-waste by 2025. This means that every single item used in production must be compostable, reusable, or recyclable. This will need the support of our suppliers, and we will begin the work in 2020. Hans Henrik Koefoed Chief Executive Officer Another new goal is to become climate positive. Greenhouse gas emissions and climate change are topics high on the global agenda, but the currently available greenhouse gas calculations are fragmented and lack validated documentation. Today, product and service providers declare their own non-consolidated part of the calculation, causing widespread misinformation and the risk of emissions not being accounted for. The world needs a widely acknowledged framework and international rules for greenhouse gas emission calculations, which takes into account full life-cycle emissions for any product or human action. INGLEBY FARMS // FARMING WITH NATURE 12 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT As farmers, we have an important role to play in solving some of the world’s global challenges. We are aligned with the 10 universal principles on environment, human rights, labour and anti-corruption. We also support the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We have identified six SDGs that apply to our farming operations, and where we have the greatest potential for impact. These are aligned with our internal goals.

Our farmers work year-round to produce sustainable seeds, grains, vegetables, fruits and nuts as well as healthy animals for meat, milk and wool. From our land, we might have grown the blueberries you are snacking on, the avocado you had for lunch or the steak you will have for dinner. In a year, we grow more than 40 different crops including cover crops and new test crops. We also raise more than 160,000 sheep and cattle. Our food production lives up to the highest standards. We have received several certifications such as Global G.A.P., Never Ever 3 and Tesco Nurture Gold. Being able to guarantee consistent quality and sustainably produced products enables us to meet the highest requirements in the most demanding global markets.

The pristine natural grasslands are a refuge for indigenous flora and fauna. Over the centuries, the grasslands have also become important areas for beef production. The native grasses have a low, but stable forage production. We are strongly committed to the protection and preservation of these natural grasslands, and conservation is deeply integrated in our livestock production. We give alternating areas a rest from grazing during flowering and seeding. This way, different species can recover and regenerate. We do not fertilise, spray or introduce improved forage species, regardless of the potential to increase productivity. COWS ARE MADE TO EAT GRASS Gauchos, cattle and natural grasslands, Uruguay.

We employ people that have a passion for caring for animals. We raise more than 125,000 sheep, 30,000 cattle and 3,500 dairy cows. Our sheep are mainly Perendale, Romney and Finnsheep crossbreeds. Our beef cattle are mainly Aberdeen Angus and our dairy cows are Holstein-Friesians. All our livestock are all free-range and grass-fed. We believe that grass-fed livestock systems have multiple benefits such as superior animal welfare. Also, where we integrate livestock grazing into our crop rotations, it reduces soil erosion, improves our soil structure and organic matter content. Livestock production also protects open grazed landscapes, which often have high biodiversity. We follow strong ethical practices on how we treat and handle our livestock to ensure the best animal welfare.

GOAL 15 // LIFE ON LAND Ingleby forests are structurally heterogeneous, offering diverse ecological niches characteristic of natural forests. We use sustainable forest management principles in combination with natural regeneration to ensure healthy forests full of life. We assess our forests on a regular basis and retire areas that do not make sense to harvest, such as small stands, broken terrain, proximity to water bodies and weak geology. Such areas often yield low returns, and the ecosystem services gained from these areas, such as erosion control, water protection and habitat preservation are more valuable to us than the timber extracted. FORESTS 33 We also have 2,381 hectares as a designated huntingfree silent area where game has a safe haven for breeding. ANTS During the last year, we initiated a project to monitor the presence of ants in the forests. Red wood ants are important to the overall health of a forest. They provide essential ecosystem services, such as dispersing seed, maintaining neutral soil acidity, providing pollination services, recycling nutrients and biological pest control. The presence of dead-wood, a sizable food source and enough solar radiation reaching the forest floor are essential for a stable population of red wood ants. It is believed that a healthy forest should have at least four ant colonies per hectare. BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS We continuously try to build good relationship with the local communities neighbouring our forests. We focus on environmental educational projects. We hope that these projects will teach the local communities to respect and care for our forests as much as we do.

Soil and cover crops, Latvia. Photographer: Jeppe Støchkel Jeppesen SOIL 35 OUR SOIL, OUR SOUL Healthy soils are our most important resource. The soul of Ingleby. As long-term land owners, we constantly work to improve the quality of our soils. Crop production involves soil disturbance to some extent, that might result in soil erosion. Therefore, we use practical farming approaches that support crop production while effectively protecting the soils. We improve our soils by leaving sufficient crop residues on the ground, using cover crops and minimum tillage, maintaining healthy crop rotations, and adding compost and livestock manures where available and cost effective. We also contour plough, add nutrients to avoid depletion, use non-chemical weed controls, satellite-guided input applications and tractor-wheel path tracking. We define and monitor our soil’s qualities in relation to its ability to support crop growth. We assume that by improving soil properties that contribute to improved crop production, we also contribute to the other environmental services that soils provide.

Our challenge is to build up soil organic matter at levels that support good soil To measure how our soils are developing, we take quality in terms of tilth, porosity, drainage, nutrient reference soil samples from representative areas of supply, and biological activity. This will help grow our the farms every five years. The locations of these topsoil layers and support our crop production. sampling sites remain constant.

This is crucial for our from our annual crop nutrient balances and leaf crop production and improves our farms’ resilience to nutrient analyses. This allows us to understand how floods and droughts. our farming practices affect soil quality and how to better manage our soils.

GOAL 2 // ZERO HUNGER Soil is a key resource for farming. About 95% of all food comes from soils. Healthy, fertile soils can increase biodiversity and crop production. We make annual assessments of our soils' quality. We combine it with other ways to track soil health, such as reference soil sampling, measuring nutrient balances and earthworm counts. To protect and improve our soils, we aim for minimal soil treatment to reduce potential erosion. We diversify our crops and add cover crops that help build soil organic matter. We add lime to increase soil pH and nutrient availability. GOAL 13 // CLIMATE Healthy soils are capable of more than just producing food. They help combat climate change by storing carbon, since plants absorb CO2 as they grow and then push extra carbon into the earth through their roots. They also provide essential biological functions, such as storing and filtering water as well as degrading and detoxifying pollutants. Typical farming techniques, including tillage and leaving the soil bare between crops, releases carbon. It is estimated that farmed soils around the world have lost 50-70% of the carbon they once contained. However, increasing the world's soil carbon content by just 2% would offset all global greenhouse gas emissions. We have adapted principles from regenerative agriculture, such as minimum tillage and using cover crops or companion cropping to always keep our soils covered. By protecting our soils and covering our fields with live and dead organic material, we help to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. SOIL 37 Earthworm population density is directly affected by nutrition, crop protection, soil amelioration and soil properties and management practices. Therefore, irrigation. year-to-year comparisons of earthworm numbers will be another indicator of how our environmental and management decisions are effecting our soil health.

It can help store significant amounts of carbon in the soil, protect against erosion, and reduce the need for fertilisers and pesticides.

Some crops are high-carbon, some are low-carbon, some are legumes. Each of them contributes to the soil's nutrients and physical properties, thereby maintaining soil health. There is growing evidence that different cover crops Rasmus Juul Christoffersen with oil radish cover crop, Lithuania have the ability to make nutrients available to plants. Photographer: Katrine Hellesøe It may therefore be possible to reduce the need for fertilisers when compared to conventional farming methods. LIVING ROOTS This principle is about having living roots in the soil. Soils are most productive when soil microbes have access to living plant materials. A living root provides a food source for beneficial bacteria and promotes the symbiotic relationship between plant roots and mycorrhizal fungi. It also helps to reduce soil erosion. INTEGRATING ANIMALS Integrating animals is the fifth principle to healthier soils. When grazing is well managed, animals can help with carbon sequestration. They can help plants grow faster. As more grass is grown, more organic matter is available to recycle into the soil for feeding microbes. This captures and holds more water and nutrients, growing more and larger plants that can gather more sunlight for the photosynthesis process, and sinking more carbon back into the ground.

It irrigates our crops and pastures, provides fresh drinking water for livestock, and supports the most biodiverse habitats on our farms. We use water efficiently and cleanly. To produce ‘more crop per drop’, we use the best irrigation systems, avoid unnecessary water-use, and recycle water where possible. We use a range of nature-based solutions to conserve water and keep our rivers clean. We protect our farm waters from fertilisers, chemicals, sediment and animal waste by creating unfarmed buffer zones along riverbanks and lakes. We use terracing along slopes, and keep grass waterways in low areas of our cropland. In this way, we slow the velocity of water after rainfall, and at the same time protect our soils and waters by reducing sedimentation and erosion. We have an obligation to protect waters and water habitats for ourselves, our neighbours, and future generations to come.

The primary use of water in the world is for food production, accounting for at least 70% of all fresh water withdrawals. Currently, only 17% of all global cropland is irrigated, but this accounts for 40% of the total value of global crop production. To improve our water use efficiency, we “harvest” water in our landscapes and store it in dams to be used for irrigating our crops in times of need. We are aware of the trade-offs irrigation creates between crop yields and water and energy use. This is why we invest in state-of-the-art irrigation systems that are highly efficient and help improve both water and electricity use efficiency. Rivers, streams, ponds and wetlands are highly important features of our farmland. We have 2.2% our total land area in waterbodies. We aspire to maintain and improve the conditions of all water habitats on our land. Waterbody ecosystems are fragile. We therefore have management practices in place to eliminate or minimise the effect that farming has on waterbodies and improve their overall health. We never deplete natural water sources.

Agriculture uses energy directly as fuel or electricity to operate farm machinery and equipment, to dry grains, cool fruits, and indirectly such as in the production of synthetic fertilisers. Our sustainable agricultural principles may not always be the most energy efficient. As an example, mechanical row cleaning requires more diesel use than simply spraying weeds with chemicals, but it reduces our need for harmful herbicides. Another example is irrigation, which also requires highenergy use, but helps us to conserve water. Ultimately, energy use and efficiency are aspects of agriculture that cannot stand alone and always should be seen as part of a larger, holistic farming system.

This is because we can be heavily affected by situations we have no influence over. Something as simple as a few weeks of prolonged drought or rain can easily be the difference between profit and loss. Changes in seasonal weather patterns and the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events is a risk for food production – both for Ingleby as well as global food production. Adapting to a changing climate is becoming increasingly important. Farming is partly responsible for rising greenhouse gas emissions, but farmers can also be a key part of the solution to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases trapped in the atmosphere. Minimising tillage, expanding crop rotations, planting cover crops and reintegrating livestock into crop production will reduce our climate footprint as well as help capture excess carbon generated by other industries. This captured carbon can then be converted to plant material and soil organic matter, improving soil health and increasing our ability to produce food.

Photographer: Amandas Naudžius NATURE 55 TAKING NATURE SERIOUSLY Healthy natural environments support healthy farms. Interactions between biological communities and their physical environments build soils, cycle nutrients and water, sequester carbon, purify water and air, mitigate pests and pollinate crops. We constantly monitor and assess if our farming practices are affecting our environments. One example is monitoring birds on our farms as indicators of biodiversity. Changes in bird populations are useful indicators of our farms as habitats, but also of broader environmental changes. We identify land that is unsuitable for production and can be returned to natural habitat. Our Farming with Nature project guides us in this process. In the last years, we have focused on how to better use the valuable natural resources present in our ecosystems. By using natural fertilisers and biocides as well as releasing native predatory insects to manage pests, we eliminate the environmental and economic cost of chemical pesticides. These practices also help us achieve our goal of producing high quality products with zero chemical residues.

The world is currently experiencing its sixth mass extinction, bought about by humanity, with over one million species threatened with extinction. Globally, the number of wild animals has halved in the last 40 years with an additional 35-50% of terrestrial species expected to disappear over the next 30-years. In Germany, a study found that 70% of all flying insects have disappeared. A similar number is likely in other countries as well. This is threatening the very biodiversity, ecosystems and biosphere that humanity relies upon for survival. Healthy ecosystems provide services necessary for successful agriculture such as nutrient cycling, water purification, primary production etc., and help build resilience to climate change.

We have also identified ten significant environmental, cultural and recreational sites totalling 265 hectares.

NATURE 63 IMPORTANCE OF POLLINATORS Animal pollinators ensure the transfer of pollen between the male and female parts of flowers to enable fertilisation and reproduction. The importance of animal pollinators to food production cannot be overstated. According to a report prepared by The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) crops dependent on pollinators account for 75% of the world’s food crops and represent 35% of global crop production volume. Pollinator-dependent crops include many fruit, vegetable, seed, nut and oil crops, which supply major proportions of minerals, vitamins and micronutrients, essential in the human diet. Furthermore, nearly 90% of wild flowering plants depend on animal pollination. Fenced riparian planting after 2 years, New Zealand. Photographer: Hans Henrik Koefoed WILD POLLINATORS Wild pollinators are declining in occurrence and diversity on a global level. International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list assessments show that often more than 40% of bee species are threatened. This is in part due to change in land use and intensified agriculture, resulting in less areas with season wide natural bee forage. Another reason is the increased use of synthetic insecticides.

Farmers often make use of managed bees to ensure a high number of pollinators are available to pollinate their crops at the time of flowering. However, wild pollinators also help with crop pollination even when managed bees are present in high abundance. In general, a diverse community of pollinators provide more effective and stable crop pollination than any single species. Fenced riparian planting directly after planting, New Zealand.
