Segments of this annual report contain opinions regarding the future. These segments can – without limitations – contain expectations on future realised and unrealised results, profits, payments, government measures, the impact of other regulating measures on the activities of RAI Amsterdam, subsidiaries and macro-economic trends and the performance of RAI Amsterdam. Such statements are preceded or followed by or include terms such as ‘believe’, ‘expect’, ‘prognosticate’, ‘feel’, ‘anticipate’ or similar. These future-oriented statements are based on current assumptions of future activities and are subject to known and unknown factors and other uncertainties, many of which are outside RAI Amsterdam’s sphere of influence.

The RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre on Europaplein in Amsterdam welcomes some 1.6 million visitors annually (a figure which fluctuates over the years). They come to attend consumer & trade exhibitions, conferences, stage shows and other events. RAI Amsterdam lets its location and facilities to organisers (event owners/organisers) for whom it facilitates the event. In addition, RAI Amsterdam has developed its own portfolio of events. These consumer and trade exhibitions and conferences are organised by the RAI itself, both in the Amsterdam Convention Centre and in other exhibition & conference venues abroad. Events In the RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre The RAI has enjoyed healthy growth over recent decades, especially in its international events portfolio. As the main sector-specific exhibitions and conventions become larger and more international, organisers recognise the benefits of Amsterdam as a location for a short multi-day stay. It is largely these international events which currently take place in the RAI, and they are expected to remain the engine of sustainable growth in the coming years. > Executive Board report > Events 2018 Money 20/20 5 RAI events in the Netherlands and abroad The RAI has a portfolio of its own events which we organise in the RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre and/or elsewhere in other convention centres outside of Europe. Our sectors (and exhibition titles) are: professional cleaning (INTERCLEAN), remanufacturing (ReMaTec), traffic technology (Intertraffic), the maritime sector (METSTRADE, Superyacht and IBEX), water technology (Aquatech), horticulture (GreenTech) and unmanned aerial systems/urban air mobility (the new Amsterdam Drone Week). The RAI also has its own national events, the majority being consumer events like the Huishoudbeurs (home and household), Negenmaandenbeurs (pregnancy and infants) and HISWA Amsterdam Boat Show. There are also trade exhibitions such as Horecava, which targets the Dutch hospitality sector. All in all, the RAI has a well-rounded portfolio of its own titles. The events organised in Amsterdam provide turnover for the convention centre, while the events abroad reinforce our market share. > Executive Board report > Events 2018 Stimulating the economy, complementing a city The RAI stimulates the economy in Amsterdam and the wider region. Hotels, restaurants, museums, transport operators, suppliers and the airport all benefit from the exhibitors and visitors who come to the city for the (often international) exhibitions, conventions and events in RAI Amsterdam. Business visitors who come for a few days are also good for the city and the wider region. They spend the day at an exhibition or convention, ensuring that the city stays in balance, while their overall stay contributes to the local economy. > Executive Board report > Regional impact CSR is part and parcel of the way we think and act Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is such an integral part of RAI Amsterdam’s strategy that it is embedded in our mission: ‘the RAI aims to stimulate the sustainable development of people, markets and the society at large’. With this in mind we take great care of our natural and social environment. Business processes are constantly made more sustainable and we work with local suppliers whenever possible. We also help organisers set up their events in a sustainable and responsible way, while our own events encourage eco-friendly innovations, contributing to new ideas and greater sustainability in a range of sectors. > Executive Board report > Strategy 6 Our strength The city of Amsterdam: a compact metropolis Amsterdam is a global city on a human scale. The canals, the museums and theatres, the cosy cafés... Amsterdam offers freedom and a uniquely tolerant ‘live and let live’ mentality. It is this combination which gives the city its global allure. > In brief > Global city on a human scale Our employees: a warm welcome to the RAI RAI employees are proud of being able to offer a wide range of services and leverage on their many years of experience to guarantee a hospitable reception. The professionalism of our staff ensures that the most diverse wishes of exhibitors and visitors are met to their satisfaction. There are 423 individual employees at RAI Amsterdam, whose presence adds up to 392 FTE. There is also a fixed group of flexibly deployed employees consisting of some 300 regular temps. Every year, RAI Amsterdam deploys around 4,200 such workers. It is energising for employees to work in teams to set up events and quickly switch from one event to the next. Working at the RAI is challenging and diverse in equal measure. > Executive Board report > Personnel and organisation Multifunctional building complex: centrally located, innovative and sustainable The RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre is an innovative building complex. We continuously seek to make our buildings and the events which take place within them more sustainable. The convention centre hosts an average of over 400 events a year. The strength of the RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre is the multifunctional nature of the complex, which enables fast and flexible switching between very diverse uses and purposes. The convention centre is located on the edge of central Amsterdam, adjacent to the A10 ring road, train & metro station Amsterdam RAI and the metro station Europaplein. The main hall of Schiphol Airport and the central train station are just a 10-minute trip away. > Executive Board report > Facilities 7 Our shareholders The holding company of RAI Amsterdam is RAI Holding BV which has two shareholders: the RAI Association and the City of Amsterdam. The RAI Association owns 75% of the shares in RAI Amsterdam. It is a trade association that promotes the interests of 700 manufacturers and importers of passenger cars, trucks, trailers, bodywork and special vehicles, motorcycles and scooters, mopeds and bicycles. Suppliers of parts and garage equipment are also linked to the association. The involvement of the RAI Association in RAI Amsterdam goes way back in time. The bicycle industry started organising an annual exhibition in Amsterdam in 1893. A few years later, after the car industry also started participating, this show was dubbed the RAI, an abbreviation for ‘bicycle and automotive industry’ in Dutch. The remaining 25% of shares are owned by the City of Amsterdam, an arrangement that dates back to 1956 and is based on economic considerations. The City of Amsterdam decided in 2016 to start the process of selling the municipal shares. 8 9 Key figures 399 in Amsterdam Approval ratings ganisers hibitors Visitors Or Ex 6 405 8.2 7.5 7.8 abroad events 18 stage shows 281 other 35 71 events national international exhibitions/ exhibitions/ congresses congresses 1.7 . million in Amsterdam 109,000 abroad 1.8 million 65% visitors foreign exhibitors 152.3 million 383 ecopower turnover employees € € ployees Em 15.5 million / 10.2% operating result 81% 2018 .

Thank you for your interest in our company and annual results. We invite you to look back with us on 2018, which has been a true banner year for our company. best operating result in history For starters, 2018 was the most profitable year in the RAI’s history. The operating result was €15.5 million over a turnover of more than €150 million. More than 1.8 million people visited our convention centre or our events abroad. Despite how busy the year was, customer satisfaction even rose a little above the 2017 level. Among the employees, 81% were satisfied or very satisfied: this proportion has unfortunately dropped from the 91% measured two years ago, with the structural changes in our company and the busy times in 2018 having since taken their toll. We see this as an important point to improve and will work hard to do so during 2019. large and small, global and We hosted 65 international and 35 national events, ranging from small shows to exhibitions that local filled the entire convention centre. Exhibitions, conventions, parties, meetings, theatre shows – all types and sizes of events were represented in our well-filled agenda. success for RAI titles Our own events, especially Interclean, Intertraffic and METSTRADE, were again very successful. Abroad, we organised events such as Aquatech China, where we hosted 80,000 visitors. new in the RAI There were also several new events. For instance, we opened our doors to AIDS2018, the 22nd edition of the world’s largest convention in the field of health. We also hosted Money20/20, the European version of an event that focuses on payment transactions, fintech and financial service provision. And we launched the Amsterdam Drone Week together with the European air transport association EASA. The arrival of this exhibition has allowed Amsterdam to profile itself as a ‘drone city’. ISE moves to larger Not all the news has been good: 2018 was also the year in which ISE announced that it would have convention centre to move to a larger location starting in 2021, despite a high level of satisfaction. The event organisers wish to make the most of opportunities to expand further, and will therefore unfortunately no longer fit within the RAI. tragic accident A tragic accident occurred in October when a 23-year old colleague from one of our partner companies suffered a fall and died during the breakdown of an event. This incident moved us all deeply. 14 strategy: reinforce core In 2017 and 2018, employees and management reviewed the RAI’s strategy, which has now been business and social balance set up to and including 2022. The main points in our approach are to reinforce the core business and ensure the best possible balance between social costs and benefits. Important pillars of the strategy include the development of a strong portfolio of events, optimised use of data & digitisation and the realisation of a multifunctional area development. This should contribute to innovative solutions for customers and the modernisation and increased sustainability of our buildings and infrastructure. Another pillar is the reinforcement of our learning organisation. further improvements in safety A lot of time has been invested into further improvements to safety & security by different departments within the RAI as well as by the North Sea canal area environment service (Omgevingsdienst Noordzeekanaalgebied) and Amsterdam-Amstelland fire brigade. We have already made major steps in this area and plan to continue doing so in 2019. the RAI and the city: a perfect Our customers’ assessments and visitor numbers show that the RAI’s proposition was much match appreciated in 2018. The charms of the city of Amsterdam, the inner-city location of the RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre and our excellent reputation in the field of hospitality once again ensured pleasant and successful business stays. stewardship for the city Our strength is in no small measure a product of our city. For many visitors, RAI Amsterdam is the city: our hosts receive visitors in Amsterdam as well as on behalf of it. We work on this all day every day with many other businesses. We also jointly make choices that have an impact on the city in turn. We feel responsible for these effects and are very aware of our role as stewards for the city. social value It is therefore understandable that the RAI aims to create social value as well as economic. This applies to our suppliers and partners, our neighbours and the Amsterdam region – even for the world, where certain sustainable development goals are concerned. We make a contribution by stimulating sustainable innovation wherever possible. real estate developments: We did a lot of work in 2018 on the RAI 2030 spatial development plan, which is a close reflection improving integration and of our social ambitions. The plan expressly dictates a better integration of the RAI complex within infrastructure its surroundings while improving our infrastructure. sustainable growth and We are proud of this future vision, not least because it helps us tell our story. It shows in concrete development terms what we really care about, in all its facets: to be an inextricable part of the city and contribute to the sustainable growth and development of people, markets and our environment.

We believe these services will offer major value to our clients in the future. Why VR? A person wearing VR glasses is situated in a digital environment. We use VR to answer questions like ‘What’s possible in the RAI?’ and ‘What will it look like?’. We are currently developing various VR services: • The virtual testing of the personalised setup of an event to realise the best possible setup in the early stages. This way we can test features and setups to further optimise the value of our halls; • The various types of possible basic setups can be visualised in 3D. This service gives organisers the chance to experience their options in a timeframe of just 15 minutes; • Providing visual support to the construction and reconstruction of the convention centre. The RAI is always innovating in its halls, rooms and exterior spaces; VR allows us to see in advance what these changes will look like and test various alternatives among users. Why AR? AR is a technology in which a digital layer is projected onto an actual image of the environment. For example: you could use the camera of your phone to see your surroundings on a screen, onto which an application then projects 3D objects in a realistic position. General research shows that a prospect who has an AR experience with a product is 30% more likely to purchase it. As we can use the technique to remove doubts, AR has major potential in the fields of e-commerce and the setup of events. We are currently developing the following services: • Various packages with uniform stands can be projected in a space in actual size or to scale. This service allows us to answer questions such as ‘Is my stand big enough?’, or ‘Do I want to change my furnishing or is standard my best choice?’; • Another option is providing AR at exhibitor stands so they can better utilise their own space. They could use an AR service to show potential customers products which are exhibited digitally instead of physically at the event. The RAI has already mapped various spaces in VR during 2018: Hall 1 (Europa Hall), Hall 4 (in the Amtrium) and Hall 5. 25 Composition of Supervisory Board and Executive Board Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board consists of five members.

FROM INTERNATIONAL TRADE EXIHIBITIONS TO ENTERTAINING STAGE SHOWS A broad range of inspiring events took place for professionals and consumers alike. SIX EVENTS ABROAD The RAI also exports its own successful events to other continents. Six such events took place in 2018 (nine in 2017). STIMULATING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT When facilitating exhibitions, the RAI stimulates sustainable development, operating with a clear focus on our ecological and social environment. When organising events, we place an emphasis on sustainable content in order to stimulate eco-friendly innovation and contribute to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. facilitating and/or organising Several categories of events can be distinguished based on the location where they took place and the role that RAI Amsterdam played: There were 388 events (421 in 2017) organised by third parties in the convention centre in Amsterdam – they jointly accounted for 1,294,000 visitors (1,124,000 in 2017) – for which RAI Amsterdam played a facilitating role. Eleven events (13 in 2017) were organised by the RAI itself in our convention centre in Amsterdam for which the RAI had an organising and facilitating role. These events welcomed around 421,000 visitors (375,000 in 2017). The remaining six events (nine in 2017) were organised by the RAI abroad and attracted around 109,000 visitors (126,000 in 2017); here, RAI Amsterdam only had an organising role. 29 Events 2018 In Elsewhere Total Amsterdam Trade exhibitions 40 6 46 Consumer exhibitions 34 34 Conferences 45 45 Stage shows 18 18 Other 262 262 399 6 405 Visitors x 1.000 In Elsewhere Total Amsterdam Trade exhibitions 564 109 673 Consumer exhibitions 796 796 Conferences 231 231 Stage shows 21 21 Other 102 102 1,715 109 1,824 30 Events in Amsterdam The table below show a selection of events divided by type.

No fewer than three-quarters of the visitors indicated that they found this edition more innovative than the last. The exhibition was full of new initiatives, including future trends in the Innovation & TrendLAB, multiple pop-up restaurants, new competitions and the extra ‘Fast Casual on the Move’ hall. The latter responded to changing consumer demands for convenience concepts and was visited by two-thirds of visitors. Three-quarters of the visitors indicated that they had come to the exhibition for new products, services and technologies. Horecava is now so large that a multi-day visit is recommended and twice as many visitors did so in 2018 as in previous events. The following activities took place during Horecava 2018: Partnership with the Vegetarian Restaurant Week held annually in March. RAI Amsterdam called on visitors, chefs and hospitality entrepreneurs to participate and generate extra attention for vegetarian recipes; Partnership with Stichting Verantwoorde Voeding Basisonderwijs (foundation for healthy food in elementary schools): signatures were collected at the exhibition for a petition calling on the government to pay more attention to this subject. A press conference featuring a 31 parliamentarian and a university professor was also held at the exhibition; Innovation & TrendLAB: one of the themes was ‘circularity’. A number of speakers at the seminar (including the writer and former politician Jan Terlouw) called for sustainable solutions. The lab itself hosted several circular companies and applications, including cradleto-cradle work clothing, equipment for longer storage of prepared food, waste reduction (La Place took part here), worm hotels (biological decomposting solutions) and city greening (urban gardens for hospitality businesses); Advisory lab: a range of consultants provided businesses with ideas on sustainable solutions (energy, water, food waste, etc.); Innovation Award: the winner in the sustainable category was a new cleaning agent using natural minerals and no chemicals; Several sustainable pavilions could be found at the exhibition, including: Veggie & fruit market: encouraging the use of vegetables; From source to plate in NL: top chefs demonstrated the preparation of culinary dishes with local seasonal products from the region. Intertraffic 2018 Intertraffic Amsterdam 2018, the world's leading trade event for infrastructure, traffic management, smart mobility, safety and parking, took place in March and attracted more than 32,000 visitors. A new component at the exhibition was ITSUP: start-ups play a significant role when it comes to innovation in the international smart mobility sector and this platform allowed them to present their ideas to a large group of companies and specialists from the sector. Forty-six start-ups were hosted on the stage in Amsterdam and an ITSUP was also held at Intertraffic China. ITSUP, Intertraffic 2018 Interclean 2018 This exhibition took place in 13 halls and hosted more than 800 exhibitors, making it the most complete event in the field of professional cleaning. Professionals came to Amsterdam to find products that deploy the latest developments in technology and innovation. In addition, there were extensive, industry-specific seminars on multiple stages, sub-events, and demonstrations of products and specialised cleaning skills. The Interclean Amsterdam Innovation Award was also presented. 32 Anatomy of the waste bin ZeroWaste Foundation developed a concept for Interclean in which companies are taken on an ‘expedition’ in their transition to a circular way of production. The keywords in this concept were awareness-raising, knowledge development and behavioural change. The ‘anatomy of the waste bin’ was an immediately successful concept from the start (see below). The expedition to zero waste focused on four interrelated topics: people, logistics, technology and raw materials. Processes and behaviour were examined, goals set and concrete measures formulated for each topic. Anatomy of a rubbish bag The zero-waste expedition started with an interactive workshop where a waste bin or container with a normal, representative amount of safe industrial waste was analysed. The options for sorting valuable raw materials from residual waste were discussed at length. ‘Anatomy of the waste bin’ is a stepping stone for a follow-up process within companies studying habitual behaviour, goals and approach towards a zero-waste situation and value creation. ISE The RAI had to prepare its maximum capacity for Integrated Systems Europe (ISE), the world's largest audio-visual equipment trade exhibition. An additional 9,000 m² of exhibition space in the form of temporary pavilions were added to the area in front of the building and a further 2,650 m² to the conference square. Moreover, the conference had 15 halls at its disposal. In July 2018 ISE announced that it would remain in RAI Amsterdam in 2019 and 2020 and move to another European city in 2021 to accommodate its explosive growth. The organisers made the following statement: “The RAI and Amsterdam have offered us a fantastic stage and been wonderful partners who have made a real contribution to the success of the exhibition. Unfortunately, the increasing demands to join as exhibitors and the ongoing increase in visitor numbers, combined with the limitations in available floor space, made us realise that, despite all our efforts, the event could not continue to grow while remaining in the RAI.” While regretting ISE’s decision, the RAI understands its reasoning and is pleased that ISE can continue to grow. We built a very successful event together over the past 15 years and will ensure that the remaining editions in RAI Amsterdam in 2019 and 2020 are events to remember. Successful introduction: Amsterdam Drone Week Professionals from 28 European countries involved in drone-related technology, applications and regulations came together during Amsterdam Drone Week in November. This new event was developed by RAI Amsterdam in collaboration with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), with the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management as a partner. It responded to a need for clear regulations requested by sectors such as defence, police, healthcare, logistics and transport as a prerequisite for using new drone applications. In fact, the first European regulations for unmanned aircraft are expected to arrive in 2019. The drone industry is developing very quickly and Amsterdam Drone Week facilitated discussions, innovations and connections among the relevant stakeholders. 33 Amsterdam Drone Week Consumer events in RAI Amsterdam in the RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre (selection) Month Title sector / field of interest website Feb Huishoudbeurs 2018 Home & living https://www.huishoudbeurs.nl/ Feb Nine Months Fair 2018 Pregancy & children https://www.negenmaandenbeurs.nl/ Mar HISWA Amsterdam Boat Show 2018 Watersports https://www.hiswarai.nl/ Apr International Amsterdam Motor Show 2018 Cars https://www.amsterdammotorshow.com/ Apr KunstRAI 2018 Art http://www.kunstrai.nl/ Apr Kingsland Festival 2018 Festival https://kingslandfestival.nl/ Sept Comic Con Europe 2018 Comics-related entertainment http://www.comiccon-europe.com/nl/amsterdam/ Oct In de Wolken Festival 2018 Parents & children https://www.indewolkenfestival.nl/2018/ Oct vt wonen&design beurs 2018 Living, interior & design https://www.vtwonen.nl/wonen-design-beurs/ Oct Martin Garrix Concert Concert https://martingarrix.com/ Nov Pan Amsterdam 2018 Art http://www.pan.nl/ Dec Masters of LXRY 2018 Luxury products https://lxry.nl/ Dec Hond 2018 Dogs/pets https://hond-event.nl/ Dec Valhalla 2018 Festival https://www.valhallafestival.nl/ Dec Amsterdam Winterparadijs Christmas event https://www.hetamsterdamsewinterparadijs.nl/ More sustainable new products at the Huishoudbeurs and Negenmaandenbeurs The Huishoudbeurs and the associated Negenmaandenbeurs, which took place in RAI Amsterdam in February, offered lots of interesting news for consumers in terms of sustainability. There was plenty to see and do, from bamboo diapers to natural deodorants, from a vegetables plaza to fashion with a story. Waste was taboo: leftover products were collected and donated via the Zending over Grenzen charity as the many visitors to both exhibitions jointly made a contribution to a cleaner environment. The exhibition organisers have been working together with the Stibat foundation since 2012 to encourage visitors to bring in their used batteries during the exhibition. A total of 650,000 batteries have been recycled in this way over the last four editions of Huishoudbeurs. 34 A Huishoudbeurs app available for download from Google Play and the Apple Store provided all the information required for a fun day at the show, such as the programme and a map. In addition, visitors could activate a virtual scratch card every week until the start of the exhibition to have a chance to win gifts. Users who switched on push notifications were automatically reminded of this every week. Parents want the very best for their child – and it is natural to wish one’s children to grow up in a clean and healthy world. This is why the Negenmaandenbeurs also featured many sustainable products, brought together at the Puur Baby Plaza. Huishoudbeurs 2018 More visitors and high willingness to buy at HISWA 2018 The water sports season started with the new HISWA Amsterdam Boat Show in March 2018. Around 37,500 visitors, seven per cent more than for the previous edition, came to find information on the latest news, try things out and make purchases. A poll among exhibitors showed that lots of sales were made. The Funsports Xperience, which was twice as large this year as last year, was also a hit. Eighty per cent of visitors were enthusiastic about the new course plotted by HISWA. Masters of LXRY For the first time in the history of the RAI, a Michelin-star restaurant was opened on the exhibition floor: M21. Ten elite chefs – together accounting for 21 Michelin stars! – cooked for visitors to the Masters of LXRY over four evenings. 35 Conferences in the RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre (selection) Month Title sector / field of interest website Jun Annual European Congress of Rheumatology Reumatology /health care https://www.congress.eular.org/ EULAR 2018 Jun EUROPERIO 9 Periodontology/health care https://www.efp.org/europerio/ Jul 22nd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2018) AIDS/health care https://www.aids2018.org/ Aug World Dog Show 2018 Dogs/pets https://wds2018.com/nl/ Sept ECI Immunology/health care https://www.eci2018.org/home/ AIDS 2018 AIDS 2018, the 22nd edition of the world’s largest conference in the field of health, took place in the RAI in July. Scientists, policy makers, activists and politicians all came to Amsterdam to talk about ways to curb the global AIDS epidemic. Eighteen thousand visitors to the conference, including doctors, researchers, activists and HIV patients from 180 countries were received in the RAI. Tens of thousands of visitors came for the Global Village, 35,000 nights in hotel rooms were booked and 500 sessions, workshops and activities were held accompanied by 800 volunteers, prominent speakers and international ambassadors. A number of side events took place in Amsterdam, there was a major publicity campaign in the city, and around 800 journalists from the Netherlands and abroad were present at Schiphol. Luminaries such as Prince Harry, Charlize Theron, Princess Mabel, Bill Clinton and Elton John all participated in AIDS 2018.

The prestigious awards for the greatest musical stars and best productions in the Netherlands were handed out during this impressive live show. Other events in Amsterdam In addition to the abovementioned categories, a range of other events took place in the RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre. Jumping Amsterdam The 59th edition of Jumping Amsterdam was held in January 2018. The event was a huge success, with several completely sold-out components. To accommodate this interest, an extra hall was used for the event in 2019. The area accommodating the general public and stands was expanded by 4,000 m², while the promo village grew by 700 m². This ensured a more varied selection of stands for our visitors, ranging from equestrian sports to jewellery and from the latest horse transportation vehicles to bridal fashion. The increase in the capacity of the spectator gallery made it possible for us to host more visitors. The programme was also adjusted, among other things due to the return of the Show Jumping World Championships. Amsterdam Sports Gala The gala celebrating elite sports in Amsterdam took place in December. The Fannies were awarded to the best sportswoman, sportsman, talent, coach and sports team in Amsterdam, respectively, in the RAI’s Ballroom. The association with the widest range of sports on offer for the disabled and chronically ill also received the Amsterdam Plum. DNA Gala The second DNA Gala was held in honour of the 105th anniversary of the Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital. This grand event for 1,000 guests aimed to raise funds for research into immunotherapy. 37 During the evening, guests were treated to a dinner interspersed with performances by various famous artists. There was also an exclusive auction, as well as a draw. The event was followed by an exclusive after-party. The gala ultimately raised a whopping €919,530 – one of the highest results ever seen for a benefit gala. DNA Gala InnovationLAB Innovation is usually given as one of the top 3 most important reasons for visiting an exhibition. In response, in 2015 RAI Amsterdam created the InnovationLAB, a place where ideas, innovations and news take concrete shape on the exhibition floor and online. RAI Amsterdam’s InnovationLAB is a collaboration with external partners TNO, 3TU Federatie and Accenture Innovation Awards. The rich and diverse platform provided by the InnovationLAB encourages exhibitors to make their innovations more visible at RAI Amsterdam shows. In addition, the InnovationLAB provides knowledge centres, research institutes and innovation partners with a platform to bring their new ideas to the market and enrich RAI Amsterdam’s exhibitions. The InnovationLAB is a platform where visitors see and experience innovations in their market online and in person. Moreover, it enables the exhibition medium to stand out and profile itself in this crucial field. The RAI gives sustainability a prominent place in the InnovationLAB so that sectors and markets are encouraged to work and innovate sustainably. How do the RAI’s own events stimulate the sustainable growth and development of people, markets and the environment? RAI Amsterdam strives to see all our own events linked to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. By putting the social challenges linked to the relevant sector/community on the agenda of every exhibition, we stimulate the sustainable growth of people, markets and the environment. Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 38 The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were formulated to help end poverty, inequality and climate change by 2030. The RAI’s business operations contribute especially to the six Sustainable Development Goals shown in the table in the Strategy paragraph. Moreover, the RAI’s own events make their own contributions to specific SDGs depending on the sector in which they are active. Aquatech China Water is already a problem in many places in the world, and things are getting worse. Sometimes there is too little of it, at other times too much, and sometimes water is contaminated and cannot be used. Aquatech Global Events are a series of trade exhibitions organised in Amsterdam, China and Mexico where the global water industry comes together to jointly address these problems. The exhibition programme offers a complete overview of the latest developments in the fields of drinking, waste and process water. Aquatech focuses on professionals working in all areas of the water industry and brings policymakers, specialists, scientists, the business community and other stakeholders together. Aquatech China is a part of Aquatech Global Events. The Asian exhibition programme also offers a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in the field of water treatment, transport & storage, process control & automation and point of use. The latest exhibition in China attracted 80,000 visitors, with more than 1,200 exhibitors participating.

The day saw the most pressing questions in the field of sustainability, matchmaking, experiences and event management solved by experts, scientists, students and professionals from a range of different disciplines. Each challenge was hacked by two teams and the solutions pitched to the jury. The solutions and ideas will be shared within the Dutch and international events sector. impression of the Event Industry Hackathon RAI Insights #2: The customer journey for exhibitors knowledge sharing focused on How can companies ensure they get the most out of their participation in an exhibition? RAI increasing returns for Amsterdam has examined the exhibitor customer journey and provided tips for every phase in the exhibitors second edition of our RAI Insights report. Exhibitors can use the knowledge it provides to enhance the impact of their brand during trade shows or other events, while organisers will find ways to provide even better support for their exhibitors. The report describes the following five phases of an exhibitor’s customer journey: Orientation: deciding whether to exhibit in an event, with which objectives and how; Preparation: from exhibiting concept to invitations; Leading up to the exhibition: physical transportation and build-up; During the exhibition: physical and digital encounters; After the exhibition: a proper follow-up of contacts and measurement of results. The report contains specific tips for exhibitors in each phase. Every year, RAI Amsterdam examines a theme and places it at the core of the annual RAI Insights report. The reports published over the period 2017-2019 formed a customer journey trilogy. In 2017, the focus was on the customer journey of event visitors while the 2018 edition looked at 42 exhibitors and the 2019 edition analysed organisers. With this expertise, RAI Amsterdam aims to contribute to the further professionalisation of the event sector for and by all the stakeholders involved. cover of the RAI insights report impression: phase of the customer journey Visitor Services focus on the visitor experience RAI Amsterdam offers services to visitors to optimise their experience. We arrange hotel accommodation and transport, parking, a courtesy lounge (help desk, work and meeting places, etc.) and visitor catering. 43 Food & beverage food & beverages: self-catered The delivery of food & beverages is an important component of every event. RAI Amsterdam or in partnership with third organises this independently or in cooperation with external specialists, and supervises the quality parties and realisation in all cases. catering food & beverage concept Five convention restaurants, two permanent restaurants The RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre has five restaurants: the Grand Café, First Floor Restaurant, Holland Restaurant, Café Amsterdam and the Amtrium restaurant. They are opened as required when an event or conference are taking place. There are another two restaurants in the convention centre which are operated by third parties: THE ROAST ROOM and Strandzuid. In addition to the restaurants, various catering points in each complex are operated during exhibitions and conferences by cafés and eateries such as La Place, Sunday’s and Sushi Time. 44 Basement Chefs The RAI’s culinary team is called the Basement Chefs and works in the nexus of underground corridors and cellars where our kitchens are located. From gala dinner to catering for a conference or exhibition, the RAI can offer the logistical capacity as well as the flexibility to turn any event into a gastronomic success. There are sometimes more than a hundred cooks active in our kitchen during large events. Heartwarming Amsterdam The ‘Heart-warming Amsterdam’ concept we deploy in our kitchens showcases a deliberate choice to work with regional products and remove vulnerable ingredients from the range. Products used have an added value for the region or society at large. Care farms for outings or education, small local farms, urban greenhouses and dairy farms in the region are seen both as suppliers and a key source of inspiration. This supports vulnerable products in our urban region while enabling RAI Amsterdam to offer people a chance to enjoy distinctive products grown in the region and dependent on the season. In addition, keeping the route and distance between production and consumption as short as possible helps reduce our CO2 emissions. In the spotlight: Warm lunch at the Bosshardt house Since June 2018 the Basement Chefs have provided the ingredients for a weekly warm lunch for 50 guests at the Salvation Army’s Bosshardt house in Amsterdam Noord. The house serves a free lunch every Thursday to give people who are lonely, elderly or have special needs a place at the table. This initiative has seen the RAI offer a fine second destination for quality products from our kitchens. Sustainable alternative At RAI Amsterdam we find it very important to add a sustainable alternative to each product group and, where possible, provide sustainable products as standard. The range of sustainable alternatives covers everything from furniture, carpeting, lighting, plants and modular stand construction to food & beverages. The catering on the exhibition floor is particularly important to visitors. It is not realised entirely by RAI Amsterdam itself, with a part being provided by subcontractors. In addition to innovating in our own kitchens, RAI Amsterdam has therefore entered a dialogue with these suppliers on ways to boost their level of sustainability. Whenever possible, all concession holders now include an organic product in their range as standard at all events in which they are active. 45 In the spotlight: Sustainable chefs’ whites New chefs’ uniforms were introduced during Horecava 2019, made of a unique fabric that is designed to be reused. Instead of being thrown away, old work clothes are reworked as raw material into new ones. The new line of chefs’ whites was designed by Persu and developed by Dutch-awearness, a textile company active in the transition from a linear to a circular economy in the field of clothing. Gold level of the EPCAS Food Waste Initiative In September 2018, RAI Amsterdam was awarded the Gold level of the EPCAS Food Waste Initiative for the many activities it undertakes to counteract food waste, such as: Participating in a study by Wastewatchers to monitor what is left over from ordered lunch items so as to learn more and adjust our range if possible; Whenever an organiser is open to the idea we can gradually change our catering offer so that there are less leftovers. For instance, The Basement Chefs created a street food assortment during a large private event and during Money20/20; Our Visitor Catering department developed a sustainable food box as a way to prevent waste by giving people the option of taking their food or leftovers with them; The Basement Chefs also have a partnership with In-Stock, which purchases leftover items from supermarkets for use in the RAI; RAI Amsterdam regularly donates products to the Food Bank; Every Thursday, the RAI offers a free three-course lunch for the Salvation Army in Amsterdam-Noord, where dishes are compiled from a residual stream of event catering in the RAI for around 50 people at a time. These are prepared meals left over at the RAI which cannot go to the Food Bank. This creates a new social purpose for leftover food, which naturally meets strict standards of food quality; Biodegradable food waste remaining at the RAI goes into a swill tank and is converted into biogas. This biogas is later returned to the RAI in the form of generated power; The production of RAI Ketchup: the Basement Chefs were contacted a few years ago by a tomato grower asking if they could find a new destination for tomatoes left over at the La Place restaurant chain, which was in dire straits at the time. This was the beginning of a new product line, and some 2,500 litres of ketchup have been produced since then. 46 Hotel Services meeting the demands of The ability to attract large international events to Amsterdam is strongly dependent on the international organisers availability of sufficient hotel rooms at attractive prices. The increase in the number of rooms available in recent years to 40,000, along with close partnerships with hotels and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, is making it easier for RAI Amsterdam to meet this requirement from international organisers. intermediary for more than RAI Hotel Services is the largest accommodation intermediary in Amsterdam and the surrounding 174,500 hotel nights region, mainly booking hotel reservations for visitors to international events. In 2018, over 36,600 reservations were processed, comprising more than 174,500 overnight stays (in 2017 this number was 141,500). The RAI’s Hotel Services website provides information on the hotels’ sustainability labels, permitting this criterion to be highlighted during the selection and booking. 'I Amsterdam Approved' RAI Hotel Services only works with hotels that have the ‘I Amsterdam approved’ quality label. This quality label label is granted by Amsterdam&partners (formerly Amsterdam Marketing) to hotels that meet certain standards and agree to reserve available rooms at a fixed rate for organisers, visitors and exhibitors during large city-wide events. 47 Sustainable venue Green LED and Power Energy-saving lighting Sedum moss roof Electric waste transport Swill tank Compost and biogas solar panels Natural smoke and 146 tonnes heat extraction electric charging stations ijzer papier glas tapijt hout swill Waste separation Water-free The Basement Chefs urinals Serve local, healthy and sustainable catering Daylight scheme Central electric cooling y reduction The Amtrium BREEAM-NL Excellent certification Combined Heat & Power (CHP) City Farm Herbs, edible flowers, fruit from own greenhouse.

The venue hosted an exceptional number of events and functioned entirely as expected. Sustainability is a major starting point in the development of the convention centre. Every year, the RAI continues to invest in increasing the sustainability of its buildings, products and services. RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre facilities The table below shows the facilities the convention centre has to offer. RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre facilities Properties Facilities Total surface area 112.600 m2 Conference centres 3 interlinked conference locations Halls 12 interconnected halls, expandable with two semi-permanent halls Rooms 2 auditoriums, one large ballroom with 2,000 seats. A total of 70 conference and meeting rooms. Accommodation for 10 to 10,000 people per room. Foyers and lounges Multifunctional space for exhibitions, parties and celebrations Entrances 9 separate entrances: own entrance for each event Restaurants and bars 9 restaurants, bars and lounges. From buffet to à la carte Parking garages Capacity for 4,000 spaces on the premises Marina Own marina directly connected to the Amsterdam canals Train station Named Amsterdam RAI, directly adjacent to the RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre Two metro stations Amsterdam RAI Station connects to the metro line that forms a circle around the city. The new Europaplein station is situated just 50 m from the entrance to the RAI and connects the RAI to the city centre. 49 the 23 hectares of the RAI RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre with the Europa Hall in the foreground Expansions & renovations completed in 2018 Despite having such a busy year, the RAI still found time to renovate, innovate and invest in the sustainability and quality of the venue. The renovations included: Forum Complex renovated individual halls can be linked Rooms E103 to E108 in the Forum Complex were renovated in various stages. The placing of five sliding walls means the rooms can be used individually or be interconnected to form one or more large halls. The high rooms were equipped with a full-glass facade which can be darkened with black-out or shading screens. 50 new rooms in the Forum Complex completed in October 2018 Room E101 in the Forum Complex was also renovated. Two previous spaces were combined into one large location with direct access to the technical area and interpreter booths of the Forumzaal. Although the room does not have natural light, the installation of a unique daylight system in the ceiling makes it a comfortable space. Park Foyer renovated completed in August 2018 The renovated Park Foyer now has an open and multifunctional character. The extra passages (7 metres wide) to Hall 8 and a movable wall between the Park Foyer and the public area on the first floor allow the space to be used as an expansion of the hall capacity and for presentations and dinners. This gives the RAI 6,000 m² of extra space for events. Park Foyer Catering points Hall 1 renovated completed in September 2018 The permanent catering points in Hall 1 were renovated to provide sufficient comfortable seating and a varied choice of places for networking or moments of rest during a visit to the RAI. The catering points offer visitors a wide-ranging menu from sandwiches and healthy smoothies to freshly made pizza. 51 catering points Stairwell entrance C expanded completed in October 2018 To ensure a safe environment for our visitors in the future, an extra stairwell next to the existing stairwell and escalator was added at entrance C. The stairs improve the flow of visitors toward Halls 10, 11 and 12 and allow us to perform quick entrance checks on the ground floor. entrance C New air-conditioning units in Hall 5 The air-conditioning units in Hall 5 were completely renewed. The old units had energy label C while the new ones come with energy label A. The expected reduction in energy consumption is over 30%. Traffic, accessibility and parking Parking spaces 4,000 parking spaces The RAI has 4,000 parking spaces on its premises, strengthening our position by increasing customer satisfaction, stimulating smooth traffic flows and reducing any nuisance to the neighbourhood. 52 The concept of registration-based payment for parking reduces the use of physical tickets. It has already decreased the number of tickets by 50% and stimulates the flow at peak times, which in turn reduces the traffic on surrounding streets. The parking rate principle was changed in the reporting year. Previously, the RAI used day rates, calculating a full day even when visitors parked for a much shorter time. In 2018, we switched to hourly rates which resulted in improved customer satisfaction. Partly due to the growing number of visitors, the total parking profits increased by 14% to € 6.5 million. North/South Line opening of new metro line The North/South Line is a new underground section of the Amsterdam subway system that was opened in 2018. It runs from Amsterdam Zuid station (walking distance from the RAI), via the new metro station Europaplein right by the entrance of the RAI, to the centre of Amsterdam, underneath the IJ waterway and on to Amsterdam North. The connection brings RAI visitors from the convention centre to the city centre or central rail station in under ten minutes, It also runs very frequently. Metro station Europaplein opened in 2018 P+R parking P+R location RAI contributes RAI Amsterdam is a designated P+R location for the municipality of Amsterdam. On days when to more accessible city centre there is little or no event-related traffic, drivers can park their cars in the garages on the RAI’s premises, reducing traffic in the city centre. The RAI welcomed its 100,000th P+R user in 2017, and in late 2018 the total was over 221,000 vehicles. In the reporting year, more than 73,500 cars used our P+R services. The opening of the North/South Line has further increased the popularity of the RAI P+R location. The door-to-door travel time via the parking facilities of the RAI and public transport to many parts of the city centre is now shorter than by car. The P+R route via RAI Amsterdam also offers time benefits compared to driving to city centre destinations by car. From January to July, the average number of vehicles was 4,200. From August (the North/South Line opened in July) this figure more 53 than doubled to 8,800 vehicles a month. Although P+R parking is not available daily due to events, these 8,800 vehicles a month over a 30-day average translate into 300 fewer cars a day parking in the city centre. December was the busiest month with 12,100 P+R users. We expect the flow will further increase in 2019 as the option becomes known as an effective and sustainable alternative for reaching the city. Mobility actions, reducing excessive traffic Watch the video on mobility on and around the RAI premises RAI Amsterdam deploys various measures to reduce periods of excessive car traffic around the complex: Proactively stimulating the use of public transport. RAI Amsterdam offers clients alternative transport to driving. Deals that combine tickets to exhibitions and transport, offered in partnership with the public transport companies NS and GVB, are both convenient and cheaper for visitors; Use of neighbourhood traffic controllers on busy days; Partnerships with NS, GVB and Taxicentrale Amsterdam (TCA); Facilitating electric transport: RAI Amsterdam now has 38 charging stations for electric cars; During exhibitions for which busy build-up and/or breakdown periods are expected, external premises in Westpoort (outside the Amsterdam ring-road) are used as a buffer zone. Incoming traffic is directed to this area, where the vehicles are registered and then invited to drive through to RAI Amsterdam in an orderly fashion. This significantly reduces lorry traffic around the RAI. The buffer facilities can accommodate 90 trucks; Using the boat services of Mokum Maritiem to transport waste over the canals as an environmentally friendly alternative to trucks. This decreases road use, reduces transport movements around the RAI and lowers air and noise pollution in the city centre. The barge sails twice a week and when full, each trip – including the return cargo – eliminates 10 to 12 trips by lorry. Other ways that we improved mobility in and around the RAI during 2018 include: 54 Making a logistical plan within the framework of which we performed various pilots and developed a long-term vision; Creating and using a permanent buffer zone in Westpoort to prevent vehicles searching for parking around the RAI and enable a smooth traffic flow; Carrying out a pilot project at METSTRADE for the further development of sustainable exhibition logistics together with our logistics partner. During the build-up and breakdown of METSTRADE, the world’s largest trade exhibition for the international leisure marine industry, DB Schenker offered exhibitors the option of delivering goods to a transhipment facility outside of Amsterdam. The goods were then grouped and transported to and from the RAI in an eco-friendly Scania LNG truck where they were unloaded with electric forklifts; Researching innovations and new types of logistics that might reduce pressure on the neighbourhood; Testing the exclusive use of electric taxis at a (small-scale) event. Non-electric taxis were banned on the annual Dutch ‘Sustainability Day’; Opening a separate queue ('fast lane') for electric taxis at various large events. This stimulated the switch to electric transport as the electric vehicles were able to reach visitors more quickly. The experimental stage with the fast lane was completed in 2018 and we have decided that all major events (which involve taxi queues) will have a fast lane in 2019; Performing tests with three electric forklifts. While these worked well technically, the balance between autonomy, charging capacity and logistics still requires some attention. In 2019 we will decide whether to make electric forklifts compulsory or stimulate their use in some other way; Tests on washing cars without water, offering people who are disadvantaged in the labour market with an opportunity to gain experience within the RAI organisation; Increasing the number of bicycles at the RAI within the Hello Bikes share programme; GBC Zuidas signed the Green Deal Zero Emission Urban Logistics agreement during the annual CEO breakfast of its Green Business Club, with the 25 CEOs present underlining their support for the deal. This will ensure that GBC Zuidas and its participants contribute to the ambition of the Amsterdam Economic Board to make urban logistics in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Region emission-free by 2025; Working on the development of a Mobility Portal to coordinate the mobility on and around the RAI premises. We expect to perform the first tests with this application during 2019. 55 Public transport deals The RAI stimulates the use of public transport via special deals. These allow us to limit the busyness around the RAI during large events as much as possible and reduce CO2 emissions. Public transport deals Percentage of visitors using public transport deals compared to total number of visitors Number of visitors Current Edition -1 Edition -2 edition (previous) (second to last) Huishoudbeurs 6% 5% 5% HISWA 4% 5% 9% Horecava 16% 19% 23% METS 40% 41% 39% Intertraffic 30% 31% 19% Interclean 26% 29% 14% GreenTech 25% 35% 13% Total 21% 24% 17% Marketing, Digital & Information and communication technology high-value Marketing and IT High-value Marketing & IT facilities are an increasingly important factor for the success of an event and sound business operations. The rapid growth of virtual applications on and around the exhibition floor requires constant attention, as does the need for exhibitors, visitors and RAI staff to be connected 24/7. RAI Amsterdam therefore prioritises the renewal and further development of its Marketing & IT services and service provision, with an emphasis on data, marketing automation, connectivity and indoor navigation. One of the RAI’s activities in this framework in 2018 was redefining our IT architecture to work from a 360-degree customer perspective (customer-centric databases). We also worked on the company-wide implementation of a new CRM system which is expected to go live in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, we’ve improved the wayfinding and achieved good results with beacons that help determine position on the exhibition floor and communicate with visitors’ smartphones via a dedicated app. The processes related to the webshop for exhibitors have been optimised and tested during METSTRADE and our webcare was further professionalised to perform faster and reach more of the community. We’ve performed tests with a live chat on RAI.nl to gain more experience in this field. In addition, we developed a white label app with functionalities that will be applied to the RAI’s own events and made available to organisers/third parties as well. Finally, we’ve taken steps in the field of virtual and augmented reality, as you can read below. The European privacy legislation (AVG/GDPR) was implemented on 25 May. This was preceded by an internal communication and awareness programme. 56 Safety & Security broad policy area, major Safety & Security is a broad policy area. Cyber-crime, fraud and terrorism have become investments in reporting year increasingly complex over recent years, with new threats that cannot be resolved by organisations alone. A combined and integrated approach with the police, justice department and defence together with government institutions and companies is required. Several years ago, the RAI’s focus was mainly on the safety and security of the building. Due to various recent events in Europe, however, our awareness has increased to other areas. As many people come together in the RAI, we have changed our policy to work more closely with public bodies and establish security agreements with the police, emergency services and the control room, the district council, companies in the surrounding Zuidas region, public transport and the Mayor of Amsterdam’s advisory team. Several examples of activities in 2018 aimed to further improve safety & security include: Fire safety: we moved forward with and partly realised various planned investments. This includes extending the fire alarm system to all halls and replacing 50% of the fire alarm centres, placing extra emergency stairs, installing extra emergency doors and taking various actions to optimise the compartmentalisation. In 2019 the RAI will go through the inspection and certification stage of various elements, such as the smoke & heat ventilation, fire alarm systems and the automatic evacuation system; Safety & Security documentation: the factual reporting of action and check lists at all stages of events has been further improved; We have established and taken the necessary integrated mitigating measures for 17 identified threats in this area. The Safety & Security policy will be developed further based on these threats; Cameras help monitor the premises and software helps us recognise people. Should something happen in the RAI, we can share information quickly with other parties such as the police, public transport and Schiphol; Within the Safety & Security field we have made a distinction between policy & development and operations. This means there are now two departments working on safety, each with its own responsibilities. Sustainable use of natural resources Energy consumption and CO2 emissions responsible use of energy The total energy consumption of the convention centre increased to 141 TJ (terajoule) from 134 TJ in 2017. This represents an increase of 5%, caused by the growing number of activities at the RAI. To compare: in 2018 there were 20% more visitors in the RAI than in the previous year. 57 To a certain degree we cannot directly influence total consumption as the RAI supplies the power our customers request. What we can do is ensure that we help our organisers and exhibitors in the most sustainable way possible. The following measures reduced our energy consumption in 2018: Since 2014 we have gradually been switching from gas absorption machines to electric cooling for the cooling of our buildings. The RAI no longer needs natural gas for cooling purposes, making the process at least eight times as efficient as before; We offer customers a sustainable and energy-efficient range of products such as LED lighting, and tackle unnecessary consumption with smart meters and presence sensors. We also offer day and night connections, which means that stands no longer need to be powered continuously: the electricity is switched off in the evening after the exhibition closes, except for exhibitors who have specifically ordered night power. This saves a great deal of unnecessary standby consumption at stands, which is beneficial for the environment and cost effective for exhibitors; In 2018 the RAI commissioned an external energy audit, designed to give us insight into opportunities for improving the efficiency of our building interior and consumption. The goal of the energy audit was to map all measures with a payback period of five years or less. It analysed major consumers such as boilers, compressors, cooling units, heat pumps, lighting, computer equipment, PV cells and the thermal storage. The audit showed that we can take actions such as continuing the centralisation of refrigeration and freezer units (1,200 kg CO2 reduction/year), replacing the central compressed air system with a mobile one (700 kg CO2 reduction/year) and improving the seals, switching off fans when the door of a cooling unit opens, and replacing (un)loading doors by speed gates (combined approx. 600 kg CO2 reduction/year). A further aspect with a significant potential benefit is reclaiming heat from ventilated air; The RAI constantly monitors the consumption data with specific software and closely monitors energy data; Natural gas is only used incidentally to heat spaces. It is used to generate the CHP and the boilers (in both cases: several days a year during peak loads). All the power consumed in the RAI is green power without a CO2 footprint. The RAI receives certificates from Centriq confirming the purchase of green power from energy provider NUON (Vattenfall). solar roof supplies approx. The RAI uses 1806 solar panels – 174 on the Amtrium building and 1632 on hall 8. Hall 8 1,700 GJ of energy measures 12,000 m² and more than 60% of its roof surface is covered in panels – the maximum proportion allowed given its structure and use. The RAI’s solar panels produced more than 1,697 GJ in 2018 (2017: 1,482 GJ). It was agreed in 2016 that 2500 solar panels would be fitted on the Holland Complex for use by the nhow Amsterdam RAI hotel. This expansion was begun in the autumn of 2018: half had been installed by the end of the year and the rest by the date of this report. The number of panels was 58 reduced to 2,164 as the capacity per panel has increased, and they will be taken into use in the spring of 2019. As the energy will be supplied to the RAI hotel, the addition will not affect the CO2 footprint of the RAI itself. solar roof Gas consumption Gas consumption has dropped abruptly in the past few years: in 2018 it was just 11% of the figure in 2013, when the RAI started switching over to more sustainable district heating. The NUON pipeline has have a capacity of up to 18 MWh, which is sufficient for the RAI to switch entirely to district heating in the future. CO2 footprint Switching from gas to district heating has led to a major reduction in our CO2 footprint. District heating is a more sustainable energy source than natural gas as it is based on the residual heat produced during industrial processes, power generation and/or waste separation.

This represents an increase of 4%. The number of visitors rose by 20%. Water consumption x 1 m3 2018 2017 2015 2014 2013 Water consumption 64,631 62,336 55,765 66,084 50,253 waste management: 'best in Waste class', zero waste Waste is one of the priorities within RAI Amsterdam’s CSR policy. We aim to be among the leaders in terms of waste management in the global conference and events industry. zero waste: 100% recycling. Together with our waste processing partner Renewi, RAI Amsterdam recycles 100% of its waste. 62% waste separation at the Zero waste is the basic principle. Seeing waste as material looking for a new use, we try to recycle source into new end products as much as possible and do our best to reuse the products ourselves. In this process, we involve the entire product chain so as to inspire as many people as possible to reduce, reuse and recycle. There is zero landfill and, as a result, 100% recycling as all materials are reused or used to generate energy. There was, however, a larger percentage of incinerated waste than we were aware of, namely 23%. This was the due to the difficult market for materials such as wood and construction waste along with the fact that the wet fraction of pellets is also incinerated. Due to these variables in the market we cannot be certain that the percentages will also apply to 2018. Waste separation on the RAI premises was 62% (2017: also 62%). The re-use of removed IT materials and reclaiming of the raw materials they contain is realised via the ‘Ladder of Lansink’ waste hierarchy, which means that the priorities for reuse are as follows: 1. reuse of the product as complete device; 2. part of the product is used for another device; 3. reclaiming raw materials; 4. incineration with reclamation of thermal energy; 5. dumping/incinerating. We removed 0.5 tonnes of IT waste using this method in 2018, earning us an environmental certificate from WEEELABEX Certification, which works in accordance with the ISO 14001 environmental management system. The RAI complies with the EU recycling goals and does not export computer waste to third-world countries. 60 Waste volume x 1 tonnes 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 wood 1,464 1,074 929 722 684 carpet 342 284 257 275 239 paper 260 250 235 213 230 plastic 2 ‑?? ‑?? ‑?? ‑?? swill 146 151 119 133 109 organic 4 16 67 ‑?? ‑?? iron 31 40 30 21 10 glass 77 73 104 71 50 construction & demolition 849 744 573 377 131 other specialist waste 2 6 7 7 2 residual 1,977 1,583 1,701 1,785 1,706 Total 5,154 4,221 4,022 3,604 3,161 City scavenger walk with a sustainable touch City walks were organised in the neighbourhood around the RAI together with our waste partner, hosted by professional guides from Gilde Amsterdam with support from students. During the walk participants collected waste in jute bags. After returning to the RAI, the contents of the bags were sorted and the participants given a certificate. GreenTech InnovationLab stage made of recycled paper/cardboard In the reporting year, we experimented with paper and cardboard construction materials, which resulted in a recycled paper/cardboard stage for the InnovationLab during GreenTech. Coffee cup project In December 2018 the RAI found a destination for our used paper coffee cups, which add up to around 1,400 kg a month. These will be used to produce paper towers for the kitchen staff. Noise four noise exemptions to RAI We try to prevent excessive noise as much as possible by using a so-called acoustic map. This environmental licence enables RAI Amsterdam to predict when we need to apply for a noise exemption permit – four such requested, careful monitoring permits are allowed per year. This way, we monitor the standards and can take preventive of sound standard measures when necessary. We made use of the acoustic map eight times in 2018. Noise exemption permits were required for four music events, for which we eventually received 23 complaints. All other events were within the noise standards of the RAI environmental permit and caused no disturbance to our neighbours. 61 In total, the RAI received 30 noise complaints in 2018 which were reported to the RAI, the environmental service (Omgevingsdienst) or the Amsterdam Zuid district. The RAI sent letters to 20,000 addresses in the neighbourhood to inform them about licences for the Valhalla and Winterparadijs events. Expansion of Hall 5 start 2018 – delivery planned To fulfil the demands of our stakeholders RAI Amsterdam is always looking for ways to upgrade the in 2020 complex. In 2018, we presented concrete plans for the renovation of Hall 5, situated in the Europa complex on the Wielingenstraat side and originally built in 1961. The space can be used as an independent hall or combined with the surrounding halls. Hall 5 will be extended by 30 metres, giving it approx. 4,000 m² of extra multifunctional exhibition space. Due to its new glass facade, the hall will have a modern and open appearance to the nearby residential neighbourhood. The main entrance for Hall 5 will be the main entrance of the Amtrium, Entrance L. This will reduce the visitor flow in Wielingenstraat. The project will also include various sound-reduction measures as well as a green strip to create a clear demarcation from the street. Part of the facade of the current hall will be reused. Any trees felled will be used to build wooden benches for the outdoor premises of the RAI. A neighbourhood meeting to present the plans took place in 2018. Impression of Hall 5 development 62 On site hotel construction of conference It has been a long-held desire for RAI Amsterdam to have a four-star hotel on our premises that hotel continues would allow us to offer tailored accommodation to conference and exhibition visitors. With the development and realisation of the nhow Amsterdam RAI hotel, this wish is becoming a reality. A hotel on the RAI site with 650 rooms and parking for around 200 cars is a strategic addition to RAI Amsterdam’s core activities. Responding to the needs of the market by creating an adjacent ‘headquarters hotel’ where event organisers and key exhibitors, speakers & visitors can all stay seriously strengthens our international position. The construction officially started in late October 2016. The basement was completed and the sheet pile wall removed from the ground at the end of 2017. The construction rose into the sky during 2018. The world-renowned architect Rem Koolhaas (OMA) created the design. As a new landmark for the city, the hotel also features a phenomenal sky bar at 90 metres. The developers COD and Being Development have sold the nhow Amsterdam RAI hotel to the investor AXA Investment Managers – Real Assets. The building will largely be leased by the NH Hotel Group and the restaurant unit on the ground floor by a catering business. A 20-year lease agreement was made with the RAI for the operation of the parking garage. The hotel is located in the triangle between the RAI complex, the Europaboulevard and the A10 motorway. This site is highly strategic thanks to the proximity of the railway station Amsterdam RAI (which allows quick connections to key places such as Schiphol Airport), the metro stations and the A10 junction. The construction reached its peak of 91 metres on Friday 8 February 2019. The milestone was celebrated with a spectacular projection mapping show in the presence of the construction partners and various guests. The opening is planned for the first quarter of 2020. nhow Amsterdam RAI hotel, impression 63 RAI Vision 2030: building on the future In January 2018, the RAI started developing a new spatial vision as part of the RAI 2030 plan, with the following goals: Anticipate the expected future growth of large events. The RAI can expand on its existing site in phases, gradually increasing the available exhibition space; Improve the quality of the public space around the plinth (outer contours of the ground floor) of the RAI; Enhance sustainability when organising and facilitating events, including reducing the nuisance caused by logistical movements around the RAI, particularly in the build-up and breakdown period of large exhibitions. Optimising the in & outflows and logistical processes minimises the inconvenience caused by freight traffic. Importance for city and society RAI Amsterdam aims to contribute to the prosperity of Amsterdam and its hinterland, and to society as a whole. While the events obviously bring revenue into the city, RAI Amsterdam would like to be involved in other ways as well: by attracting local suppliers and offering opportunities to local residents who are disadvantaged on the labour market; by limiting the impact of large events on daily life in the city wherever possible; and by having an active dialogue with all our stakeholders. In all these ways, we aim to ensure that RAI Amsterdam continues to provide a valuable contribution to society. 64 Waste management € € Consulting role from the RAI helps reduce waste from organisers and exhibitors Environmental inspectors help reduce waste during setup and breakdown stand stand stand supplier organisers Food waste Waste separation from the kitchen events 146 wood carpet paper swill metal glass residual waste tonnes 29% 7% 5% 3% 1% 1% 16% Swill tank in house provides new raw separated waste material in compost and biogas 62% in 2018 62% in 2017 Electric waste transport on canals: 1 trip = 6 truck rides Ambition: 100% recycling = zero waste & 0% landfill 38% residual waste is filtered and processed at Renewi into ecopower and other products 65 Strategy MISSION In 2018, RAI Amsterdam formulated an enriched strategy for the period 2019-2022, including a newly defined mission/ambition and strategy. STRATEGY Comprising six pillars, the strategy is focused on strengthening the core business and creating a balance between social profits and losses. Focal points and goals have been assigned for each calendar year up to and including 2022. OUR BRAND The RAI Roadmap gives direction to our brand and the implementation of our strategy. Mission motivation: Inspiring people RAI Amsterdam aims to contribute to the sustainable growth and development of people, markets and our local environment. We realise this mission in the following ways organising and facilitating high-quality events that bring people and communities together and inspire them; being an ideal and attractive meeting place for everyone; working in a sustainable way and generating economic and social value. In short: 'inspiring people'. Strategy strengthening core business & Our strategic goals help RAI Amsterdam achieve its ambitions. Until 2022 these are: social balance Strengthening our core business by realising growth in events and communities. We increase our sustainability for the future by addressing changing client demands and aiming for even greater flexibility and cost-effectiveness; Creating an optimal balance in social costs & gains to increase our social value. We integrate corporate social responsibility (CSR) in our operational management, constantly interact with our stakeholders, are valuable and indispensable to the city of Amsterdam and provide a substantial contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals, relative to the company size. 66 We have defined six pillars to achieve these goals: Client solutions We provide our clients with an even better service by constantly expanding our service portfolio. Portfolio development We work on the (continued) development, purchasing and acquisition of (new) titles, focusing on businessto-business events both in Amsterdam and abroad. Data & digitalisation We apply technological developments to create value for our clients and work more efficiently. We also use it to develop new business models. Multifunctional area development We are a meeting point for everyone. Our unique location in the heart of Amsterdam facilitates corporate and spontaneous meetings alike. RAI Amsterdam should be an attractive environment, before, during and after events. Building & infrastructure We offer an accessible and safe place for valuable meetings. We increase the available square metres of exhibition space within the existing options and substantially improve logistics and traffic management. The location is fully equipped for business and leisure. A learning organisation We challenge ourselves to constantly work in smarter ways and ensure an optimal working environment for our employees. Sustainable business minimising negative impacts, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is an integral part of RAI Amsterdam’s strategy and has increasing social value even been embedded in our mission: the RAI aims to stimulate the sustainable development of people, markets and society. We work with our clients and suppliers to integrate CSR in our business on a daily basis. Proud that many activities make a social contribution, we also realise that our business uses natural resources, takes up space, produces noise and impact society in other ways. Via a constant dialogue with our stakeholders, we try to operate in a way that is experienced as sustainable by society. We do this by: Minimising/neutralising the negative social impact of our business as much as possible. We aim to create a sustainable environment in which we can facilitate valuable meetings, now and in the future. This includes constantly increasing the sustainability of our facilities, products, services and operational processes and focusing on the reduction and management of logistic movements around the RAI. We also help organisers realise their events in the RAI in a sustainable and responsible manner. Increasing the social value of the business wherever possible. We actively aim for the development and growth of the people and communities with which our business crosses paths. For example, we stimulate the local economy by attracting visitors to the city who then stay in the region. Where possible we work with local suppliers and stimulate a safe learning, working and living environment. With the events we organise, we also actively try to stimulate the sustainable growth and development of the sector in which the relevant exhibition operates by putting the spotlight on social challenges on the exhibition floor. We also work actively on organising/facilitating meaningful meetings that contribute to the growth and development of (vulnerable groups in) society, with a special focus on the Amsterdam Metropolitan Region. 68 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Global UN goals SDG RAI strategy 8 Work and economic growth We stimulate business and create spinoff via the growth of our core activities 9 Industry, innovation and Our events and operational management provide a platform for industry, innovation and infrastructure infrastructure 11 Sustainable cities and communities We create value for the city of Amsterdam 12 Responsible consumption and As an early adopter of proven technology/processes, we help build a circular economy and production climate action 13 Climate action See 12 17 Partnerships Meetings in the RAI contribute to partnerships to achieve the SDGs Brand values RAI Amsterdam has the following six brand values.

Based on the RAI’s promise to stimulate valuable meetings, sustainable growth and the development of people, markets and our environment, we want to actively contribute to the growth and development of (vulnerable groups in) society. We will facilitate and/or organise meaningful meetings in which we voluntarily provide expertise, manpower, facilities and/or networks for local society, with a special focus on the Amsterdam Metropolitan Region. 70 71 Personnel and organisation CULTURAL AND STRUCTRAL CHANGE RAI management and staff have been involved in intensive cultural and structural changes over the past two years. The departmental structure was abandoned and the entire organisation reorganised in five company divisions (Marketing & Digital, Commerce, Clients, Venue and Operations) and supporting departments (such as HR, ICT and Finance) working together in three main processes (events, innovation and management). All RAI managers followed an intensive leadership trajectory and were enhanced their skills via training courses. BUSY 2018 PLUS STRUCTURAL CHANGE VISIBLE IN EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION Employee satisfaction is at 81%. Absence through illness increased to 3.2%. While these figures are good in relative terms, they are clearly less positive compared to previous years. SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE HR POLICY The RAI has a socially responsible and sustainable HR policy focused on the well-being, vitality and lifestyle of its personnel. STRATEGIC PERSONNEL PLANNING In 2018 the RAI carried out research into strategic personnel planning as part of a project that will be finalised in 2019. Our employees ‘for people, by people' RAI Amsterdam is a company for people, by people. Our employees are the outward face of the RAI and function as hosts during events. The RAI realises its company goals in large part by empowering its employees with responsibilities, streamlining their tasks and enabling them to make the most of their talents. Employee satisfaction overall employee satisfaction: Employee satisfaction is a crucial yardstick and an important instrument for the continuous 81% improvement of our company. The RAI undertakes a major survey of employee satisfaction every two years: the last time this took place was in late 2018. The goal of the survey is to map the experience of the employees and their suggestions for improvement. With this input we can move towards increasing the satisfaction, involvement and enthusiasm of our staff. In 2016 the RAI scored extremely high with a percentage of 91%. In 2018 the general satisfaction among employees had fallen to 81%. The rating of the direct managers was the same, but most others were slightly lower, including the satisfaction regarding activities, working conditions, development opportunities and the organisation as a whole. The lower marks can probably be attributed to the fact that 2018 was a very busy year. 72 Multi-year cultural and structural transformation of the company changes in culture and The RAI started transforming the way it is organised in the summer of 2016. A change to the structure go hand in hand corporate culture was seen as an important step in staying successful in the long term and continuing to innovate sufficiently. There were also several processes that were ripe for improvement and bottlenecks which needed to be removed. A structural change was initiated to achieve these improvements and the planned process involves changes to both the culture and structure of the company. abandoning the departmental In 2017 the RAI was still organised in a departmental structure with two main divisions: RAI structure Exhibitions and RAI Convention Centre. Over the course of 2017, the new management team worked together with the RAI’s employees to move from a structure divided into departments toward a process-oriented structure. three core processes as the Each new organisational segment has its own responsibility with regards to the RAI’s three core red thread processes: EVENT Events are leading in all our activities; Each department provides a contribution (direct or indirect) to events; The organisation and tasks are set up in a way that ensures that the interests of departments are subordinated to the event process; The RAI works with a single uniform event process during both its own and third-party events. INNOVATION Innovation is a responsibility of the business; The focus needs to shift from pioneering instead of merely improving; It is crucial to increase the value of meetings; Innovation specialists support the business and stimulate the process; We focus on short cyclical steps by initiating small projects; We work outside-in by bringing in external knowledge. To make this happen, we are continuously expanding our innovation ecosystem. MANAGEMENT including new business, HR, IT, etc.) New business fills and manages the pipeline of new initiatives. In this context, the RAI aims to have an open partnership with third parties; The new business process is managed and given substance at discussion meetings where departments and experts jointly make choices and bring together results; Portfolio Management, Revenue Management and Capacity Management are active on a tactical level. Portfolio Management coordinates the event portfolio while Revenue 73 Management optimises turnover and Capacity Management prevents bottlenecks; RAI services ensure a smooth and efficient handling of demand; The costs of RAI services (fixed and variable) are passed on to the relevant event; We use a uniform reporting structure for all events. consequences of structural We have been working on translating these starting points into a new structure throughout 2017. changes Around the turn of the year 2017/2018 the changes became concrete for most employees and most process changes were implemented. switching over to the event The new organisational configuration of the RAI went live on 1 February 2018. The new process process organisation did not apply to events that took place within three months of this date. The company reorganisation involved scores of internal moves, which took place over February 2018. This was preceded by an adaptation of the Elicium (floors 6-9) and Amtrium (floors 3-4). many activities related to In 2018 the RAI agenda listed many activities in the framework of the ‘We are on’ internal change cultural and structural changes programme, including: Change Leadership (team sessions for managers); Fishbowl sessions (open meetings with employees); Leader Days; Various brainstorming sessions; Activation of the seven habits: the habits of RAI employees that represent the desired culture and behaviour. In 2018 we also prepared a strategy activation programme called 'Museum of the Future’ in which the RAI used a space in which teams and departments are stimulated to start a dialogue on the determined strategy. The museum opened its doors in February 2019. evaluation process event table The event table, an important link in the new process, was evaluated in 2018. It brings together all people involved in an event. The process ensures that people are involved in decisions at an early stage, can contribute their expertise to the innovation of the event and translate decisions made to the event table for their own departments. The evaluation brought forth over 250 recommendations and points for further improvement. One of the strategic pillars of the RAI for the period up to and including 2022 is to be a learning organisation. This means that more evaluations will take place and that commenting on what is not going well in the organisation will be anchored in the cooperation between all RAI departments. 74 Development and setup of compliance function setup of compliance function In late 2018, the RAI started to set up a compliance function. started late 2018 RAI Amsterdam aims to comply with all the statutory and licence-related requirements and guidelines that apply to the organisation. We also wish to comply with and work in accordance with the standards and guidelines that the RAI itself determined are relevant. Moreover, we aim to minimise the risks of non-compliance as much as possible and apply a very low tolerance in this regard. To meet these demands, the RAI is setting up a compliance management system. In this process, we are led as much as possible by the starting points and principles as defined in the ISO 19600 standard for compliance management. Significant starting points include: A goal-oriented, structured approach in a continuous process; A defined scope and a risk-analysis based prioritisation within the context of the specific characteristics of the RAI organisation; A clear division and appointment of tasks and responsibilities with a leading and closely involved role for upper management; A cyclic process that enables the RAI to be a learning organisation; Focus on culture and behaviour in line with the core values and seven habits principle; Transparency on the compliance approach and the way non-compliance is dealt with. Mobility survey mobility survey among In the framework of commuting and mobility issues around the Zuidas district, we performed a employees small survey into the transport preferences of RAI employees. Seventeen employees who commute by car or public transport participated and over 450 trips were monitored. The speed, comfort and flexibility were shown to be the most important aspects. The main benefit of commuting by public transport is how relaxed it is for the traveller, while the car was the preferred mode of transport, except on busy days. The RAI will be using the results as input for the future mobility policy. Training and education extensive training and An extensive training and education plan was implemented based on the findings and improvement education plan deployed proposals from the work floor. Employees and managers participated in job and/or disciplinespecific training courses in 2018. There was also a simulation game which considered various situations in the new event process. In addition, a basic Finance course took place in 2018 focusing on the management process, as did an Innovation Bootcamp. There were also Agile and LEAN workshops as well as a range of inspiration sessions looking at the innovation and new business process. 75 Vitality initiating, facilitating and RAI Amsterdam aims to promote the vitality of its employees so that they can be fit, energetic and promoting fitness campaigns healthy at work. A dedicated programme initiates, facilitates and promotes vitality campaigns among employees. A variety of tools, workshops and campaigns were offered under the ‘RAI Vitaal’ framework to help employees in the field of health & fitness, stress & absenteeism prevention, and work enjoyment & work-life balance. In 2018, training courses were offered on topics such as sleep, exercise, food and relaxation. Sports were also a part of the initiative, with courses given three times a week in bootcamp, kickboxing and HIIT training. The work in 2018 was based on the results of the Vitality Scan and the Periodical Medical Survey which took place among RAI Amsterdam employees in 2016 and 2017. Diversity diverse teams; target for The RAI strives to ensure the diversity of its departments in terms of age, experience, gender and Talent to the Top charter competencies. RAI Amsterdam is convinced that diverse teams have a positive influence on reached and surpassed results. With 56% women and 44% men among its employees, RAI Amsterdam has a balanced staff. Moreover, the objective in the field of gender diversity as described in the Talent to the Top charter has been amply achieved: the share of women in the policy team and second echelon of managers is 41%. 76 Composition of personnel Below are some cross-sections of the composition of the RAI’s employees. Personnel At the end of the year 2018 2017 EMPLOYEES Male 193 46% 181 44% Female 230 54% 228 56% Total 423 100% 409 100% FTE Male 190.0 48% 178.2 47% Female 202.0 52% 197.9 53% Total 392.0 100% 376.1 100% Personnel by age Percentage/FTE (at the end of the year) 2018 2017 BY AGE 25 and under 1% 2% 26 to 35 25% 26% 36 to 45 32% 34% 46 to 55 28% 24% 56+ 14% 13% Total 100% 100% 77 Personnel by discipline Percentage/FTE (at the end of the year) 2018 2017 BY DISCIPLINE Commercial 48% 53% Operational 39% 35% Financial/management 13% 12% Total 100% 100% Strategic personnel planning further improvement and In 2018, the RAI worked on further improving its strategic personnel planning. The objective of the embedding in HR and project was to implement an adequate functional and practical method that could be integrated department processes within the normal HR and department processes. Starting points were formulated, a training course was held and a gap & bottleneck analysis was carried out. The results of the project, including the strategic personnel plan, are expected during 2019. Absence due to illness 3.2% The absence due to illness rate in 2018 was 3.2%. While this is a good score, it is unfortunately higher than the even better score of 2.5% in 2017 and equivalent to the level last seen in 2015. The high degree of activity around events, combined with changes in company structure and culture, doubtless played a part in this rise. Absence due to illness Percentage 2018 2017 2015 2014 2013 Total 3.2% 2.5% 2.9% 3.2% 3.4% Social engagement more opportunities for The HR policy related to social engagement reflects an aim to generate a greater social return for unemployed youth and people the city of Amsterdam. In 2018, RAI Amsterdam took part in a range of major initiatives which strive with occupational disabilities to create better opportunities for unemployed youth (work agreement for tackling youth unemployment) and people with occupational disabilities. more opportunities for young RAI Amsterdam has been participating in the work agreement for tackling youth unemployment people since 2015. We increase opportunities for unemployed youth by offering the following: Deployment and training of around 4,200 flexible workers: opportunities include participating in hospitality courses or obtaining traffic controller certificates; 78 Tours: some 300 students from various schools visit the RAI each year to learn about this type of work environment; Ninety internships: the RAI’s internal traineeship office places students from the intermediate and higher vocational (MBO and HBO) levels in BBL (vocational learning track), BOL (vocational training) and combined work/education structures. The trainees learn about topics such as job applications, personal branding, time management and Office skills. We organise a RAI Discovery process at the start of the traineeship as well, an introductory day during which the students visit the entire company. Later on, trainees can participate in a DiscoverRAI structure, where they spend a day in other departments to gain knowledge and expand their skillset. charities The social involvement of RAI Amsterdam and its employees is also illustrated by the various charities they support. In the spotlight: Event Operations Management helps the Food Bank The department excursion of Event Operations Management on 24 May was entirely dedicated to the Food Bank. There is a major distribution point on Lutmastraat, a stone’s throw away from the RAI, where some 150 people pick up a package every week. The department enthusiastically carried out the tasks requested by the Food Bank. The supplies and materials collected by the RAI team, from food to refrigerators, should provide substantial help to the Food Bank in its mission. Cooperation with the RAI works council frequent and constructive As in previous years, there was frequent and constructive dialogue with the works council in 2018. dialogue In addition to the structural changes in the company and the cultural evolution that accompanied them, the diverse topics discussed included the financial results, construction developments, consent requests, innovation, new business and working conditions. In addition to these formal consultations, the dialogue continued in a number of subcommittees, such as the HRM Committee, the Financial Committee, the Working Conditions Committee, the Terms of Employment Committee, the Pensions Committee and the Temps Committee. 79 Prospects Market, events International business exhibitions and congresses are clearly growing. The revitalisation and development of events for the Dutch public remains a challenge, although good results were achieved here too in 2018. On balance, the long-term outlook for RAI Amsterdam is positive while the expectations for 2019 are moderate in comparison with such a peak year as 2018. This fact has been taken into account in the multi-year forecast and the RAI expects to perform in accordance with that forecast. The RAI has a well-filled portfolio of events. Nonetheless, it will be a challenge to compensate for the added value lost after 2020, the last year in which ISE (Integrated Systems Europe) will be held at the RAI. Partly for this reason, developing and bringing in new events will be a major area of focus. While Dutch events are stabilising, everything points to international events continuing to expand. Sustainable innovations will increasingly become an important part of the content of events. The RAI will focus more on the contribution of its events to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Implementation of strategy The following activities are on our agenda for 2019: Portfolio development: organising sales to further meet customer needs, opening one or more offices abroad, optimising our annual agenda and strengthening event communication outside event periods; Customer solutions: developing more services and updating our range based on customer journey surveys while developing a new vision and a strategic plan in the field of stand construction; Digitisation: translating data products into commercial propositions such as matchmaking and solutions for lead generation; Multifunctional area design: completing our 2030 plan for area design, experimenting with temporary functions on the plinth (outside the ground floor) of the convention centre and continuing work on the design of area communication; Learning organisation: the implementation of a new phase in strategic personnel planning, the development of a vision on flexibly deployed workers and further work on safeguarding our cultural values; Building and infrastructure: further development of a vision on infrastructure together with the City of Amsterdam and the Zuidas organisation, renovation of hall 5, further integration of physical and digital safety & security, development of an innovative logistics concept for the future and deployment of external logistics hubs for dispersing freight traffic. 80 Developments in direct surroundings The construction of the convention hotel nhow Amsterdam RAI will be very visible, and the outdoor area will be structured. The building area will become a refined urban environment by the end of 2019. Organisation The programme-based approach to the culture and structure process will be further shaped by the executive team in 2019. Lastly As mentioned in the foreword, the Executive Board wishes to thank all stakeholders for their efforts and involvement. We are especially grateful to our employees, who have delivered truly impressive commercial and operational performances while working on the company strategy, culture and structure. We look forward to continuing to work with our teams in 2019 and aim to bring employee satisfaction back to its 2016 level in addition to achieving our operational objectives.

We recognise 13 strategic risks: S-1 exploitation risk: the loss of one of the RAI’s own major titles S-2 market development: letting to third parties S-3 traffic: the accessibility of RAI Amsterdam (city of Amsterdam, Schiphol) S-4 exploitation risk: the risk that a major third-party event is cancelled S-5 security: the risk of terrorism S-6 market development: the risk that our own concepts become smaller due to online business models S-7 [risk not made public for competition reasons] S-8 loss of outbound sales agents S-9 market development: limitation to growth of own events S-10 market development: exhibitors use other channels to reach their target groups in the future S-11 [risk not made public for competition reasons] S-12 licence to operate: the RAI cannot structurally balance social costs and benefits S-13 [risk not made public for competition reasons] The first five strategic risks have not changed since 2016, while the second five were added in 2017 and the last three in 2018. 88 financial/administrative risks Financial/administrative risks are linked to developments in financial markets and financial & administrative management. We recognise the following 11 financial/administrative risks: F-1 financing risk (including being unable to comply with bank agreements) F-2 interest risk F-3 currency risk F-4 debtor risk F-5 administrative organisation: integrity, availability, monitoring of automatic data processing and storage F-6 financial control F-7 cash flow risk F-8 potential excessive reimbursement of expenses (fiscal) F-9 accounting fraud F-10 risk related to activities abroad: different laws & regulations than in the Netherlands F-11 tax plan for 2019 The first 10 financial/administrative risks are unchanged since 2016, while the last one was added in 2018. 89 operational risks Operational risks are linked directly with operational activities. Nineteen operational risks are monitored by the RAI: O-1 safety while working in the halls O-2 construction risks: risks not covered by licenses that can occur when placing temporary installations and structures O-3 major health risks (legionella) O-4 hazardous substances O-5 hygiene and food O-6 product liability related to RAI services O-7 crowd control (e.g., in case of fire) O-8 failure of installations essential to an event (cooling, heating, power etc.) O-9 failure of in-house operational ICT systems (administration, operations) O-10 failure of event network for exhibitors O-11 growth in third-party demands on IT infrastructure and public services at RAI Amsterdam that is faster than our ability to upgrade/expand O-12 use of public infrastructure by organisers, exhibitors and/or visitors that differs from expectations, resulting in major disruptions O-13 privacy violations due to misuse of data O-14 data theft by hackers O-15 presence of asbestos in old building O-16 developments in the market and demands from the organisation which outpace the IT infrastructure O-17 lower profits from connectivity services O-18 damage to reputation (going viral via social media) O-19 inadequate ability to recruit sufficient numbers of quality personnel and flexible workers due to scarcity in the labour market The risk ‘nationwide strike’ was removed and the risk O-19 added in 2018. 90 Risk evaluation method current risk and consequences Evaluating the actual risks for RAI Amsterdam involves assessing both the current risk of an incident occurring and the current consequences (measured in financial terms) this might have on RAI Amsterdam. evaluation of risk impact The combination of the current risk and current consequences determines whether the current risk level is seen as low, medium or high. The evaluation explicitly takes into account the prevailing monitoring procedures and measures/actions taken to mitigate the relevant risk. The determination of risk and consequence is indicated in the matrix table. The letters in the matrix indicate the type of risk, with S representing strategic risks, O operational risks, and F financial/administrative risks. The associated numbers refer to the specific risks as described above. The colours represent the following risk levels: low (blue), medium (grey) and high (red). Risk matrix Likelihood and consequence determine level of risk Risk (%) >90%: S-4 extreme 75-90%: F-11 S-12 high O-19 S-13 50-75%: F-3 F-8 S-3 F-10 S-7 S-5 medium O-6 O-16 O-15 O-17 S-11 S-10 F-4 O-10 S-1 S-2 25-50%: S-6 S-9 O-1 O-13 O-8 low F-9 O-18 O-5 O-14 O-10 O-11 < 25%: S-8 F-5 F-6 O-3 F-1 O-7 very low F-7 O-2 O-4 F-2 insignificant minor moderate major severe < € 250,000 € 250,000 € 50 0,0 0 0 € 1,000,000 > € 2,500,000 € 500,000 € 1,000,000 € 2,500,000 Consequences (€) risk tolerance Given the desired financial resilience, the RAI has set its maximum tolerance for financial risk at €10 million. If an impact of this magnitude should manifest itself, RAI Amsterdam will have sufficient buffers to manage the consequences. risk management system The risk management approach has stayed the same in 2018 as in 2017. strengthening risk and At the end of 2018, RAI Amsterdam has made a start on further strengthening its risk and compliance management compliance management. The company wishes to set up a cyclical framework for this purpose based on the ISO 31000 and ISO 19600 principles and guidelines for risk and compliance 91 management. This will enable the RAI to improve the quality of its processes and make them even more goal-oriented while being a learning organisation. A risk and compliance position has been created in order to shape this process. The matrix shows that nine risks – seven strategic, one financial and one operational – are considered high. They are: S-4 exploitation risk: the risk that a major third-party event is cancelled S-5 security: the risk of terrorism S-7 [risk not made public for competition reasons] S-10 market development: exhibitors use other channels to reach their target groups in the future S-11 [risk not made public for competition reasons] S-12 licence to operate: the RAI cannot structurally balance social costs and benefits S-13 [risk not made public for competition reasons] F-11 tax plan for 2019 O-19 inadequate ability to recruit sufficient numbers of quality personnel and flexible workers due to scarcity in the labour market Discussed with the Supervisory Board The risks, internal risk management and control systems, along with the realised and planned actions, were discussed at the September meeting of the Supervisory Board. Functioning of internal risk management and control systems Below is an overview of the checks and actions undertaken related to the four risks with the largest potential impact on RAI Amsterdam. limiting risks related to third S-4 exploitation risk: the risk that a major third-party event is cancelled party events To prevent that a large exhibition or conference organised by a third party is cancelled (risk: very high, and in fact has occurred; consequences: severe) the relation management of the A accounts has been entrusted to the Executive Board. Where possible, long-term contracts are implemented. To minimise the consequences of the potential loss of a major third-party title on the results of RAI Amsterdam, priority in terms of both time and funds is given to attracting new exhibitions and conferences for the future. calamities S-5 security: the risk of terrorism RAI Amsterdam has a Safety & Security Board that monitors processes and, where necessary, adapts measures related to protection against calamities. S-10 market development: exhibitors use other channels to reach their target groups in the future This risk is being mitigated by intensifying innovation and product development. The RAI aims both to integrate new channels and connect them to exhibition titles, and to develop them autonomously so as to reach communities and inspire people. 92 S-12 licence to operate: the RAI cannot structurally balance social costs and benefits This risk is being mitigated by focusing on the balancing of social costs and benefits by making it one of the two core principles in the new strategy covering the period until and including 2022. F-11 tax plan for 2019 The RAI has an active lobbying policy and deploys mitigating measures where possible. O-19 inadequate ability to recruit sufficient numbers of quality personnel and flexible workers due to scarcity in the labour market Strategic personnel planning will provide more insight. The following measures are being assessed: policy development, new partnerships, department reinforcement and/or changes to how work is organised. share price risk There is no risk linked to share prices as RAI Holding BV does not hold any shares listed on the stock exchange. liquidity risk Liquidity risk refers to the danger of having insufficient funds to cover direct obligations. Active monitoring of cash flow and setting up of a multi-year forecast which assesses the cash flow and predicts available liquidity limits the risk here. RAI Holding BV has formulated measures which will lead to an immediate lowering of expenditures should the liquidity risk increase. uncertainty about the The current financing agreement will last until 2020. The uncertainty about the possibilities to possibilities to attract financing attract financing is being mitigated through the maintaining of an active relationship with providers of loan capital, a proven track record of maintaining the agreed ratios, and keeping to a clear strategy. The current financing agreement, which runs up until and including 2020, will be followed up in good time before it expires. financial instrument risk Risk linked to financial instruments is described in the financial statement in the section ‘notes on the consolidated annual account'. competition rules RAI Amsterdam has a tender board which assesses all purchase orders above a given threshold amount for compliance with regulations and, where necessary or desirable, formulates calls for tender. internal permit office RAI Amsterdam holds various event-related permits and certificates. A unique cooperation with the City of Amsterdam has meant that RAI Amsterdam is the first private company in the Netherlands to be given the authority to regulate and enforce event-related permits in a number of fields. To ensure compliance with legislation, RAI Amsterdam has an internal permit office which is charged with applying the policy and issuing and enforcing permits. tax legislation To ensure compliance with tax laws, RAI Amsterdam makes use of advisors – some of whom are affiliated with the accountant and some who are not – to assess RAI Amsterdam’s processing of tax legislation. The two most important types of tax for RAI Amsterdam are VAT and corporate tax. 93 #04 Statement from the Supervisory Board 94 2018: a bumper year Dear RAI stakeholders and readers of this report, The Executive Board opened its foreword to this report by stating that “2018 was the most profitable year in the RAI’s history”. The Supervisory Board would like to emphasise this point because such an impressive result is not something that just happens on its own. In 2018, employees and management organised and facilitated an exceptional number of events. Almost all of the recurring events have shown growth, and customer satisfaction levels were excellent. The traditionally quiet summer break was very short in 2018 and the usual maintenance had to be carried out in-between the events. Everyone in the company did a great job and deserves a huge compliment. Another thing that became clearer than ever in 2018 is that the partnership between the RAI and the city of Amsterdam is more than the sum of its parts. The combination of the two is appreciated by organisers, exhibitors and visitors – Dutch and international alike – as pleasant and unique. A key development in 2018 was that the company drew up and implemented concrete plans which focused more on added value produced for the city and its inhabitants. A major example is the future vision plan for 2030, in which strengthening the connection with the urban fabric is a key principle. The Supervisory Board fully supports this development and feels that, no matter how much international success the RAI experiences, its operations cannot be balanced if they do not comprise real added value for the people of Amsterdam. A development in 2018 that was not immediately visible to everyone were the many improvements made behind the scenes of the RAI organisation. Despite the hectic activity accompanying the many events, the company found the energy to continue building on its structural and cultural transformation started at the end of 2016. A strategy review was completed in the summer and a strategy adopted for the coming planning period. In short, 2018 was a bumper year. As such, it is important to remember that it was exceptional – according to the most recent forecast, turnover in 2019 will simply correspond to the normal long-term trend. Nonetheless, the Supervisory Board remains confident about the future. On behalf of the Supervisory Board, Roelf de Boer, chair 95 Annual report 2018 The Supervisory Board hereby presents the annual report of RAI Holding BV for 2018. The annual report was compiled by the Executive Board and includes the financial statement for 2017. Deloitte Accountants BV checked the financial statement and provided it with an approved audit statement. Our supervisory role The responsibilities of the Supervisory Board include internal supervision of the Executive Board and the general affairs of the company. This involves activities such as the monitoring of the achievement of intended results. The Supervisory Board makes use of two progress reports submitted by the Executive Board: the year-to-date results (YTD) and the report to shareholders. The discussion of these reports is regularly on the agenda of both the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board. The report to shareholders follows non-financial goals as well as financial reports. In addition to following reports, the Executive Board transmits to every meeting of the Supervisory Board a business update that looks at the most important occurrences related to customers, markets and events. In 2018, the Supervisory Board discussed the topics explained below. Each paragraph indicates whether the discussions were first prepared in a Supervisory Board committee: AC stands for Audit Committee, SC for Selection & Appointment Committee and RC for Remuneration Committee. Strategy Based on various updates, the Executive Board involved the Supervisory Board in the process which extended the vision and strategy from the planning period up until and including 2018 to the planning period following it. The Supervisory Board approved the company strategy for 2019-2022 over the summer (AC); Safety and security The Supervisory Board has had comprehensive discussions with the Executive Board about the way in which the security of the RAI is approached. Both physical and virtual security (AC) were considered in this process. The RAI has made major investments to improve the safety and security of its building complex. The process was monitored by the Supervisory Board, which is satisfied with the results achieved in 2018 and endorses the sustained attention to and prioritisation of safety and security (AC). During the breakdown of an exhibition, an employee of a preferred supplier working at the RAI fell 1.5 metres down from a ladder and died as a result of a serious brain injury. The Supervisory Board discussed this tragic accident, the impact it had on employees and 96 stakeholders, and the investigations that followed, with the Executive Board (AC). The Supervisory Board has discussed developments around the floors in the Amtrium which consist of BubbleDeck prefab slabs – these slabs were shown by a countrywide study in 2017 to possibly be insufficiently adhesive. The internal RAI investigation has now been completed (AC). The Supervisory Board has discussed the claim received from employees of a company who were involved in an asbestos incident in 2016 (AC). Business Each Supervisory Board meeting provided an update to the Executive Board which discussed shows, commercial developments, acquisitions and similar topics. In 2018, there were also discussions about network activities abroad, and innovations such as wayfinding, matchmaking and lead generation were considered in the updates. Financial The evolution of turnover and costs has been thoroughly reviewed. The turnover in 2018 was clearly above the policy outline, while 2019 is expected to be in line with the long-term forecast (AC). The 2019 budget has been discussed and determined, with the total amount being lower than in 2018 (AC). There was an exchange of views with the Executive Board about the dividend policy from 2019 onwards, partly in relation to the intended disposal of its shares by the City of Amsterdam. The dividend policy will be put into practice in 2019 (AC). The budgeting precision has been evaluated. A discussion was held on ambition versus prudence in establishing the budgets and the related policy. (AC). The tax plan for 2018 has been discussed, with particular reference to the depreciation of buildings in terms of value under the Valuation of Immovable Property Act and the impact of this on the budget (AC). The Executive Board reported on discussions with the municipality about the tax assessment notice under the Valuation of Immovable Property Act (AC); The list of debtors and policy related to debtors as well as changes in the positions and measures adopted by the Executive Board have been discussed (AC). A new management report has been reviewed. The report was found to be a better fit for the new organisational model. The development of a new financial dictionary has also been discussed (AC). It was established that the distribution test and balance sheet test have been prepared (AC). A review of financing has taken place. A refinancing is due in 2020. This was discussed by the Supervisory Board, which considered its timing, among other things (AC). Risk management RAI Amsterdam has systems for risk analysis and control, and periodically informs the Supervisory Board of risk-related developments via the Audit Committee. The risk aspects of relevant topics are also explicitly mentioned by the Executive Board for all matters where a 97 decision of the Supervisory Board is requested. The Audit Committee has indicated to the Supervisory Board that the Executive Board has correctly estimated the risks. The Supervisory Board agrees with the indicated risks and estimated consequences. The Executive Board has clarified this risk analysis in the Governance and Risk Management section of this report (AC). The Supervisory Board has spoken to the Executive Board about the signature of an 'in control' statement by policy team members. This has led to the execution of a compliance audit and establishment of a compliance steering group. This process will eventually lead to the formulation of an 'in control' statement (AC). An entire Supervisory Board meeting has been devoted to the impact on the RAI of the announced departure of ISE from 2021 onwards. Options and measures against fraud, phishing and unauthorised payments have been discussed, as was the password policy (AC). Governance and compliance Corporate governance in general and the rules of procedure of the Audit Committee have been evaluated and remained unchanged (AC). The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been discussed, as have the measures taken to comply with it (AC). The tendering process for the appointment of a new accountant has been discussed. Deloitte has since been selected (AC). Our advisory/sounding board role In its advisory role, the Supervisory Board acts as a sparring partner for the Executive Board. A range of topics have been discussed both within the Supervisory Board and with the Executive Board, and advice and comments provided. A major topic of consultation was the progress in the sale by the City of Amsterdam of its shares in the RAI, and the position, interests and involvement of the company regarding this process. Our employer role The Supervisory Board has discussed the following topics based on its employer role: Executive Board The evaluation interviews of the two members of the Executive Board for 2018 took place in March 2019 (RC). The Supervisory Board has prepared a remuneration report for 2018 for the shareholders, which explains both the remuneration policy and its implementation in 2018 (RC). 98 Organisation The evolution in FTEs has been considered, especially in light of the lower budget in 2019 (SC). The process and the results of strategic personnel planning were discussed with the Executive Board (SC). The progress of the structural and cultural changes has been looked at. This included an evaluation of the event process and the transfer of the management of the process from an external agency to an in-house department (SC). The analysis of the gender equality policy with regards to salaries has been discussed. Remuneration of men and women is not entirely equal across the RAI. The difference is explained by the duration of the employment and job periods during which the individual employees are active. The Supervisory Board will continue to follow the ratio and is satisfied by the manner in which this topic has been assessed (SC). The vitality figures and changes implemented to promote vitality have been considered (SC). The vacancy for the position of HR manager has been looked at, including the recruitment process (SC). The Executive Board has informed the Supervisory Board of the staff party, including the manner in which it will integrate the closing of the first phase of the cultural and structural transformation (SC). Supervisory Board The preparation and execution of the annual Supervisory Board evaluation has been discussed and the results of the evaluation were discussed with the person who drew up the evaluation report (SC). The Supervisory Board commissioned a benchmark study into remuneration by FocusOrange. In accordance with the resulting recommendations, the Supervisory Board has decided to propose to the general meeting to increase the remuneration of the chair. The general meeting has indicated that it will consider this in its March or April 2019 session. General meeting The general meeting was held on 10 April 2018 and the topics considered included: the annual report 2017 determination of the dividend for 2017 the annual plan for 2018 (including budget) the shareholder report the process of the sale of its shares by the City of Amsterdam appointment of the new accountant progress in the cultural and structural transformation state of affairs regarding BubbleDeck floors (see above) the RAI’s new construction plans in the framework of its vision for 2030 99 the sponsor policy The general meeting discharged the Supervisory Board for its supervision and the Executive Board for its management. The entire Supervisory Board and Executive Board were present at the general meeting. About the Supervisory Board Composition of the Supervisory Board and its committees The Supervisory Board formatively consists of five members and had four on 1 January 2018. The appointment of a member on the recommendation of the City of Amsterdam as shareholder has been postponed due to its intention to sell its shares. There were no changes in the membership of the Supervisory Board in 2018 nor its composition. The personal details of members, including their membership of Supervisory Board committees, are indicated in the section ‘In Brief’ under ‘Composition of Supervisory Board and Executive Board’. There were no changes to the composition of the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee or the Selection & Appointment Committee in 2018. In 2018, the Supervisory Board proposed reappointing John van der Steen for a period of two years from April 2019. Although Mr Van der Steen’s second four-year term is ending, the Supervisory Board made this recommendation due to his knowledge of longstanding issues, including the sale of its shares by the City of Amsterdam. Exemption All Supervisory Board and Executive Board members have been declared exempt by the company. Consultations between Supervisory Board and committees The Supervisory Board held four scheduled meetings in 2018. Each meeting was attended by all the members of the Supervisory Board, the members of the Executive Board, the financial director and the company secretary. In addition to the normal meetings, an informal session was organised at the home of a Supervisory Board member and a meeting was held dedicated entirely to the announced departure of ISE. All members of committees attended the meetings of each committee. In other words, each member was present 100% of the time. Pre-consultation between the Supervisory Board members usually takes place prior to the normal meetings. In addition, the members of the Supervisory Board keep in contact where necessary outside of the meetings. In addition to the abovementioned meetings with the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board has also met in closed sessions. Topics discussed during these meetings included the sale of shares, the vision and strategy and the occupancy notification. The chair of the Supervisory Board and the CEO met regularly to discuss progress on various topics in 2018. 100 The members of the Supervisory Board separately visited several RAI events throughout the year to stay up to date with the operations and recent developments. The Audit Committee prepares the Supervisory Board’s decision-making and advises the Supervisory and Executive Boards of its findings in fields such as finance, internal risk management & control systems, risk analysis, applications of information technology (IT) and the activities and recommendations of the accountant. The Audit Committee held a total of five meetings during 2018, one of which was over the telephone. The committee members, the CEO and the financial director attended all meetings, while the COO attended most. The concept report of the Audit Committee was a fixed agenda item in each subsequent meeting of the Supervisory Board. In all these meetings the Supervisory Board received advice on the decisions to be taken by the Supervisory Board as prepared by the Audit Committee. The chair of the Audit Committee and the financial director met regularly during the year under review to discuss the progress of various matters. The task of the Remuneration Committee includes making proposals to the Supervisory Board and preparing accountability regarding the recommended remuneration policy and the actual remuneration of the members of the company’s Executive Board. The Remuneration Committee met four times in 2018. The task of the Selection and Appointment Committee includes drawing up selection criteria and appointment procedures for members of the Supervisory and Executive Boards, assessing the size and composition of both boards and making proposals on the profile of the Supervisory Board at least once a year, reviewing the functioning of individual Supervisory and Executive Board members and reporting on it to the Supervisory Board at least once a year, making suggestions for appointments and reappointments, and supervising the policy of the Executive Board with regards to selection criteria and appointment procedures for senior management. The Selection and Appointment Committee met four times in 2018. Annual report and financial statement for 2018 The Audit Committee has discussed the financial statement and annual report with the Executive Board and the external accountant Deloitte at length. The Supervisory Board then discussed the annual report with the Executive Board. The Supervisory Board accepts the financial statement and agrees with the Executive Board’s proposal to pay a dividend of €2.356 million including dividend tax over the year, and add the remaining profit to ‘unappropriated profit’ under shareholder equity. The dividend was determined in accordance with the 2013-2018 dividend policy, established at the General Meeting on 17 April 2014. The 2018 financial statement will be presented for approval to the general meeting of shareholders on 16 April 2019. The Supervisory Board proposes that the financial statement be approved, that the Executive Board be given discharge for its management and that the Supervisory Board be 101 given discharge for its supervision. In conclusion As mentioned in the foreword to this report, the Supervisory Board would like to thank the employees and the Executive Board for their efforts in 2018. We are also grateful to all stakeholders for their involvement. Amsterdam, 26 March 2019 Supervisory Board of RAI Holding BV R.H. (Roelf) de Boer, chair J. W. Th.

The entity did not realise any turnover or costs in recent years. The assets and liabilities of Amsterdam RAI Catering BV were nil. Functional currency The items in the annual accounts of the group companies are valued in accordance with the currency of the economic environment in which the group company mainly performs its activities (the functional currency). The consolidated annual accounts were drawn up in euros; the functional and presentation currency of RAI Holding BV. Transactions, receivables and liabilities Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the exchange rates at the time of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are converted into the functional currency at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. The resulting translation differences are included in the profit and loss account, unless hedge accounting is applied. Non-monetary assets that are valued in a foreign currency at acquisition cost are converted at the exchange rates valid at the time of transaction Non-monetary assets valued in a foreign currency at the current value are converted at the exchange rates which applied at the time the current value was determined. Translation differences in long-term inter-group loans which are actually an expansion or reduction of the net investment of foreign participations will be credited or charged directly to the equity in the statutory translation differences reserve. If loans were entered into in a foreign currency to finance or cover the net investment in a foreign participation, the translation differences that result from the loan will be processed in the statutory translation differences reserve insofar as the loan is effective as coverage for the translation differences on the net investment in the foreign participation. The assets and liabilities of the participations included in the consolidation at a functional currency that is different than the presentation currency will be converted at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. The profits and losses are converted at the exchange rates at the time of transaction. The resulting translation differences will be credited or charged directly to the equity in the statutory translation differences reserve. 111 Use of estimates In order to help determine the included figures when drawing up the annual accounts, the management of RAI Holding BV makes certain estimates and suppositions in accordance with the generally accepted principles of financial reporting. The factual results can deviate from these estimates. The estimates and underlying suppositions are regularly evaluated. Revisions of estimates are recorded in the period in which the estimate is revised and in future periods that are affected by the revision. Financial tools Financial tools include both primary financial tools such as receivables or debts, and financial derivatives. For the principles of the primary financial tools, see the description per balance sheet item. RAI Holding BV applies hedge accounting based on documentation for each individual hedge relation, and documents how the hedge relations fit in with the goals of the risk management, hedge strategy and the expectations regarding the effectiveness of the hedge. The effective part of the financial derivatives assigned to cost-price hedge-accounting is valuated at cost value and the ineffective part is valuated at fair value. The valuation changes of the fair value of the ineffective part are immediately processed in the profit and loss account. Principles for the valuation of assets and liabilities The assets and liabilities are valued at nominal value unless the notes for the individual items indicate otherwise. Intangible fixed assets Externally obtained exhibition titles are valued at cost price or market value if lower, and are depreciated over their economic life, which is assumed to be 20 years at most. The economic life for the IBEX exhibition title is assumed to be 15 years at most. Software is valued at historic cost and is depreciated over its economic life, which is assumed to be ten years at most. Operating rights are valued at acquisition price and depreciated annually based on the term of these rights. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are valued at their acquisition price, minus straight-line depreciation based on their economic life and minus any special depreciation. Maintenance costs for buildings owned are immediately charged to the results, or entered as assets and depreciated if the asset criteria allow it. The depreciation calculation takes the residual value into account. This residual value is expected to be nil in all cases. Financial fixed assets 112 Participating interests over which significant control is exercised over their business and financial policy are stated at their net asset value determined on the basis of the accounting principles of RAI Holding BV Participating interests over which no significant control is exercised are stated at the acquisition price or current value if lower. Receivables from and loans to participating interests as well as other receivables are stated at the fair value in the first processing, and then valued at the amortised cost minus the necessary provisions. Special depreciation of fixed assets An evaluation is made each year to see whether there are any indications that intangible, tangible or financial fixed assets are subject to special depreciation. Special depreciations apply when the balance sheet value of the asset is higher than the realisable value. In case of special depreciation, the relevant asset is devalued to the realisable value. The loss is immediately processed as expense in the profit and loss accounts. Receivables Receivables are stated at the fair value in the first processing, and then valued at the amortised cost, which is the same as the nominal value minus any provisions for doubtful debts. These provisions are determined based on an individual assessment of the receivables. The receivables have an expected term of up to one year, unless stated otherwise. Stock The stock mainly involves food & beverage products of which the valuation is determined at acquisition costs, minus a provision for obsolescence, where necessary. Securities Securities are stated at their cost or market value on the balance sheet date, whichever is the lower. The market value is in principle equal to the value quoted on the stock exchange. If a sale is expected in the short term, the directly realisable value is considered the market value. Liquidities Liquidities are at the disposal of the company. Provisions Provisions are included for all rightful enforceable or factual obligations resulting from an event before the balance sheet date, which are expected to require an export of capital for the fulfilment thereof and of which the scope can be reliably estimated. A provision for long-service payments is included based on the valid long-service scheme per balance sheet date, taking into account the likelihood of continued employment, future labour cost developments and discount provisions. A provision is included for bonus schemes and participations based on relevant performance schemes. This provision is included under current liabilities. Pension provision The company has two active pension schemes for its employees. Employees who started working for the company before 1 January 2013 are subject to a pension provision that qualifies as a defined benefit plan, in which the defined pension payments are based on average pay. This pension scheme has been placed with a pension insurer, and is processed in the financial statement as a defined 113 contribution scheme due to the fact that the obligations for realising this pension scheme are entirely reinsured. Employees who started working for the company since 1 January 2013 or those who have voluntary switched to the new pension scheme are subject to a premium scheme with the nature of a defined contribution agreement in which the company obligations are limited to making an annual contribution to the insurance company. Future payable contributions will partly depend on the development of the employment conditions and the yield on the invested contributions achieved by the insurer. Long-term liabilities Long-term liabilities include debts with a remaining term of over one year. These debts are stated at the fair value in the first processing, and then valued at the amortised cost. Current liabilities Current liabilities are stated at their fair value in the first processing and then at the amortised costs. They have an expected term of less than one year. A provision is included for bonus schemes and participations based on relevant performance schemes. There is also a provision included for contractual agreements with employees. (Deferred) corporation tax Temporary differences between the determination of profit for commercial and tax purposes are stated at their nominal value in the balance sheet as a tax deferral or asset. Deferred claims for corporation tax on account of tax-deductible losses are valued at the future tax rate known on the balance sheet date in so far as it can reasonably be expected that the claims are realisable. RAI Holding BV is the leading company of a group that is treated as a single entity for tax purposes. The other members of the group are: RAI Amsterdam BV, RAI Solar Energy BV and Arfora BV. Principles for determination of results Revenue The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the historical cost convention. The revenue recognition applies to all categories as specified under 2.1.1. The net turnover includes the revenue from the delivery of goods and services as specified under 2.1.1 minus discounts and the like, and turnover taxes. Revenue and expenses are accounted for in the period in which the activity is performed. For exhibitions and events this is the period in which the event takes place. Profits are accounted for in that period. Losses and risks that originated before the end of the financial year are processed if and insofar as they became known before the annual accounts were drawn up. For participations in which the RAI plays a deciding role, the revenue and expenses are consolidated proportionally. For participations in which the RAI does not play a deciding role, the result attributable to RAI Holding BV is included. Costs for outsourced work Costs for outsourced work and other external costs involve the direct and indirect costs, including purchasing costs of sold catering stock that can be attributed to the turnover. Depreciation The depreciation on tangible fixed assets is calculated on a linear basis by reference to the expected economic life. 114 The applied depreciation rates are between 2% and 20%. The depreciation of the intangible fixed assets is related to the acquisition value, and ranges between 5% and 20%. Possible residual values of tangible and/or intangible fixed assets are not taken into account. Financial revenue and expenditure The financial revenue and expenditure involve the translation differences, interest revenue and costs attributable to the period concerned. Participating interest results The participating interest results concern the share of the company in the results of the net asset value of the participating interests. The share that the company is due is stated as the result of a specific participating interest in the participating interest results. Corporation tax The corporation tax is calculated on the commercial pre-tax profit, taking into account the tax facilities. The mutation in the provision for deferred corporation tax is taken into account in the calculations. It is continuously evaluated whether the financial reporting should or could be adapted in the framework of new fiscal legislation. Cash flow statement The cash flow statement has been drawn up in accordance with the indirect method. The resources in the cash flow statement consist of liquidities. Comparative figures To ensure transparency and comparability, the comparative figures over 2017 have been adjusted. The adjustment involves the categorisation of various items in the profit and loss accounts. The adjustments do not affect the balance sheet. The adjustments in categorisation involve the re-categorisation of the costs for outsourced work and other external costs to the turnover at an amount of € 1.1 million and a re-categorisation of the costs for outsourced work and other external costs to the other operational costs (including other personnel costs) at an amount of € 3.8 million. 115 Notes on the consolidated balance sheet as on 31 December 2018 1.1.1.

This credit agreement comprises an overdraft facility of €30 million as well as two loans totalling €48 million (50% Deutsche Bank AG and 50% Coöperatieve Rabobank Amsterdam U.A.) until 2020. In 2016 the RAI established an additional credit facility with Deutsche Bank AG and Coöperatieve Rabobank Amsterdam U.A., consisting of a current account of US$ 6.7 million at Coöperatieve Rabobank Amsterdam U.A. As part of this agreement, it was agreed that the current account of Coöperatieve Rabobank Amsterdam U.A. is reduced by €3 million and the current account of Deutsche Bank AG is increased by €3 million. This way both banks are a 50% credit provider. The current account of US$ runs until 2020 and is reduced every six months by US$ 831,250 as of 1 July 2018. The rate of interest on the loans is Euribor + 1.70%. In 2013 the RAI entered into an interest swap agreement, based on which RAI Holding BV pays an interest rate of 1.54% over an amount of € 40 million. 119 The business premises at Europaplein have been mortgaged as security for the repayment of the long-term debts and overdraft facility. A credit agreement with the Triodos Bank for the financing of solar panels was concluded in 2014. It consists of a loan of €0.29 million for the period until 1 January 2034. The loan is being repaid in 79 quarterly terms, starting 1 July 2014. The interest rate is 3.5% on an annual basis for the period until 17 January 2026. A credit agreement to finance solar panels was concluded with the Amsterdam Investment Fund of the Municipality of Amsterdam in 2014. It consists of a loan of €0.1 million for the period until 5 March 2029. The loan will be repaid at the latest by 5 March 2029 and the interest rate is 0%. The other long-term liabilities concern a lump-sum payment received in 1988 from the Municipality of Amsterdam for the operating losses of the Convention Centre in the period until 2038. This lump-sum payment was acquired in the past for an interest of 7.46%. This lump-sum payment is mainly of a long-term nature. The release benefits the operational costs. The annual interest increase is at the expense of the financial revenue and expenditure. Of the long-term liabilities, a total of €6.6 million has a term of over five years. 1.1.8.

RAI Holding BV is the leading company of a group that is treated as a single entity for corporation and turnover tax purposes. The other members of the group are: RAI Amsterdam BV, RAI Solar Energy BV and Arfora BV. Each company is severally liable for the liabilities of the fiscal entity. Financial tools The risks associated with the financial tools are clarified below. Credit risk In order to manage the credit risk, exposure is constantly monitored and acted upon. There was no major concentration of credit risks at the end of the financial year. Credit risks relate to debtors and other short-term receivables. Sufficient provisions were included accordingly. Currency risk There are no substantial currency risks as the operational cash flows and financing activities mainly take place in euros. There is an overdraft facility agreement with Coöperatieve Rabobank Amsterdam U.A. to a maximum amount of US$ 6.7 million for which the company faces a currency risk. 121 Interest risk Interest risks mainly concern long-term loans. RAI Amsterdam BV has interest rate swap contracts to cover interest risks. In order to cover the interest risk RAI Amsterdam BV has concluded interest swap contracts. In order to fix the interest rates, interest rate swaps amounting to € 40 million at the end of 2018 were concluded in 2013 for the period until 2020. RAI Amsterdam BV pays an interest rate of 1.54% on the interest swap with Deutsche Bank AG/Coöperatieve Rabobank Amsterdam U.A. A variable interest rate of three months Euribor plus an individual surcharge is paid on the bank overdrafts. The amounts covered by the interest swaps are smaller than or equal to the outstanding principle of the loans from Deutsche Bank AG/Coöperatieve Rabobank Amsterdam U.A. On 31 December 2018, the interest swaps had a fair value of minus € 1,180,692 (2017: minus € 1,801,264). The nominal value will be reduced to zero over the remaining interest swap period (until 2020). 122 Notes on the consolidated profit and loss accounts 2018 2.1.1.

Events after the balance sheet date None. 132 133 #06 Other information 134 Result appropriation in accordance with the statutes Article 24 of the company statutes states the following regarding the appropriation of profit. Article 24. 1. In addition to several other reserves, the company can keep a general reserve, a share premium reserve A, a share premium reserve B, a dividend reserve A, and a dividend reserve B in its books. The respective rights to these reserves go to owners of shares A and shares B, pro rata to the number and type of shares they own. 2. Payments to shares A and shares B that exceed the nominal value of those shares are added to the share premium reserve concerned. 3. Without prejudice to that determined elsewhere in this article, the distributable profit is freely at the disposal of the general meeting for the payment of dividend, reservations or other such purposes within the company’s goal as determined by the general meeting. 4. The general meeting can determine, with the prior approval of the owners of shares of the type concerned, to not pay profit on those shares but to reserve that part of the profit and add it to the dividend reserve A or B respectively. Payment against dividend reserve A or B respectively can only be made to the owners of the type of shares concerned if the general meeting determines as such after prior approval by a meeting of those owners. 5. Without prejudice to that determined elsewhere in this article, if the general meeting decides to reserve profit or pay dividend on all shares regardless of the type, equal amounts of the profit will be reserved or paid as dividend. 6. The company can only make payments to shareholders and other parties that have a right to the payable profits insofar as the shareholder capital is larger than the paid and requested part of the capital increased by the reserves that must be applied in accordance with the law or statutes. The shares kept in the capital of the company are not included in the calculation of the appropriation of profit. 7. Appropriation of profit will occur after the determination and approval of the annual accounts which show that payment is permissible. 8. The general meeting is authorised to determine payments on one or multiple interim dividends, with due regard to point seven. 9. Unless the general meeting determines another date, dividends are payable immediately after determination. 10. The right to claim for payment of dividend lapses after a period of five years. 135 Reference to the audit statement by the independent accountant To: the shareholders and Supervisory Board of RAI Holding B.V.
