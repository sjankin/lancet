Let me mention just two. First, in June, we launched a book written in collaboration with B1G1 Members around the world. It was the second book in the series titled ‘Better Business, Better Life, Better World.’ Its predecessor was published in 2016 with 36 co-authors. This time, it carried a subtitle ‘The Movement’ and featured 62 contributors. In fact, it was in 2018 that we started to really see B1G1 as a movement. Now, this movement is growing. Building a movement takes more than building an initiative. It requires many leaders working together to inspire and mobilise their communities. In a movement, everyone comes together for the greater collective good, transcending our individual needs and our unique differences. The second highlight of 2018 showed the power of this movement we are creating together in B1G1. It was when many of the Members came together for the global conference in Singapore in July. Seeing everyone’s genuine desire to give and to make a difference assured us that the B1G1 community can grow to do more. We look forward to another year of this movement development with you. It matters. Because the world needs more movements like this and more people like you. Masami Sato B1G1 Founder GROWING THE MOVEMENT WORDS FROM THE FOUNDER MASAMI SATO 4 to create a IMPACT world that’s We ensure 100% of your full of giving. contributions go to support your intended projects to Because that’s a create real IMPACT. happier world. HABIT We support you and our Worthy Cause Partners through the giving process to make giving a HABIT. CONNECTION OUR We develop mechanisms to help you feel and create tangible MISSION CONNECTIONS. 5 THE B 1 G 1 MODEL “For it is in giving that we receive.” – St. Francis of Assisi HOW B1G1 WORKS THE UNIQUE B1G1 MODEL B1G1 is uniquely funded by a Business Membership Program. It sets B1G1 apart from other giving initiatives that rely on donations to sustain them. This way, B1G1 can provide businesses with greater giving opportunities as well as fantastic tools and resources that add significant value to them.

Key Responsibilities: Key Responsibilities: • Creating values • Ensuring sustainability • Ensuring sustainability • Enabling impactful giving • Maximising connectivity • Enhancing effectiveness 7 THE BUSINESS FOR GOOD MEMBERSHIP Here are the key steps for businesses to join and work with B1G1 and create great impacts. 1 CREATING THE FIRST IMPACT B1G1 makes it easy for any business to start giving immediately and create significant, tangible impacts that can cost as little as just one cent, so it’s easy to link giving to any business activity. EMBEDDING GIVING TO CREATE HABIT To make giving even more effective, 2 businesses can choose to build giving right into their core dayto-day activities. Over time, a great giving habit makes a great difference to our world. 3 CONNECTING & SHARING WITH THE COMMUNITY In B1G1, we also create opportunities for our members to learn from one another and help each other’s businesses succeed, while inspiring others and sharing their desire to give back in their own unique ways. 8 OUR FAVOURITE GIVING STORIES FROM B1G1 BUSINESS FOR GOOD MEMBERS SMM Face & International Body Clinic “When we create a “When we sell advanced Facebook post, we give nutritional supplements, 1 learning tool to a we give 1 dose of nursery school child in vitamin supplements to Ethiopia.” a child in need.” 3,344 9,899 Giving Impacts Giving Impacts DP Dental “When we send out an email, we give 1 day of Ocaquatics Swim school access to e-Learning to a SpringCom child in India.” “When we issue a “When we teach a monthly account to a swimming lesson, we give 21,000 customer, we give 1 day 1 day of access to lifeGiving Impacts saving clean water to a of transportation for a child in Tanzania.” child to get to school.” 273,372 4,389 Giving Impacts Giving Impacts 9 3 INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT B1G1 PROJECTS THE POWER OF SMALL A key tenet of the B1G1 philosophy is that anyone can make a difference at any time. To enable this, we have broken down B1G1 projects to their smallest practical constituents, allowing our members to create an impact from just one cent. We truly believe that smaller, regular inflows of contributions to our Worthy Causes are far more beneficial and sustainable than occasional large influxes. ENSURING THAT YOU CREATE AN IMPACT People often ask us how we ensure their contributions actually create an impact. The key to this lies in our entire selection and annual review process. B1G1 only approves organisations that have a track record of running the specific activities longterm with clear costing, with at least 2 years of transparent, externally audited financial reports. Thereafter, Remittance Advices (detailing the allocation of funds to projects) requiring signature confirmation are sent to our Worthy Cause each time contributions are remitted. Our B1G1 Giving Board then reviews Worthy Causes and their new financial reports on an annual basis. See more here. INITIAL BOARD FINANCIAL PROJECT MONTHLY ANNUAL ASSESSMENT APPROVAL REVIEW LISTING REMITTANCE REVIEW A B1G1 PROJECT FOR EVERY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL On 25 September 2015, world leaders convened to adopt the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Since then, B1G1 has not only identified the SDGs each B1G1 project contributes to, but has also brought on new Worthy Causes to ensure that there are projects for every SDG.

From the education project uplifting the lives of ex-refugee children, to providing opportunities to more families through microfinance (or even by sharing goats), to equipping communities with access to clean water and medical care, to planting fruit trees to help people generate greater income. The scope is vast. The impact is profound. But the lives changed are not just those of project beneficiaries. Every single person on the tour said that their lives were changed forever. For good. January BETTER BUSINESS, BETTER LIFE, BETTER WORLD 2018 HIGHLIGHTS The second issue of the special book ‘Better Business, Better Life, Better World’ was launched with ‘The Movement’ as the subtitle. This cool book, with its messages that inspire the world, immediately became an international bestseller. Every copy given or sold also creates a great giving impact. April 12 150 MILLION GIVING IMPACTS It took so much faster for us to reach 150 million impacts after surpassing 100 million impacts in 2017. This says so much about the momentum that’s being created in the world of B1G1. And as always, the most important thing to remember is to know that every impact is a smile created. (Click here for video) June B1G1 GLOBAL CONFERENCE 2018 HIGHLIGHTS It was such a great privilege for the entire B1G1 Team to welcome our Members to our home country: Singapore. Whilst every B1G1 Conference so far has been extraordinary and uniquely special, we (secretly) think the Singapore Conference was really the most powerful one ever. Many of the delegates mentioned to us two of the most significant highlights of the conference: one was the ‘coming together’ moment we experienced (please watch the overview video here) and another was our first trial of the ‘Human Library’ activity where we explored the stories of very unique individuals. Please do not miss the next one: our 2020 Hanoi Conference! July 13 Australia New Zealand United Kingdom United States 2018 HIGHLIGHTS Lithuania B1G1 IMPACT – THE WORLD TOUR It was the first ever tour in the history of B1G1 to have B1G1 Founders Masami and Paul speak together – to connect with and inspire B1G1 Members, their team members and their friends. The tour was a huge success creating more than 150 new B1G1 members. But the greater part of it was that we learned so much from so many of the Members around the world. We now have many more great ideas to bring to life. Nov ‘18 – Feb ‘19 14 IMPACT “Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more.” – H.

It is based on the sum of all units of impacts created across the B1G1 Projects. ‘Frequency of giving’ is based on the number of actual payments made through www.b1g1.com. 18 B1G1 IMPACTS AND On 25 September 2015, world leaders convened to adopt the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and they represent the global community’s next step in ending poverty, fighting inequality and injustice, and tackling climate change for the next 15 years. B1G1 is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), and pledges its commitment to uphold UNGC’s 10 universal principles in the areas of human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and anti-corruption. We are committed to reporting our progress on all 17 SDGs in our annual report. 19 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS SOCIAL INCLUSION Many of the B1G1 Projects work on eliminating poverty and inequality.

And that was the real start of us doing more to unleash the power of the people in the movement (the B1G1 Members). The power they possess to innovate, the power they have to connect, the power they have to inspire. We’re now harnessing that power in what we call ‘the B1G1 Bee’ — Members ‘pollinating’ their communities and our world in ways that we’ve not experienced before. And in these early months of 2019, we’re seeing the impact with record growth in Membership and connection. It’s the most exciting time yet in what continues to be the most exciting and meaningful time of my life. I hope it has that same impact on you as well.

We have started to see more member-curated events. The most prominent one is the B1G1x event held in the UK in early 2018. In the coming year, we are going to see more of these member curated events happening in more countries. We hope you will take a part in some of those events and initiatives that are driven by our great members. B1G1 LEGACY MAKERS INITIATIVE More than 40 of our Members are taking part in this very special program that will run throughout 2019. Each one of these ‘LEGACY-MAKERS’ will sponsor one week of B1G1 and share their inspiring messages in the upcoming book LEGACY, which is already featuring great global leaders like Paul Polman (former CEO of Unilever and one of the key leaders who were involved in the launch of the Sustainable Development Goals). A NEW WAY TO ‘AUTOMATE’ YOUR GIVING One of the important elements of effective giving in B1G1 is ‘HABIT’. Great habits are those that require intentional effort. By making giving part of the habit of businesses, many things in the world can be transformed. And to make this habit creation easier, our system team is exploring ways to track your business activities and add the giving automatically to your cart. So….please watch our updates throughout the year! 26 B1G1 “Those who are happiest are those who do the most COMMUNITY for others.” – Booker T.

The board helps ensure that decisions around our Worthy Cause Partner selections and the contribution management processes are made with fair and objective views independently without any conflicts of interest. DEANNE FIRTH, VICE PRESIDENT Director of Tactical Super Founder of Auditing for Good Deanne is a chartered accountant and the Director of Tactical Super, an audit firm and Effective PD, a firm that provides professional development training to accountants in public practice. She has also been an active B1G1 member since the start of 2016. Being part of B1G1 not only gave my business the opportunity to make a positive impact in the world but also provided me with enriching experiences. The B1G1 project in 2018 that is most memorable to me is one we visited in Borneo, Friends of the National Park Foundation. Not only did I get to see Orangutans, I met the people working on the ground there. These people help protect the rainforests and Orangutans with education, purchasing land and reforestation at a financial cost to themselves, choosing to do the right thing over financial gains. I learnt so much from the people involved and it made me appreciate even more the value of what we do in B1G1. 2018 was filled with projects that made an impact not only on those we’ve helped but also on us as members. I’m proud how B1G1 achieves two great things at the same time. While contributing to the achievement of sustainable goals, our projects also give business owners experiences that make them see where their contributions actually go. 31 B1G1 TEAM MASAMI SATO FOUNDER & CEO masami@b1g1.com “The B1G1 Team is here to be a good example of the power of small.
