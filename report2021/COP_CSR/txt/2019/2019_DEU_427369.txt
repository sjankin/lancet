Moreover, there are already upper limits for mandates as well as a legal prohib­ ition on certain ties pursuant to § 100 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

The Supervisory Board has the task of advising and supervising the Board of Management in its management of the BMW Group. It is in­ volved in all decisions of fundamental import­ ance for the BMW Group. The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Board of Management and decides upon the level of compensation they receive. Remuneration: The Supervisory Board decides annually on the level of compensation received by members of the Board of Management, orienting its deci­ sions on the sustainable development of the BMW Group. The compensation comprises both fixed and variable elements as well as a share-based component. The performance component of the bonus (an element of the variable remuneration) results from a perform­ ance factor determined for each member of the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board sets the performance factor on the basis of a detailed assessment of the contribution made by members of the Board of Management to the sustainable and long-term development of the company over a period of at least three financial years. The evaluation by the Supervisory Board is based on pre-defined criteria that take into ­account both the long-term success of the company and the interests of the sharehol­ ders, as well as the interests of the employees and social responsibility. The criteria include innovation (economic and ecological, for ­example the reduction of carbon dioxide ­emissions), market position compared to ­competitors, customer focus, ability to adapt, leadership, corporate culture, promotion of compliance and integrity, contributions to the Group’s attractiveness as an employer, progress in implementing the diversity concept, and activities that foster corporate social ­responsibility. • Compensation Report in Annual Report 2018 Search • Back 10 GRI Content Index Further information (incl.

Among other things, it assesses the econom­ ic, environmental and social progress made by the company as well as the level of inte­ gration of sustainability in the company ­d ivisions.

We follow the guiding principle that the total remuneration package must be above the average for the respective labour market. We conduct annual compensation studies worldwide to determine our current market positioning so that we can continue to align overall compensation with the market. This ensures that every employee receives com­ pensation commensurate with the relevant labour market. The ratio of the annual compensation of the highest-paid employee to the median level of all employees is also in keeping with the market thanks to our globally applied ­approach; it can however vary greatly de­ pending on the market spread between countries. For this reason, no definitive state­ ment can be made. The percentage increase in annual compensation is decided based on various factors such as the inflation rate and in principle follows the market trend. 102-39 – – Cf.

On the basis of our BMW policy, and work-related fatalities we currently do not report on any differences with regard to working condi­ tions, because all BMW Group employees are treated equally. Occupational diseases are defined differently in the different regions. Work-­ related diseases are recorded in the English-speaking countries. In Germany, this is not permitted for data privacy reasons. An aggregate statement for the BMW Group on the frequency and type of diseases and injures is therefore not possible. German figures for occupational diseases are based on the precise definition in the German Social Insurance Code. According to this definition, BMW AG has a rate of occupational diseases in the range of 0.1 per thousand (cases per employee). Thanks to central planning based in Germany, the work­ ing conditions for handling hazardous substances and the ergonomic design of workplaces are identical in all BMW Group plants worldwide. In analogy, it can be assumed that the rate of occupational diseases abroad is the same as in Germany. The BMW Group does not collect data from contractors active at our locations, as this information is subject to confidentiality clauses in our contracts. On-site contractors are instructed in occupational health and safety precautions before taking up their work. The accident statistics take into account work accidents that lead to at least one day of absence from work. 403-3 – – Thanks to our control mechanisms, BMW Group employees are not exposed to Workers with high occurrence or any high levels of risk. The key element in our occupational health and safety risk of work-related diseases system is the risk assessment. It forms the basis for systematic and successful safety and health management. If risks are identified, measures are taken in accordance with the STOP ­principle (Substitution, Technical, Organisational, Person-based measures). Subsequently, instruction guidelines are prepared and the employees are in­ formed about their content. The occupational physician responsible is involved in the process of risk assessment and can thus ensure that illness-related risks are identified early and countermeasures taken. In countries with high risk of infection, e.g. South Africa, prevention pro­ grammes such as free HIV tests are also offered. In countries with high risk of infection by mosquitoes, such as the case of the ZIKA virus in Brazil, the local BMW health service carries out prevention campaigns.
