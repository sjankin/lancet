Revenue amounted to USD 110.7m compared to USD 86.6m in 2017, resulting in a growth of 27.9%. This was driven by both the Trading Division and the Program Division, which grew by 28.9% and 29.8%, respectively. Earnings also grew significantly amounting to an EBITDA before special items of USD 40.6m, which was USD 12.3m above the 2017 figure. EBITDA margin before special items increased by 4.0 percentage points to 36.7% compared to 32.7% in 2017. Profit before tax for 2018 showed a USD 7.3m increase amounting to USD 12.2m compared to USD 5.0m for 2017.

The group tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment on an annual basis. The recoverable amount of the entity is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require the use of assumptions. The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a nine-year period. Cash flows beyond the nine-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below. These growth rates are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports specific to the industry in which the entity operates. 132 ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Key assumptions, long term growth rate and discount rate used in the value-in-use calculations are as follows: Assumptions at 31.12.2018 Average sales growth (% annual growth rate) from year 2019 to year 2027 9.9% EBITA margin (%) 18.0% Marginal tax rate (%) 22.0% Long term growth rate (%) 2.0% Pre-tax discount rate (%) 7.5% Assumptions at 31.12.2017 Average sales growth (% annual growth rate) from year 2018 to year 2026 8.0% EBITA margin (%) 20.0% Marginal tax rate (%) 22.0% Long term growth rate (%) 2.5% Pre-tax discount rate (%) 7.2% Description of assumptions Average sales growth is the average annual growth rate over the nine-year forecast period. It is based on past performance and management’s expectations of market development. The development of average sales is expected to be realised based on all the Group’s activities, Programs, Trading and MRO and is supported by a documented increasing level of activity with the Group’s existing customers and the expectation that new customers will be gained in the budget period. In 2019 and onwards, the Group will invest heavily in being able to meet the requirements and demands of existing and potential new customers. Industry analyses show that the global aircraft fleet will increased by 3-4 per cent a year up to 2028 and that the airline companies is expected to spend more than USD 2 billion each year on the replacement and maintenance of the wheels and brakes of their aircrafts, which also supports Management’s expectations for the average growth rate. EBITA margin is the average margin as a percentage of revenue over the nine-year forecast period. It is based on the current sales margin levels and expectations to sales mix and the expectation that the budgeted increasing level of activity will have a positive spill-over effect on the Company’s EBITA margin. Marginal tax rate is the expected rate over the nine-year forecast period. It is based on current Danish tax legislation. Sensitivity to changed assumptions The calculated value in use of the cash-generating unit is considerably higher than the carrying amount, and the prepared impairment test shows that goodwill and customer relations are not impaired. In Management’s opinion, no reasonable likely change to the above-mentioned assumptions will imply that the carrying amount of the cashgenerating unit will exceed the value in use significantly. 133 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TP AEROSPACE 12.

The expected credit losses also incorporate forward looking information. The credit risk is generally considered immaterial. 140 ANNUAL REPORT 2018 17. FAIR VALUES Financial instruments measured at fair value can be divided into three levels: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liablilities Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. The fair value of bank borrowings does not differ significantly from the carrying amount. The fair value of derivatives are calculated on level 2 in the fair value hierarchy using direct quotes.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Financial risk factors The group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, interest risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the group’s financial performance. The Financial risks of the group are managed centrally. The overall risk management guidelines and policies have been approved by the board of directors. The board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity. Group management manages contracts and risk exposures in accordance with the guidelines and policies and reports to the board of directors on a regular basis. Market risk Foreign exchange risk As a consequence of the Group’s structure, most net sales and expenditure in foreign currency are set off against each other, so that the Group is not exposed to major exchange-rate risks. The groups revenue and expenses are mostly in the functional currency of the operating entity creating a natural currency hedge. Consequently, the group treasury’s risk management policy is not to hedge foreign exchange rate risks. The main borrowings are in USD or DKK. Board of Directors have decided not to hedge borrowings in DKK and the groups main currency risk is therefore related to loan in DKK. Sensitivity analysis The group is primarily exposed to changes in DKK/USD exchange rate. The sensitivity of profit or loss to changes in the exchange rates arises mainly from expenses and loans in DKK. 2018 2017 Impact on post tax profit USD’000 USD’000 DKK/USD exchange rate – increase 10% 3,470 3,037 DKK/USD exchange rate – decrease 10% -4,241 -3,447 All other variables are held constant. 148 ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Interest rate risk The group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings related to the acquisitions. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk. Group policy is to hedge as a minimum 67% of the cash flow interest rate risk on the term loan A. The Group uses internest rate swaps to hedge this risk. Sensitivity analysis Profit or loss is sensitive to higher/lower interest from borrowings and fair value changes of interest rate derivatives as a result of changes in interest rates. The sensibility analysis are calculated after the impact of the hedging instruments. 2018 2017 Impact on post tax profit USD’000 USD’000 Interest rates – increase by 100 basis points 510 64 Interest rates – decrease by 100 basis points -510 64 All other variables are held constant. Credit risks Credit risk is managed on group basis, except for credit risk relating to accounts receivable balances. Each local entity is responsible for managing and analyzing the credit risk for each of their new clients before standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. For accounts over a certain size group management has to be consulted. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a high credit rating are accepted. For customers individual risk limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the board. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored. The maximum exposure corresponds to the carrying amount of receivables. Due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same as their fair value. The group applies the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected credit losses below also incorporate forward looking information. The creditrisk is generally considered immaterial. 149 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TP AEROSPACE 23. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Hedging The group’s activities expose it to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. In order to minimise any adverse effects on the financial performance of the group, derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps are used to fix variable future cash flows. These instruments reduce the uncertainty of interest payments. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments. Hedge accounting is applied to remove the accounting mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is deferred into the cash flow hedge reserve through OCI and will be recognised in profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss. This will effectively result in recognising interest expense at a fixed interest rate for the hedged loans. Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt. The fair value of interest rate swaps at the end of the reporting period is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the end of the reporting period and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the reporting period. As the critical terms of the interest rate swap contracts and their corresponding hedged items are the same, the Group performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that the value of the interest rate swap contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying interest rates. The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedge relationships is the effect of the counterparty and the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the change in interest rates. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships. The following tables detail various information regarding interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the end of the reporting period and their related hedged items. Interest rate swap contract assets and liabilities are included in the ‘Other receivables’ and ‘Other payables’ line items in the consolidated statement of financial position respectively. There was no ineffectiveness during 2018 in relation to the interest rate swaps.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that the group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) or any of its borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration the group’s debt financing plans and covenant compliance. The group has undrawn borrowing facilities of USD 18.7m that may be available for future operating activities and to settle capital commitments.

Hvidovre, 19 February 2019 Executive Board Peter Jørgen Lyager Thomas Daniel Ibsø Board of Directors Flemming Jensen Peter Ryttergaard Chairman Deputy Chairman Andrew Hoad Jesper Abildskov Blom Vilhelm Eigil Hahn-Petersen Michael Humphreys 180 181 SIGNATURES TP AEROSPACE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT To the Shareholders of TPA Holding I A/S Opinion In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s financial position at 31 December 2018 and of the results of the Group’s and Parent Company’s operations and cash flows for the financial year 01.01.2018 31.12.2018 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act. We have audited the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements for the financial year 01.01.2018 31.12.2018 of TPA Holding I A/S, which comprise income statement and statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for both the Group and the Parent Company (“financial statements”). Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Statement on Management’s Review Management is responsible for Management’s Review. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover Management’s Review, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read Management’s Review and, in doing so, consider whether Management’s Review is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 182 ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether Management’s Review provides the information required under the Danish Financials Statements Act. Based on the work we have performed, in our view, Management’s Review is in accordance with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statement Act. We did not identify any material misstatement in Management’s Review. Management’s Responsibilities for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 183 SIGNATURES TP AEROSPACE As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s internal control. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management. • Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
