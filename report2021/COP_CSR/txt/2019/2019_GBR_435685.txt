Policy on Anti-corruption It is of the highest importance that Whizz Education adheres to and complies with all given legislations and regulations as well as setting a bar for how to act and behave in society always with the highest ethics. Whizz Education’s Anti-Bribery Policy first adopted in 2010 is available on its Intranet and all employees are regularly made aware of the Policy. Pursuant to the Policy, the Company is committed to promoting and maintaining the highest level of ethical standards in relation to all of its business activities. Its reputation for maintaining lawful business practices is of paramount importance and the Anti-Bribery Policy is designed to preserve these values. The Company therefore has a zero tolerance policy towards bribery and corruption and is committed to acting fairly and with integrity in all of its business dealings and relationships and implementing and enforcing effective systems to counter bribery.Whizz Education continuously works on improving its work against corruption and bribery. Violations connected to corruption must be reported to the violator’s superior or through a whistleblower procedure and violators would be subject to the Company’s disciplinary process with violations found to be gross misconduct potentially leading to summary dismissal. Actions in the last year We continued to ensure that all stakeholders, including employees, partners, contractors, suppliers and subcontractors are required by contract to comply with Whizz Education’s AntiBribery Policy. All UK employment contracts now include a direct reference to our AntiBribery Policy and we are taking steps to provide that any breach of our Anti-Bribery Policy by a business partner will lead to termination of their contract. Goals for the coming year The goal is to ensure no corruption in any aspect of Whizz Education’s activities. We intend to introduce anti-corruption provisions as a standard feature of contracts with business partners, and to seek to modify those existing contracts which do not yet contain such provisions. Measurement of outcomes No cases of corruption have been reported during the year Policy on Environment Whizz Education has an Environmental Policy which is shared with all employees. Since our operations are primarily office based and concern intellectual property, our Company’s impact on the environment is of limited importance, and we are unable to dictate methods of operation to change our impact to any significant degree. Whizz Education does increasingly encourage recycling of consumables used in our business where it is practical, and we intend to examine the degree to which we might be able to conduct our business with less employee travel. Each premise has emergency procedures in place to prevent and address accidents affecting the environment and human health. The premises undergo relevant health and safety checks including air pollution control, waste and water treatment. Whizz Education minimises the use and ensures safe handling and storage of chemicals through COSHH (Care of Substances Hazardous to Health) and other dangerous substances. Actions in the last year None of significance. Goals for the coming year Communicate and encourage more Environmental awareness among our workforces. Measurement of outcomes We are not aware of any worthwhile procedures we could adopt to measure changes in the Company’s environmental impact. 18th December, 2019
