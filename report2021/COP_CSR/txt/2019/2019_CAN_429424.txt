Meeting people’s electricity needs in a sustainable way is of prime importance. It is also crucial to use resources wisely and preserve the quality of the environment for future generations. Québec long ago opted for hydroelectricity, a clean, renewable energy source with known, well-controlled environmental impacts. Today, Québec is actively involved in the fight against climate change in North America. Hydro-Québec has a sustainability vision that goes well beyond the environment. We endeavor to see that stakeholders participate in our decisions. We are also determined to contribute to the province’s economic vitality. The Romaine-2 development, in Côte-Nord.

A total of 232 Canadian companies with sales of more than $1 billion were evaluated on the basis of 17 environmental, social and governance criteria. PREVENTIVE SPILLS In spite of careful water-system management, preventive spills are sometimes necessary. In 2018, spills were carried out at the following generating sites: Manic-1, Manic-2, Manic-3, Péribonka, La Grande-1, Brisay, Eastmain-1 and Laforge-2.

The explanation for this situation is that the markets are unable to instantly absorb all the energy contained in our huge reservoirs. In the 1980s, Hydro-Québec experienced a similar period of even more abundant surpluses after the generating stations in phase one of the La Grande complex in the Baie-James region were commissioned. The good news is that our energy surpluses offer us highly lucrative business opportunities on markets in neighboring provinces and states. We can already report tangible results in this regard. Last spring, we signed the largest electricity export contract in our history. The reason for this is simple: Québec hydropower is reliable and affordable. Above all, it is very clean: according to the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, the greenhouse gas emissions avoided over the term of the contract will total more than 36 Mt CO2 eq. A CRUCIAL NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY SOURCE Our energy surpluses, coupled with unbeatable sales arguments, allow us to see ourselves becoming a crucial source of clean energy in northeastern North America. This is a key component in achieving the objective of our Strategic Plan, which aims to “lay the groundwork to double our revenue over the next 15 years so as to increase profits.” Other growth avenues will also play a part. To generate even more wealth, we will be on the lookout for growth opportunities in Québec and abroad, while also continuing to commercialize our technological innovations. Éric Martel To fulfill all these ambitions, we have a major advantage: exceptionally competent, motivated employees and President and Chief Executive Officer partners. We must take good care of them. That is why we’ve embarked on a thorough change in occupational health and safety culture. We want this culture to be firmly rooted, consistent and suited to the reality of our company. Last year, more than 9,000 employees and managers took a 90-minute time-out to familiarize themselves with our new Statement of Occupational Health and Safety Principles. Accident frequency was 2.01, versus a targeted 1.70. Accordingly, much remains to be done, and further concrete steps will be taken; a specific action plan has been established to improve our performance in this area. I’m convinced that our actions will already begin to bear fruit in 2019.

In the past few years, we’ve introduced many initiatives to improve customer satisfaction. Overall public satisfaction with Hydro-Québec is on the rise, customers’ wait time is declining and the range of services we offer our various customer categories is continually expanding. The customer-focused shift we’ve adopted is fully in line with our rate commitments. For the fourth year in a row, we kept rate increases below the level of inflation. Québec customers first, but also the Québec environment. Even though our environmental management system has been certified ISO 14001:2015-compliant, we have to stay on the ball. Some issues have been raised in connection with the 120-kV Grand‑Brûlé–Saint-Sauveur supply line being built. Despite all our efforts, the project’s environmental management has proven difficult. We have learned from this situation and are committed to taking all necessary measures to avoid any recurrence. TOWARD A LOW-CARBON ECONOMY While our electricity exports help avoid GHG emissions in neighboring states, we’re also maintaining our efforts to reduce our own emissions here in Québec. Since 1990, Hydro-Québec’s emissions have fallen by over 90%. We’re on the same track with our project for an underwater link to the Îles-de-la-Madeleine and our requests for proposals for the conversion of off-grid systems to renewable energies. On a wider scale, we’re implementing more and more initiatives to speed up the decarbonization of the Québec economy. Under the company's Technological Vision 2035, our innovation projects will revolve around our customers, our assets and the power system of the future. These projects will diversify our service offering and usher in a new era of electrification that will allow each of our customers to contribute to the decarbonization of Québec.

Our role consists in providing an independent opinion of this Report, the publication of which is the responsibility of Hydro-Québec. ASSURANCE MISSION Our evaluation was conducted in compliance with the requirements of Type 2 assurance as provided in the AccountAbility AA1000 Assurance Standard (2008) for a moderate level of assurance. The following qualities of the Report were reviewed: [[ Adherence to the Principles for Sustainable Development in the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard (2018) [[ Reliability of the quantitative sustainability performance information (identified in the Report by the  symbol) [[ Concordance of Hydro-Québec’s performance information with specific indicators drawn from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standard disclosures STATEMENT OF INDEPENDENCE EEM Gestion ESS has policies and procedures in place to ensure that its employees maintain their independence during the execution of its independent evaluations. The evaluation of this Report was carried out by a team of seasoned auditors holding recognized professional certification. The team members confirm that they are independent. ASSURANCE APPROACH The evaluation conducted by EEM Gestion ESS between January and March 2019 consisted of the following: [[ Interviews with Hydro-Québec managers and executives on current issues and subjects of interest for stakeholders in relation to sustainability. This exercise allowed us to further our understanding of how these issues are considered and presented by Hydro-Québec in its Report, and to validate the degree of Hydro-Québec’s adherence to the AA1000 AP (2018) sustainability principles. [[ Verification of over 550 data items, including interviews with some 50 employees to better understand the data collection process, the sources of the data and control measures applied.

Hydro-Québec’s regular dialogue with its stakeholders demonstrates the organization’s commitment to social acceptability in its business strategy, which is further materialized by the integration of sustainability principles in its projects and operations. Materiality: Hydro-Québec has a robust and interactive Materiality Analysis process that covers the entire organization. The process is used to review and prioritize issues, and contributes to the content of the Report. The previous Materiality Analysis, conducted in 2017, as well as a responsiveness exercise conducted with stakeholders in 2018, served as a basis for the Sustainability Report 2018. Responsiveness: To respond to the concerns of external and internal stakeholders, Hydro-Québec has acquired and strategically deployed various tools and resources. The organization prioritizes responsiveness based on its relevant issues and its sustainability challenges. The stakeholders appear to be well served by these processes, including the annual publication of the Sustainability Report. Impact: Hydro-Québec has a history of systematically evaluating the impacts of its strategies, decisions, projects and activities on the environment and on its stakeholders. These evaluations fuel the organization’s dialogue and interactions with the stakeholders. The impacts are documented in the Report and as they relate to the materiality matrix. CONCLUSION The assurance team considers that, based on the assurance approach used, the information contained in the Sustainability Report 2018 presents a reliable account of Hydro-Quebec’s sustainability performance during the period.
