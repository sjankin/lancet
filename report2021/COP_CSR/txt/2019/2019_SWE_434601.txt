We think everyone should be able to make sustainable choices, regardless of the size of their wallet. Ever since the foundation of Rusta, back in 1986, “great value for money” has been our guiding principle. That same idea also provides the foundation for our sustainability approach. When we say, “great value for money”, we mean more than just low prices. It also means that our products are of good quality, and that we, as a company, act in a way that is ethically, socially and environmentally sound. That is part of Rusta’s business. In recent years, Rusta has placed great commitment and emphasis on sustainability. A sustainability strategy and policy were established, as well as a vision for what our sustainability work should lead to: “offering sustainable products for life at home”. Subsequently, systematic and long-term work has followed in order to gradually make the business more sustainable. The ways in which we can contribute to a sustainable society are many, especially when it comes to production, distribution and use of our products. Being on site where our products are made enables efficiency, while ensuring that quality, production, working conditions and transport are all managed in a sustainable manner. During the year, we have continued to develop the quality of Rusta’s range of products, as well as our work within sustainability. We are good, but we can always get better. This constant development is the essence of our company and guide our more than 3,000 employees. Rusta´s Sustainability Report is an important tool for our continued work as a responsible company. Through this annual report we set targets and requirements and create systems for follow-up – aiming to create a more sustainable Rusta. Sustainability is our shared responsibility and we look forward to continue to improve and work towards long-term sustainable development. Together we make Rusta even better!

Our operations and procurement practices Operations The first Rusta store was opened in Sweden back in 1986. Today 1986 we have stores in Sweden, Norway, Germany and Finland. We offer a wide range of home and leisure products at surprisingly low prices. Rusta has a core assortment, combined with inspirational and ever-changing seasonal products. Purchasing is mainly sourced through direct imports from Europe and Asia, or directly from manufacturers in Sweden. Our Business Concept We want our customers to feel welcome, be inspired and enjoy shopping with us.

We closed the year with 3,021 coworkers in seven countries and our sales reached 6,935 billion SEK. During the financial year, Rusta’s company portfolio was supplemented with an independent holding company for e-commerce. This newly formed company will handle all e-commerce activities within the group. We have made two significant improvements in our quality and sustainability work ahead of 2019; we merged our quality and sustainability business plans into one and we also created a new packaging strategy with great improvement potentials. Sourcing offices Rusta maintain a highly competent purchasing organisation with a strong local presence in Asia. By working directly with manufacturers, we establish close cooperation, working together to find the best solutions in terms of function, quality and price.

Rusta Sustainability report — Financial year 2018/19 08 Development talks At Rusta all managers and coworkers regularly meet to set and follow up on performance and development needs. These dialogues are held every year and are always documented so that they may be systematically reviewed and followed up on. The development talk is designed to assure that both employees and manager will share their view on the work progress and what the future looks like in relation to the business goals set by the company. It is important that both employees and managers get to speak, share experiences and opinions on performance in relation to expectations, in order to create clarity in both directions. Only then, a plan forward can be set. The plan includes what is expected to be achieved and individual goals to support the overall objectives. It should also clarify ex­pected behaviors used to reach the goals, in the same way as it defines what support the manager shall give the coworker to succeed. Development and leadership Rusta has created a leadership profile to define behaviors that encompasses our values. Those behaviors are applicable for all leaders around the Rusta world, regardless of country origin. At Rusta, a leader shall engage and inspire coworkers by leading by example, being a good role model. Moreover, our leaders are expected to always encourage and recognize initiatives and learning actions from their team members. A Rusta-manager works with continuous improvements where good examples are being used to spread best practices and further improvement over time. The need of internal training varies depending on working position and tasks. Rusta offers trainings and educations in: Materials and product development Workplace safety Quality and sustainability Introduction trainings Packaging Store concept Truck driving license REACH and RoHS II Code of Conduct To support our leaders in their growth, and ultimately, Rusta Rusta core values has created a specially designed program which is mandatory Ethical policy for all managers in the company.

We will also adapt A newly designed Business Acumen program for Store Managto changing demands by training coworkers in new skills. It is ers has been rolled out and implemented. Rusta’s continued natural to invest in the company´s most valuable assets, the expansion means that the need for strong and talented leadpeople. ers is increasing. One way to meet this need is through Rusta ś trainee program for Store Managers to be. The program gives coworkers, primarily sales staff and Deputy Store Managers, the opportunity to start their journey towards becoming a future Rusta Store Manager. Rusta Sustainability report — Financial year 2018/19 09 Code of Conduct All our suppliers and their employees shall have the benefit of good working conditions. For this reason, Rusta has formulated a Code of Conduct (CoC). In order to meet global and fundamental responsibilities in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact is incorporated in the Rusta Code of Conduct. Since 2008, all Rusta suppliers annually sign and shall always fulfil the Rusta Code of Conduct. In this Code of Conduct we state eight basic requirements that must be achieved to enter as a Rusta supplier. We call this Rusta Basic: • All employees have an employment contract • No child labour • Voluntary labour only • Access to fresh drinking water and toilets • Wage equal to or exceeding the legal minimum level • Critical health and safety hazards shall be prevented • Critical environmental hazards shall be prevented • Good business ethics shall be practiced Further, we classify our suppliers based on how well they fulfill our Code of Conduct. The suppliers in the lowest category are evaluated and monitored every three months, while the suppliers in the best category are evaluated every two years. In addition to the minimum basic requirements, Rusta´s Code of Conduct also contains several demands to which the supplier shall adhere, such as good working conditions, health and safety regulations, business ethics and environment regulations, along with protection of animals and threatened species. Forced or compulsory labour Rusta has a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of forced or bonded labour. In some South East Asian regions for example, unscrupulous businesses hold the passports of the coworkers. Our Code of Conduct clearly states that no supplier can supply goods to Rusta if they exploit any type of forced or bonded labour. During the past year we have had one such incident come Store to our attention where, in line with our Code of Conduct, Rusta immediately cut all business ties with the supplier in question. • We sort our waste according to set routines • We take care of batteries, electronics and luminaires from To involve, encourage and engage our colleagues around we our customers have also created Code of Conduct for Stores, Warehouse • We take actions when we discover poor quality and Sourcing offices.

In this process we have used a four-step approach. The basis of our materiality analysis is the United Nation ś global sustainable development goals. We have then proceeded to combine these overarching goals with the goals that Rusta has identified based on our stakeholder dialogue on sustainability, which was performed in connection with the Rusta Sustainability Report 2017/2018. The stakeholders provided areas on which we focus on. The stakeholder input has also been elaborated through work­ have thereafter been anchored and confirmed through group shops and more specific in-depth interviews. These priorities discussions within the sustainability reporting team. Upon finalisation, the input and the output of the analysis has been approved and supported by Rusta’s executive management.

We will continue to work in this area. Apart from the basic requirements outlined above, Rusta expects suppliers to continuously work towards improving working conditions for their workforce.

We know that our largest contributor to CO2-emissions comes from the raw materials and production of our products. Currently we have not gathered all data. Our company owned vehicles drove 398,583 km, equivalent of 76 t CO2. Electricity consumption in our stores, offices and warehouse: was 48 GWh, equivalent of 8,843 t CO2. We monitor the energy consumption in our stores and warehouse to gather real-time data. We are currently working on structuring and analysing this data to allow us to set key metrics both for our own and for our supplier ś operations. Today, a large majority of our Swedish stores ́ energy supply comes from renewable and eco-labelled sources purchased directly from the energy supplier. Going forward, Rusta will work to ensure that those stores which have outsourced their provision of energy to the respective property-owner, will also purchase energy from h 0 0 kW -145 ,0 renewable sources. We continuously try to find ways to reduce energy consumption. Every day we need to remind ourselves to work in the right way in all our units. Examples of energy reducing activities are: • Motion sensors for light sources in staff areas • Timer and twilight relay for the exterior store signs • Reduced lighting on the sales floor before opening • LED-spot lights instead of halogen We are also exchanging fluorescent lamps in existing stores to LED-luminaire. This is done when the fluorescent lamps have reached their maximum life span, which is normally six to seven years. As we have seen in the Umeå store during the year, this activity together with the LED-spot lights, reduces the yearly electricity consumption by half (290,000kWh to 145,000kWh). Rusta Sustainability report — Financial year 2018/19 15 4 Technological improvements Goals financial year 2019/20: • Implement a Product Lifecycle Management system • We are in dialogue with our suppliers on this subject and will explore this area further during the financial year 2019/20 to allow us to implement key performance indicators, measurement methods and clear objectives We understand that, to become the most sustainable mixed • Implement the energy consumption monitoring system in all low-price retailer in the Nordics by 2021, we need to partner with stores in Sweden suppliers who are innovative, who invest in new materials and willing to invest in better technology. Our suppliers, who are one of our stakeholder groups, have clearly expressed the need to work with technological development to meet the demands of tomorrow to improve efficiency and reduce the environmental impact. By studying this area more in detail, we can share knowledge and best practice with our suppliers. Technological improvements are also strongly connected with IT and communication. Rusta is currently preparing for a Product Lifecycle Management system (PLM) with gradual implementation from January 2020. We also plan to have a new E-learning system in place during 2019. In our warehouse we use a Voice-picking system when goods are prepared for the stores. This allows better efficiency and less quality deviations. Result financial year 2018/19: • We have implemented Skype for business in all Rusta units • Implemented a monitoring system allowing us to see the energy consumption by the hour in 65 of our stores Results financial year 2018/19: 5 Corruption and bribery • Six people in the organization were dismissed due to confirmed incidents of corruption • 100% of our suppliers in Asia have signed the Ethical policy Goals financial year 2019/20: • All coworkers (including our Finnish operations) who are not yet In our Supplier Manual (RSM), we clearly account for Rusta ś busifully integrated and shall sign the ethical policy annually ness ethics policy.

By this, we aim to encourage Rusta ś internal and external stakeholders to use the whistleblower function, should they observe or suspect any conduct indicating corrupt behavior in relation to our suppliers. For this reason, during 2018 we conducted several training sessions on this topic in our sourcing offices in China, India, Sweden and Vietnam. Rusta Sustainability report — Financial year 2018/19 16 6 Raw material and carbon footprint Rusta ś main carbon footprint stems from the raw material extraction and processing used for our products. To improve our overall environmental performance, we are determined to increase the share of sustainable materials in our assortment. We have therefore identified nine “eco-labels” that we plan to highlight in our assortment to help our customers choose more sustainable products.
