Following the plan drawn up for the year, we completed 19 projects. For us, this is an extremely relevant fact, since it shows that we maintained the pace in eliminating liabilities of projects behind schedule according to the concession agreement entered into with the Federal Government. In order to do so, intense work by the entire team was necessary to resume the works that had been interrupted, demanding a contractual renegotiation with suppliers. In 2019, we will continue working to eliminate delays in the projects, with the goal of completing 25 projects, a goal 6 7 considered extremely challenging. A result of all the effort of our employees, in 2018 we exceeded In 2018, we exceeded goals and broke records. Following our guidelines, strategies and work ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | 2018 plans, we achieved an expressive result in our operational goals and in the improvements implemented in our electric energy system—throughout the year, there were 200 improvements in Transmission and 50 in Generation, in the modernization of transmission lines, substations, protection, automation, telecommunications and in Chesf’s power plants throughout the Brazilian Northeast. In addition, we exceeded all goals related to operational availability. In Transmission, we reached 99.91%, third-best result in the Company’s history and exceeded the goal established of 99.85%. A similar performance was obtained in the availability of transformers, reaching the Company’s second-best result: 99.93%. In Generation, our accumulated goals and broke records APOLONIO SALES POWER PLANT availability in 12 months was 1.14, whereas the goal was 1, thus obtaining our best historical performance. For the accumulated 60-month availabiMESSAGE FROM lity, we reached 1.03, higher than the goal established of 1, once again obtaining our best result in history. We also recorded the smallest number of events with power outages in the Basic Network, with only 13 occurrences originating in Chesf’s assets, when the threshold was a maximum of 26. This is the best historical result in 20 years of monitoring.

In order to enable all these guidelines and for the effective integration of the Company’s main processes, there was a significant advance in structuring and preparing the teams, infrastructure and adequacy of procedures for the MESSAGE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION implementation of SAP’s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). This project represents a major challenge in relation to changing attitudes, processes and the way people work, and this is an essential part of the Company’s transformation. Chesf takes a large step towards modernization of management, efficiency and competitiveness. Investment in new forms of generation The natural vocation of Brazil’s Northeast region for new forms of renewable energy generation should be highlighted, especially for solar and wind sources. The high level of solar irradiance, which was once considered a problem for the Turnaround region, today has become something good and profitable. The region also has The Company also completed the transfer of its ownership interest in Special Purpose Entities (SPEs), 8 9 excellent rates of wind circulation.

The Center has a solar power plant with 2.5 MWp capacity. In addition, CRESP will house a solar power plant using central-tower technology to capture the light reflected by the heliostats, and a solar plant using parabolic trough technology. It is worth mentioning that, in this segment of innovation, we obtained Chesf’s first ABREU E LIMA SOLAR PLANT patent, with the “Aplicativo para Regulação e Paralelismo de Transformadores de Potência” (“Application for 10 11 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | 2018 Regulation and Parallel Operation of Power Transformers”). All of these initiatives and our drive for innovation have helped put the Company back into a competitive scenario. The electricity sector is changing rapidly and is very different from the market we knew ten years ago. Therefore, we need to be agile in our decisions to continue improving processes efficiently and seeking innovation and development actions to maintain Chesf as a strong and competitive company. Given the mission of operating in the electricity sector with excellence and in a sustainable manner, generating value for society, our challenge now is to keep delivering at this level, always focusing on efficiency of our operations, modernization of our business and development of our team—all without neglecting our commitments related to sustainability, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), the Principles of the Global Compact.
