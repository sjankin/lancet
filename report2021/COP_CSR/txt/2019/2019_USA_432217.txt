Supply Chain SAS strives to build long-term relationships with both direct and indirect suppliers. A wide range of best practices, tools and policies are used to ensure that the supply chain remains strong and the company is identifying the best fit for all procurement needs. Direct suppliers provide products or services used in creating the products and services SAS provides to customers. These include software, software as a service, hardware, consultants and IT infrastructure. Indirect suppliers in areas such as food services, legal and accounting, real estate, facilities services and travel provide support for operating the business. SAS places a priority on contracting with local suppliers when it makes sense for the company. SAS uses mechanisms such as service level agreements, key performance indicators, benchmarking and supplier relationship management to monitor and manage suppliers’ results. Suppliers are subject to ongoing anti-corruption due diligence, which – proportionate to the level of the supplier’s business and risks presented – screens prospective suppliers and relevant or high-risk individuals within those organizations. The company also has an advance due diligence process for suppliers who assist in sales efforts and potential acquisitions. The process involves investigation of the supplier at levels that are proportionate to the risks 47 Governance & Management SAS Corporate Social Responsibility 2018 presented by the supplier, including investigating the supplier’s background, qualifications, conflicts of interest, financial condition and history of regulatory violations. SAS has confirmed via supply chain due diligence that no conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of any product manufactured by or contracted for manufacture by SAS. The supply chain compliance program also consists of contractual requirements for anti-corruption and ethics rules for all contractors and consultants. SAS also conducts in-person and online training, expense record and expenditure reviews, audits, and global outreach through organizations such as the UN Global Compact. SAS voluntarily provides supply chain information for the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and Great Place to Work. SAS uses competitive bidding to help ensure competition and fairness in the marketplace for suppliers. SAS’ standard request for proposal form emphasizes the importance of corporate social responsibility, including environmental stewardship and promotion of supplier diversity. Additionally, if the bidder is not a diverse company, SAS requests a statement regarding its active supplier diversity programs or opportunities it may subcontract to diverse suppliers. Beginning in 2017, the Strategic Sourcing and Procurement Department requires adherence to the SAS Business Partner Code of Conduct and SAS Sustainable Procurement Charter in SAS’ standard vendor agreements and purchase orders. Supplier Diversity SAS’ Supplier Diversity Department was formed in 2005 out of a need to satisfy customer requirements during the sales contracting process. Over the years, responsibilities have evolved to reflect SAS’ corporate conscience and competitive advantage as a global leader in analytics software and solutions. As part of the Corporate Services Division, the manager of supplier diversity is responsible for the supplier diversity process and mission, which includes: • Reviewing RFPs and contracts and responding to customers with diversity requirements. • Preparing and providing diversity spending reports to customers. • Providing information and access to SAS’ procurement opportunities by supporting and conducting various diversity activities and events (e.g., sponsorships, education and attendance). • Providing internal training to buyers and stakeholders regarding the importance and value of providing access to and utilization of diverse suppliers. By developing and maintaining effective relationships with suppliers, SAS aims to create value throughout the life of each contract based upon economy, quality, environmental preservation and social values. SAS is a member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council, the Women’s Business Center of North Carolina, the North Carolina Veterans Business Association, the local LGTBQ Chamber of Commerce and the local chapter of Disability:IN. SAS is also represented on the boards of various diverse supplier development councils and economic development initiatives. Three examples of active board chair positions include the Carolinas Virginia Minority Supplier Development Council, Piedmont Chapter; the Carolina/Virginia Chapter of the Institute for Supply Chain Management and the North Carolina Chapter of Disability:IN. SAS believes that active participation and collaboration with these organizations fosters a strong climate for diverse business development. 48 Governance & Management SAS Corporate Social Responsibility 2018 SAS Supplier Diversity is a member of the North Carolina MWBE Coordinators’ Network, a professional development organization for supplier diversity professionals. Membership ensures SAS’ program stays relevant on legislation and industry changes. SAS partners with the Small Business and Technology Development Center to provide procurementrelated educational services to small and diverse-owned businesses. SAS values extend into the community in which we live and work. In 2018, SAS volunteered with Dress for Success to provide mock interviews and business training to women entrepreneurs. The organization partnered with several minority business owners to collect and pack truckloads of supplies to deliver basic necessitates to the victims of Hurricane Florence. Giving back strengthens local communities and in turn strengthens the suppliers with which SAS does business. Supplier Diversity Policy Statement SAS customers represent a wide range of industries, people and locations – and the company seeks this same level of diversity in its supplier community. Unlike a typical manufacturing environment, the creation of SAS products does not require purchasing materials or component parts, but rather relies on a highly skilled staff of technical professionals. SAS complies with federal laws and regulations that prohibit discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability or veteran status. As a federal contractor, SAS complies with Executive Order 11246, as amended, and the implementing rules and regulations of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Regarding the procurement of goods and services to support corporate operations, SAS continually seeks ways to make business opportunities available to all certified, diverse business categories: These categories include: • Minority-Owned Business Enterprises. • Women-Owned Business Enterprises. • Disability-Owned Business Enterprises. • LGBTQ-Owned Business Enterprises. • Veteran or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses. • Federal HUB Zone-Certified Businesses. In the area of professional services offered to its customers, SAS provides small and diverse-owned businesses the opportunity to participate in the subcontracts it awards. As with all SAS suppliers, there must be a demonstrated “value-added” benefit. SAS seeks out suppliers that show a commitment to our values, innovative business solutions, cost savings and competitive pricing.

The Environmental Management Program researches ways to incorporate corporate social responsibility into procurement efforts and reduce the environmental impact of supply chain processes. To accomplish this, SAS: • Strongly encourages employees to give consideration • Makes extensive use of green products, such as environand preference to suppliers with environmental mentally friendly cleaning supplies and low-emissions practices and programs. paints and products for campus buildings.

Only then are materials processed for responsible recycling. As a software company, SAS has limited risks and concerns in regard to raw materials, hazardous wastes and supplier practices. Because the primary input to SAS products is intellectual property, SAS does not currently collect data on GHG emissions and climate change strategy from suppliers. 2018 Data SAS continued to research options for incorporating corporate social responsibility elements into procurement processes and reducing environmental impact of supply chain processes. As in years past, SAS completed its annual CDP supply chain questionnaire related to greenhouse gas emissions inventory and related climate change management, and water management and stewardship. SAS achieved an overall CDP performance score of Bfor both surveys. The average performance score for supplier responses was D for climate management and C for water management.

Where available, global data is provided and appropriately labeled. There have been no significant changes to the scope and boundaries for SAS; however, there have been improvements in the reporting of such boundaries. Because SAS is a software company, much of the company’s impact is related to its own operation rather than the products and services provided to customers. Externally, impacts generally occur related to the business practices of suppliers. Examples of impacts include: • Environmental: energy use in offices and data centers, waste, and construction of new buildings. • Societal: compliance with local, national and international laws; ethical treatment of employees, customers, suppliers, partners and communities; supporting and fostering a strong workforce. • Economic: creating value in communities where SAS operates; job creation and economic growth; supporting the community through philanthropy. At this time, SAS does not collect environmental information on suppliers or partners; however, the company seeks to work with organizations that have a similar approach to reducing their environmental impact. SAS’ standard procurement agreements require that suppliers must abide by required ethics and compliance rules, which can be found in the Governance & Management section under Supply Chain. Materiality Matrix The CSR Task Force, a cross-departmental sustainability team based in the US, underwent a facilitated process to determine the primary issues that affect SAS and its stakeholders. This included issues that affect the industry as a whole, peer businesses, communities, customers, employees and management. Through this process, the team determined areas where SAS has a significant environmental, social or economic impact. These issues were then rated to determine their importance to stakeholders and/or SAS’ operations. Using the GRI standards, these issues have been reported as “material topics.” Each team member then gathered information specific to these areas of impact for inclusion in this report. The focus areas of this report include: 52 About This Report SAS Corporate Social Responsibility 2018 Internal: Issues Relevant to Employees and Management Great workplace Training for next generation of employees Great workplace Health and safety Talent development Training forEthics next generation Environment of employees Diversity HealthVolunteerismandsafety and Inclusion Workers’ rights andTalent community development engagement Ethics Energy and Environment emissions Recycling Smart Campus Diversity and Inclusion Water Workers’ rights IoT Volunteerism and community engagement Energy and emissions Recycling Water Smart Campus Quality of support IoT External: Issues Relevant to Other Stakeholders, Including Customers, Communities, Governments, Partners, Subcontractors, Suppliers, etc. Giving Back Ethics Privacy Continuity Quality of businessof support Giving trade Environment Back Privacy DiversityEthics Global Anti-corruption Continuity of business Fair business practices Gift law Government relations Global trade Environment Civic participation Anti-corruption DiversityFair business practices Gift law Government relations Civic participation 53 About This Report SAS Corporate Social Responsibility 2018 Stakeholder Engagement SAS’ stakeholders include communities, employees, regulatory and governmental bodies, industry organizations, students and teachers, and business partners and suppliers.
