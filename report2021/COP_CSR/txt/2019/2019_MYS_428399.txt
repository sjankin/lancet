We strive to find ways of conducting businesses using smart approaches and most of our R&D work centers on finding ways to minimize or eliminate the impracticalities. Today, we have successfully formulated and synthesized a very stable mixture of bio-fuels with Nano Emulsion and Polarization Technology which requires blending & storage tanks to mix bio components and fossil fuels. Even though most of our additives are Jatropha based, we have the technology to formulate “Drop-In” additives derived from other types of feedstock such as used cooking oil, canola, cotton seed oil, algae etc. As bio-fuels and renewable fuels are comparatively new to existing fossil, we do not wish to be seen as competitor to the oil majors. Instead we opt and prefer to collaborate with the oil majors, national oil and energy companies to further enhance their existing products and turning them into renewable fuels. We firmly believe that through collaboration with the oil majors we would be able to speed up the promotion and use of renewable energy, minimize or eliminate investments required for infrastructure setups and utilizing the oil majors’ industry knowledge & experience, retailing, and supply chain. Through our technology, we believe this could also reduce the use of fossil thus prolonging the life of oil reserves. 0022 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2018 2019 BIONAS PRODUCTS REGISTRATION, CERTIFICATION & TEST REPORTS The Company’s products registration with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 0023 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2018 2019 Certificate of Fuel Additive Registration from Department of Energy, Ministry of Energy, Philippines to Bionas Philippines Corporation 0024 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2018 2019 Permanent Registration for B30(M) Bio-Petrol and B30 Bio-Diesel issued by the Ministry of Energy, Philippines for Bionas Philippines Corporation 0025 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2018 2019 Test result by PUSPAKOM (Malaysian Government Vehicle Inspection Agency) with 94% Emission Reduction.

Riyadh Zero (0) Waste City Design Concept The development will adopt the concept of new ‘Oasis and Garden Sanctuary’ where all activities, public transport, pedestrian and space layers emit from it. This mixed development incorporates innovative approaches to energy conservation and environmental sustainability. This concept has Central Park as the core of development. The component of the Humid Tropic Biome is the natural environment of tropical rainforest produced from within. Another component is the roofless biome where an open area with a variety of plants and animals from the existing region will be placed. Sustainability Concept The development will create a full-scale Garden City connected with a series of cool connecting shaded plazas and pedestrian paths and a city linked by canopies and nodes that generate energy. The goal is to implement a full scale of environmental strategy and integrate it into overall recreation and beautification planning. The goal is the low environmental impact in all aspects of development with various strategies to achieve a comprehensive sustainable city based on green international standards. Landscape in the city and plants planted in the countryside will be irrigated with grey water and treated waste water produced by the urban water treatment plant. A TREE LINE OASIS • Road with effective Landscape Treatment The goal of development is to overcome the effects of climate change and soil degradation. It should be environmental friendly in terms of providing shades, reducing wind storm and heat waves. • Landscape Road Features 1. The Identity of the Landscape Identity of the landscape of various cultural landscapes are defined through the plants selections and characteristics. There are three main cultural landscapes to be enhanced along the highways that emanate from the desert to the fields; the residential settlement; and ultimately the urban centre. 0088 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2018 2019 RIYADH RECREATIONAL & BEAUTIFICATION DEVELOPMENT 2. Safe and comfort The highways provide designated lanes for vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians for safety. The designated bicycle trails and pedestrian walkways at the designated width are set aside from the vehicle to provide comfort and avoid conflicts. The trees provide shades and canopied avenues; the shrubs on road shoulder serve as a safety barrier to the pedestrian walkway. 3. Well connected to various green spaces and public institutions. Bicycle trails and pedestrian walkways at various road hierarchies need to be linked and interconnected to a variety of open space hierarchies and public institutions with minimal conflict with vehicles. 4. Combine infrastructure and trench utility. Often, infrastructure along the roads and associated utilities that come along with them do not allow complicated landscapes to occur. This is due to the numerous utility trench built under the ground limiting the space for planting trees and pedestrian paths. Coordination between landscape architects and engineers is important for identifying multiple utility lines and determining trench routes at the earliest level to provide more space for the landscape. Riyadh Recreational & Beautification Development 0089 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2018 2019 WASTE TO ENERGY (WTE) PROJECT Modern energy services are crucial to human well-being and to a country’s economic development; and yet globally 1.2 billion people are without access to electricity. It gets even more complicated when we do not want to just provide electricity but also trying to tackle climate change at the same time – and prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2̊C. To satisfy both goals, nations around the world would also need to improve their energy efficiency and bolster the amount of clean energy they use. Hydropower generators produce electricity, but hydropower does have environmental impacts. Although hydropower generators do not directly produce emissions of air pollutants, dams, reservoirs, and the operation of hydropower electric generators can affect the environment. A dam that creates a reservoir (or a dam that diverts water to a run-of-river hydropower plant) may obstruct fish migration. A reservoir and dam can also change natural water temperatures, water chemistry, river flow characteristics, and silt loads. All of these changes can affect the ecology and the physical characteristics of the river. These changes may have negative impacts on native plants and on animals in and around the river. Most cities around the world were using incineration (thermal treatment) in handling their garbage/municipal solid waste (WSW). Waste incineration systems produce a wide variety of pollutants which are detrimental to human health. Such systems are expensive and do not control the toxic emissions from chemically complex MSW. Even new incinerators release toxic metals, dioxins and acid gases. Bionas’ Waste to Energy (WTE Plant) Technology is a Bio-Digester, a series of biological processes in which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. One of the end products is biogas, which is combusted to generate electricity, or can be processed into renewable natural gas and transportation fuels. Environmental friendly with no pollutants. The amount of electricity produced from a 1000 tons waste per day is 288 to 480 MWh sufficient to supply electricity to 96,000 to 160,000 houses at 3 kWh per house. Our Bio-Digester technology is equipped with Pyrolysis Plant and Distillation Plant that produce other products such as syngas, carbon black, fuel oil, non-standard diesel, non-standard gasoline and carbohydrate. The investment for this technology is less expensive when compared to other existing technologies, with a very attractive return of investment. Our WTE Plants are installed at more than 20 countries worldwide. 0090 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2018 2019 WASTE TO ENERGY (WTE) PROJECT Bionas offers Private Funding Initiative (PFI) to any countries to implement the Waste to Energy (WTE Plant) projects provided that their governments and/or its electricity companies provide guarantee to purchase the electricity from Bionas as the Independent Power Producer (IPP) at a gratifying tariff. The time to act is now and the place to act is in the cities of the world. Cities not only have to take preventative measure, they must plan to offset the worst. The technologies are there. The solutions exist. But turning the huge unmet needs into market demand requires the right mix of political will and commitment, well-founded policies and strategies, an enabling business environment and capacity development. WTE Process Flow Standard Building Design / Layout 0091 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2018 2019 NATIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM As part of our Agropolitan Development, we have planned for housing needs for support workers as well as for the public. We plan to build 31,000 affordable houses per Block to meet the needs at reasonable prices. 255 Blocks of Agropolitan Business Corridor Development, a total of 7.9 million houses will be built to sufficiently accomodate the appropriate location which is in line with KSA's Housing Ministry to provide quality affordable homes to the people of KSA. Our Agropolitan Development will create more than 15 million job opportunities with a high impact on the KSA economy that will drastically reduce unemployment rate and affordability to purchase own houses. Our affordable housing units will vary in size and type but on average as an example for medium asset 3 Bedroom apartment of 1000 sq. ft in size the price is less than USD 100,000.00. Our goal is to complete the Affordable Housing Scheme in 3 phases spacing up to 8 years that will contribute to USD 637 Billion which will boost the KSA Construction industry, creating more job opportunities to local contractors. Our affordable housing projects will be built using the latest green construction technology of Industrial Building System (IBS) which will offer low carbon emission, efficient, good quality and fast construction practices. The prefab building materials will be manufactured locally on the second year. Mandatory use of clean energy and renewable fuels will be enforced in this Program.

The world is desperate for climate change solution, just look at the continuous natural disasters and catastrophic around the world, who actually cares?’ DATO’ SERI MOHD SAFI’E M. JAFFRI ‘We must understand the need of the people, they are not capable to invest on anything but they have some lands for food crops. Give them the seeds, buy back at the right price, good price! Process the seeds in front of their eyes and produce the oil and additive locally for their benefits! This is the only way to bring them out of misery.’ – ZURINA AMNAN COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2018 2019
