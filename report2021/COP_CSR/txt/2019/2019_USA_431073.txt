Through the commitment of our team and the numerous partnerships that have helped amplify our efforts, we are “punching well above our weight” as my dad likes to say. My father spent a great deal of time in the 1990’s and early 2000’s as the sole consultant to the aluminum industry in developing environmental policy for the European Union. In those days it was rather groundbreaking work, as new legislation was emerging regarding greenhouse gas emissions and the impact of waste on the environment. My dad has always been an outlier thinker and his influence continues to drive my passion for using business as a platform to work collaboratively with other enterprises to help our planet, care for our communities and build more inclusive and equitable workplaces, all while being profitable. While spending time with him recently, and hearing his stories, I was filled with a great sense of urgency to commit to dramatic positive change. It occurred to me that “punching well above our weight” now requires us to work harder and push beyond our limits, learn from our missteps and find opportunities to collaborate with others. As Greta Thunberg so eloquently told us: “our house is on fire” and most of us, ourselves included, are just not doing enough to drive systemic change. We are not perfect, but we are listening and we can do more. Our purpose is to inspire beyond ourselves and our daily lives, in the same way my father has inspired me through his work. We feel a great responsibility to offer our support, guidance and resources; whether that be in an individual habit change or encouraging other businesses to I have been humbled by become a force for good. our clients and suppliers We eagerly commit to create action around our five focus SDGs by learning and expanding alike who have also joined our knowledge in how to use our business to have the greatest impact.

We are happy to listen, businesses. offer practical help and of course inspire each other as we build profitable businesses, with talented people, to help our planet sustain us today and in the future.

We continue to measure our impact covering the original scope of the SDGs to act as a blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet now, and into the future. We feel we can have the most impact by focusing on 5 SDGs. — # 3 Good Health and Well-being — # 5 Gender Equality — #12 Responsible Production and Consumption — #13 Climate Change — #17 Partnerships for the Goals Recently, the UN Global Compact has collaborated with B Lab to map sections of the B Impact Assessment to each SDG. As a B Corp and Global Compact Participant, MaCher has been selected as one of the first businesses to beta test this platform. This new tool will be used to help organizations navigate their progress with the SDGs by measuring their impact through components of the B Impact Assessment. This groundbreaking new platform will not only drive business action toward sustainability but reveal how businesses can change their behavior to make a greater impact. We look forward to learning, challenging ourselves and positively influencing those around us to hold ourselves and each other accountable.

In 2014 we certified as a B Corp; a for-profit company certified by the nonprofit B Lab for meeting rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. B Lab’s B Corp certification gave us the foundation to benchmark our progress against a set of goals that align strongly with the values that have been vital to us since we were founded over 35 years ago. In our B corp community, we have been recognized for our best practices, given resources and tools to develop sustainability goals and have been humbled by the work we still need to do. We are kept accountable through tri-annual recertification and independent auditing by B Lab. 2018 Best for the As a B Corp, we take ownership in the responsibility to inspire our team, our clients and all of our other stakeholders to feel that together, we are better.

Our goal is to create a space where life is intertwined with purpose. We can learn from our differences and be inclusive of all experiences while creating a balance where the health and well-being of our team members are at top of mind. We encourage the exploration of different perspectives and we understand that by working on our inclusivity we can evolve creatively to extend into new realms of innovation. We are working on creating mindfulness in our culture where we can actively pursue normality in addressing previously taboo subjects such as women’s health and mental health. Areas where we passionately contribute: — Best in class: 100% company paid, medical and wellness coverage for all gender identities — Upgraded 100% of office lighting to LED and dimmable lights See more details on page 18.

We are proud of our equality across all departments/leadership positions and of our efforts to always maintain equal pay for equal job status. Being mindful of each person’s experience at MaCher is a top priority for us; as we move into our next chapter of progress, we are looking to be more open with our current shortfalls in diversity and create equal space for all gender identities. We wish to inspire others to adopt similar practices and provide support where we can. The majority of our team members are either the sole provider or main income earner for their families. It’s important to us that team members can enjoy the balance of raising and connecting with their family while also earning an income and contributing to our workplace.

We encourage all our stakeholders to make these changes in their personal lives first and foremost. In doing this, bigger structural changes implemented by a business will have personal meaning. Our team has adopted yearly Earth Day pledges to inspire reduction in their individual environmental footprint and build awareness on the power of collective change. As a business, our greatest impact is through working with both our clients and our supply partners. We prioritize building awareness of their impact first, through measurement. From that point we can work together to build strategies for impact reduction. Our focus in this past year has been reduction of virgin plastic production as we see a dire need to prevent plastics from entering our waste streams and our oceans. Areas where we passionately contribute: — Responsible procurement policy which covers both environmental and social considerations for purchasing — Since 2016 MaCher has been paperless for record keeping — Reusable coffee cup program P R O G R E S S O N S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 15 OUR SDG FOCUS S N A P S H OT | OUR BUSINESS | O U R S T R AT E G Y | PERFORMANCE | GOVERNANCE | I N V I TAT I O N T O H E L P Climate Action “Our house is on fire”, as a business we need to act with urgency.

The Solution We developed sustainability focused KPIs (key performance indicators) and Earth Day Pledges to measure individual sustainability goals and hold our team members accountable. The Result While our goal was to achieve 100% engagement on sustainability KPIs, 73% of our team participated this year. 78% of those who participated felt this program increased their engagement in sustainability. We see this as an opportunity to prioritize this initiative in the upcoming year. We had 100% of employees engaged in Earth Day pledges.

The Challenge To remove single use plastic bottles within the travel industry as they cause signifcant harm to the environment. The Solution We created and facilitated custom strategy to design products that would address the challenges of removing single use plastic water bottles for our clients. The Result Through partnering and supporting our travel industry partners, a number of our clients have totally removed single use plastic bottles from their product offering. We designed and manufactured re-usable bottles to suit the travel industry’s demands. This has directly resulted in millions of single use bottles being removed from the supply chain.

The Challenge To educate and inspire change related to the horrors experienced by the 152 million children who are victims of child labor in factories around the world. The Solution We tapped into our B Corp community and partnered with Participant Media, a fellow B Corp, and the leading media company dedicated to entertainment that brings social awareness. We organized a panel and screening of the film “Price of Free” to influence our local community on the importance of taking action against slave labor. The Result After taking the opportunity to educate our team and influence our community; we have seen how critical it is to prioritize freeing every child from slavery and using ethical practices when partnering with our supply chains. We have made it a priority to empower our suppliers to become SEDEX certified to further impact responsible sourcing and transparency.
