The LTI 2016 plan came into effect on January 1, 2016. It is a virtual share program with a term of four years per tranche. Financial targets (KPIs 2018) Under the plan, a new LTI tranche is granted annually. Each 100% grant starts with determining a grant amount in euros. This grant amount is based on the Executive Board members’ contractual LTI target amount and the operating profit target achievement (non40% New cloud bookings IFRS, at constant currency) for the previous year. Taking this target (at constant currency) achievement into account, the grant amount can be adjusted 35% Cloud and software revenue growth upwards or downwards in the range of 80% to 120% of the (non-IFRS, at constant currency) contractual LTI target amount. The 2017 operating profit target 25% Operating margin increase achievement was 95.4%. Considering this, the Supervisory Board (non-IFRS, at constant currency) set the grant amount of the 2018 tranche at 95.4% of the contractual LTI target amount. This grant amount is converted into virtual shares (Share Units), Target achievement so that Executive Board members participate in further share price developments.

The grant date of the 2018 tranche was February 21, 2018. All Share Units granted in this way, comprising 60% STI compensation Performance Share Units (PSUs) and 40% Retention Share Units (RSUs), have a vesting period of approximately four years, during STI target achievement (%) x STI target amount (€) which the Executive Board member must actively contribute to the Company’s operations. The value of the Share Units varies The short-term, one-year performance-based compensation positively and negatively with the performance of SAP’s share (Short-Term Incentive (STI)) is determined based on a set of price. At the end of the vesting period, the corresponding Share financial targets (KPIs). Units are non-forfeitable. For the STI 2018, the financial KPIs are: Constant currency new cloud bookings in 2018, year-over-year growth in non-IFRS constant currency cloud and software revenue in 2018, and nonIFRS constant currency operating margin in 2018. The KPIs and their respective target values are derived from SAP’s budget for that year. For more information about financial KPIs, see the Performance Management System section. If the weighted target achievement for the financial KPIs is below 75%, there is no STI payout for the financial KPIs. In this case, the target achievement for these KPIs is set to zero. On February 20, 2019, the Supervisory Board assessed SAP’s performance against the agreed targets and determined the amount of the STI 2018 for the entire Executive Board. This resulted in a target achievement of 93.0% (cloud and software revenue growth of 125.8%, operating margin increase of 92.2%, and new cloud bookings of 64.9%). The STI compensation for 2018 will be paid out after the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2019. It is paid in the Executive Board member’s home currency1). All Executive Board members are obliged to purchase SAP shares worth at least 5% of the actual payout amount according to appropriate trading period regulations.

The payout price is capped at 300% of the grant price. The LTI tranche is paid in euros after the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting of the corresponding year. Any potential foreign currency exchange rate risk is borne by the Executive Board members themselves. The number of Share Units that will finally result in payments to the Executive Board members can and will likely differ from the number originally granted. The number of PSUs ultimately paid out changes depending on the performance of the SAP share relative to the Peer Group Index at the end of the vesting period. This places more weight on SAP's performance within the industry. In contrast, the final number of RSUs is fixed. However, both types of Share Units may expire during the entire term of a tranche under certain conditions (see the LTI Forfeiture Rules” graphic below). 28 Compensation Report To Our Combined Consolidated Financial Further Information on Economic, Additional Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Environmental, and Social Performance Infomation SAP’s share price performance is measured by comparing the The Peer Group Index currently includes the following major grant price against the payout price.

There are no comparable IFRS measures In 2018, we used the following key measures to manage our for these bookings metrics. Cloud backlog: In addition to new cloud bookings, we use the operating financial performance: Cloud subscriptions and support revenue (non-IFRS): This measure “cloud backlog” to evaluate our sales success in the cloud revenue driver comprises the main revenues of our fast-growing business. We define cloud backlog as a measure that represents expected future cloud subscriptions and support revenue that, as cloud business.

Therefore, we are confident that we will deliver on our operational In October 2018, based on the continued strong momentum in outlook for 2019 and on our 2020 and 2023 mid-term ambitions. our cloud business, the Company raised its outlook a third time for non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue, to range Performance Against Our Outlook for between €5.15 billion and €5.25 billion at constant currencies. This 2018 (Non-IFRS) range represents a growth rate of 36.5% to 39% at constant currencies. Consequently, we also raised the forecast for non-IFRS As in previous years, our 2018 operating profit-related goals and cloud and software revenue to a range of €21.15 billion to published outlook were based on our non-IFRS financial measures €21.35 billion at constant currencies.

This range represents a growth rate of 6% to 8% at constant currencies. In addition, we aimed for non-IFRS total revenue in a range of €24.6 billion to €25.1 billion at constant currencies (2017: €23.46 billion). This range represents a growth rate of 5% to 7% at constant currencies. We also projected our full-year non-IFRS operating profit for 2018 would end between €7.3 billion and €7.5 billion (2017: €6.77 billion) at constant currencies.

In light of this acquisition and our strong operating profit in the first quarter, we adjusted our outlook in April 2018 for all parameters. We then expected non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue to reach a range between €4.95 billion and €5.15 billion at constant currencies. We also raised our forecast for non-IFRS cloud and software revenue to a range of €20.85 billion to €21.25 billion at constant currencies. We expected our non-IFRS total revenue to end between €24.8 billion and €25.3 billion at constant currencies. We also adjusted our outlook for non-IFRS operating profit for 2018 upward to range between €7.35 billion and €7.5 billion at constant currencies.

To expand our business, we have made acquisitions of businesses, products, and technologies. Depending on our future cash position and future market conditions, we might issue additional debt instruments to fund acquisitions, maintain financial flexibility, and limit repayment risk. Therefore, we continuously monitor funding options available in the capital markets and trends 92 Financial Performance: Review and Analysis To Our Combined Consolidated Financial Further Information on Economic, Additional Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Environmental, and Social Performance Infomation in the availability of funds, as well as the cost of such funding. In recent years, we were able to repay additional debt within a short period of time due to our persistently strong free cash flow. For more information about the financial debt, see the Cash Flows and Liquidity section. Capital Structure Management The primary objective of our capital structure management is to maintain a strong financial profile for investor, creditor, and customer confidence, and to support the growth of our business. We seek to maintain a capital structure that will allow us to cover our funding requirements through the capital markets at reasonable conditions, and in so doing, ensure a high level of independence, confidence, and financial flexibility. For more information about the capital structure and its analysis, see the Analysis of Consolidated Statement of Financial Position section and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (E.1). The long-term credit rating for SAP SE is “A2” by Moody’s and “A” by Standard & Poor’s, both with a stable outlook. Aside from our dividend policy, we might return excess liquidity to our shareholders by potentially repurchasing treasury shares in future. Credit Facilities Other sources of capital are available to us through various credit facilities, if required. To retain high financial flexibility, on November 20, 2017, SAP SE entered into a €2.5 billion syndicated revolving credit facility agreement with an initial term of five years plus two oneyear extension options, of which one was exercised in November 2018. It replaced the previous credit facility of €2.0 billion from 2013 and may be used for general corporate purposes. A possible future utilization is not subject to any financial covenants. Borrowings under the facility bear interest of EURIBOR or LIBOR for the respective currency plus a margin of 0.17%. We are also required to pay a commitment fee of 0.0595% per annum on the unused available credit. So far, we have not used, and do not currently foresee any need to use, this credit facility. As at December 31, 2018, SAP SE had additional available credit facilities totaling €424 million. Several of our subsidiaries have credit facilities available that allow them to borrow funds at prevailing interest rates. As at December 31, 2018, approximately €21 million was available through such arrangements. There were immaterial borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities from our foreign subsidiaries as at December 31, 2018. On November 12, 2018, SAP entered into a €7.0 billion credit facility agreement to finance the intended acquisition of Qualtrics. On December 10, 2018, we issued five tranches of Eurobonds with a total volume of €4.5 billion and maturities between two and 12.25 years to refinance the intended acquisition early. The funds were used to cancel the credit facility accordingly, therefore resulting in €2.5 billion still available to SAP on December 31, 2018. The facility was fully drawn on January 23, 2019, and can be flexibly repaid within its lifetime of three years.

Impact on SAP The 2018 results again showed SAP’s impressive resilience and the business momentum driven by our strategy of innovation and growth. Even with evolving economic and political uncertainties, the SAP business model will ensure sustained cash flows via our high share of more predictable revenue. Our growth ambition remains strong and we will further continue to invest in strategic growth areas like the cloud, IoT, AI, machine learning, and blockchain. Those are expected to become significant investment priorities of our customers in the upcoming years. In addition, our focus on combining “Experience Management” from Qualtrics with SAP’s “Operational Data Management” will significantly increase our total addressable market. 124 Expected Developments and Opportunities To Our Combined Consolidated Financial Further Information on Economic, Additional Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Environmental, and Social Performance Infomation Financial Targets and Prospects The following table shows the estimates of the items that represent the differences between our non-IFRS financial measures Revenue and Operating Profit Targets and and our IFRS financial measures. Prospects (Non-IFRS) Non-IFRS Measures Outlook 2019 € millions Estimated Actual The Company is providing the following 2019 outlook: Amounts for Amounts – Non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue is expected 2019 for 2018 to be in a range of €6.7 billion to €7.0 billion at constant Revenue adjustments 100–150 33 currencies (2018: €5.03 billion), up 33% to 39% at constant Share-based payment expenses 1,200–1,500 830 currencies.

Impact of the New Accounting Standard IFRS 16 “Leases” As of January 1, 2019, SAP adopted the new IFRS standard on lease accounting (IFRS 16 “Leases”). SAP’s profit, assets, and liabilities, and cash flows in 2019 will be impacted by the new policies. The actual impact of IFRS 16 on our profits depends not only on the lease agreements in effect at the time of adoption but also on new lease agreements entered into or terminated in 2019. For more information about the adoption of IFRS 16 and an estimation of the impact on SAP’s income statement, statement of financial position, and cash flow statement, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (IN.1). Proposed Dividend In 2019, we intend to pay a dividend totaling 40% or more of the prior year’s profit after tax. This results in a dividend of €1.50 per share (subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Shareholders meeting in May 2019).

Key Assumption Basis for Determining Values Assigned to Key Assumption Budgeted revenue growth Revenue growth rate achieved in the current fiscal year, adjusted for an expected increase in SAP’s addressable cloud and database markets; expected growth in the established software applications and analytics markets. Values assigned reflect our past experience and our expectations regarding an increase in the addressable markets. Budgeted operating margin Operating margin budgeted for a given budget period equals the operating margin achieved in the current fiscal year, increased by expected efficiency gains. Values assigned reflect past experience, except for efficiency gains. Discount rates Our estimated cash flow projections are discounted to present value using discount rates (after-tax rates for the SAP Business Network segment and pre-tax rates for all other segments). Pre-tax discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) approach. Terminal growth rate Our estimated cash flow projections for periods beyond the business plan were extrapolated using segment-specific terminal growth rates. These growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which our segments operate.

Customers, investors, as well as affected by selected non-financial indicators that measure, for future and current employees can decide from whom they buy, in example, how well we engage with our employees and inspire them whom they invest, and for whom they work. Numerous studies to commit to our vision and strategy, support a healthy business provide strong evidence for this: For example, 87% of consumers culture, and succeed in reducing our carbon emissions. believe companies perform best over time if their purpose goes To achieve this quantification, we created cause-and-effect beyond profit2, 80% of executives say purpose helps increase chains that show how specific actions we take at SAP lead to shifts customer loyalty3, and organizations driven by purpose and values in behavior.

We believe that such environmental, and economic performance are interrelated, with insights are a prerequisite for fully modeling the financial impact of each creating tangible impacts on the others. To achieve a truly non-financial performance. integrated strategy, we must understand these connections and work to support them throughout SAP. Figure 1 below shows how Using Cause-and-Effect Analysis different elements connect, exemplified through profitability. To create and validate these chains of cause and effect, we turned to both internal and external stakeholders. We started with those inside SAP, meeting in small groups that rigorously examined the impacts of activities related to each of our non-financial indicators. Next, we conferred with external stakeholders, including academics, financial investors, and industry peers, to vet our findings. Finally, we used real data from SAP to translate our causeand-effect chains into a quantified impact on operating profit. Documenting Financial Impact Since 2014, SAP has used techniques such as linear regression analysis to document the financial impact of four non-financial indicators. We assess each indicator to see what a change of 1 percentage point (pp) (or 1% for carbon emissions) would mean for our operating profit. The results for 20185 are below: Impact on Operating Profit Non-Financial Indicator (€ millions, non-IFRS) Business Health Culture Index 90 to 100 per pp Employee engagement 50 to 60 per pp Retention 55 to 65 per pp Figure 1: Connectivity Between Social, Environmental, and Economic Performance.

However, because lowering emissions also brings certain restrictions, such as on business travel, it may also have a negative impact on employee engagement. Employee Engagement > GHG Footprint We believe that engaged employees are likely to want to help SAP achieve our target in lowering GHG emissions. Yet another possible outcome is that a higher level of employee engagement may lead to more business activity requiring travel, and therefore could lead to an increase in GHG emissions. GHG Footprint > Growth Lowering SAP’s GHG footprint could have a positive impact on SAP’s revenue because customers increasingly ask their suppliers to act sustainably. This reasoning is supported by a study by PwC (2013) confirming the existence of a positive correlation between a company’s environmental performance and financial performance.39 On the other hand, where additional travel is conducted to generate additional business, the resulting increase in SAP’s GHG footprint could have positive impact on growth. GHG Footprint > Customer Loyalty We believe that lowering SAP’s carbon emissions has a positive effect on our reputation, thereby enhancing SAP’s standing with our customers.

Integrated Reporting Framework. Key stages of the process are detailed below. Review Identification Feedback on and analysis of the SAP Integrated Report will serve as an input for future materiality assessments. During this stage, we drew up a long list of potential topics based on guidance from GRI G4 and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), as well as our existing material topics. Results We also considered a materiality assessment for the ICT industry by the Global E-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) as well as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). When identifying our key topics and their boundaries, we looked first at areas related to our operations and supply chain. Second, we looked at topics related to how our software can help our customers contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Prioritization During the prioritization stage, we looked at the extent to which each individual topic affects our ability to create value at SAP. We assessed whether this value was financial, operational, strategic, reputational, or regulatory. All topics that were identified as delivering value in three or more areas were then included on our short list of seven categories, as follows: – Business conduct – Climate and energy – Financial performance – Human and digital rights – Human capital – Innovation – Impact on society Next, we conducted semi-structured interviews with selected stakeholders to validate the shortlisted topics. We asked stakeholders to rate topics on a scale from 0 to 5 (where 0 is not important at all and 5 is very important) based on the following Materiality Matrix Non-Financial Topics (the chart only shows topics with high or questions for the first six categories: very high scores) – To what degree does this topic influence SAP's ability to create value? – How important is that topic for you to engage in a business relationship with SAP? 220 Materiality To Our Combined Consolidated Financial Further Information on Economic, Additional Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Environmental, and Social Performance Infomation Key points of our materiality assessment results include: Human and Digital Rights – Stakeholders saw financial performance as a mandatory part of For more information, see the Security, Privacy, and Data reporting.

They are based either on measurements supply chain, and SAP as a solution provider enabling our or, where no measured data is available, on estimations and customers. These boundaries are listed in detail in the Content extrapolations. Index of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). A portion of SAP’s leased facilities operates under full-service or multitenant leases, where SAP does not have access to actual energy consumption information. SAP includes these facilities in our definition of operational control and accounts for them by estimating related energy consumption.

As SF6 and PFCs mainly occur in chemical processes, they are not relevant for us. Below you will find the different parameters contributing to our carbon footprint. The methodology explanation will be complemented by activities and trends. Scope 1 Refers to direct greenhouse gas emissions and is defined as emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the organization. At SAP, the following areas are covered by Scope 1: – Stationary Combustion Facilities: Emission calculation is based on building gas or oil consumption in kWh. Where no measured data is available, stable values (kWh/m2) are used for extrapolation of buildings (58% measured data). In cases where no specific information is available, natural gas reported by local sites is assumed to be reported in Lower Heating Value. Besides gas and oil, we also began using wood pellets to produce thermal heat for our buildings. The Scope 1 emissions of wood pellets can be set to net ‘0’, since the wood itself absorbs an equivalent amount of CO2 during the growth phase as the amount of CO2 released through combustion. Still, to ensure complete accounting for all emissions caused, we document the Additionally, we annually measure the cumulative cost direct carbon dioxide (CO2) impact of burning wood pellets as avoidance of our carbon emissions, compared to a business-as‘outside of scopes’ CO2 emissions. In 2018, these emissions usual scenario. In 2015, we introduced a cumulative cost avoidance accounted for 782 tons of CO2. calculation based on a triennial rolling method.
