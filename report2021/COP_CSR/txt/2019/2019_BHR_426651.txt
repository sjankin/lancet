Sustainability Leadership and Governance : Sustainability Focus Areas: GPIC’s sustainability strategy is centered on the United Nations’ pillars of sustainable development: People, Planet and Profit. We measure our success on social responsibility, care for the environment and profitability. In developing our sustainability strategy, we ensure a close-knit integration between the stakeholders’ interest, important environmental concerns and our core business. Our business model is based on principles of sustainable development as we appreciate that all our operations and activities impact, either directly or indirectly, the welfare of all our stakeholders as well as the environment. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 11 of 103 Our Sustainability focus areas for 2018 and beyond: First and foremost we consider ourselves as a corporate citizen of Bahrain. It ensures that our business model is geared towards Bahrain’s economic needs. We create an opportunity for a far wider community than the direct suppliers and customers; it helps us fulfill the economic promise of the nation as a whole. Secondly, we believe that the real key to profitability is being reliable and transparent in the way we do business. To achieve this, we have crafted our strategies, prioritised our investments, maintained our assets and developed our human talent to ensure responsible operations and business continuity. Thirdly, we believe that in order to add value to the shareholders and to remain competitive and sustainable in this ever-evolving and challenging global market, we have to grow. In line with this outlook, we h a d developed a strategic plan ranging until the year 2020. The subject plan has been revised and updated as the GPIC Corporate Strategy Plan 2030. A high level council, GPIC 2030 Strategy Implementation Council (SIC) has been formed whose main objective is to ensure the implementation of the GPIC Corporate Strategy Plan 2030. GPIC has also embarked on a new Urea Formaldehyde(UF 85) plant at its facilities with the contract awarded to JGC, Gulf International Company limited in February 2017 and the plant has been commissioned in 2018. In addition to this GPIC has also started export of methanol to downstream consumers in Bahrain in 2016. Furthermore, at GPIC we are mindful that our success relies very heavily on our ability to attract, recruit, and retain the highest quality of talent within the organisation. This is why, as part of our commitment to people, the first group of stakeholders we identified consists of our own ‘People’. Simply put, without our people, our reputation would not be what it is today, so we focus on nurturing them and developing them throughout our careers. We put lot of emphasis on gender equality and youth empowerment. Another set of stakeholders we have identified are the communities that host our business and our people. We are aware of the fact that our business and/or negligence may be equally damaging to these communities, and we this as a part of our core responsibility to cater to their needs and be aware of their interests. At the same time, the safety of all our employees, contractors and host communities is also paramount. At GPIC, corporate social responsibility is all about how we manage our core business processes to produce an overall positive impact on society. Our social investment strategy is crafted with a commitment to the idea that our stakeholders i s compri se d of a much wi de r group than only our people, shareholders or financial investors. We have an unwavering commitment to invest in helping address the social needs firstly of our neighbouring communities, but also of Bahrain as a whole. At GPIC, we believe in giving back to communities, addressing not just their immediate needs but also their long term ability to lead healthy and productive lives. This is why we have invested heavily in providing and supporting education, technical /vocational training, and health care. Furthermore, we ensure that our social investments reach every segment of the Bahraini society in need. We believe that Engagement with Regional and International Organizations is a business imperative. With the aim to be proactively involved and to contribute towards knowledge sharing and professional networking, GPIC participates in several organizations at a national, regional and international level. GPIC’s leadership is involved in promoting sustainable development and agriculture on both a local and global level and is actively engaged with policy makers. Life Cycle Perspective. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 12 of 103 Some of the GPIC’s significant environmental impacts can occur during the s ourcing of raw material, manufacturing process, transport, delivery, use and final disposal of its product or service. By providing information, GPIC can potentially prevent or mitigate adverse environmental impacts during these life cycle stages. GPIC considers the extent of control or influence that it can exert over activities, products and services considering a life cycle perspective. GPIC and the Sustainable Development Goals. In September 2015, 193 Member States of the United Nations adopted 17 new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to make our world more prosperous, inclusive, sustainable and resilient. These SDGs represent an unprecedented opportunity for companies such as ours, to align their own sustainability goals with the broa der societal aspirations at hand. Hence, we are diligently mainstreaming the SDGs with our own Corporate Sustainability objectives and purpose. Through our ambitious short term and long-term initiatives, we are not only spreading awareness and action on the SDGs amongst our employees, but passing this realization and understanding within the wider community and region. As the world’s climate begins to change, no company can afford to ignore the impact it has on the environment any longer. We have committed ourselves to some of the most stringent standards when it comes to environmental management because we believe that the way any organisation manages environmental issues is a crucial measure of their standards of corporate social responsibility, competitiveness and vision. As part of our continual improvement, and in addition to taking responsibility of our own environmental footprint, we have been accredited to ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management Systems, Responsible Care Management System RC 14001:2015 and the Energy Management System ISO 50001:2011. In essence, our sustainability strategy highlights the commitment to manage the entire business in a manner that does not focus only on profits, but also ke y social responsibility factors within our organization and the country, as they have a significant enabling element towards our existence as an organization. We believe being successful is about sharing opportunities, and having the responsibility to make the world a better place by creating ‘win-win-win’ situations for us, our stakeholders and the planet. Risk Management GPIC supports a precautionary approach related to environment and development. Being a member of UN Global Compact, the Company is committed to all the ten principles including principle number 7 which states that “Businesses should support precautionary approach to environmental challenges”. As a responsible corporate citizen, GPIC continues to use a well -defined process for assessing and managing risks in the face of uncertainty. This process is science-based, ensuring decision-making includes an appropriate evaluation of risk and benefits. It applies to current products as well as those being contemplated for future development. GPIC views the Precautionary Principle as an application of the principles of risk assessment and risk management. Risk assessment includes hazard identification, characterization exposure assessment and risk assessment. Risk management encompasses the identification, selection and implementation of alternative actions for addressing risk through the control of identified hazard(s) and/or exposure. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 13 of 103 The company’s operations could be affected by various risks, some of which are beyond its control. Corporatelevel identification and management of risk is systematically accomplished using an Enterprise Risk Management approach. The most significant risk factors that could affect our business are included in our Enterprise Risk Register. These risks cover the significant risks ranging from financial to operational, Safety, Health and Environment, reputational, cyber security, marketing, shareholders, raw material availability, market volatility, human talent recruitment and retention etc. The Company assesses financial risk from many perspectives. Examples include the potential impact of weatherrelated events, access to credit, and volatility in purchased feedstock and energy costs. Risk management results are regularly communicated internally with a formal annual review with the Board of Directors and the Audit, Finance and Risk Committee. GPIC’s Internal Audit Function plays a major role in ensuring ethical business functions. All the ERM risks are regularly reviewed and updated as deemed necessary.( For details refer to GRI SR 2018) Risk of Economic uncertainty impacted every industry and sector during 2015/2016 and beyond. This provided an opportunity to GPIC to redefine and reshape its global marketing strategy and assertively continued to build it s brand reputation and product quality within the international market. So despite a sharp dro p in market prices in 2015/2016 and continued uncertainty, we were able to sustain our profitability due to our streamlined and efficient operations and cost optimization initiatives. GPIC’s leadership and the corporate board are firmly committed to sustainable growth year on year. Our expansion aspirations for this organic growth and in the petrochemical market, is firmly built on emergent operational capacity and cultivating our global customer base. We have a talented workforce and supportive business environment which will allow us to continue to grow our global footprint. We also firmly believe that our competitive cost of doing business, combined with our sol id partnerships and relationships, at the local, regional and international level, are some of the reasons we anticipate expansion plans to be under way in the near future. During 2018, in spite of challenging climatic conditions and the sea water temperature peaking to +39 degC, at its sea water intake, GPIC was able to maintain all its plants at the highest level of safety, productivity a nd reliability. Our risk management portfolio has become more robust since we have taken on board the Business Conti nuity Management system ISO-22301. We have combined both the ERM and BCM under the umbrella of Resilience committee. All the Business Impact analysis and the Business Continuity plans are reviewed and exercised regularly across the organization. The 13 ERM risks have been reviewed and updated as 10 ERM risks. Cyber Security has been added in the Risk profile and a dedicated Cyber Security committee has been formed. Supply Chain GPIC operates in an integrated manufacturing environment. Basic raw materials are processed through many stages to produce ammonia, methanol and granular urea. The main raw material that feed the integrated production of the Company’s three products is natural gas. The Company purchases natural gas from Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO), mainly to produce ammonia and methanol and also to generate electricity and steam. GPIC also purchases electric power to supplement internal generation. The products from ammonia production process which are mainly liquid ammonia and gaseou s carbon dioxide are used as raw material for the manufacture of granular urea. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 14 of 103 The three products are exported globally by our marketers who are also our shareholders Sabic, Saudi Arabia and PIC Kuwait. These products are transported by sea. Proper handli ng of these products is critical to avoid harm to people’s health or to the environment and we are committed to quality, safety and sustainability throughout our operations. GPIC Purchasing collaborates with suppliers around the world to help our businesse s meet their objectives for profitability, growth, innovation, diversity and sustainability. GPIC Purchasing looks for suppliers that demonstrate a commitment to reliable, high-quality supply relationships embody highly responsible, ethical business practices, including sustainable labor practices. As an enhancement, in 2014, Responsible Care aspects related to minimum Safety, Health and Environment requirements have been added in the pre -qualification criteria of services contractors. This criteria requires contractors to provide their SHE policies, training records, previous accident/ incident records, hazardous waste management license and certification etc. Moreover the life cycle concept was introduced as a qualifier in relation to the 2015 version of I SO 14001 and ISO 9001. The total number of suppliers registered with the Company are 1833 and out of those, 703 are local suppliers (38%). During 2018 thirty one (31)new suppliers were registered which includes 15 local suppliers (48%). GPIC being a Responsible Care certified Company and IFA protect and Sustain product stewardship certified company puts great emphasis on maintaining safety, health, security and environmental excellence throughout the product life cycle. Stakeholders Now in our third decade with operations at our manufacturing facility in Bahrain and exports that span the globe, we believe stakeholder engagement is vital to ensure that we understand not only the demands of a rapidly evolving marketplace, but the expectations of society. For GPIC, engagement with our stakeholders is a continual process. Following are the key stakeholder groups that we engage with: 1. Shareholders 2. Employees 3. The Local Community 4.

We are the only native petrochemical organization in the K ingdom of UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 15 of 103 Bahrain, and two of the significant producers in the region are key investors in our organization. We have found that because the community (business and local population) in Bahrain are intrinsically integrated/interlinked within the Kingdom, there is high consistency in terms of all issues identified being of high priority. The issues identified fall under key development areas, and can be included under key themes of focus which we monitor, evaluate and develop on a continuous basis. All aspects listed from our materiality process are key elements of our organizational strategy with impacts within and outside our organization. Our material aspects are as below; 1. Air Pollution 2. GHG Emissions and Climate Change 3. Water Pollution 4. Environmental Awareness 5. Energy Saving 6. Sustainability 7. CSR 8. Health & Safety 9. Education, Training & Development 10. Process & Product Safety 11. Philanthropy 12. Innovation 13. Reputation 14. Waste Management (Hazardous And Non-Hazardous) 15. Human Rights & Labour Rights 16. Equal Rights (Women Empowerment) 17.

Water Conservation (For details on Materiality mapping and assessment please refer to our GRI SR 2018) External Assurance We believe that external assurance significantly enhances the credibility of any report. Therefore for this report we have evidence of external assurance from credible international partners for some of the indicators listed below . For instance, our financial performance is audited by Price Water house Coopers (PwC) and their audit statement is part of our Annual Financial Report. Most of our business functions are also certified by relevant bodies, for example GPIC is certified for 14 Management System Certifications. Our laboratory, inspection and instrument maintenance functions are certified through ISO 17025 and ISO 17020. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 16 of 103 Our environmental monitoring (emissions and effluents) is verified by the environmental inspectors from Supreme Council for Environment, Bahrain. Our urea storage and export facilities and processes are assured by The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) Australian Quarantine Inspection Services (AQIS). Our production and export quantities and quality are verified by third party surveyors such as M/S SGS. Our year end production and inventories are verified by third party. Our plant equipment is assured by insurance bodies including statutory requirements. All our external assurance providers are assisted by our internal control processes that report to our Board of Directors through the Audit and Risk Committee. However, we intend getting our next GRI Report, targeted for 2020, to be externally assured comprehensively . UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 17 of 103 Making the SDGs a Reality at GPIC GPIC and the UN Sustainable Development Goals GPIC’s triple bottom line business approach aligns strongly to the UN SDGs. GPIC is a proud supporter of the global goals and has contributed in all the phases, right from the participatory process of My World to setting up meaningful indicators, sharing best practices on SDG aligned projects and programs through the UN Global Compact and KPMG’s Industry Matrix. Aligning corporate goals both short term and long term with the relevant SDGs. Mainstreaming SDGs in business functions. Linking SDGs with our Cape x projects and modifications through our MOC system is one of our latest initiatives. Sharing our sustainability performance publicly through GRI sustainability reports and encouraging others to do the same. As we continue to advance our thinking and work to address the SDGs, we’ll update our initiatives in our sustainability reports and the UN Global Compact’s Communication on Progress Reports. We proudly present our eleven steps that were instrumental in making the SDGs a reality at GPIC. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 18 of 103 11 Steps GPIC has taken to Contribute to the SDGs Step 1 Leadership Commitment towards Sustainability and SDGs We have entered a new era where we are engaging more with leading global corporate sustainability initiatives such as the UN Global Compact and focusing more on Leadership, Collaboration and Innovation and Youth empowerment so that we can serve the people of this nation and the world in a better way”. Dr. Abdulrahman Jawahery GPIC President Step 2GPIC employees took part in the Participatory process through MY WORLD survey in 2013 GPIC’s employees were involved in the participatory process for the SDGs through UN’s global My World survey that received more than 7 million votes from around the world, with approximately 75% of participants und er 30 years of age. Step 3-GPIC promotes awareness of SDGs within the Organization GPIC Sustainability Reporting committee are conducting SDGs awareness presentations to GPIC Employees and flashes and newsletters are circulated regularly to enhance SDGs related knowledge and awareness within the Company. Step 4-GPIC compares its business practices with the SDGs and its targets GPIC’s Sustainability Reporting committee compared GPIC’s current business practices to see how they compare and align to the 17 SDGs. The result was encouraging to know that in one way or another GPIC practices are contributing to the SDGs. Step 5-GPIC aligned its Corporate sustainability goals with the SDGs and its targets in 2017 and beyond GPIC has mainstreamed SDGs in its business and has shown alignment with its Corporate Goals for 2017/2018. Step 6-GPIC aligned its Departmental sustainability goals with the SDGs and its targets in 2017 and beyond GPIC has mainstreamed SDGs in its business and has shown alignment wi th its Departmental Goals for 2017/2018. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 19 of 103 Step 7-GPIC aligned GRI indicators with the SDGs in its GRI Sustainability Report 2016 and 2018 GPIC aligned the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to GRI standards relevant disclosures/ indicators, UNGC principles and GPIC ‘s contribution. These linkages are based on a more detailed analysis available on the SDG Compass website (www.sdgcompass.org). Step 8-GPIC provided its SDG related Industry Matrix best practice to UNGC based on UNGC Survey To solicit examples of how companies are positively contributing to the SDGs through their core business operations and to capture ideas on future opportunities for shared value. GPIC has provided a number of best practices and one is the carbon dioxide recovery project that addresses SDG #12 and 13. Step 9-GPIC promotes awareness of SDGs within the Community GPIC Sustainability committee and the Youth committee are conducting awareness presentations to Bahrain’s School children. Moreover school children and university interns are exposed to the SDGs and their relevance during Company visits and other events. Step 10-GPIC has started to link its initiatives, technical reports with the SDG’s GPIC has started to show linkage to SDGs in technical reports. For example the Company’s waste recycling report is linked to target 12.5 of SDG 12 “ Responsible Consumption and Production”. Step 11-GPIC has linked its technical and nontechnical projects with the SDG’s At GPIC, now the SDGs are part of the work flow for all the Capex and Modifications as part of the MOC system. The concerned engineer has to show linkage of the projects to applicable SDGs in the electronic data base, which is finally verified by the SDGs administrator.

GPIC where nature and technology co-exist GPIC has consistently demonstrated that a rapidly growing company in a highly competitive emerging market can, not only meet its environmental responsibilities, but also dramatically reduce its carbon footprint whilst simultaneously improving profitability. As the world’s climate begins to change, no company can afford any longer to ignore the impact it has on the environment. GPIC has committed itself to some of the most stringent of standards when it comes to environmental management because it believes that the way any organisation manages environmental issues is a crucial measure of its standards of corporate social responsibility, competitiveness and vision. At GPIC, our management approach is based on three areas: Reducing the environmental footprint of our activities, embedding environmental protection (alongside safety and health) into our operations and complying with legislation, and communicating our environmental performance to our various stakeholders as done in this report. The Company has shown strong commitment by establishing and upholding high environmental standards while at the same time pursuing capabilities and expertise towards softening impact of our industrial activities on communities and natural environment. This approach is aligned to the Bahrain Environmental policy, based on the precautionary principle, the polluter-pay principle, the sustainability concept, and the concept of shared responsibility, to fulfill the ultimate goals of sustainable development through harmonious action of all relevant actors. (Refer to our environmental strategy available at www.gpic.com ) Environment: Climate Change In an era of global climate change, GPIC greenhouse gas emissions, as well as its carbon footprint, are one of the biggest challenges we face when trying to invest in environmental sustainability. GPIC has been able to implement some projects such as the urea plant and the carbon dioxide recovery plant that have reduced the company’s carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions, thereby helping to slow the pace of climate change. Carbon Dioxide Recovery (CDR) plant commissioned in 2009, captures 450 MT/Day of CO2 from methanol reformer flue gases and recycles back. Hence reducing the Company’s carbon footprint in addition to resource efficiency and production augmentati on. This project is a best example of how GPIC combines business strategy with environmental sustainability. Environment: Energy Efficiency UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 60 of 103 The Company believes that a sustainable energy future is connected to innovative technologies and energy efficient operations where sustainable production and consumption is the area of focus. The manufacturing of fertilizers is a relatively clean but highly energy intensive process. In a global context, the greatest environmental impact is from GHGs emitted during the production of ammonia and methanol along with the emissions from fossil fuel fired boilers and gas turbines. GPIC has reduced its GHG emissions and improved our energy efficiency significantly since the commissioning of our first ammonia and methanol plants in 1985. At that time the total energy per tonne of the product was 11Gcal/Metric tonne, which is currently 7.34 Gcal/Metric tonne, a significant reduction through reliable operations with high on stream factor and high capacity utilization and through energy saving projects, such as the implementation of the urea plant in 1998 and commissioning of the carbon dioxide recovery unit in 2009. Globally, it is regarded that an energy efficient Plant will emit fewer greenhouse gases as compared to the one which is not so energy efficient. GPIC as part of its COP 21 obligations has started to report its GHG Inventory In recent years, GPIC has embarked on energy saving projects, the latest being the ammonia converter revamp that involved the replacement of Uhde converter basket with Haldor Topsoe S-200 series basket that resulted in a reduction in the synthesis loop pressure and a net energy saving of 0.17 Gcal/MT of ammonia produced. Furthermore our equipment have been technically upgraded to optimize energy efficiency, and energy-saving programs have been successfully implemented in our other facilities. Improved energy efficiency has the added benefit of reducing CO2 emissions. With energy efficiency being a corporate priority, GPIC has opted to go for ISO50001 certification in 2015. Among our several energy goals GPIC has a very ambitious project in place to replace all the conventional lights with LEDs and also to provide solar energy to its buildings outside process areas. Environment: Water Water is an important factor in the manufacturing processes. GPIC mainly needs it for production of steam and cooling purposes and some part goes for horticulture. The water requirements are met by sea water and desalinated water and as per design most of the process related water streams such as process condensate, steam condensate is recovered and recycled back into the process after treatment through steam stripping and polishing for higher resource optimization and energy efficiency. There is a strict monitoring regime involving online analysers, laboratory analysis and regular checks by government regulators. These stringent controls ensure we remain compliant to national legislative requirements by not exceeding the allowable threshhold levels. Ground water monitoring is also done to ensure the leaking process fluids and chemicals do not contaminate the sea water and are detected in time. In 2012, use of chlorine from sea water system was eliminated and Sodium Hypochlorite was introduced as a safer alternative. In 2014 GPIC has constructed and commissioned a double HDPE lined evaporation pond which is capable of storing 1000 m3 of waste water and other solvents. This pond was used very effectively during turnaround 2015/2018 for spent fresh cooling water (nitrite based) , catalyst contaminated waste water (Heavy metals contamination) etc. The solid sludge after evaporation is disposed to governmental hazardous waste landfills. The waste water generated in our processes is treated through skimming (oil removal) and neutralization to reduce the pollutant to acceptable limits prior discharging it into the marine environment. Hence, our effluents do not burden the environment Environment: Emissions UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 61 of 103 GPIC’s concern for minimizing the emission of Greenhouse gases, received the highest attention right at the design stage of the plants. GPIC always believed that the environment should be protected and industries should optimize resource use so as to minimize impact on the environment while meeting the needs of modern society. GPIC therefore, built several concepts over the years, into the design of the plant and structured its operating philosophy in such a way that the greenhouse gases released are low. Reduction of GHG to below 2014 levels is one of the long term sustainability goals at GPIC. GPIC’s Philosophy to minimise the emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHG). In GPIC, the emphasis has always been in maintaining a very high on-stream factor of the plants while improving on environmental and safety aspects. GPIC always believed that a plant with high on -stream factor and with high based on IPCC guidelines. The Company has issued 2014, 2015 ,2016 , 2017 and 2018 years inventory reports. Total GHG emission in 2018 was 1085.943 Gg CO2e, which includes 486.547 Gg CO2e from energy; 512.561 Gg CO2e from industrial processes. (Ammonia process 259.077 Gg, Methanol Process 253.484 Gg) and 85.566 GgCO2e from imported power (Scope 2). Environment: Waste Responsible management of hazardous and non-hazardous waste is one of the key focus areas within our environmental strategy. Our strategy is defined by a Waste Minimization Hierarchy, which fundamentally includes waste reduction at source (most preferred) to proper disposal (least preferred). We have taken a number of steps over the years in enhancing recycling of paper, plastic and metals and have introduced Cardboard Recycling in April 2015. An increase in recycling target (10% increase over the 2014 baseline) was introduced in 2015 and was achieved. The target was made challenging to 15% for the year 2016 and further to 20% in 2017 and 25% in 2018. The total quantity of waste (plastic, metal cans, paper, cardboard) recycled during 2018 is 39% higher than target mainly due to enhanced recycling during turnaround 2015 and also due to the introduction of card board recycling in April 2015. Since 2005 we have shredded paper and recycled 64,800 Kg as part of our waste for charity programme and to date we have recycled about 144 tonnes of plastic, paper, metal cans and card board. Catalysts are one of the main raw materials in our industry and we recycle spent catalysts (hazardous) by selling them to certified overseas recycling agencies. In 2016 we exported 267.5 tons of catalyst to overseas recycling agencies. During turnaround 2018 we have generated more than 300 tons of spent catalyst, which is under sales to recycling agencies. We are fervently pursuing our ultimate goal of minimal waste to a landfill site. However, we still generate a significant amount of waste that goes to the landfill site locally. One of our latest initiatives to manage the hazardous liquid waste generated within our facility is, the construction and commissioning of a 1000 M3 double HDPE lined evaporation pond in 2014. The pond was effectively used during the turnarounds in 2015& 2018. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 62 of 103 Some of our other initiatives include: • Reducing our hazardous waste (mainly catalysts) by operating the plants in an efficient way with minimum unplanned outages and thereby increasing the life of the catalysts. • Reusing a number of items such as the catalyst drums from new catalysts. These drums are used to store spent catalyst. • Some of the empty chemical drums are cleaned and reused to store spent resins prior to sending them to the landfill. • Wood waste is reused to make wooden boxes for storing maintenance tools and also for storing rotary equipment such as compressor rotors before sending them to overseas OEM workshops. Following are some of our 2018 highlights reflecting our commitment to UN Global Compact’s principles related to environmental sustainability  There were no reportable environmental incidents and regulatory noncompliance cases during 2018.  Environmental Audits were carried out throughout the year to ensure that all work areas were controlled in such a way that they remained eco-friendly.  Capacity building and training related to Environment continued in 2018. A number of employees attended courses, workshops, seminars and conferences on topics ranging from Energy management, Climate Change, GRI reporting, Carbon accounting, Environmental legislation, Agriculture etc.  Since 2013 we have installed 4292 LEDs within our complex, replacing conventional lights, resulting in an energy saving of 1120.38 MWH/Y, a cost saving of US$ 83688 and a CO2 emission reduction of 557.56 tons/ year.  As part of Post COP 21 requirements, GPIC in collaboration with NOGA provided trainin g to its Greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory reporting team members on the use of IPCC GHG Inventory software and issued its first GHG Inventory Report in 2016 and the second report in April 2017, third in March 2018 and the fourth in March 2019  To date we have recycled 144 tons of plastic, paper, metal cans and card board. Additional waste recycling points were introduced in employees car park and the GPIC Club. During Turnaround 2018 an effective waste recycling program was implemented. This has resulted in reduction of our carbon emissions by over 200 tons.  Publicizing environmental awareness amongst future generations progressed as planned. Our engineers presented a number of environmental lectures in both public and private schools. The total number of students benefiting from this program has crossed 40,000 since 2001. From 2015 Responsible Care awareness is also being imparted in addition to environmental awareness and since 2017 SDGs awareness has also been included through a GPIC Youth committee initiative. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 63 of 103  For the fifteenth consecutive academic year, GPIC sponsored the Ministry of Education/GPIC Environmental Research Program for the GPIC Environment Award for secondary school students. This Award has developed momentum and become the best Environment Award available for secondary school students. This project also received the first winner award for the Best CSR Project by Arabia CSR, UAE.  GPIC in cooperation with UN Environment and Ministry of Education continued with the Green Wave initiative that was launched in 2015. Through this program we sponsor and facilitate the planting of local trees at public schools in order to promote biodiversity awareness and encourage environmental stewardship. At each school a variety of local tree saplings, such as pomegranate and olive, are planted by the students. It is worth mentioning that since the launch of the program in 2015, 70 schools have benefited from the program with the distribution of 2,800 sapling trees in total.  Environmental awareness continued through flashes, newsletters, presentations throughout the year.  Compliance reporting to Supreme council for environment on effluents, emissions, chemicals and waste was carried out as per the mandatory reporting schedule.  The third edition of Environmental Legislation compliance manual has been issued in 2018 with updated legislation and compliance status and further linking to the environmental dimension of the SDGs. Environment related support and sponsorships GPIC takes an active role in the environmental stewardship and in July 2018 has provided financial support to Arabian Gulf University to carry out research on the subject of “ Resilience Assessment of Subtidal HabitatSea grass and Coral Reef area using very high and moderate resolution satellite data, GIS and Survey Data. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 64 of 103 Anti – Corruption Primary linkages between UNGC Principle 10 on AntiCorruption and the SDGs and the contribution that these can make towards achievement of the SDGs. We believe that by respecting and supporting universal principles, UN Global Compact business participants like GPIC can play an important role in helping to realize the SDGs. GPIC’s Contribution Principle 10 Businesses should work SDG3: Ensure healthy lives and Health and Safety for employees, their against promote well-being for all at all families and contractors; Full health corruption in ages insurance and health campaigns; Health all its forms, training and lectures. including extortion and SDG10: Reduce inequality within Responsible Care protects wellbeing of bribery. and among countries all people involved with the company’s business; Sharing expertize with all industry regardless of size or position; equal employment opportunities; Injaz – working with all schools to develop skills and knowledge.

GPIC’s focus on sustainability is embedded in everything we do – our strategy, operations and daily actions; which also includes our critical stance as a responsible business against fraud and corruption within the marketplace and our communities. We strongly believe that ‘how we make our profits’ is a critical enabler towards our credibility amongst our stakeholders, and is a core element of our operational environment. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 65 of 103 Investing towards anti-fraud and anti-corruption mechanisms and principles makes good business sense, and within GPIC, we start right at the top. The Board of Directors and Executive Management have a strong commitment toward operating and managing an ethical organisation with a strong sense of responsibility towards all stakeholders. We believe that the “tone at the top” is absolutely critical for us to foster an ethical environment within the workplace; and it is the same tone from the top that establishes our leadership commitment throughout the organizations to positively influence our management and our people towards transparency, integrity, honesty and ethical behavior. In order to sustain our commitments across the organization, we enforce the following actions as a part of our daily operations: Communicating what is expected from our people and promoting ethical values: We clearly communicate the values and ethics of the organization, and how this should be performed consistently and continuously. We also make this formally available by means of a written ‘Code of Ethics’. Leading by example: We believe in living our values, and we believe that this starts from right at the top of the organization. Our leadership and management are expected to go over and beyond to apply these values in their own day-to-day actions, whilst being a positive role model for our people. Providing a safe environment for reporting violations: We have established a safe environment for our people to be able to report on any unethical action or behaviors they have witnessed without the fear of reprisal. Our people also have a route to file a report anonymously, should they chose not to disclose their identity. Rewarding acts of integrity: We ensure that we recognize and reward ethical behavior within the organization including considering our people who have exhibited high levels of integrity and ethical behavior over and beyond their call of duty for organizational awards. GPIC’s pursuit of profit is underlined by a pervasive commitment to be ethical in all that we do. As a result, GPIC’s work ethos embodies some of the highest standards of corporate governance. In fact, GPIC have voluntary aligned its corporate governance to the Bahraini law requirement, to ensure best practices. Our pursuit of ethical behavior stems from a corporate governance strategy built upon mechanisms that ensure responsible behavior across all tiers of interaction throughout the organization’s operations; including who we conduct business with, the employees of the organization, the people of the communities that host us, as well as the government representatives who regulate our business practices. Our Corporate governance policy begins with a very simple and basic premise. All of GPIC’s workings, ranging across all stakeholders, must and do, comply with the laws and regulations of Bahrain. However, as with everything that is GPIC, we aim to go beyond just mere legal compliance, and hold ourselves to an even higher standard. GPIC’s stringent policies ensure that we monitor the action of those connected to the organization in any capacity, thus preventing them having undue advantage of their access to information. Access to GPIC legal, compliance and internal audit function is made available to the business partner and trading organizations associated with GPIC to ensure liaison with the external parties to report any potential malpractice, fraud and corruption. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 66 of 103 At GPIC, corporate governance is also about preventing a disadvantage to those who interact with the organization. The company makes it a point to pay suppliers on time, as well as fulfilling all other financial obligations without any delays. Additionally a strict pre-qualification process takes place before accepting any new trading organization. Furthermore, our governance framework allows for a stringent, frequent and thorough audit of every department where financial transactions are scrutinized and system compliance audits are conducted. Each department is regularly audited and issued audit reports. Additionally an independent external auditor would also further audit the control system to ensure its effectiveness and elevate any potential wrongdoing or cases involving anti-corruption. We have always obtained an opinion from an independent external auditor. Moreover, a joint shareholders audit is conducted on GPIC every three years targeting a comprehensive scope which adds to our credibility, integrity, and ethical values. In 2012, we were successfully able to improve our governance by issuing a revised Corporate Governance Policy, keeping it updated and in-line with the Kingdom of Bahrain’s Governance Code. In 2013 2014, the company has prepared a comprehensive Segregation of Duties (SOD) guidelines and matrix identifying positions that should be separated, positions that require compensating controls when combined, transaction codes that should not be combined with a single user and the risks arising from the conflicts. To ensure the compliance with SOD framework, detailed and comprehensive compliance audits conducted resulted in significant improvements. The SOD framework is considered to be another essential milestone toward enhancing the anti-corruption and anti-fraud programs and systems, which include the following areas:  The GPIC Corporate Governance Policy  The Board of Directors’ Charter  The Board’s Performance Assessment Framework  The Board Sub-Committee Charters  The Board Sub-Committee Performance Assessment  The Directors Code of Conduct  Board of Directors Conflicts of Interest and Disclosure Policies  Director independence and conflict of interest to be declaration  The Secretary to Board terms of reference  Board of Directors Appointment Letter To further enhance the anti-corruption framework, we have conducted a comprehensive compliance review with the Corporate Governance Policy. Such reviews are conducted on a yearly basis. In addition, the company prepared a detailed Code of Ethics Handbook which was presented to the Audit, Finance and Risks Committee in December 2015. The Handbook had been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors in May 2016. This Handbook emphasizes working sincerely, honestly, acting responsibly and reaffirms GPIC’s commitment to the UN Global Compact. The Handbook describes GPIC’s ethical principles in relation to Human Rights, Labour Rights, the Environment and Anti-Corruption. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 67 of 103 The company had also launched a Compliance Awareness Campaign in mid-2018, which included a series of presentations covering the Code of Ethics Handbook and GPIC’s Corporate Governance Policy. Tests were used to assess the overall awareness level within the Company before and after the campaign and showed a significant increase in the level of awareness. The following are some of our recent highlights reflecting our commitment to UN Global Comp act’s principles related to anti-corruption  New Guidelines on segregation of duties have been issued and an audit has been conducted.  In line with the newly released updates of the Kingdom of Bahrain’s Governance Code in 2018, a “Governance Committee” was created and merged with the with the existing Nomination and Remuneration Committee” to be named “Nomination, Remuneration and Governance Committee”.  The Corporate Governance Policy was reviewed by the Nomination, Remuneration and Governance Committee, and approved by the BoD in 2018.  Every employee is given a code of business ethics booklet.  Robust accountability and auditing system prevents any wrong doing.  The three bids system for tendering is yet another step towards anti-corruption. Over and above this, we are also a member of the Pearl Initiative, which is the leading independent not-forprofit, by-business for-business, institution working across the Gulf Region of the Middle East to influence and improve corporate accountability and transparency. One of the key aims of the Pearl Initiative is to positively influence and drive collaborative action on issues such as corporate governance, anti-corruption, codes of conduct, integrity and reporting across the region. Eventually these practices will have a huge impact to reducing the intention of employees of engaging in any sort of corruption and fraud activities. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 68 of 103 UN Global Compact: Food and Agriculture Business Principles Reporting on the UNGC FAB Principles GPIC is proactively involved in promoting sustainable development and agriculture at both local and global level. We continue to strengthen on our partnerships and collaborate actively with the International Fertilizer Association and Arab Fertilizer Association. Locally, GPIC is a partner of the National Initiative for Agriculture Development, a local non-profit focused on promoting sustainable agriculture through training, financing and capacity building. As one of the world’s premier petrochemical and fertilizer industry companies, our products help enable productivity, sustainability, food security and efficiency in the value chain they support. We have partnered with UN Environment Programme (UNEP) for the first of its kind United Nations Health Awareness Campaign. UNEP seeks to establish a nutritional concept amongst students, to educate them on how to benefit from, and to stop the wastage of healthy food. Through this campaign titled, Let's put an end to the waste of healthy food and promote the health of our children in public schools” By producing and exporting fertilizers worldwide and participating in several platforms globally to develop the agriculture sector and improving the food security GPIC is directly contributing towards UN SDG #2 Zero Hunger. ( Please refer to our section on SDGs for further details) Principle 1: Aim for Food Security, Health and Nutrition Businesses should support food and agriculture systems that optimize production and minimize wastage, to provide nutrition and promote health for every person on the planet. Promoting Local Foods In order to promote access to local, seasonal and fresh food production in Bahrain, we annually sponsors the Bahrain Farmer’s Market, a large weekly market that spans across 5 months each year. To further increase access to local and nutritious food options, we launched our charity garden in 1992 in an area of 1,500m 2. Since then, we have produced and supplied over 14 tons of local fruits and vegetables to low -income Bahraini communities. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 70 of 103 Sourcing Healthy Options Within GPIC, our canteen sources a variety of nutritious foods, including an extensive salad bar, fresh fruit, local fish and produce. These are provided to both employees and contractors at a subsidized rate to encourage healthy eating habits, and to raise awareness on healthy options for the community. In 2016, GPIC launched FAO’s International Year of Pulses campaign, for which a pulse -based menu was introduced, replacing the conventional menu once a month to promote meat alternatives resulting in healthier people and healthier planet. In continuation of this initiative, we celebrated the Global Pulses Day on 18 January 2017. Additionally, our Agri-nutrient committee developed an information booklet on local trees to spread awareness on its health benefits. Our latest initiative for 2018 is as below; During the Maintenance Turnaround, April 2018, fresh fruits and healthy drinks were served to +4000 contractors as our commitment towards the well -being of our workers and contractors alike. Principle 2: Be Environmentally Responsible Businesses should support sustainable intensification of food systems to meet global needs by managing agriculture, livestock, fisheries and forestry responsibly. They should protect and enhance the environment and use natural resources efficiently and optimally. Sustainable Fish Stocks Within the complex, GPIC manages a fish farm that was established in 1996 and expanded in 2012 to release 80,000 fish of a local species of sea bream into the sea. This promotes fish stocks and increases availability of fish in local markets. We have released over a million fish into the sea till date. GPIC’s mangrove plants surrounding its bird sanctuary also indirectly helps in sustaining the nearby fish populations via the ecosystem services that they provide. Preserving Biodiversity In recent years, the indigenous herbs that have played a large role in local culture have been threatened by urbanization. At GPIC, we preserve herbs and medicinal plants in two gardens, the Herbal and Medicinal Plants Garden covering an area of 1,200 square metre and the HH Shaikha Sabika bint Ebrahim Al Khalifa Aromatic Plants Garden. Additionally, in 2015 GPIC launched a project in partnership with the UNEP Green wave for Biodiversity program, through which we are planting local trees in 10 schools per year in order to promote green spaces and biodiversity, and encourage environmentalism amongst the younger generation. In 2016, we took the initiative to increase the number of schools participating in the program by planting local trees in 20 schools. In 2018, total of 800 local saplings were distributed to 20 schools for the academic year 2018/2019. Each school was provided with 40 trees of four types such as lime, fig, pomegranate and almond trees. Since the launch of the Green Wave initiative four years ago in 2015, GPIC has contributed more than 2800 saplings to over 70 schools in Bahrain. As Bahrain is updating its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (under UNEP’s Convention for Biological Diversity), we were involved as a stakeholder with Bahrain Supreme Council for Environment and engaged in workshops to provide extensive feedback on the strategy. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 71 of 103 Environmental Management Environmental responsibility is integrated into all operations and certified by the Environment and Responsible Care Management Systems and the IFA Protect and Sustain Product Stewardship certifications. In order to further promote efficient natural resource use and stream line energy management, we have:  Adopted the ISO 50001 Energy Management System in 2015/2016.  Established an Energy Management Committee to investigate opportunities within the company operations to reduce energy consumption and promote energy efficiency.  Started to report our GHG Inventory based on IPCC guidelines since 2016.  Established Debottlenecking and Energy Efficiency committee in 2017, which is tasked to explore all opportunities to improve efficiency by adopting energy saving and conservation concepts throughout the complex. Excellence in Safety, Health and Environment In 2018, GPIC has won International Fertilizer Association SHE Excellence gold medal for excellence in health, safety and environmental conservation, as GPIC is one of the region’s largest fertilizer producers and is working to establish a culture of clean industry and safe working environment. Principle 3: Ensure Economic Viability and Share Value Businesses should create, deliver and share value across the entire food and agriculture chain from farmers to consumers. High Quality, Low Risk We follow stringent guidelines for quality control of urea production. Level 1 Gold status awarded by the Australian Department of Agriculture to our bulk fertilizer shipments and low risk status from MPI Biosecurity New Zealand reiterates our commitment to providing high quality uncontaminated fertilizer. This accreditation means that GPIC has the best low-risk facility for the production, storage and export of granular urea, which in turn provides an added value to all GPIC urea customers around the world. This accreditation specifies stringent guidelines that ensure the GPIC product is fully controlled from the source until it reaches the end user and is adequately protected from any objectionable contaminants and pollutants. Community Engagement GPIC’s leadership is involved in promoting sustainable development and agriculture on both a local and global level. As of 2015, our president serves as the President of the International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA) in addition to being the Chairman and President of the Arab Fertilizer Association (AFA) and the chairman of the Responsible Care Committee of Gulf Petrochemicals and Chemicals Association (GPCA). He is also involved by invitation from UNEP with the Geo 6 High Level Intergovernmental Groups and Stakeholder Group. In Bahrain, he is a member of the Supreme Consultative Council of the National Initiative for the Development of the Agricultural Sector. We are involved in the working groups within the associations such as the IFA Communications and Public Affairs working group and the AFA Communications and Media working group. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 72 of 103 Additionally in 2016 GPIC, with the aim to expand on the knowledge building opportunity, sponsored an external agriculture training, which was attended by our employees and 15 representatives from local community organizations. Furthermore, GPIC is also working towards raising awareness and knowledge amongst the younger generation towards local plants and biodiversity.

(Pls. refer to our GRI sustainability report 2016 for detailed account on Human Resour ceEmployees). In 2016, we invited women entrepreneurs in the field of Agriculture and local farmers to educate our employees about farming techniques, local plants and plants that best suits Bahrain’s climate and soil. In 2017, we sponsored employees to attend the Europe food and agribusiness course and the basic successful agriculture course to enhance their knowledge towards food and agriculture. Additionally, some of our employees have participated in the 23rd AFA Annual Fertilizer Forum and Exhibition, the TFI world fertilizer conference-2017 and the 8th GPCA Fertilizer Conventions, which was also sponsored by GPIC. A delegation from GPIC attended AFA’s food management conference in 2018, the theme of the conference was integrated management of Fertilizers in west Asia and North Africa. Representatives of Arab and global companies working in the field of fertilizers in the Arab world and beyond took part. In addition, a GPIC delegation also attended AFA meeting, their participation came as part of the company’s desire to be present in various AFA activities and gatherings and take part in discussions on important topics that support the Arab fertilizer industry. Through the Agri-nutrient committee, information and newsletters are distributed to employees regularly, including information on seasonal agriculture and home agriculture tips to increase awareness and encourage UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 73 of 103 interest in the subject. The committee also manages a database of agriculture related resources for reference and plants to host awareness sessions internally in order to develop the capacity and capability of employees to participate in food growing that contributed towards food security. Farmer Engagement Although GPIC does not work directly with farmers, their needs are consid ered globally through our active participation in IFA, AFA and their relevant working groups, and locally via the partnership with the National Institute for Agriculture Development.

GPIC provided urea fertilizer to Ministry of Works, Municipality Affairs and Urban Planning in 2016 and is committed to continue with the program annually to support local farmers and increase green fields in the Kingdom of Bahrain. During 2018, GPIC has provided 50 tonnes of urea to support Bahraini farmers and this initiative is been held annually. The initiative is to support the National initiative for the development of the agricultural sector, patronized by Her Royal Highness Princess Sabeeka bint Ibrahim Al K halifa.

Sustainability Reporting In addition to managing our environmental impacts and taking steps to reduce energy use, we publicly document our activities through biennial sustainability reports and have so far published three reports since UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 74 of 103 2012. Our last report following the GRI G4 guidelines was issued in June 2016 and the current report SR 2018 is also based on the GRI Standards. In 2014, GPIC became an organizational stakeholder with GRI in order to further promote sustainability and transparency globally. We also report our environmental data twice a year to the Supreme Council for Environment in Bahrain. Engagement with Policy Makers In recognition of the interdependence of resources and the environment since 2015, we have been actively engaged, as a stakeholder, with the National Oil and Gas Authority, in dialogue and upcoming workshops on Bahrain’s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions to the climate change negotiations at COP 21.

Principle 6: Promote Access and Transfer of Knowledge, Skills and Technology Businesses should promote access to information, knowledge and skills for more sustainable food and agricultural systems. They should invest in developing capacities of smallholders and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as more effective practices and new technologies. Knowledge Sharing with Farmers Over the past few years, we have been distributing booklets on optimal use of urea per crop, to buyers prior to execution of each sale. The booklet includes general information on soil health, fertilizers and farming best practices. Recently GPIC took part in the Bahrain International Garden show 2018 with the theme “Food safety and human health “where those booklets have been distributed as part of its policy of supporting the environment and encouraging steps that would increase the country’s green areas. Knowledge Sharing with Employees Through the Agriculture Committee, information and newsletters are distributed to employ ees regularly, including information on seasonal agriculture and home agriculture tips to increase awareness and encourage interest in the subject. The committee also manages a database of agriculture related resources for reference and plans to host awareness sessions internally in order to develop the capacity and capability of employees to participate in food growing that contributes towards food security. Members of the committee developed their own knowledge on agriculture through participation at the 2015 Global Forum for Innovations in Agriculture in Abu Dhabi and sharing information amongst the committee members on a regular basis. Employees can also share their own knowledge and suggestions via GPIC’s suggestion scheme, in which the Agriculture Comm ittee plans to designate a specific section for agricultural suggestions. Promoting Research UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 75 of 103 In order to promote more informed agricultural practices, we are planning to sponsor a research study on soil types across the country including what kinds of crops are suitable for growing in each area. GPIC has also been sponsoring an annual Environmental Research Program for schools in Bahrain since 2004, which sponsors 20 research programs and awards to the top three ideas. Among this year’s participants, some projects in the field of agriculture include irrigation control via smart phones and irrigation through controlled water release. Social Media We are keen on leveraging the power of social media to share best practices on key issues around food and agricultural practices. We would like to develop a channel of communication where our in -house experts can share their thoughts and ideas on key best practices based on our research with critical communities across the world. UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 76 of 103 UN Global Compact: Women’s Empowerment Principles UNGC Women’s Empowerment Principles GPIC contributes to SDG# 5 through its policies and actions related to gender equality and women’s empowerment and by embracing the 7 principles of UNGC Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) SDG Goal 5: Gender Equality SDG Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth SDG Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities GPIC aims to be a role model to other companies through our women empowerment strategies by recruiting, developing and retaining more women in various positions including top management roles. We ensure a zero discrimination policy championed by our Equal Opportuniti es Council; the first in the Oil & Gas Industry sector and is headed by the Company President. We believe in our people and we know that, by developing the qualifications and professional competencies of the women in our organisation, we will ensure a sustainable future. GPIC committed to the UN Global Compact’s Women’s Empowerment’s Principles (WEPs) and joined companies that publicly support equal opportunities in the workplace, in the year 2014. Our company has one of the largest percentage of female employees in Bahrain’s industrial sector, which enables more women to access competitive job opportunities offered by this sector. As a result of our continuous efforts, the company has won the Global Award for Women's Empowerment presented by the First Lady Her Royal Highness Princess Sabeeka bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa, for both year 2014 and 2008 – making it the only company that won this prestigious award twice despite competing with companies from all sectors. During 2017, the First Lady and the President of Supreme Council for Women (SCW) had honoured the company’s President, Dr. Abdulrahman Jawahery, as the Bahraini Women Empowerment Personality of the Year.

We ensure continued efforts to retain women in business and foster work-life balance in the workplace. GPIC's empowerment strategy and initiatives are encouraging our people to increase their involvement in all activities associated with the business. Through our formal communication channels and committees, our employees are encouraged to work with and influence the business goals as well as their personal and UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 78 of 103 professional objectives. Participation in numerous committees has encouraged greater autonomy in decision making, created a positive and engaging culture, and has resulted in the de -layering and thereby the creation of an inclusive organisation. Principle 1: Leadership Promotes Gender Equality In 2014, our President Dr. Jawahery signed the CEO Statement of Support to the Women’s Empowerment Principles in order to publicly stand by the principles, including committing to communicate progress towards the principles using gender-specific data as illustrated below. An Equal Opportunities Committee within the company was established in 2013 as a result of an ongoing partnership with Bahrain’s Supreme Council for Women. This committee is responsible for creating and monitoring equal opportunity procedures, setting goals and targets in alignment with the SCW, coordinating with the SCW regarding community activities and investigating potential discrimination cases. The committee was later elevated to Equal Opportunities Council in March 2017, with the goal of establishing and maintaining equal opportunities, rules and regulations as well as encouraging their implementation in the company. We also have a Ladies Working Committee which is focused on enhancing the social environment for female employees by organizing events and activities, and coordinating with external organizations for women. Overall, all of our company policies as outlined below, do not discriminate between male and female employees, at any level. Principle 2: Equal Opportunity, Inclusion & Nondiscrimination Equal opportunity at GPIC begins with inclusion of women in all departments of the company. Although the Labour Law in Bahrain restricts women from working in shift jobs, women are represented in all departments where we proactively recruit and appoint them to managerial and executive positions. They are actively involved in internal audits, plant maintenance activities and as participants in trainings, conferences and events. In order to assure sufficient participation of women in decision-making and governance at all levels and across all business areas, the female employees are appointed on various committees as members, coordinators, and chairpersons.

With this fact in mind GPIC has, over the years implemented several projects related to energy.( For Principle 7 Reduction of Energy details refer to GPIC SR 2018 ) GRI302-4 95 consumption Some of the initiatives related to 2018 are;  Since 2013 we have installed 4292 LEDs within our complex, replacing conventional lights, resulting in an energy saving of 1120.38 MWH/Y, a cost saving of US$ 83688 and a CO2 emission reduction of 557.56 UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 95 of 103 UNGC GRI Description Page Remarks Principles Standard tons/ year. As part of ISO 50001 GPIC has identified its significant energy uses which is primarily natural gas as fuel and steam. In this context a couple of energy saving opportunities have been identified and modifications are implemented in urea, CDR and utilities. Principle 7 Total number and We did not have any significant loss of containment in the GRI306-3 volume of significant 96 reporting period .(2018) spills We have reduced the Company’s absolute GHG emissions by more than 50 percent since 1985. The energy savings resulting from increased efficiency from 2007 through 2015, as reported in GRI 302-4, can be converted to equivalent GHG emissions avoided. The activities described in GRI302-4, in addition to implementing new processes that emit less GHGs compared to traditional routes, will be important to driving Initiatives to reduce reductions in the future. GPIC’s long term sustainability Principle 8 greenhouse gas 61,62, goal regarding climate change is to maintain GHG GRI305-5 emissions and 96 emissions below 2014 levels on an absolute basis for all reductions achieved GHGs, thereby growing the Company without increasing its carbon footprint. Our CDR, which has been in full operation since 2009, has so far extracted over 1,000,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, which has been used to enhance the production of urea and methanol. This translates to an average of 200,000 Nm3/day carbon di oxide being captured by the CDR recovery unit. Principle 8 non-compliance with Nil. GPIC ensured full compliance to environmental laws GRI307-1 environmental laws 96 and legislation during 2018. and regulations Air pollutants can have adverse effects on climate, ecosystems, air quality, habitats, agriculture, and human and animal health. Reductions in regulated pol lutants lead to improved health conditions for workers and neighbouring communities. GPIC is mindful of the fact that reductions, or performance beyond compliance, can enhance reputation of the Principle 8 NOX, SOX, and other company, enhance relations with the neighbouring GRI305-7 significant air 96 communities and workers, and the ability to maintain or emissions expand operations. More regional impacts from GPIC production plants include emission of acidifying gases (NOx and SOx) from flue gas stacks of four HP steam boilers, one LP boiler, two reformers, one gas turbine and particulate matter and ammonia from the urea granulator s tack. All such impacts are monitored closely through online continuous emission monitoring system( CEMS) and also through laboratory sampling to ensure that allowable UN Global Compact COP March 2019 Page 96 of 103 UNGC GRI Description Page Remarks Principles Standard levels are not exceeded. GPIC is the only industry in Bahrain to have a mobile ambient ai r quality monitoring station. Over the years GPIC has taken several steps to further reduce emissions beyond compliance, for instance, operational improvements and investments in clean technologies such as the ultra low NOx burners in the new HP steam boiler and the CDR boiler. Our main effluent to the marine environment is the sea water discharge from the process units. All other effluents after their primary treatment and quality checks also intermix with the main sea water effluent before discharging to the marine environment. The main sea water effluent is closely monitored through regular laboratory analysis and periodically monitored by governmental environmental inspectors for compliance. We optimize our total water requirements and associated effluents keeping in view our process requirements related to load and climatic conditions. For example our Total water sea water requirements increase by approximately 33% Principle 8 GRI306-1 discharge by quality 97 during summers. and destination Sea Water discharge to marine environment includes 1) Return SW cooling 2) desalination unit reject 3) desalination unit vacuum system sea water outlet 4) desalination unit sand wash pump discharge 5) neutralized waste water from plants.
