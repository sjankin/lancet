Consolidated Management Report 18 Message from the Chief Executive Officer NOS has come a long way since the merger in 2013, which successfully brought together two organizations with very different operational legacies and cultures, whilst competing in one of the most advanced and highly invested telecom landscapes in the world. After a period of strong growth in revenues and accelerated market share gains, led by the mass-market take up of convergent offers and which enabled us to exceed our original 30% revenue market share target well ahead of schedule, our focus today is to consolidate our position as the leading entertainment and communications company in Portugal. We are leveraging our unique combination of telco and audiovisuals assets whilst transforming our business to become a more customer centric, operationally fit and digitally enabled organization, to deliver long lasting value creation for our shareholders. Our results in 2018 reflect this strategic direction. We strengthened our competitive position in all segments with sound RGU growth in a market that is already highly penetrated. Incremental service growth was led by additional greenfield network coverage, continued uptake, albeit lower, of convergent solutions and by sustained improvement in subscriber churn. Despite the slowdown in commercial activity in comparison with previous years, and price stability during 2018, revenues grew just over 1% to 1,576 million euros and, through disciplined cost management and efficiency, EBITDA grew by almost 3% to 592 million euros. The investment we are doing in strategic technological and operational transformation programmes is a critical enabler of current and long-term competitive strength. Last year we continued to invest in the upgrade of our mobile network to a single RAN, 5G ready architecture, having executed more than 70% of the planned site renewal. Completion of the project during 2019 will stand us with the most technologically advanced mobile network in Portugal, boasting the most advanced and efficient next generation broadband capabilities and features. During the second half of the year, we started to exchange the first FttH households within the context of our network sharing agreement, further extending our greenfield coverage with next generation access technology, and complementing our fully upgraded Docsis 3.1 network, which already allows us to provide Gigabit speeds nationwide. Last year also marked the launch of the first of three waves of our operational transformation programme, designed to re-think and design the way we interact with our customers at all levels of the organization, with an ambition to deliver excellence in customer experience and be the operator of choice in Portugal. The projects being implemented are company-wide, run by internal resources, and are setting the foundations for a much fitter, digital company, driven by simpler, more customer centric processes and new ways of working. The value captured from the programme will start to accelerate once all three waves of projects are up and running, translating into leading customer experience metrics and savings in both operational running costs and customer related investments. Our continuous and sustained improvement in operating profitability and FCF momentum, the strength of our capital structure and our leading competitive positioning provide the basis for long-term value creation and continued and attractive shareholder returns. Against this positive backdrop, the Board has again proposed an increase in dividend payment this year to 35 cents, representing an increase of 17% over last year and demonstrative of the confidence we have in our continued operating and financial momentum. We consider sustainability to be a strategic priority and the guidelines we embrace and report, in line with the GRI Global Reporting Initiative, are sharing across the organization. We are very conscious of the importance of acting responsibly to ensure our long-term competitiveness, including the role of our sector to contribute to a sustainable future for society. We reiterate our commitment to the ten Principles of Global Compact and to the achievement of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. I am very confident that NOS is well equipped today to face the long-term challenges of our sector and the ever evolving and legitimate expectations of our customers. The good results we continue to achieve allow us to embrace the future with optimism and I know we have the best team and assets to succeed as the leading entertainment and telecommunications company in Portugal, continuing to increase value generated for our customers, employees, shareholders and other stakeholders.

Operational and Financial Review 2018 Management Report Reporting Changes As from 1Q19, NOS’ accounts will be reported applying the new IFRS 16 framework with regards mainly to the accounting of operating leases. Restated values for the corresponding comparative periods for FY18 will also be provided. IFRS16 mandates that lessees account for all leases based on a single model of balance sheet recognition (on balance model) similar to the treatment IAS 17 prescribes for financial leases. At the lease start date, lessees recognize the responsibility related to payments regarding the lease (the lease’s Liabilities) and the Asset which is represented by the right to use of the underlying asset during the period of the lease (right of use, or ROU). Lessees must recognize the cost of interest of the liability of the lease and the ROU depreciation separately. Lessees must also remeasure the lease’s liability according to certain events (such as a change in the period of the lease, a change in future payments resulting from a change in the reference index or the rate used to determine those payments). The lessee will recognize the amount of this remeasurement of the lease’s liability as an adjustment to the ROU. The main impacts are as follows: 2018 Before IFRS 16 Restated Revenues 1,576.2 1,576.2 OPEX 984.4 951.9 EBITDA 591.8 624.3 Net Income 141.4 137.8 CAPEX 375.7 423.8 56 Non-Financial Statements Sustainability and Performance Strategy 58 Introduction to this report For the NOS Group (hereinafter referred to as “NOS”) sustainability is a strategic dimension of the organization, crucial for long-term value creation.

The ERM methodology provides for periodic risk assessments, allowing different areas of the organization to review and prioritize the main corporate risks that may compromise their performance and objectives. In 2018, the ERM risk identification and evaluation process focused on assessing the risks associated with NOS certified management systems: ISO 27001 “Information Security Management System”, ISO 20000 “Service Management System”, ISO 9001 “Quality Management System”, ISO 14001 “Environmental Management System” and ISO 45001 “Occupational Health and Safety Management System”. In total, 29 ERM corporate risks eligible to be evaluated in this process were identified, which include the risks relevant to Sustainability2. The risks were submitted to an assessment by the Directors and pivots of 17 NOS areas, with responsibilities in the abovementioned certifications. For the risk assessment, probability of occurrence and estimated impact criteria were applied, on a scale of 0 to 10. Of the set of assessed risks, only 3 obtained an inherent risk value above the level of risk acceptance (≥25), 1.

Valuing human capital Sustainability and Performance Strategy Health and safety at work NOS Bem-nos-quer program The health and well-being of employees matters and is relevant to people, for the organization and for the stakeholders in general. At NOS, we evaluated our employees’ health and wellbeing profile and behaviours to design an employee centric program, and implement a set of initiatives tailored to the segments with the objective of changing behaviours and/or encouraging healthier practices. In this sense, we have been promoting an organizational program, called “NOS Bem-nosquer”, which is based on a holistic approach to total well-being composed of three axes: physical, mental/emotional and social. Throughout 2018, we developed different initiatives promoted by several areas of the company that contributed to this holistic view of the employee as a professional, individual/ family and social person. We also held the 3rd edition of the week dedicated to health and well-being, with an intensive agenda at the level of content of interest and actions relevant to employees, such as osteopathy, workplace exercise, posture, sleep quality, healthy eating (eg healthy snacks for the whole family), mindfulness, smoking cessation, among others. In the coming years, the program dedicated to the health and well-being of NOS employees intends to continue to evolve, establishing new initiatives and contents, differentiating formats, involving its employees in the creation of content, extending its scope to families, establishing new partnerships and relevant protocols, inviting experts, among others. 111 04.

Water consumption management NOS activities do not involve the consumption of relevant quantities of water. However, we are aware that water is an increasingly scarce natural resource on a global scale, and we implement measures to ration its consumption. Although it was not considered a material topic in our sustainability strategy, since 2014 we have monitored the water consumption of our buildings, our own stores and our technical network. 125 05. Preserving the environment Sustainability and Performance Strategy Commitments for 2019 Commitments To effectively manage the environmental impacts associated with the life cycle of our products and services Objective ODS To reduce, by 2020, 9% of energy consumption in buildings, compared to 2015 To reduce, by 2020, 35% of energy consumption in own stores, compared to 2015 To participate, starting in 2019, in a study on the impact of the introduction of 5G on radio field emissions. 126 05.

Promoting sustainable innovation Sustainability and Performance Strategy Development of products or services with environmental or social benefits At NOS, we are committed to developing or supporting the development of innovative IoT as strategic focus solutions, the use of which induces economic as well as environmental and social benefits. NOS is today a significant partner of national companies, as a result of a continued commitment to innovation and, in particular, IoT. This is a strategic area and in which we have worked in the most different layers, Low carbon solutions always with the objective of enhancing the services and operations of our customers. With a ratio of 1:10 between the carbon As priority areas of action we highlight: emissions it induces and the avoided the development of new products (e.g. emissions with the adoption of the products telemonitoring of chronic patients, smart and services that it provides, the information counters and bike sharing); improving the and communication technologies sector is customer experience (e.g. connection of essential in the fight against climate change. household equipment, waste management solutions and smart parking); collaboration To achieve the potential of digital technologies through innovation in workspaces (e.g. in the transition to a low carbon economic monitoring of space occupancy and use of model, we have developed, for the various equipment); and, finally, the optimization of customer segments, innovative solutions operations (e.g. energy efficiency and control that bring more functionality and productivity, of cold temperature systems). As an example, while reducing consumption and emissions. we highlight two projects developed in 2018. Virtualization solutions for call centres, which reduce material consumption and waste production; for energy management that reduce consumption in facilities and fleets; for collaboration and telecommuting that reduce travel; or for hosting and centralized data processing, which increase safety and efficiency in energy consumption are some of the examples of solutions we have been developing to fulfil this purpose. 130 06. Promoting sustainable innovation Sustainability and Performance Strategy Bicycles with NOS technology In 2018, we provided a technological solution (NOS Follow Asset +) for bicycles at the University of Évora, which enables real-time tracking and assets control in a quick and simple way, without the need for professional intervention. The solution, which features a high capacity internal battery and provides locations, it also allows to consult and control the use of bicycles in a quick and simple way, maximizing the profitability of the assets and enhancing the performance of the business. Remote rehabilitation project NOS, in partnership with SWORD Health, implemented a remote scanning project of chronic knee and shoulder rehabilitation therapies, the first of its kind at the national level, at the Leiria Central Hospital, through which 30 SWORD Phoenix systems were provided (tablets and software) along with their respective mobile data accesses. This new approach in the field of physical rehabilitation aims to address the main problems of current models, such as the dependence on scarce specialized human resources, difficulties of remote communication between therapist and patient and loss of information on patient performance in each rehabilitation session. technological solutions that address different Smart cities challenges and priorities.

In case of any discrepancy, the Portuguese version always prevails.) To the Board of Directors of NOS S.G.P.S., S.A. Introduction 1. We have been engaged by the Board of Directors of NOS S.G.P.S., SA to proceed with the independent review of the Non-Financial Information Statements on Sustainability Strategy and Performance (hereinafter the “Non-Financial Information Statements”) included in the “Report and Accounts 2018”, relating to the sustainability activities carried out from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018. Responsibilities 2. The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the “Non-Financial Information Statements”, and to maintain an appropriate internal control system that allows the information presented to be free of material misstatements due to fraud or error. 3. It is our responsibility to issue a limited assurance report, professional and independent, based on the procedures performed and described in the “Scope” section below. Scope 4. Our review procedures have been planned and executed in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3000, Revised) – “Assurance engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standard Board, for a limited level of assurance. 5. A limited assurance engagement consists mainly in the formulation of questions to those in charge of the organization and in analytical procedures, including review tests on a sample basis. Therefore, the assurance provided by these procedures is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Our independent review procedures comprised the following: ► Conducting interviews with Management, in order to understand how the information system is structured and assess their level of knowledge of the topics addressed in the report; ► Review of the processes, criteria and systems adopted to collect, consolidate, report and validate the data for the year 2018; ► Analytical review, on a sample basis, of the data calculated by Management, and verification of quantitative and qualitative information disclosed in the report; ► Confirmation on how collection, consolidation, validation and report procedures are being implemented in selected operating units; ► Verification of the conformity of the information included in the non-financial information statements with the results of our work.

Independent Assurance Report of the Consolidated Statement of Non – Financial Information 1 of January 2018 to 31 of December 2018 6. Regarding sustainability reporting standards of the Global Reporting Initiative – GRI Standards 2016, we performed a review of the self-evaluation made by Management of the adopted option to apply the GRI Standards 2016 and conformity with Article 508-G of the Portuguese Companies Act (Código das Sociedades Comerciais) and 245-A, paragraph r) of the Securities Market Code (Código do Mercado dos Valores Mobiliários) with respect to non-financial and diversity disclosures. Quality and independence 7. Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC 1), and consequently maintains a global quality control system which includes documented policies and procedures relating to compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and the legal and regulatory provisions applicable and we comply with the independence and ethical requirements of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) Code of Ethics and the Code of Ethics of the Order of Chartered Accountants (OROC). Conclusion 8. Based on our work, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the systems and procedures for the collection, consolidation, validation and reporting of the information included in the “Non-Financial Information Statements” are not operating appropriately and the information disclosed is not free from relevant material misstatements. Additionally, we concluded that the “Non-Financial Information Statements” include the required data and information for a Core option as defined by the GRI Standards 2016 and by the Article 508º G of the Portuguese Companies Act and paragraph r) of the article 245ºA of the Securities Market Code.

The Board of Directors believes that these financial statements give a true and fair 2. Accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are described below. These policies were consistently applied to all the financial years presented, unless otherwise stated. Principles of presentation The consolidated financial statements of NOS were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting an Union, in force as at 1 January 2018. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros as this is the main currency of the Group's operations and all amounts are presented in thousands of euros, except when referred to the financial statements of subsidiaries located abroad were converted into euros in accordance with the accounting policies described in Note 2.3.19. The consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis from the ledgers and accounting records of the companies included in the consolidation (Annex A)), using the historical cost convention, adjusted when necessary for the valuation of financial assets and liabilities (including derivatives) at their fair value (Note 2.3.22). In preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, the Board used estimates, assumptions, and critical judgments with impact on the value of assets and liabilities and the recognition of income and costs in each reporting period. Although these estimates were based on the best information available at the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements, current and future results may differ from these estimates. The areas involving a higher element of judgment and estimates are described in Note 3. The group presents a statement of financial position at the beginning of the previous comparative period when there is a retrospective application of an accounting policy, a retrospective restatement or a material reclassification of items in the financial statements. A statement of financial position is presented as 1 January 2017 due to retrospective application of accounting policies as a result of the adoption of the new accounting standard (IFRS 15). 170 In the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements, the NOS Group declares that it complies explicitly and without reservation with IAS/IFRS reporting standards and related SIC/IFRIC interpretations as approved by the European Union. Changes in accounting policies and disclosures The standards and interpretations that became effective as of 1 January 2018 are as follows: • for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). These amendments incorporate guidelines on the accounting treatment of cash-settled share-based payments, which follow the same approach of payments based and settled in shares. • endments complement the current options in the standard that can be used to bridge the concern related with the temporary volatility of the results. • beginning on or after 1 January 2018). The initial phase of IFRS 9 forecasts two types of measurement, amortised cost and fair value. All equity instruments are measured at fair value. A financial instrument is measured at amortised cost only if the company has it to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows represent principal and interest. Otherwise, financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit and loss. • riods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). This standard establishes a single, comprehensive framework for revenue recognition. The framework will be applied consistently across transactions, industries and capitals markets, and improve comparability in IFRS 15 replaces the following standards and interpretations: IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers and SIC-31 Revenue Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services. • on or after 1 January 2018). The clarifications presented are about the transition and not about changes in the underlying principles of the standard. • periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). Interpretations clarify the accounting for transactions that include the receipt or payment of advance consideration in a foreign currency. • or after 1 January 2018). The amendments clarify if a property under construction or development, which was previously classified as Inventories, can be transferred to investment property when there is an evident change in use. • Improvements to international financial reporting standards (2014-2016 cycle that is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017/2018). These improvements involve the review of various standards, highlight the following: 171 • IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of IFRS , an improvement that eliminated the short-term exemption for adopters for the first time in paragraphs E3-E7 of IFRS 1 because it served its purpose (which related to exemptions from some disclosures of financial instruments under IFRS 7, exemptions at the level of employee benefits and exemptions at the level of investment entities). These standards and changes had no material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements, except for IFRS 9 and IFRS 15. Impacts of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 was adopted by European Commission Regulation number 2067/2016 of 22 November 2016, with mandatory application for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. This standard replaced the requirements of IAS 39 and includes the following aspects: classification and measurement of financial assets; classification and measurement of financial liabilities; impairment; and hedge accounting. Classification and measurement of financial assets: • All financial assets are measured at fair value on the date of the initial recognition, adjusted for transaction costs in the case that instruments are not accounted for their fair value through profit or loss. However, customer accounts without a significant financing component are initially measured at their transaction value, as defined in IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. • Debt instruments are subsequently measured based on their contractual cash flows and the business model in which such instruments are held. If a debt instrument has contractual cash flows that are only the payments of principal and interest on the outstanding capital and is held within a business model with the purpose to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, then the instrument is accounted at amortized cost. If a debt instrument has contractual cash flows that are exclusively the payments of principal and interest on the outstanding capital and is held in a business model whose purpose is to collect contractual cash flows and the sale of financial assets, then the instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss with its subsequent reclassification to income. • All other debt instruments are subsequently accounted for its fair value through profit or loss. In addition, there is an option that allows financial assets, at initial recognition, to be designated as fair value through profit or loss if this eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting derecognition in the year's results. • Equity instruments are generally measured at fair value through profit or loss. However, entities have an irrevocable option, on an instrument-to-instrument basis, to present changes of the fair value of equity instruments, in the statement of comprehensive income (without subsequent reclassification Classification and measurement of financial liabilities: • For financial liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option, the amount of the change in the fair value of these financial liabilities that is attributable to changes in credit risk must be presented in the statement of comprehensive income. The remaining of the change in fair value shall be presented in profit or loss, unless the presentation of the change in the fair value related to the liability credit risk, in the statement of comprehensive income will create or • All remaining requirements of classification and measurement for financial liabilities of IAS 39 were carried forward to IFRS 9, including embedded derivatives separation rules and the criteria for using the fair value option. 172 Impairment • Impairment requirements are based on an expected credit loss model (ECL), which replaces the incurred loss model of IAS 39. • The ECL model applies to: (i) debt instruments accounted at amortized cost or at fair value through comprehensive income, (ii) the majority of loan commitments, (iii) financial guarantee contracts, (iv ) to contractual assets under IFRS 15 and (v) receivables from leases under IAS 17 Leases / IFRS 16 Leases. • Generally, entities are obliged to recognize ECLs related to 12 months or over their duration depending on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the initial recognition (or when the commitment or guarantee was entered into). For accounts receivable from customers without a significant financing component and depending on the choice of an entity's accounting which the ECL throughout the respective duration are always recognized. • The measurement of ECL should reflect the weighted probability of the result, the effect of the time value of money, and be based on reasonable and bearable information that is available at no cost or excessive effort. Hedge accounting • Coverage effectiveness tests should be prospective and may be qualitative, depending on the complexity of the coverage, without the 80% 125% test. • A risk component of a financial or non-financial instrument may be designated as the hedged item if the risk component is separately identifiable and reliably measurable. • The time value of an option, any forward element of a forward contract and any spread of foreign currency may be excluded from the designation as hedging instruments and be accounted as hedging costs. Larger sets of items can be designated as covered items, including layered designations and some liquid positions. The new standard replaces the previous IAS 39, having NOS Group recognized the cumulative effect, in the first period of application of the standard, as an adjustment to equity, in the opening balance sheet of the period in which the standard is adopted (on 1 December 2018). With the exception of hedge accounting, the standard requires its retrospective application, not being, however, mandatory to restate comparative information. For hedge accounting, the requirements of the standard are applied prospectively, with some exceptions. Transition The new standard replaces the previous IAS 39 and may be applied retrospectively for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. With the exception of hedge accounting, the standard requires its retrospective application, not being, however, mandatory to restate comparative information. For hedge accounting, the requirements of the standard are applied prospectively, with some exceptions. NOS Group adopted this standard on the effective date required (1 January 2018). 173 Financial impacts The main impacts of the application of IFRS 9 for the Group are due to the change in the methodology of calculation of the impairment losses with customers and other accounts receivable for an expected loss model (ECL), which considers the credit risk assessment since initial recognition. The measurement of ECL should reflect the weighted probability of profit or loss, the effect of the time value of money, and be based on reasonable and bearable information that is available at no cost or excessive effort. Impacts with this standard are presented in the tables below. Impacts of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and amended in September 2015 and April 2016 with mandatory application for the financial years beginning on or from 1 January 2018, with earlier application permitted. This standard establishes the principles that are to be applied for the recognition of the revenues and costs associated with the contracts with customers, based on a five-step model that will allow allocating the revenue to the performance obligations. According to IFRS 15, the revenue is recognised by a value that reflects the compensation that a company expects to have the right by exchanging a transfer of goods or services to a customer. Transition The new standard replace all the previous requests for the recognition of the revenue prescribed in the IFRS and can be applied retrospectively, with regard to periods that began on or after 1 January 2018 by adopting one of the following methods: i) complete retrospective application: it implies the restatement of all the comparatives periods; or ii) modified retrospective application: recognition of the cumulative effect during the first application period of the standard, as an adjustment to the equity, and during the opening balance of the period when the standard is adopted. NOS Group adopted the new standard on the effective date requested (1 January 2018), using the full retrospective method. Performance Obligations According to IFRS 15, at the inception of each contract, the entity should assess the goods or services that have been promised and identify as a performance obligation each promise of transfer to the customer of any good or service (or bundle of goods or services) that are distinct. The promises in contracts with clients might be explicit or implicit, as long as those promises create a valid expectation for the customer that the entity will transfer a good or service to the customer, based on published policies, specific declarations, or current commercial practices of the entity. Subsequently, the entity must distribute the transaction price to each performance obligation that is identified in the contract, based on the autonomous sales price, so that the allocation performed represents the amount of consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange of the transfer of the promised goods and services to the customer. According to IFRS 15, when determining the transaction price, the entity should adjust the amount of the revenue to the time effect of money if the timing of payments agreed between the parties provides the customer a significant financing benefit. NOS does not consider that there is a significant benefit component. 174 IFRS 15 also provides additional disclosures, both on performance obligations of the entity and determination of transaction based-price, and on assets and liabilities that its application will originate, implying a relevant increase of the disclosures on financial statements. Financial impacts The business segments in which NOS group operates are essentially telecommunications, advertising, cinema distribution and exhibition, and audiovisuals. The main impacts of the application of IFRS 15 occurred in the telecommunications segment, in which equipment and services are sold both by separated contracts and by packs of goods and services. Sale of mobile phones within telecommunications packs The sale of mobile phones is normally associated with telecommunications packs that include several services: television, internet, data, and equipment and are usually sold with significant discounts. According to the previous policy, the revenue was recognised in accordance with the value of the pack associated with each service. Therefore, the revenue that was associated with the equipment sale was recognised by the price paid by the customers and when the equipment is delivered (when all the risks and advantages inherent in the possession of the goods are transferred to the buyer). There were also situations in which equipments are provided to the customers under a free-lease agreement (rent-free). According to IFRS 15, and delivery of this equipment being a performance obligation, a part of the revenue from the contracts with customers is now allocated for complying with this obligation. It implies a higher revenue, at the initial moment of the contract, allocated to the sale of equipment, and a lower revenue during all the period of the contract of services provision. In other words, there is a transfer of services revenues to equipment revenues and an amendment of the period of the revenue recognition. With the application of IFRS 15, the revenue was anticipated and restated on 1 January 2017, that originated the establishment of an asset. Over time, it is expected that this asset (Note 17) remains at stable levels, since the impact of the new contracts will compensate with the impact of those that end. However, some short-term of volatility is estimated and results from the launch of new products. Commissions and other costs related to the soliciting of contracts According to the previous policy, the Group capitalised all the commissions that are paid to third parties and other costs related to the soliciting and loyalty of contracts with clients providing that the contracts have a loyalty period and the costs are amortised during the loyalty period of the contracts (predominantly 2 years). According to IFRS 15, the promises in contracts with customers may be explicit or implicit, so the capitalization of the costs related to soliciting of contracts is not restricted to the contracts that were signed with a loyalty period and that originate a capitalization of commissions and other costs that were previously recognised as costs. The commissions and other costs related to the soliciting of the contracts are amortised systematically and in a consistent manner with the transfer of goods and services to customers relative to the assets. The Group determined that a customer, on average, is a NOS customer for periods of either 2 to 4 years, depending on the business segment, so the amortisation period of the commissions and costs related to contracts soliciting has been amended from 2 years to 4 and 2 years. In addition to the adjustments that were previously described, the application of IFRS 15 implied the corresonding adjustment concerning deferred taxes. 175 The impacts of the adoption of IFRS 9 and 15 in the consolidated financial position statements are presented in the tables below: At 31 December 2016 IFRS 15 Revenue 31-12-2016 IFRS 15 31-12-2016 (recognition according with REPORTED Contract costs RESTATED performance obligations) ASSETS NON CURRENT ASSETS Tangible assets 1,158,181 (12,604) (79,169) 1,066,408 Intangible assets 1,158,779 (64,189) 1,094,590 Contract costs 176,182 176,182 Deferred income tax assets 117,302 8,667 125,969 Other assets 18,740 18,740 TOTAL NON CURRENT ASSETS 2,453,002 (12,604) 41,491 2,481,889 CURRENT ASSETS: Accounts receivable trade 348,926 348,926 Contract assets 47,136 47,136 Prepaid expenses 84,391 (28,957) 55,434 Other assets 445,248 445,248 TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS 529,639 18,179 547,818 TOTAL ASSETS 2,982,641 5,575 41,491 3,029,707 SHAREHOLDER'S EQUITY Share capital issued, premium and own shares 841,645 841,645 Other reserves and accumulated earnings 112,031 5,217 21,246 138,494 Net Income 90,381 (1,201) 3,172 92,352 EQUITY BEFORE NON CONTROLLING INTERESTS 1,044,057 4,016 24,418 1,072,491 Non-controlling interests 9,041 (1,266) 7,775 TOTAL EQUITY 1,053,098 4,016 23,152 1,080,266 LIABILITIES NON CURRENT LIABILITIES Deferred income tax liabilities 10,206 1,559 18,339 30,104 Other liabilities 1,158,490 1,158,490 TOTAL NON CURRENT LIABILITIES 1,168,696 1,559 18,339 1,188,594 TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES 760,847 760,847 TOTAL LIABILITIES 1,929,543 1,559 18,339 1,949,441 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDER´S EQUITY 2,982,641 5,575 41,491 3,029,707 176 At 31 December 2017 IFRS 15 Revenue 31-12-2017 (recognition according IFRS 15 31-12-2017 IFRS 9 REPORTED with performance Contract costs RESTATED obligations) ASSETS NON CURRENT ASSETS Tangible assets 1,137,209 (10,322) (82,948) 1,043,939 Intangible assets 1,141,104 (58,503) 1,082,601 Contract costs 170,797 170,797 Deferred income tax assets 99,538 8,163 1,654 109,355 Other assets 44,305 44,305 TOTAL NON CURRENT ASSETS 2,422,156 (10,322) 37,509 1,654 2,450,997 CURRENT ASSETS: Accounts receivable trade 406,904 (6,009) 400,895 Contract assets 47,424 47,424 Prepaid expenses 77,657 (31,130) 46,527 Other assets 60,350 60,350 TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS 544,911 16,296 (6,009) 555,198 TOTAL ASSETS 2,967,067 5,974 37,509 (4,355) 3,006,195 SHAREHOLDER'S EQUITY Share capital issued, premium and own shares 847,718 847,718 Other reserves and accumulated earnings 105,489 4,017 24,337 (4,339) 129,504 Net Income 124,094 306 (2,317) 122,083 EQUITY BEFORE NON CONTROLLING INTERESTS 1,077,301 4,324 22,020 (4,339) 1,099,306 Non-controlling interests 9,067 (1,245) (15) 7,807 TOTAL EQUITY 1,086,368 4,324 20,775 (4,354) 1,107,113 LIABILITIES NON CURRENT LIABILITIES Deferred income tax liabilities 7,140 1,650 16,733 25,523 Other liabilities 1,120,538 1,120,538 TOTAL NON CURRENT LIABILITIES 1,127,678 1,650 16,733 1,146,061 TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES 753,021 753,021 TOTAL LIABILITIES 1,880,699 1,650 16,733 1,899,082 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDER´S EQUITY 2,967,067 5,974 37,508 (4,354) 3,006,195 177 The impacts of adopting IFRS 15 in the Consolidated Statement of Income by nature are presented in the table below: Financial year ended on 31 December 2017 IFRS 15 Revenue 12M 17 IFRS 15 12M 17 (recognition according with REPORTED Contract costs RESTATED performance obligations) REVENUES: Services rendered 1,480,102 (20,654) 1,459,448 Sales 68,833 16,196 (1,258) 83,771 Other operating revenues 12,848 2,574 15,422 1,561,783 (1,885) (1,258) 1,558,640 COSTS, LOSSES AND GAINS: Direct costs 499,897 (1,042) 498,855 Costs of products sold 51,111 10,903 1,377 63,391 Support services 92,920 (69) 92,851 Supplies and external services 172,914 (9,066) 163,848 Depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses 422,211 (13,185) 10,910 419,936 Other costs, losses and gains 179,968 179,968 1,419,021 (2,282) 2,109 1,418,848 INCOME BEFORE FINANCIAL RESULTS AND TAXES 142,762 398 (3,367) 139,793 Financial results 1,061 1,061 INCOME BEFORE TAXES 141,701 398 (3,367) 138,732 Income taxes 17,480 92 (1,072) 16,500 NET CONSOLIDATED INCOME 124,221 306 (2,295) 122,232 ATTRIBUTABLE TO: NOS Group Shareholders 124,094 306 (2,317) 122,083 Non-controlling interests 128 21 149 EARNINGS PER SHARES Basic euros 0.24 0.24 Diluted euros 0.24 0.24 The impacts of the adoption of IFRS 9 in the consolidated statement of income by nature were null.

At the date of approval of these financial statements, the standards and interpretations endorsed by the European Union, with mandatory application in future financial years are the following: • beginning on or after 1 January 2019). Amendments to IFRS 9 clarify that a financial asset meets the SPPI criteria regardless of the event or circumstances that caused the anticipated termination of the contract and regardless of which party pays or receives reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract. • IFRS 16 (new option of early application). This standard sets out recognition, presentation, and disclosure of leasing contracts, defining a single accounting model. Aside from lower contracts than 12 months and low value (optional), leases should be accounted as an asset and a liability. • or after 1 January 2019). The interpretation addresses accounting for income taxes, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments that affect the application of the IAS 12. The interpretation is not applicable to taxes and charges that are outside the scope of the IAS 12, nor include specific requirements relating to interest and penalties associated with uncertainty over tax treatments. 178 Material impacts on the consolidated financial statements of the group of the application of these standards and amendments are not estimated, except for IFRS 16. Estimated impacts of IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 was issued in October 2017 and should be applied for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, early adoption being permitted. This standard establishes the form of recognition, presentation and disclosure of leases, defining a single model of recognition. Transition The new standard will replace all current requirements, principles of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases prescribed in IFRS, particularly in IAS 17 Leases and should be applied retrospectively, adopting one of the following methods: i) complete retrospective application: it implies the restatement of all comparatives periods; or ii) modified retrospective application: recognition of the cumulative effect, during the first period of application of the standard, as an adjustment to equity, and during the opening balance of the period when the standard is adopted. NOS Group will adopt the new standard at the effective date requested (1 January 2019), using the full retrospective method. Leases A lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that transfers the right to use an asset (the underlying asset), for a period of time, in exchange for a value. t the beginning of each contract, an entity shall evaluate and identify whether it is or contains a lease. This evaluation involves an exercise of judgment on whether each contract depends on a specific asset, if the entity substantially obtains all the economic benefits from the use of that asset and if the entity has the right to control the use of the asset. In the case of contracts that constitute or contain a lease, entities shall account for each component of the lease contained in the contract as a lease, separately from the other components of the contract that are not leases, unless the entity applies the practical expedient foreseen in the scope of the standard. NOS Group chose to separate non-lease components of the contract. IFRS 16 establishes that lessees account for all leases based on a single on-balance model recognition, similarly to the treatment that IAS 17 establishes for financial leases. The standard allows two exceptions to this model: (1) low value leases and (2) short term leases (i.e., with a lease term lower than 12 months). NOS Group did not adopt these exceptions. At the start date of the lease, the lessee recognizes the responsibility related to the lease payments (i.e, the lease liability) and the asset that represents the right to use the underlying asset during the lease period (i.e, Lessees will have to separately recognize the cost of interest on the lease liability and the depreciation of the ROU. Tenants should also remeasure the lease liability according to the occurrence of certain events (such as a change in the lease period, a change in future payments that result from a change in the reference rate or the rate used to determine such payments). The lessee will recognize the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment in the ROU. 179 The lessor's accounting remains substantially unchanged from the current treatment of IAS 17. The lessor continues to classify all leases using the same principles of IAS 17 and distinguishing between two types of leases: operational and financial. IFRS 16 also provides for additional disclosures about the assets and liabilities that their adoption will give rise to, whereby NOS Group anticipates a significant increase in the disclosures in the financial statements. Financial impacts The business segments in which NOS Group operates are essentially telecommunications, advertising, cinema distribution and exhibition, and audiovisuals. It is estimated by the group that the impacts of the application of IFRS 16 occur in all the segments, with particular impact on leasing contracts for telecommunications towers, movie theaters, equipments, stores and vehicles. Additionally, from the application of IFRS 16, there will be a corresponding adjustment on taxes. The impacts estimated by the Group, from the application of IFRS 16, are as follows: 2018 IFRS16 2018 ITEMS REPORTED IMPACT RESTATED Revenues 1,576,161 1,576,161 Operating costs* 984,397 (32,544) 951,853 Depreciations and amortisations 390,001 31,434 421,435 Income before financial results and taxes 200,773 1,110 201,883 Financial income 16,594 6,537 23,131 Income taxes 29,276 (1,798) 27,478 Net Consolidated Income** 141,405 (3,628) 137,777 Asset 2,925,543 133,441 3,058,984 Other reserves and accumulated earnings 86,909 (26,553) 60,356 Liabilities 1,841,661 163,622 2,005,283 * Before depreciations, amortisations and impairment losses, integration costs, losses/(gains) with disposal of assets, net and other costs/(gains) non-recurrent. **Excluding minority interests. The following standards, interpretations, amendments, and revisions, with mandatory application in future financial years have not yet been endorsed by the European Union, at the date of approval of these financial statements: • IAS 1 e IAS 8 (amendment), Definition of material (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The intent of amending the standard is to clarify the definition of material and to align the definition used in international financial reporting standards. • IFRS 3 (amendment), Business Combinations (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The intent of the amendment to the standard is to overcome the difficulties that arise when an entity determines whether it has acquired a business or a set of assets. • IFRS 17 general objective of IFRS 17 is to provide a more serviceable and consistent accounting model for insurance contracts between entities that issue them globally. 180 • or after 1 January 2019, and early application is permitted). The objective of the amendment is to harmonise the accounting practices and provide relevant information on decision-making. • 2019. The improvement clarified that (i) a company that is a risk capital company, or any other qualifying company, might choose to measure, its investments in associates and/or joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss at the moment of initial recognition and in relation to each investment. (ii) If a company that is not itself an investment entity holds an interest in an associate or joint venture that is an investment entity, the company might decide to maintain the fair value that those associates apply when measuring its subsidiaries by the application of the equity method. This option is taken separately for each investment on the later date considering (a) the initial recognition of the investment in that subsidiary; (b) this subsidiary as becoming an investment entity; and (c) when that subsidiary will be a parent company. • Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards (2015-2017 cycle) that is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The improvements involve the review of the IFRS 3 Business combination interest previously held in a joint operation, IFRS 11 Joint arrangements interest previously held in a joint operation, IAS 12 Income taxes consequences for income tax resulting from payments for financial instruments, which are classified as equity instruments and IAS 23 Borrowing costs borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. • Improvements to international financial reporting standards (issued on 29 March 2018, to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). These improvements involve reviewing various standards. The Group has been evaluating the impact of these amendments. It will apply this standard once it becomes effective or when earlier application is permitted. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2018, the Group changed the presentation caption of costs related to costs directly related to the operational activity of this business segment. This change had no impact in the consolidated statements were restated from 1 January 2017, with 7,196 thousand euros being the amount reclassified as at 31 December 2017. Bases of consolidation Controlled companies Controlled companies were consolidated by the full consolidation method. Control is deemed to exist when the Group is exposed or has rights, because of their involvement, to a variable return of the entity's activities, and has capacity to affect this return through the power over the entity. Namely, when the Company directly or indirectly holds a majority of the voting rights at a General Meeting of Shareholders or has the power to determine the financial and operating policies. In situations where the Company has, in substance, control of other entities created for a specific purpose, although it does not directly hold equity in them, such entities are consolidated by the full consolidation method. The entities in these situations are listed in Annex A). the consolidated statement of financial position and in the consolidated statement, respectively, under the 181 The identifiable acquired assets and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective of the existence of non-controlled and liabilities is stated in Goodwill. When the acquisition cost is less than the fair value of the identified net assets, the difference is recorded as a gain in the income statement in the period in which the acquisition occurs. The interests of minority shareholders are initially recognised as their proportion of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities. On the acquisition of additional equity shares in companies already controlled by the Group, the difference between the share of capital acquired and the corresponding acquisition value is recognised directly in equity. When an increase in position in the capital of an associated company results in the acquisition of control, with the latter being included in the consolidated financial statements by the full consolidation method, the share of the fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities, corresponding to the percentages previously held, is stated in the income statement. The directly attributable transaction costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss. The results of companies acquired or sold during the year are included in the income statements as from the date of obtaining control or until the date of their disposal, respectively. Intercompany transactions, balances, unrealised gains on transactions and dividends distributed between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction shows evidence of impairment of the transferred asset. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of controlled companies in order to align their accounting policies with those of the Group. Jointly controlled companies The classification of investments as jointly controlled companies is determined based on the existence of shareholder agreements, which show and regulate the joint control. Financial investments of jointly controlled companies (Annex C)) are stated by the equity method. Under this method, financial investments are adjusted periodically by an amount corresponding to the share in the net profits of jointly controlled companies, as a cont financial results and taxes. Direct changes in the post-acquisition equity of jointly controlled companies are recognised as the value of the shareholding as a contra entry in reserves, in equity. Additionally, financial investments may also be adjusted for recognition of impairment losses. Any excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets and liabilities (goodwill) is recorded as part of the financial investment of jointly controlled companies and subject to impairment testing when there are indicators of loss of value. When the acquisition cost is less than the fair value of the identified net assets, the difference is recorded as a gain in the income statement in the period in which the acquisition occurs. Losses in jointly controlled companies, which exceed the investment made in them, are not recognised, except when the Group has entered into undertakings with that company. Dividends received from these companies are recorded as a reduction in the value of the financial investments. 182 Associated companies An associated company is a company in which the Group exercises significant influence through participation in decisions about its financial and operating policies, but in which does not have control or joint control. Any excess of the acquisition cost of a financial investment over the fair value of the identifiable net assets is recorded as goodwill and is added to the value of the financial investment and its recovery is reviewed annually or whenever there are indications of possible loss of value. When the acquisition cost is less than the fair value of the identified net assets, the difference is recorded as a gain in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the acquisition occurs. Financial investments in the majority of associated companies (Annex B)) are stated by the equity method. Under this method, financial investments are adjusted periodically by an amount corresponding to the share income statement. Direct changes in the post-acquisition equity of associated companies are recognised as the value of the shareholding as a contra entry in reserves, in equity. Additionally, financial investments may also be adjusted for recognition of impairment losses. Losses in associated companies, which exceed the investment made in them, are not recognised, except when the Group has entered into undertakings with that associated company. Dividends received from these companies are recorded as a reduction in the value of the financial investments. Balances and transactions between group companies Balances and transactions as well as unrealised gains between Group companies, and between them and the parent company, are eliminated in the consolidation. The part of unrealised gains arising from transactions with associated companies or jointly controlled companies attributable to the Group is eliminated in the consolidation. Unrealised losses are similarly eliminated except when they show evidence of impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies Segment reporting As stipulated in IFRS 8, the Group presents operating segments based on internally produced management information. Operating segments are reported consistently with the internal management information model provided to the chief operating decision maker of the Group, who is responsible for allocating resources to the segment and for assessing its performance, and for taking strategic decisions. Classification of the statement of financial position and income statement Realisable assets and liabilities due in less than one year from the date of the statement of financial position are classified as current in assets and liabilities, respectively. In accordance with IAS 1, Integration costs , Losses / (gains) on disposal of assets and Other non-recurring costs / (gains) reflect unusual costs, should be disclosed separately from the usual cost lines, in order to avoid distortion of the financial information from regular operations. 183 Tangible assets Tangible assets are stated at acquisition cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, when applicable. Acquisition cost includes, in addition to the purchase price of the asset: (i) costs directly attributable to the purchase; and (ii) the estimated costs of decommissioning and removal of the assets and restoration of the site, which in Group applies to the cinema operation business, telecommunication towers and offices (Notes 2.3.12 and 8). Estimated losses resulting from the replacement of equipment before the end of its useful life due to technological obsolescence are recognised by a deduction, from the corresponding asset as a contra entry in profit and loss. The costs of current maintenance and repairs are recognised as a cost when they are incurred. Significant costs incurred on renovations or improvements to the asset are capitalised and depreciated over the corresponding estimated payback period when it is probable that there will be future economic benefits associated with the asset and when these can be measured reliably. Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets (or discontinued operations), are classified as held for sale if their value is realisable through a sale transaction rather than through their continued use. This situation is deemed to arise only when: (i) the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition; (ii) the Group has given an undertaking to sell; and (iii) it is expected that the sale will be realised within 12 months. In this case, non-current assets are valued at the lesser of their book value or their fair value less the sale costs. ceases and they are classified as non-current assets held for sale. Gains and losses on disposals of tangible assets, corresponding to the difference between the sale price and the net book value, are recognised in Depreciation Tangible assets are depreciated from the time they are completed or ready to be used. These assets, less their residual value, are depreciated by the straight-line method, in twelfths, from the month in which they become available for use, according to the useful life of the assets defined as their estimated utility. The depreciation rates used correspond to the following estimated useful lives: 2017 2018 (YEARS) (YEARS) Buildings and other constructions 2 50 2 50 Technical equipment: Network Installations and equipment 7 40 7 40 Terminal equipment 2-8 2-8 Other technical equipment 1 16 1 16 Transportation equipment 3-4 3-4 Administrative equipment 2 10 2 10 Other tangible assets 4-8 4-8 Intangible assets and Contract costs Intangible assets and Charges of contracts with costumers are stated at acquisition cost, less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, when applicable. Recognised only when they generate future economic benefits for the Group and when they can be measured reliably. 184 Intangible assets consist mainly of goodwill and utilisation rights of satellite and distribution network capacity, customer portfolios, telecom and software licenses, content utilisation rights and other contractual rights. Contract costs consist mainly of commissions paid to third parties and charges incurred with the customer loyalty contracts acquisition. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the net fair value of the assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, jointly controlled company or associated company at the acquisition date, in accordance with IFRS 3. he case of a jointly controlled company or an associated company. Goodwill is not amortised and is subject to impairment tests at least once a year, on a specified date, and e statement of financial position which may result in a possible loss of value. Any impairment loss is recorded immediately in the For the purposes of impairment tests, goodwill is attributed to the cash-generating units to which it is related (Note 9), which may correspond to the business segments in which the Group operates, or a lower level. Internally generated intangible assets Internally generated intangible assets, including expenditure on research, are expensed when they are incurred. Research and development costs are only recognised as assets when the technical capability to complete the intangible asset is demonstrated and when it is available for use or sale. Industrial property and other rights Assets classified under this item relate to the rights and licenses acquired under contract by the Group to third parties and used in realising the Group's activities, and include: • Satellite capacity utilisation rights; • Distribution network utilisation rights; • Telecom licenses; • Software licenses; • Customer portfolios; • Costs of obtaining and to fulfil a contract with a customer (e.g., customer acquisition and other costs of procurement and installation); • Content utilisation rights; • Other contractual rights. The content exploration rights are recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position, as intangible assets, when the following conditions are fulfilled: (i) there is control over the content, (ii) the Company has the right to choose the way to explore the content, and (iii) it is available for exhibition. The conclusion of contracts relating to sports contents, which are not immediately available, originates rights that are initially classified as contractual commitments. 185 In the specific case of broadcasting rights of sports competitions, these are recognised as assets when the necessary conditions to organise each sports competition are present, which occurs in the homologation date of the participating teams in the competition that is being held in the sports season to be initiated, by the organizing entity, taking into consideration that it is from that date that the conditions for the recognition of an asset are present, namely, the unequivocal attainment of the exploration rights of the games of the stated the month in which they are available for use. Resulting from agreements concluded for the cession of the exclusive rights to exploit sports content, and as it is permitted by IAS 1, since 2017, NOS presents the net assets and liabilities of the values ceded to other operators, considering that this compensation best reflects the substance of the transactions. Intangible assets in-progress Group companies periodically carry out an impairment assessment of intangible assets in-progress. This impairment assessment is also carried out whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the amount at which the asset is recorded may not be recoverable. When such indications exist, the Group calculates the recoverable value of the asset in order to determine the existence and extent of the impairment loss. Amortisation These assets are amortised by the straight-line method, in twelfths, from the beginning of the month in which they become available for use. The amortisation rates used correspond to the following estimated useful lives: 2017 2018 (YEARS) (YEARS) Period of the Period of the Rights of using capacities contract contract Telecom licences 30 to 33 30 to 33 Software licences 1 to 8 1 to 8 Customer portfolios 5 to 6 5 to 6 Costs of obtaining and to fulfil a contract with a customer 2 to 4 2 to 4 Period of the Period of the Content utilization rights contract contract Other 1 to 8 1 to 8 Impairment of non-current assets, excluding goodwill Group companies periodically carry out an impairment assessment of non-current assets. This impairment assessment is also carried out whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the amount at which the asset is recorded may not be recoverable. When such indications exist, the Group calculates the recoverable value of the asset in order to determine the existence and extent of the impairment loss. The recoverable value is estimated for each asset individually or, if that is not possible, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows to the cash-generating unit to which the asset a cash-generating unit, except for the assets allocated to the cinema exhibition business, which are grouped into regional cash-generating units. The recoverable amount is calculated as the higher of the net sale price and the current use value. The net sale price is the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in a transaction between independent and knowledgeable entities, less the costs directly attributable to the sale. The current use value 186 is the current value of the estimated future cash flows resulting from continued use of the asset or of the cash-generating unit. When the amount at which the asset is recorded exceeds its recoverable value, it is recognised as an impairment loss. The reversal of impairment losses recognised in previous years is recorded when there are indications that these losses no longer exist or have decreased. The reversal of impairment losses is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the year in which it occurs. However, an impairment loss can only be reversed up to the amount that would be recognised (net of amortisation or depreciation) if no impairment loss had been recorded in previous years. Financial assets Financial assets are recognised in the statement of financial position of the Group on the trade or contract date, which is the date on which the Group undertakes to purchase or sell the asset. Initially, with the exception of commercial accounts receivable, financial assets are recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs, except for assets at fair value through income in which transaction costs are immediately recognised in income. Trade accounts receivable, at the initial time, are recognised at their transaction price, as defined in IFRS 15. expire; (ii) the Group has substantially transferred all the risks and benefits associated with their ownership; or (iii) although it retains part but not substantially all of the risks and benefits associated with their ownership, the Group has transferred control of the assets. The financial assets and liabilities are offset and shown as a net value when, and only when, the Group has the right to offset the recognised amounts and intends to settle for the net value. The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets measured at amortised cost, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. Its classification depends on the entity's business model to manage the financial assets and the contractual characteristics in terms of the cash flows of the financial asset. Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss This category includes financial derivatives and equity instruments that the Group has not classified as financial assets through other comprehensive income at the time of initial recognition. This category also includes all financial instruments whose contractual cash flows are not exclusively capital and interest. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of assets measured at fair value through profit or loss the income from interest and dividends. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are those that are part of a business model whose objective is achieved through the collection of contractual cash flows and the sale of financial assets, being that these contractual cash flows are only capital and interest reimbursement on the capital in debt. Financial assets measured at amortised cost Financial assets measured at amortised cost are those that are included in a business model whose purpose is to hold financial assets in order to receive the contractual cashflows, being that these contractual cash flows are only capital reimbursement and interest payments on the capital in debt. 187 Cash and cash equivalents cash, bank deposits, term deposits and other investments with maturities of less than three months which may be immediately realisable and with a negligible risk of change of value. Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to their contractual substance irrespective deducting the liabilities. The equity instruments issued by Group companies are recorded at the amount received, net of the costs incurred in their issue. Financial liabilities are recognised only when extinguished, i.e. when the obligation is settled, cancelled, or extinguished. In accordance with IFRS 9, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for: a) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. These liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, should subsequently be measured at fair value; b) Financial liabilities that arise when a transfer of a financial asset does not meet the conditions for derecognition or when it is applied the continued involvement approach; c) Financial guarantee contracts; d) The commitments to grant a loan at a lower interest rate than the market; e) The recognised contingent consideration by a buyer in a concentration of business activities to which IFRS 3 applies. Such contingent consideration shall be subsequently measured at fair value, with changes recognised in profit or loss. Financial liabilities of the Group include: borrowings, accounts payable and derivative financial instruments. Impairment of financial assets At the date of each financial position statement, the Group analyses and recognises expected losses on its debt securities, loans and accounts receivable. The expected loss results from the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The objective of this impairment policy is to recognise expected credit losses over the respective duration of financial instruments that have undergone significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition, assessed on an individual or collective basis, taking into account all reasonable and sustainable information, including prospects. If, at the reporting date, the credit risk associated with a financial instrument has not increased significantly since the initial recognition, the Group measures the provision for losses relating to that financial instrument by an amount equivalent to the expected credit losses within a period of 12 months. For receivables and assets resulting from contracts under IFRS 15, the Group adopts the simplified approach when calculating expected credit losses. As a result, the Group does not monitor changes in credit risk, recognizing instead impairment losses based on the expected credit loss on each reporting date. The Group presents an impairment loss criterion based on the history of credit losses, adjusted by specific prospective factors for the clients and the economic environment. 188 Derivative financial instruments Initial and subsequent recognition The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as exchange rate forward contracts, interest rate swaps, to cover its exchange rate risks, interest, respectively. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value on the date the derivative is contracted and are subsequently measured at fair value. Derivatives are presented in assets when their fair value is positive and in liabilities when their fair value is negative. In terms of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: • Fair value hedge when the purpose is to hedge the exposure to fair value changes of a registered asset • Cash flow hedge when the purpose is to hedge the exposure to cash flow variability arising from a specific risk associated with the whole or a component of a registered asset or liability or an anticipated • Coverage of a net investment in a foreign operational unit. NOS Group uses derivative financial instruments with fair value and cash flow hedges. At the beginning of the hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedging relationship for which hedge accounting is intended to apply as well as the management and strategy purpose of such hedge. Before 1 January 2018, the documentation included the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the hedged risk and the manner in which the Group assessed the effectiveness of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument according with the Group's exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedge item or cash flows arising from the hedged risk. Such hedges should be highly effective to compensate changes in fair values or cash flows and would be assessed on a continuing basis in order to demonstrate their highly effectiveness over the reporting period. Beginning 1 January 2018, the documentation includes the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Group will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements: i) ii) relationship; and iii) The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedges that quantity of hedged item. Hedges that meet all the quantifying criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for, as described bellow: Fair value hedges The change in the fair value of a hedging instrument is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognised in the statement of profit or loss. 189 For fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortised cost, any adjustment to carrying value is amortised through profit or loss over the remaining term of the hedge using the EIR method. The EIR amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss. When an unrecognised firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. Cash flow hedges The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in OCI in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item. The Group uses forward contracts of: i) currency contracts for its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments; ii) interest rates to cover the risk of volatility of the interest rates; iii) own shares contracts for its exposure to volatility in own shares to be distributed within the scope of share reign In the financial year of 2018, the Group did not make any changes in the recognition method. The amounts accumulated in OCI are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the separate component of equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and will not be recognised in OCI for the period. This also applies where the hedged forecast transaction of a nonfinancial asset or nonhedge accounting is applied. For any other cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in OCI must remain in accumulated OCI if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Otherwise, the amount will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. After discontinuation, once the hedged cash flow occurs, any amount remaining in accumulated OCI must be accounted for depending on the nature of the underlying transaction as described above. Inventories Inventories, which mainly include mobile phones, customer terminal equipment, DVDs, and content broadcasting rights, are valued at the lower of their cost or net realisable value. The acquisition cost includes the invoice price, freight, and insurance costs, using the weighted average cost as the method of costing goods sold. 190 Inventories are adjusted for technological obsolescence, as well as for the difference between the purchase cost and the net realisable value, whichever is the lower, and this reduction is recognised directly in the income statement. The net realisable value corresponds to the normal sale price less restocking costs and selling costs. The differences between the cost and the corresponding net realisable value of inventories, when this is less Inventories in transit, since they are not available for consumption or sale, are separated out from other inventories and are valued at their specific acquisition cost. The signing of contracts related with sports content originates rights that are initially classified as contractual commitments. The content broadcasting rights are recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position, as Inventories, in the event of the nonexistence of full right over the way of exploration of the asset, by the respective value of cost or net realisable value, whenever it is lower, when programmatic content has been received and is available for exhibition or use, according to contractual conditions, without any production or change, given that the necessary conditions for the organization of each sports competition are present, which occurs in the homologation date of the participating teams in the competition that is being held in the sports season to be initiated, by the organizing entity. The stated rights are recognised in the income obtained through their commercial exploration. Due to the agreement between the three national operators of reciprocal availability, for several sports 41), NOS considered the recognition of the costs, excluding those divided by the remaining operators, on a systematic basis, given the pattern of economic benefits obtained through their commercial exploration. Subsidies Subsidies are recognised at their fair value when there is a reasonable assurance that they will be received and Group companies will meet the requirements for their award. Operating subsidies, mainly for employee training, are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income by deduction from the corresponding costs incurred. Investment subsidies are recognised in the statement of financial position as deferred income. If the subsidy is considered as deferred income, it is recognised as income on a systematic and rational basis during the useful life of the asset. Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised when: (i) there is a present obligation arising from past events and it is likely that in settling that obligation, the expenditure of internal resources will be necessary; and (ii) the amount or value of such obligation can be reasonably estimated. When one of the above conditions is not met, the Group discloses the events as a contingent liability unless the likelihood of an outflow of funds resulting from this contingency is remote, in which case they are not disclosed. Provisions for legal procedures taking place against the Group are made in accordance with the risk assessments carried out by the Group and by their legal advisers, based on success rates. 191 Provisions for restructuring are only recognised when the Group has a detailed, formal plan, which identify the main features of the restructuring programme, and after these facts have been reported to the entities involved. Provisions for dismantling costs, removal of assets and restoration of the site are recognised when the assets are installed, in line with the best estimates available at that date. The amount of the provisioned liability reflects the effects of the passage of time and the corresponding financial indexing is recognised in results as a financial cost. Obligations that result from onerous contracts are registered and measured as provisions. There is an onerous contract when the Company is an integral part of the provisions of an agreement contract, which entail costs that cannot be avoided and exceed the economic benefits derived from the agreement. Provisions for potential future operating losses are not covered. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements, unless the exception provided under IFRS 3 business combination, and are disclosed whenever there is a good chance to shed resources including economic benefits. Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements, being disclosed when there is a likelihood of a future influx of financial resources. Provisions are reviewed and brought up to date at the date of the statement of financial position to reflect the best estimate at that time of the obligation concerned. Leases Leasing contracts are classified as: (i) finance leases, if substantially all the risks and benefits incident to ownership of the corresponding assets concerned have been transferred; or (ii) operating leases, if not all risks and rewards incident to ownership of those assets have been substantially transferred. The classification of leases as finance or operating leases is made based on substance rather than contractual form. The assets acquired under finance leases, the corresponding liabilities are recorded using the financial method, and the assets, related accumulated depreciation, and pending debts are recorded in accordance with the contractual finance plan. In addition, the interest included in the rentals and the depreciation of the tangible and intangible assets are recognised in the income statement for the period to which they relate. In the case of operating leases, the rentals due are recognised as costs in the income statement over the period of the leasing contract. Income tax NOS is covered by the special tax regime for groups of companies, which covers all the companies in which it directly or indirectly owns at least 75% of the share capital and which simultaneously are resident in Portugal and subject to Corporate Income Tax (IRC). The remaining subsidiaries not covered by the special tax regime for groups of companies are taxed individually based on their respective taxable incomes and the applicable tax rates. Income tax is stated in accordance with the IAS 12 criteria. In calculating the cost relating to income tax for the period, in addition to current tax, allowance is also made for the effect of deferred tax calculated in accordance with the liability method, taking into account the temporary differences resulting from the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their values as stated in the consolidated financial statements, and the tax losses carried forward at the date of the statement of financial position. The 192 deferred income tax assets and liabilities were calculated based on the tax legislation currently in force or of legislation already published for future application. As stipulated in the above standard, deferred income tax assets are recognised only when there is reasonable assurance that these may be used to reduce future taxable profit, or when there are deferred income tax liabilities whose reversal is expected to occur in the same period in which the deferred income tax assets are reversed. At the end of each period an assessment is made of deferred income tax assets, and these are adjusted in line with the likelihood of their future use. The amount of tax to be included, either in current tax or in deferred tax resulting from transactions or events recognised in equity accounts, is recorded directly under those items and does not affect the results for the period. In a business combination, the deferred tax benefits acquired are recognised as follows: a) The deferred tax benefits acquired recognised in the measurement period of one year after the date of merger and that result from new information about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition are recorded against the goodwill-carrying amount related to the acquisition. If the goodwillcarrying amount is null, any remaining deferred tax benefits are recognised in the income statement. b) All the other acquired deferred tax benefits performed are recognised in the income statement (when applicable, directly Share-based payments The benefits granted to employees under share purchase or share option incentive plans are recorded in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments. In accordance with IFRS 2, since it is not possible to reliably estimate the fair value of the services received from employees, their value is measured by reference to the fair value of equity instruments in accordance with their share price at the grant date. The cost is recognised, linearly over the period in which the service is provided by employees, under the in equity. The accumulated cost recognised at the date of each statement of financial position up to the vesting reflects the best estimate of the number of own shares that will be vested, weighted by the tire elapse between the grant and the vesting. The impact on the income statement each year corresponds to the accumulated cost valuation between the beginning and the end of the year. In turn, benefits granted based on shares but paid in cash lead to the recognition of a liability valued at fair value at the date of the statement of financial position. Equity Legal reserve Portuguese commercial legislation requires that at least 5% of annual net profit must be appropriated to a legal reserve until it represents at least 20% of the share capital. This reserve is not distributable, except in case of liquidation, but can be used to absorb losses, after having exhausted all other reserves and to increase share capital. 193 Share premium reserves Issue of shares corresponds to premiums from the issuance or capital increases. According to Portuguese law, share premiums follow the treatment given to the Legal reserve , that is, the values are not distributable, except in case of liquidation, but can be used to absorb losses after having exhausted all other reserves and to increase share capital. Reserves for plans of medium term incentive According to IFRS 2 Share-based payments , the responsibility with the medium-term incentive plans settled by delivery of own shares is recorded as credit under Reservations for mid-term incentive plans and such reserve is not likely to be distributed or used to absorb losses. Hedging reserves Hedging reserve reflects the changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges that are considered effective, and they are not likely to be distributed or be used to absorb losses. Own shares reserves legal reserve. Under Portuguese law, the amount of distributable reserves is determined according to the individual financial statements of the company prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the increases resulting from the application of fair value through equity components, including its application through the net profit can only be distributed when the elements that originated them are sold, exercised liquidated or when the end their use, in the case of tangible assets or intangible assets. Own shares The own shares are recorded at acquisition cost as a deduction from equity. Gains or losses on the sale of own shares are recorded under Other reserves . Retained results This item includes the results available for distribution to shareholders and earnings per fair value in financial instruments increases, financial investments and investment properties, which, in accordance with paragraph 2 of article 32 of the CSC, will only be available for distribution when the elements or rights that originated them are sold, exercised, terminated, or settled. Revenue The main types of revenue of NOS subsidiaries are as follows: i) Revenues of Telecommunications Services: Cable television, fixed broadband and fixed voice: The revenues from services provided using the fibre optic cable network result from: (a) basic channel subscription packages that can be sold in a bundle with fixed broadband/fixed voice services; (b) premium channel subscription packages and S-VOD; (c) terminal equipment rental; (d) consumption of content (VOD); (e) traffic and voice termination; (f) service activation; (g) sale of equipment; and (h) other additional services (ex: firewall, antivirus). Satellite television: Revenues from the satellite television service mainly result from: (a) basic and premium channel subscription packages; (b) equipment rental; (c) consumption of content (VOD); (d) service activation; and (e) sale of equipment. Mobile broadband and voice services: Revenues from mobile broadband Internet access services and mobile voice services result mainly from monthly subscriptions and/or usage of the Internet and voice service, as well as the traffic associated with the type chosen by the client. 194 ii) Advertising revenue: Advertising revenues mainly derive from the attraction of advertising for Pay TV channels to which the Group has publicity rights and in cinemas. These revenues are recognised from when they are received, taken off any discounts given. iii) Film showings and distribution: Distribution revenue pertains to the distribution of films to film exhibitors not distributed by the Group, that are included in the film showings, whilst income from film showings mostly derive from cinema ticket sales and the product sales in the bars; the film showings revenue includes the revenue from ticket sales and bar sales respectively. iv) Revenue from producing and distributing channel content: Revenue from production and distribution essentially includes the sale of DVDs, the sale of content and the distribution of television channels subscriptions to third parties and count from the time at which they are sold, shown, and made available for distribution to telecommunications operators, respectively. v) Consultancy and datacentre management: information systems consultancy and datacentre management are the major services rendered by NOS Sistemas. The Group's revenue is based on the five-step model established by IFRS 15: 1) Identification of the contract with the customer; 2) Identification of performance obligations; 3) Determining the price of the transaction; 4) Allocation of the price of the transaction to the performance obligations; and 5) Recognition of revenue. Thus, at the beginning of each contract, the NOS Group evaluates the promised goods or services and identifies, as a performance obligation, every promise of transfer to the customer of any distinct good or service (or package of goods or services). These promises in customer contracts may be express or implied, provided such promises create a valid expectation in the client that the entity will transfer a good or service to the customer, based on the entity's published policies, specific statements or usual business practices. The NOS Group has internally defined that a performance obligation corresponds to the promise of delivery of a good or service that can be used in an isolated/separated way by the customer and on which there is a clear perception of this good or service by the customer among the available in each contract. The main performance obligations are summarized as Sales of Mobile Phones, Telephones, Hotspots, DVD's, Movie Tickets and Other Equipment and the Services Rendered of Mobile Internet Services, Fixed Internet, Mobile Phone, Landline Phone, Television, Consulting, Cloud/ IT Services, distribution of audio-visual rights among others. The provision of Set-top-boxes, routers, modems and other terminal equipment at the customers' home and respective installation and activation services were considered by the group as not corresponding to a performance obligation, since they are necessary actions to fulfil the promised performance obligation. In determining and allocating the transaction price of each performance obligation, NOS used stand-alone prices of the promised products and services at the time of entering into the agreement with the customer to distribute the amount expected to be received under the contract. The recognition of revenue occurs at the time of performance of each performance obligation. Revenue from selling equipment are included when the buyer takes on the risks and advantages of taking possession of goods and the value of the benefits are reasonably quantified. Revenue from telecom services subscriptions (TV, internet, mobile and fixed voice services bundle subscription, individually or as a bundle) is recognised linearly over the subscription period. 195 Revenue from equipment rental is recognised linearly over the rental agreement, except in the case of instalment sales, which are accounted as credit sales. The Group attributes to its customers, loyalty points that might be exchanged, over a limited period, for discounts in equipment purchase. These points represent a deferred income, until the date when the points are definitely converted into benefits, as its utilization implies an additional retention. The fair value of the liability is calculated based on an estimated utilisation point rate and an average cost per point, taking into consideration the available points at the date of each report. Revenue related with traffic, roaming, data usage, audiovisual content, and others is recognised when the service is rendered. The Group also offers various personalised solutions, particularly to its corporate customers in telecom management, access, voice, and data transmission services. These personalised solutions are also recognised when the service is rendered. Unless demanded or allowed by IFRS, the compensation of revenues and costs is not performed, namely, when it reflects the nature of the transaction or other event. The compensation of revenues and costs is performed in the following situations: (i) When the gross inflows from economic benefits do not result in equity increases to the Group, i.e., the amount charged to the customer is equal to the amount delivered to the partner. This situation is applicable to the revenue obtained by the invoicing special services operators, in these cases the amounts charged on account of the capital are not revenue; and, (ii) a product or services in order for it to be commercialised. Thus, a counterpart of a contract will not be a customer if, for instance, the counterpart has hired from NOS to participate in an activity or process in activities result. These cases are designated collaborative arrangements. This situation is applicable to revenues from operators affected by the reciprocal availability agreement regarding broadcasting rights of sports content. Discounts granted to customers related with loyalty programmes are allocated to the entire retention contract to which the customer is committed to. Therefore, the discount is recognised as the goods and services made available to the customer. Amounts that have not been invoiced for are included based on estimates. The differences between the estimated amounts and the actual amounts, which are normally immaterial, are recorded in the next financial year. Until 31 December 2014, revenue from penalties, due to the inherent uncertainties, was recorded only at the moment it was received, and the amount was disclosed as a contingent asset (Note 44). From 1 January 2015, Revenue from penalties is recognised based on an estimated collectability rate, taking into account the Group's collection history. Revenue from penalties is recognised under Other revenues . Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest method, only when they generate future economic benefits for the Group and when they can be measured reliably. Accruals accruals principle, under which they are recognised as they are generated or incurred, regardless of when they are received or paid. The costs and revenues related to the current period and whose expenses and income will only occur in 196 already occurred that relate to future periods, which will be recognised in each of those periods, for the corresponding amount. The costs related to the current period and whose expenses will only occur in that future periods are value is classified as Provisions (Note 2.3.12). Assets, liabilities and transactions in foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are converted into the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transactions dates. On each accounting date, outstanding balances (monetary items) are updated by applying the exchange rate prevailing on that date. The exchange rate differences in this update are recognised in the income statement for the year in which they were calculated in the item Losses / (gains) on exchange variations . Exchange rate variations generated on monetary items, which constitute enlargement of the investment denominated in the functional currency of the Group or of the subsidiary in question, are recognised in equity. Exchange rate differences on nonThe financial statements of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are converted at the following exchange rates: • The exchange rate obtaining on the date of the statement of financial position for the conversion of assets and liabilities; • The average exchange rate in the period for the conversion of items in the income statement, with the exception of cases of affiliated companies that are in a hyperinflationary economy, such as Angola; • The average exchange rate in the period, for the conversion of cash flows (in cases where the exchange rate approximates to the real rate, and for the remaining cash flows the rate of exchange at the date of the operations is used), with the exception of cases of affiliated companies that are in a hyperinflationary economy, such as Angola; • The historical exchange rate for the conversion of equity accounts. Exchange differences arising from the conversion into euros of the financial statements of subsidiaries In the last quarter of 2017, the Angolan economy was considered a hyperinflationary economy according to IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies. This standard requires that the financial statements prepared in the currency of a hyperinflationary must be expressed in terms of the current measurement unit at the financial statements preparation date. In summary, the general aspects that have to be considered for the restatement of the individual financial statements are the following ones: The monetary assets and liabilities are not amended because they are already updated to the current unit at the financial statements date; The non-monetary assets and liabilities (that are still not expressed in terms of the current unit at the financial statements) are restated by the application of an index; 197 The effect of the inflation on the net monetary position of the subsidiaries companies is reflected in the income statement as a loss in the net monetary position. Additionally, according to IAS 21, the restatement of the consolidated financial statements is prohibited when the parent company does not operate in a hyperinflationary economy. The conversion coefficient that was used for the restatement of the individual financial statements of the subsidiaries in Angola was the Consumer Price Index (CPI), issued by the National Bank of Angola. Converted CPI Basis 100 CPI (Basis 100 Year 2010) dec/10 Year 2010 100,0 100,0 dec/11 Year 2010 111,4 111,4 dec/12 Year 2011 109,0 121,4 dec/13 Year 2014 93,0 130,8 dec/14 Year 2014 100,0 140,5 dec/15 Year 2014 114,3 160,6 dec/16 Year 2014 162,2 227,9 dec/17 Year 2014 204,8 287,8 mar/18 Year 2014 212,9 299,1 jun/18 Year 2014 220,4 309,8 set/18 Year 2014 232,0 326,1 dec/18 Year 2014 241,1 338,8 At 31 December 2017 and 2018, assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies were converted into euros using the following exchange rates of such currencies against the euro, as published by the Bank of Portugal: 31-12-2017 31-12-2018 US Dollar 1.1993 1.1450 Angolan Kwanza 185.4000 353.0155 British Pound 0.8872 0.8945 Mozambican Metical 70.5700 70.2400 Canadian Dollar 1.5039 1.5605 Swiss Franc 1.1702 1.1269 Real 3.9729 4.4440 In the financial years ended at 31 December 2017 and 2018, the income statements of subsidiaries expressed in foreign currencies were converted to euros at the average exchange rates of the currencies of their countries of origin against the euro, with the exception of cases of affiliated companies that are in a hyperinflationary economy, such as Angola, which exchange rate used is at the end of the period. The average exchange rates used are as follows: 12M 17 12M 18 US Dollar 1.1297 1.1810 Angolan Kwanza 184.8662 303.6658 Mozambican Metical 71.5117 71.2933 Financial charges and borrowings Financial charges related to borrowings are recognised as costs in accordance with the accruals principle, except in the case of loans incurred (whether these are generic or specific) for the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial period of time (over one year) to be ready for use, which are capitalised in the acquisition cost of that asset. 198 Investment property Investment property mainly includes buildings held to generate rents rather than for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, or for sale in the ordinary course of business. These are measured initially at cost. Subsequently, the Group uses the cost model for the valuation of investment property since use of the fair value model would not result in material differences. An investment property is eliminated from the statement of financial position on disposal or when the investment property is taken permanently out of use and no financial benefit is expected from its disposal. Fair value measurement The Group measures part of the financial assets, such as financial assets available for sale, and some of its non-financial assets, such as investment properties, at fair value on the date of the financial statements. The fair value measurement assumes that the asset or liability is exchanged in an orderly transaction among market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value measurement is based on the assumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability may occur: On the main market of the assets and liabilities, or In the absence of a primary market, it is assumed that the transaction occurs in the most advantageous market. This is what maximises the amount that would be received for selling asset or minimises the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability, after considering transaction costs and transport costs. Since different entities and businesses within a single entity can have access to different markets, the main or most advantageous market for the same asset or liability can vary from one entity to another, or even between businesses within the same entity, but it is assumed that they are accessible to the Group. The fa liability, assuming that market participants would use the asset to maximise its value. The Group uses valuation techniques appropriate to the circumstances whenever there is information to measure the fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities measured at fair value or of which disclosure is mandatory, are rated on a fair value hierarchy, which ranks data in three levels to be used in the measurement at fair value, and detailed below: Level 1 Listed and unadjusted market prices, in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date; Level 2 Level 3 valuation techniques using inputs not based on observable market data, based on unobservable inputs. The fair value measurement is classified in the same fair value hierarchy level at the lowest level of input, which is significant to the measurement as a whole. Assets and liabilities offsetting Financial assets and liabilities are offset and presented at the net amount when, and only when, the Group has the right to offset the recognised amounts and intends to settle for the net amount. 199 Employee benefits Personnel expenses are recognised when the service is rendered by employees independently of their date of payment. Here are some specificities: a) Termination of employment. The benefits for termination of employment are due for payment when there is cessation of employment before the normal retirement date or when an employee voluntarily accepts to leave in exchange of these benefits. The Group recognises these benefits when it can be shown to be committed to a termination of current employees according to a detailed formal plan for termination and there is no realistic possibility of withdrawal or these benefits are granted to encourage voluntary redundancy. When the benefits of cessation of employment are due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date, they are updated to their present value. b) Holiday, holiday allowances, and bonuses. According to the labour law, employees are entitled to 22 days annual leave, as well as one month of holiday allowances, rights acquired in the year preceding payment. These liabilities of the Group are recorded when incurred, independently of the moment of payment, and are reflected under the item Accounts payable and other . c) Labour Compensation Fund (FCT) and the Labour Compensation Guarantee Fund (FGCT). Based on the publication of Law No. 70/2013 and subsequent regulation by Order No. 294-A / 2013, entered into force on 1 October the Labour Compensation Fund schemes (FCT) and the Guarantee Fund Compensation of Labor (FGCT). In this context, companies that hire a new employee are required to deduct a percentage of the respective salary for these two new funds (0.925% to 0.075% and the FCT for FGCT), in order to ensure, in the future, the partial payment the compensation for dismissal. Considering the characteristics of each Fund, the following is considered: The monthly deliveries to FGCT, made by the employer are recognised as expense in the period to which they relate. The monthly deliveries to FCT, made by the employer are recognised as a financial asset, in the caption Other nonof the entity, measured at fair value with changes recognised in the respective results. Statement of cash flows The statement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the direct method. The Group classifies under change in value is negligible. For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the balance of cash and cash equivalents also include bank overdrafts included in the statement of financial position under Borrowings . The statement of cash flows is divided into operating, investing, and financing activities. Operating activities include cash received from customers and payments to suppliers, staff and others related to operating activities. Under Other cash receipts / (payments) related with operating activity includes the amount received and subsequent payments related to assignments without recourse, coordinated by the Banco Comercial Português and Caixa Geral de Depósitos, and these operations do not involve any change in the accounting treatment of the underlying receivables or in the relationship with their clients. The cash flows included in investing activities include acquisitions and disposals of investments in subsidiaries and cash received and payments arising from the purchase and sale of tangible and intangible assets, amongst others. 200 Financing activities include cash received and payments relating to borrowings, the payment of interest and similar costs, finance leases, the purchase and sale of own shares and the payment of dividends. Subsequent events Events occurring after the date of the statement of financial position, which provide additional information about conditions that existed at that date, are taken into account in the preparation of financial statements for the year. Events occurring after the date of the statement of financial position, which provide information on conditions that occur after that date, are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements, when they are materially relevant. 3. Judgements and estimates Relevant accounting estimates and estimates that affect the statement of financial position and the reported results. These estimates are based on the best information and knowledge about past and/or present events and on the operations that the Company considers it may implement in the future. However, at the date of completion of such operations, their results may differ from these estimates. Changes to these estimates that occur after the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements will be corrected in the income statement in a prospective manner, in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors . The estimates and assumptions that imply a greater risk of giving rise to a material adjustment in assets and liabilities are described below: Entities included in the consolidation perimeter To determine the entities to be included in the consolidation perimeter, the Group assesses the extent to which it is exposed, or has rights, to variability in return from its involvement with that entity and can take possession of them through the power it holds over this entity. The decision that an entity must be consolidated by the Group requires the use of judgment, estimates, and assumptions to determine the extent to which the Group is exposed to return variability and the ability to take possession of them through its power. Other assumptions and estimates could lead to the Group's consolidation perimeter being different, with direct impact on the consolidated financial statements. Impairment of non-current assets, excluding goodwill The determination of a possible impairment loss can be triggered by the occurrence of various events, such as the availability of future financing, the cost of capital or other market, economic and legal changes or control. The identification and assessment of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows, and the calculation of the recoverable value of assets involve a high degree of judgment by the Board. 201 Impairment of goodwill Goodwill is annually subjected to impairment tests or whenever there are indications of a possible loss of value in accordance with the criteria described in Note 9. The recoverable values of the cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated are determined based on the calculation of current use values. These calculations require the use of estimates by management. Intangible and tangible assets The life of an asset is the period during which the Company expects that an asset will be available for use and this should be reviewed at least at the end of each financial year. The determination of the useful lives of assets, the amortisation/depreciation method to be applied, and the estimated losses resulting from the replacement of equipment before the end of its useful life due to technological obsolescence is crucial in determining the amount of amortisation/depreciation to be recognised in the consolidated income statement each period. concerned, and taking account of the practices adopted by companies in the sectors in which the Group operates. The capitalised costs with the audiovisual content distribution rights acquired for commercialisation in the various windows of exhibition are amortised over the period of exploration of the respective contracts. Additionally, these assets are subject to impairment tests whenever there are indications of changes in the pattern generation of future revenue underlying each contract. With the adoption of IFRS 15, the useful lives of subscriber and acquisition costs were reviewed (Note 2.1). Provisions The Group periodically reviews any obligations arising from past events, which should be recognised or disclosed. The subjectivity involved in determining the probability and amount of internal resources required to meet obligations may give rise to significant adjustments, either due to changes in the assumptions made, or due to the future recognition of provisions previously disclosed as contingent liabilities. Deferred income tax assets Deferred income tax assets are recognised only when there is strong assurance that there will be future taxable income available to use the temporary differences or when there are deferred tax liabilities whose reversal is expected in the same period in which the deferred tax assets are reversed. The assessment of deferred income tax assets is undertaken by management at the end of each period taking account of the expected future performance of the Group. Expected credit losses The credit risk on the balances of accounts receivable is assessed at each reporting date, using a collection matrix based on the historical past collections adjusted from the future expectation of collections evolution, to determine the uncollectability rate. The expected credit losses of the accounts receivable are thus adjusted for the assessment made, which may differ from the effective risk that will incurred in the future. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities When the fair value of an asset or liabilities is calculated, on an active market, the respective market price is liabilities, valuation techniques generally accepted in the market, based on market assumptions, are used. 202 The Group applies evaluation techniques for unlisted financial instruments, such as derivatives, financial instruments at fair value and instruments measured at amortised cost. The most frequently used valorisation models are models of discounted cash flows and option models, which incorporate, for example, interest rate and market volatility curves. For certain types of more complex derivatives, more advanced valuation models are used containing assumptions and data that are not directly observable in the market, for which the Group uses internal estimates and assumptions. Errors, estimates, and changes to accounting policies During the financial years ended on 31 December 2017 and 2018, errors, estimates and changes in material accounting policies relating to prior years were not recognised, in addition to the application of IFRS 15 (Note 2.1). 4. Financial risk management policies Financial risk management The activities of the Group are exposed to a variety of financial risk factors: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. covering specific areas such as: exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivatives and other non-derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity. A) Credit risk Credit risk is mainly related to the risk of a counterparty defaulting on its contractual obligations, resulting in a financial loss to the Group. The Group is exposed to credit risk in its operating and treasury activities. The credit risk associated with operations is mainly related to amounts due from customers for services provided to them (Notes 12 and 16). This risk is monitored on a regular business basis and the aim of management is to: i) limit the credit granted to customers, using the average payment time by each customer; ii) monitor the trend in the level of credit granted; and iii) analyse the impairment of receivables on a regular basis. The Group does not face any serious credit risk with any particular client, insofar as the accounts receivable derive from a large number of clients from a wide range of businesses. The impairment adjustments to accounts receivable are calculated on profile, depending on whether the customer is a residential or business customer; ii) the average collection ive of the evolution of the collection. Because of the dispersed nature of customers, it is not necessary to consider an additional adjustment for credit risk other than the expected credit losses that are already recorded in accounts receivable customers and accounts receivable others. 203 The table below shows the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2017 and 2018, without taking into account any collateral held or other credit enhancements. For assets in the statement of financial position, the defined exposure is based on their book value as stated in the statement of financial position. 31-12-2017 31-12-2018 RESTATED Accounts receivable trade current i) 345,391 320,678 Accounts receivable other non-current (Note 12) 6,185 7,334 Accounts receivable other current (Note 12) 6,614 3,718 Cash and cash equivalents ii) 975 1,438 TOTAL FINANCIAL ASSETS 359,165 333,168 i) Accounts receivable customers The Group exposure to credit risk is related to operational account receivables. The amounts presented on financial position are net of impairment losses for estimated doubtful accounts receivable. These impairment losses were estimated by the Group in accordance with its experience and based on their assessment of the current macroeconomic environment. The Board believes that the carrying amounts of account receivables are similar to their fair value. At 31 December 2017 and 2018, the balances receivable from customers by age were as follows: 31-12-2017 31-12-2018 RESTATED Not overdue 120,747 136,581 0 to 90 days 69,954 60,491 90 180 days 27,477 19,859 180 to 360 days 52,146 27,333 Over 360 days 220,560 216,237 490,883 460,500 Expected credit losses (145,492) (139,822) TOTAL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 345,391 320,678 Credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis and can be summarized as follows: • regular customers are analyzed on an aggregated basis (homogeneous group) and the expected credit losses calculated thought the use of a collection matrix, which is based on the historical past collections adjusted by the future expectation of collections evolution, to determine the uncollectibility rate; • the balances of operators, agents and others are analyzed individually and expected credit losses calculated based on the age of each balance, the existence of claims, the current financial situation of each third party and the future expectation of receiving the respective amounts in debt. Guarantees and pledges obtained from some operators and agents are not material. 204 ii) of assets (cash and cash equivalents as described in Note 21, with the exception of the value of cash), whose counter parties are Financial Statement Institutions, are as follows: 31-12-2017 31-12-2018 RESTATED A 5 18 BBB+ 1 1 BBB 4 BBB176 193 BB86 262 B+ 1 without rating 704 963 TOTAL 975 1,438 The information on ratings was taken from Reuters, based on the ratings awarded by the three major rating B) Liquidity risk Prudent management of liquidity risk requires the maintenance of an adequate level of cash and cash equivalents to meet the liabilities associated with the negotiation of credit facilities with financial institutions. Under the model adopted, the Group has: b.1) Commercial paper programmes of which around 294.5 million euros is being used, including 29.5 million euros issued without underwriting securities. The commercial paper programmes have a total amount of 520 million euros, corresponding to eleven programmes, with four banks, including 445 million euros which bear interest at market rates and 75 million euros issued in fixed rate; b.2) Private and direct cash bonds to the value of 660 million euros; b.3) A Finance Contract with the European Investment Bank to support the development of mobile broadband network in Portugal in the amount of 73.3 million euros. Management regularly monitors the forecasts of unused credit lines and the amounts of cash and cash equivalents, based on estimated cash flows and compliance with any covenants usually associated with borrowings. Of the loans obtained (excluding finance leases), in addition to being subject to the Group complying with its operating, legal and fiscal obligations, 100% are subject to cross-default clauses, Pari Passu clauses and negative pledge clauses and 76% to ownership clauses. In addition, approximately 27% of the total loans obtained require that the consolidated net financial debt does not exceed 3 times consolidated EBITDA, approximately 4% of the total loans obtained require that the consolidated net financial debt does not exceed 3.5 times consolidated EBITDA, and approximately 6% of the total loans obtained require that the consolidated net financial debt does not exceed 4 times consolidated EBITDA. 205 he amounts shown in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows payable in the future, including the interest remunerating these liabilities. 31-12-2017 RESTATED 31-12-2018 LESS BETWEEN LESS BETWEEN OVER 5 OVER 5 THAN 1 1 AND 5 TOTAL THAN 1 1 AND 5 TOTAL YEARS YEARS YEAR YEARS YEAR YEARS Borrowings: Bond Issue 1,431 523,130 59,970 584,531 152,487 507,688 660,175 Commercial Paper 122,637 177,500 37,500 337,637 29,732 215,002 49,998 294,732 Foreign Loans 17,748 72,241 89,989 17,504 52,710 70,214 Bank overdrafts 41,753 41,753 19,936 19,936 Financial Leases 26,567 56,525 27,793 110,884 24,475 43,686 19,834 87,995 Accounts payable trade 224,864 224,864 254,950 254,950 Accounts payable other 75,770 75,770 47,949 47,949 Derivatives of financial instruments 33 2,462 2,495 1,211 1,211 Operating leases 58,728 131,050 36,695 226,473 60,800 135,777 43,416 239,993 TOTAL 569,531 962,908 161,958 1,694,396 609,044 954,863 113,248 1,677,155 C) Market risk Exchange rate risk Exchange rate risk is mainly related to exposure, resulting from payments made to suppliers of terminal equipment and producers of audiovisual content for the Pay TV and audiovisual businesses, respectively. Business transactions between the Group and these suppliers are mainly denominated in US dollars. Depending on the balance of accounts payable resulting from transactions in a currency different from the -term foreign currency forwards, in order to hedge the risk associated with these balances (Note 20). The Group has investments in foreign companies whose assets and liabilities are exposed to exchange rate variations (the Group has two subsidiaries in Mozambique, Lusomundo Moçambique and Mstar, whose functional currency is the Metical and four in Angola, Finstar, ZAP Media, ZAP Cinemas and ZAP Publishing, whose functional currency is the Kwanza). The Group has not adopted any policy of hedging the risk of exchange rate variations for these companies on cash flows in foreign currencies, as they are insignificant in the context of the Group. A sensitivity analysis was performed using a strengthening or weakening by 10% of the functional currencies of the various financial investments at 31 December 2018. The amount of the investments would decrease by 1,008 thousand euros or increase by 825 thousand euros, respectively, and the counterpart of these changes the equity. In this sensitivity analysis, gains or losses that financial investments would recognise resulting from currency fluctuations are not considered. 206 The table below shows the Group's exposure to exchange rate risk at 31 December 2017 and 2018, based on stated in local currency): 31-12-2017 RESTATED BRITISH MOZAMBIQUE US DOLLAR KWANZA POUND METICAL ASSETS Account receivable trade 7,850 5 2,534 Account receivable other 1 465,300 896 Tax receivable 5,093 Cash and cash equivalents 45,605 TOTAL ASSETS 7,850 6 465,300 54,128 LIABILITIES Borrowings Account payable trade 9,118 32 592 Accounts payable other 354 22 185 Tax payable 403 TOTAL LIABILITIES 9,472 54 1,180 NET (1,622) (49) 465,300 52,948 31-12-2018 BRITISH MOZAMBIQUE US DOLLAR KWANZA POUND METICAL ASSETS Account receivable trade 6,104 2,868 Account receivable other 1 465,300 726 Tax receivable 5,927 Cash and cash equivalents 56,453 TOTAL ASSETS 6,104 1 465,300 65,974 LIABILITIES Borrowings Account payable trade 11,885 67 75,351 Accounts payable other 30 6 5,646 Tax payable 772 TOTAL LIABILITIES 11,915 72 81,769 NET (5,811) (71) 465,300 (15,795) NOS uses a sensitivity analysis technique which measures estimated changes in results and equity of an immediate strengthening or weakening of the Euro against other currencies in the rates applying at 31 December 2018 for each class of financial instrument with all other variables remaining constant. This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, since in practice exchange rates rarely change in isolation. The sensitivity analysis was performed using a strengthening or weakening of the Euro by 10% in all exchange rates. In such case, profits before tax would have increased by 369 thousand euros (2017: decreased 168 thousand euros) or decreased by 451 thousand euros (2017: decreased by 206 thousand euros), respectively. D) Interest rate risk The risk of fluctuations in interest rates can result in a cash flow risk or a fair value risk, depending on whether variable or fixed interest rates have been negotiated. The borrowings by the Group (with the exception of EIB financing of 73.3 million euros, the bond loan of 300 million euros, the commercial paper issue of 75 million euros and finance leases) have variable interest rates, which exposes the Group to interest rate cash flow risk. The Group has adopted a policy of hedging risk with interest rate swaps to hedge future interest payments on Bond loans and other borrowings (see Note 20). 207 The NOS Group uses a sensitivity analysis technique, which measures the expected impacts on results and equity of an immediate increase or decrease of 0.25% (25 basis points) in market interest rates, for the rates applying at the date of the statement of financial position for each class of financial instrument, with all other variables remaining constant. This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, since in practice market rates rarely change in isolation. The sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: • Changes in market interest rates affect interest receivable or payable on financial instruments with variable rates; • Changes in market interest rates only affect interest receivable or payable on financial instruments with fixed interest rates when they are recognised at fair value; • Changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities; • Changes in the fair value of derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting future cash flows from current net values using market rates at the end of the year. Under these assumptions, an increase or decrease of 0.25% in market interest rates for loans that are not covered or loans with variable interest at 31 December 2018 would have resulted in an increase or decrease in annual profit before tax of approximately 1.1 million euros (2017: 1.7 million euros). In the case of the interest rate swaps contracted, the sensitivity analysis which measures the estimated impact of an immediate increase or decrease of 0.25% (25 basis points) in market interest rates results in changes in the fair value of the swaps of over 319 thousand euros (2017: over 945 thousand euros) and down 320 thousand euros (2017: down 955 thousand euros) at 31 December 2018. Capital risk management , with an adequate return to shareholders and generating benefits for all stakeholders. The NOS Group's policy is to contract loans with financial institutions, mainly at the level of the parent company, NOS, which in turn makes loans to its subsidiaries and associated companies. In the case of joint ventures, which contract loans in their own name, NOS participates in the contract process and is the guarantor for repayment of the loan. This policy is designed to optimise the capital structure with a view to greater tax efficiency and a reduction in the average cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amounts of dividends distributed to shareholders, issue new shares, and sell assets to reduce liabilities, or launch share buyback plans. 208 As is the practice of other companies operating in the market in which the Group operates, the Group manages capital based on the net financial debt/EBITDA ratio. Net financial debt is calculated as the total of current and non-current borrowings, excluding the finance lease related to contracts for the acquisition of capacity and content utilisation rights, less the amounts of cash and cash equivalents. The internal ratio set as a target is a level of debt lower than 3 times EBITDA. 31-12-2017 31-12-2018 RESTATED Total gross debt 1,088,461 1,068,057 Cash and cash equivalents (2,977) (2,182) TOTAL NET DEBT 1,085,484 1,065,875 EBITDA 575,394 591,763 Total net debt/EBITDA 1.89 1.80 Estimated fair value The table below shows the financial assets and liabilities of the Group valued at fair value at 31 December 2017 and 2018, as the levels of the fair value hierarchy: 31-12-2017 RESTATED LEVEL 1 LEVEL 2 LEVEL 3 TOTAL ASSETS Available-for-sale financial assets 180 180 Derivative financial instruments interest rate swap (Note 20) 19 19 19 180 199 LIABILITIES Derivative financial instruments equity swap (Note 20) 9 9 Derivative financial instruments interest rate swap (Note 20) 2,453 2,453 Derivative financial instruments exchange rate forward (Note 20) 33 33 2,495 2,495 31-12-2018 LEVEL 1 LEVEL 2 LEVEL 3 TOTAL ASSETS Available-for-sale financial assets 204 204 Derivative financial instruments equity swap (Note 20) 153 153 Derivative financial instruments exchange rate forward (Note 20) 32 32 185 204 389 LIABILITIES Derivative financial instruments interest rate swap (Note 20) 1,211 1,211 1,211 1,211 In accordance with IFRS 13 Fair value measurement, the levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows: Level 1 Financial instruments valued based on quotations in active markets to which the company has access are included in this category, securities valued based on executable (immediate liquidity) published by external sources. Level 2 Financial instruments whose value is based on directly or indirectly observable data in active markets are included in this category, securities valued based on bids provided by external entities and internal valuation techniques using only observable market data. Level 3 All financial instruments valued at fair value that do not fall in level 1 and 2. Assets available for sale were valued using the discounted cash flow method (level 3). 209 The calculation of the fair value of interest rate swap derivatives was based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows, using the estimated market interest rate curve calculated by the entities with which the swaps were contracted (level 2).

The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities for the financial years ended on 31 December 2017 and 2018 were as follows: DEFERRED TAXES OF THE PERIOD 31-12-2016 IFRS 9 31-12-2017 RESTATED INCOME EQUITY (NOTA 2.1) RESTATED (NOTE B) DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS Expected credit losses 7,380 (2,399) 1,654 6,635 Inventories 2,482 (142) 2,340 Other provision and adjustments 84,371 (12,871) 71,500 Intragroup gains 23,034 (2,108) 20,926 Liabilities recorded as part of the allocation of fair value to the liabilities 7,801 (405) 7,396 acquired in the merger Derivatives 901 51 (394) 558 125,969 (17,874) (394) 1,654 109,355 DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS Revaluations of assets as part of the allocation of fair value to the assets 7,879 (3,028) 4,851 acquired in the merger Derivatives 10 (10) Assets recognised under application of IFRS 15 (Note 2) 19,898 (1,515) 18,383 Others 2,317 (28) 2,289 30,104 (4,581) 25,523 NET DEFERRED TAX 95,865 (13,293) (394) 1,654 83,832 222 DEFERRED TAXES OF THE PERIOD 31-12-2017 31-12-2018 RESTATED INCOME EQUITY (NOTE B) DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS Expected credit losses 6,635 (1,839) 4,796 Inventories 2,340 (730) 1,610 Other provision and adjustments 71.500 (19,544) 51,956 Intragroup gains 20,926 1,172 22,098 Liabilities recorded as part of the allocation of fair value to the liabilities 7,396 (2,453) 4,943 acquired in the merger Derivatives 558 (43) (277) 238 109,355 (23,437) (277) 85,641 DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITIES Revaluations of assets as part of the allocation of fair value to the assets 4,851 (1,160) 3,691 acquired in the merger Derivatives 7 7 Assets recognised under application of IFRS 15 (Note 2) 18,383 (18,383) Others 2,289 (19) 2,270 25,523 (19,555) 5,968 NET DEFERRED TAX 83,832 (3,882) (277) 79,673 At 31 December 2018, the deferred tax assets related to the other provisions and adjustments are mainly due: i) Impairments and acceleration of amortisations beyond the acceptable fiscally and other adjustments in fixed tangible assets and intangible assets, amounted to 40.9 million euros (31 December 2017: 50.3 million euros; and ii) Other provisions amounted to 9.6 million euros (31 December 2017: 13.0 million euros). At 31 December 2018, the deferred tax liability is related to the revaluation of assets relates mainly to the companies. At 31 December 2018, deferred tax assets were not recognised for an amount of 2.2 million euros, corresponding mainly to tax incentives. Deferred tax assets were recognised when it is probable that taxable profits will occur in future that may be used to absorb tax losses or deductible tax differences. This assessment was based on the business plans of , which are regularly revised and updated. At 31 December 2018, the tax rate used to calculate the deferred tax assets relating to tax losses carried forward was 21% (2017: 21%). In the case of temporary differences, the rate used was 22.5% (2017: 22.5%) increased to a maximum of 5.13% (2017: 5.13%) of state surcharge when the taxation of temporary differences in the estimated period of application of the state surcharge was perceived as likely. Tax benefits, related to deductions from taxable income, are considered 100%, and in some cases, their full acceptance is conditional upon the approval of the authorities that grants such tax benefits. Under the terms of Article 88 of the IRC Code, the Company is subject to autonomous taxation on a series of charges at the rates set out in that Article. Additionally, under the terms of current legislation in Portugal, tax losses generated from 2012 to 2013 and from 2014 to 2016 may be carried forward for a period of five years and twelve years, respectively, after their occurrence and may be deducted from taxable profits generated during that period, up to a limit of 75% of the taxable profit, in 2012 and 2013, and 70% of taxable profit from 2014 to 2016. For tax losses generated in taxation periods that begin on or after 1 January 2017, the carryover is over a five-year period up to the limit of 70% of the taxable profit. 223 In the financial years ended on 31 December 2017 and 2018, the reconciliation between the nominal and effective rates of tax was as follows: 4º QUARTER 17 12M 17 4º QUARTER 18 12M 18 RESTATED RESTATED Income before taxes 13,047 138,732 25,324 170,178 Statutory tax rate 22.5% 22.5% 22.5% 22.5% ESTIMATED TAX 2,936 31,215 5,698 38,290 Permanent differences i) (4,168) (7,733) 755 918 Differences in tax rate of group companies 484 (2,709) 96 (1,131) Record of deferred taxes (337) (1,167) 119 (3,743) Tax benefits ii) (1,447) (6,545) (11,398) State surcharge (1,865) 3,403 (2,572) 6,915 Autonomous taxation 213 810 254 828 Others 454 (774) 2,475 (1,403) INCOME TAXES (3,730) 16,500 6,825 29,276 Effective Income tax rate -28.6% 11.9% 27.0% 17.2% Income tax (16,475) 3,207 (8,107) 25,394 Deferred tax 12,745 13,293 14,932 3,882 (3,730) 16,500 6,825 29,276 i) At 31 December 2017 and 2018, the permanent differences were composed as follows: 4º QUARTER 17 12M 17 4º QUARTER 18 12M 18 RESTATED RESTATED Equity method (Note 36) (7,950) (22,933) 1,990 6,441 Others (10,574) (11,437) 1,365 (2,362) (18,524) (34,370) 3,355 4,079 22.5% 22.5% 22.5% 22.5% (4,168) (7,733) 755 918 ii) This item corresponds to the amount of deferred taxes and the use of tax benefits for which there was no record of deferred taxes: SIFIDE (Business Research and Development Tax Incentives System), a tax benefit introduced by Law 40/2005 of 3 August and RFAI (Investment Tax Incentive Regime) introduced by Law 10/2009 of 10 March. During the financial year ended on 31 December 2018, following the different dates to submission and approval of applications, tax incentives related to RFAI and SIFIDE of the years of 2016 and 2017 were recognised. Whilst in the financial year ended on 31 December of 2017, only RFAI of the year of 2016 and SIFIDE of 2015 were recognised.

Future credits transferred: for the financial year ended at 31 December 2010, NOS SA was notified of the Report of Tax Inspection, when it is considered that the increase, when calculating the taxable profit for the year 2008, of the amount of 100 million euros, with respect to initial price of future credits transferred to securitization, is inappropriate. Given the principle of periodisation of taxable income, NOS SA was subsequently notified of the improper deduction of the amount of 20 million euros in the calculation of taxable income between 2009 and 2013. Given that the increase made in 2008 was not accepted due to not complying with Article 18 of the CIRC, also in the years following, the deduction corresponding to credits generated in that year, will eliminate the calculation of taxable income, to meet the annual amortisation hired as part of the operation (20 million per year for 5 years). NOS SA challenged the decisions regarding the 2009 to 2013 fiscal year and will appeal for the judicial review in due time the decision regarding the 2008 to 2013 fiscal year. Regarding the year 2008, the Administrative and Fiscal Court of Porto has already decided unfavourably, in March 2014. The company has appealed; b. Supplementary Capital: the fiscal authorities believe that NOS SA has broken the principle of full competition under the terms of (1) of Article 58 of the Corporate Tax Code (CIRC) currently Article 63 , by granting supplementary capital to its subsidiary NOS Towering, without having been remunerated at a market interest rate. In consequence, it has been notified, with regard to the years 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 of corrections to the determination of its taxable income in the total amount of 20.5 million euros. NOS SA contested the decision with regard to all the abovementioned years. As for the year 2004, the Court has decided favourably. This decision is concluded (favourably), originating a reversal of provisions, in 2016, in the amount of 1.3 million euros plus interest. As for the years 2006 and 2007, the Porto Fiscal and Administrative Court has already decided unfavourably. As for the year 2005, the Court decided favourably, having been concretized by the Tax Authorities, which meant the provision reversal of one million euros.; ii) The amount under the item Financial investments corresponds to the liabilities assumed, in addition to the investment made, by the Group in jointly controlled companies and associated companies (Note 11); iii) The amount under the item Dismantling and removal of assets refers to the estimated future costs discounted to the present value, related with the termination of the use of the space where there are telecommunication towers and cinemas; iv) The amount in the item Contingent liabilities refers to several provisions recorded for present but not likely obligations, related to the merger by incorporation of Optimus SGPS, namely: 233 a. Extraordinary contribution toward the fund for the compensation of the net costs of the universal service of electronic communications (CLSU): The Extraordinary contribution toward the fund for the compensation of the net costs of the universal service of electronic communications (CLSU) is legislated in Articles 17 to 22 of Law no 35/2012, of 23 August. From 1995 until June 2014, MEO, SA (former PTC) was the sole provider for the universal service of electronic communications, having been designated administratively by the government, i.e. without a formal contest procedure led by the government for that effect, which constitutes an illegality, by the way acknowledged by the European Court of Justice who, through its decision taken in June 2014, condemned the Portuguese State to pay a fine of 3 million euros for illegally designating MEO. In accordance with Article 18 of the abovementioned Law 35/2012, of 23 August, the net costs incurred by the operator responsible for providing the universal service, approved by ANACOM, must be shared between other companies who provide, in national territory public communication networks and publicly accessible electronic communications services. NOS is therefore within the scope of this extraordinary contribution given that MEO has being requesting the payment of CLSU to the compensation fund of the several periods during which it was responsible for providing the services. In accordance with law, the compensation fund can be activated to compensate the net costs of the electronic communications universal service, relative to the period before the designation of the provider by tender, whenever, cumulatively (i) there are net costs, considered excessive, the amount of which is approved by ANACOM, following an audit to their preliminary calculation and support documents, which are provided by the universal service provider, and (ii) the universal service provider requester the Government compensation for the net costs approved under the terms previously mentioned. Therefore: In 2013, ANACOM deliberated to approve the final results of the CLSU audit presented by MEO, relative to the period from 2007 to 2009, in a total amount of 66.8 million euros, a decision that was contested by the Company. In January 2015, ANACOM issued the settlement notes in the amount of 18.6 million euros related to NOS, SA, NOS Madeira and NOS Açores which were contested by NOS and for which a bail was presented by NOS SGPS (Note 41) to avoid Tax Execution Proceedings. The guarantees have been accepted by ANACOM. In 2014, ANACOM deliberated to approve the final results of the CLSU audit by MEO, relative to the period from 2010 to 2011, in a total amount of 47.1 million euros, a decision also contested by NOS. In February 2016, ANACOM issued the settlement notes in the amount of 13 million euros, related to NOS, SA, NOS Madeira and NOS Açores which were also contested and for which it was before also presented bail by NOS SGPS in order to avoid the promotion of respective tax enforcement processes. The guarantees that have been accepted by ANACOM. In 2015, ANACOM deliberated to approve the final results of the audit to CLSU presented by MEO relative to the period from 2012 to 2013, in the amount of 26 million euros and 20 million euros, respectively, and as the others, it was contested by NOS. In December 2016, the notices of settlement were issued relating to NOS, SA, NOS Madeira and NOS Açores, corresponding to that period, totalling 13.6 million euros that were contested by NOS and for which guarantees have been already presented by NOS SGPS in order to avoid the promotion of the respective proceedings of tax execution. The guarantees were also accepted by ANACOM. 234 In 2016, ANACOM approved the results of the audit to the CLSU presented by MEO related with the period between January and June 2014, for an amount of 7.7 million euros that was contested by NOS, in standard terms. In 2017, NOS, SA, NOS Madeira and NOS Açores were notified of the decision of ANACOM concerning the entities that are obliged to contribute toward the compensation fund and the setting of the values of contributions corresponding to CLSU that have to be compensated and relating to the months of 2014 in which MEO still remained as provider of the Universal Service, which establishes for all these companies a contribution totaling close to 2.4 million euros. In December 2017, the settlement notes relating to NOS, SA, NOS Madeira and NOS Açores, concerning that period, were issued in the amount of approximately 2.4 million euros, which were challenged by NOS and for which guarantees have also been presented by NOS SGPS, in order to avoid the promotion of their tax enforcement procedures. The guarantees were also accepted by ANACOM. It is the opinion of the Board of Directors of NOS that these extraordinary contributions to Universal Service (not designated through a tender procedure) flagrantly violate the Directive of Universal Service. Moreover, considering the existing legal framework since NOS began its activity, the request of payment of the extraordinary contribution violates the principle of the protection of confidence, recognised on a legal and constitutional level in Portuguese domestic law. For these reasons, NOS has judicially challenged either the approval of audit results of the net cost of universal service related to the pre-competitive period, and the liquidation of each extraordinary contribution, once the Board of Directors is convinced it will be successful in challenges already undertaken; b. Other tax proceedings: which the Board of Directors is convinced that there are strong arguments to obtain a favourable decision for NOS SA, but considers that they correspond to a contingent liability under the fair value allocation of assumed liabilities related to the merger operation; v) The amount under the caption Contingencies other refers to provisions for risks related to miscellaneous events/disputes of various kinds, the settlement of which may result in outflows of cash, and other likely liabilities related to several transactions from previous periods, and whose outflow of cash is probable, namely, costs charged to the current period or previous years, for which it is not possible to estimate reliably the time of occurrence of the expense.

On this date, it is impossible to determine what the scope of the infraction proceedings is to be. Tax authorities During the course of the 2003 to 2018 financial years, some companies of the NOS Group were the subject of tax inspections for the 2001 to 2015 financial years. Following these inspections, NOS SGPS, as the controlling company of the Tax Group, and companies not covered by Tax Group, were notified of the corrections made to the Group's tax losses, to VAT and stamp tax and to make the payments related to the corrections made to the above exercises. The total amount of the notifications unpaid is about 16 million euros, added interest, and charges. Note that the Group considered that the corrections were unfounded, and contested the amounts mentioned. The Group provided the bank guarantees demanded by the tax authorities in connection with these proceedings, as stated in Note 41. As belief of the Board of Directors of the Group, supported by our lawyers and tax advisors, the risk of loss of these proceedings is not likely and the outcome thereof will not affect materially the consolidated position. Actions by MEO against NOS SA, NOS Madeira and NOS Açores and by NOS SA against MEO • In 2011, MEO brought against NOS SA, in the Judicial Court of Lisbon, a claim for the compensation of 10.3 million of Euros, as compensation for alleged unauthorized portability of NOS SA in the period between March 2009 and July 2011. NOS SA presented its defence and reply, and the Court ordered an expert opinion, which was, meanwhile, deemed without effect. The discussion and trial hearing took place at the end of April and beginning of May 2016, and a judgment was rendered in September of the 252 same year, which considered the action to be partially justified, based not on the occurrence of improper portability, which the Court has determined to restrict itself to those which do not correspond to the will of the proprietor, but of mere delay in sending the documentation by the Recipient Carrier (NOS) to the Holding Provider (MEO). In that regard, it sentenced NOS to the payment of approximately 5.3 million euros to MEO, a decision of which only NOS appealed to the Lisbon Court of Appeal. MEO, on the other hand, was satisfied with the decision and did not appeal against the part of the sentence that acquitted the NOS of the requests for compensation that it formulated in the amount of approximately 5.0 million euros regarding alleged improper portabilities. This Court, in the first quarter of 2018, upheld the decision of the Court of First Instance, except for interests, in which gave reason to the claims of NOS, in the sense that they should be counted from the citation to the action and not from the due date of the invoices. NOS filed an extraordinary appeal with the Supreme Court of Justice, which was admitted and is currently under appreciation in this Court. • MEO made three court notices to NOS SA (April 2013, July 2015 and March 2016), three to NOS Açores (March and September 2013 and May 2016) and three to NOS Madeira (March and September 2013 and May 2016), in order to stop the prescription of alleged damages resulting from claims of undue portability, absence of response time to requests submitted to them by MEO and alleged illegal refusal of electronic portability requests. realizing only part of these, in the case of NOS SA, in the amount of 26 million euros (from August 2011 to May 2014), in the case of NOS Açores, in the amount of 195 thousand euros and NOS Madeira, amounting to 817 thousand euros. At the beginning of July 2018, NOS, SA was notified of the filing by MEO of a lawsuit concerning portability compensations in which MEO claims from NOS the right, in this respect, to approximately 26.8 million euros intending to proceed with the special judicial notification sent to the NOS in July 2015, as mentioned above. NOS contested the action during the month of October. • In 2011, NOS SA brought an action in Lisbon Judicial Court against MEO, claiming payment of 22.4 million euros, for damages suffered by NOS SA, arising from violations of the Portability Regulation by MEO, in particular, the large number of unjustified refusals of portability requests by MEO in the period between February 2008 and February 2011. The court declared the compulsory performance of expert evidence of technical nature. At the same time, it was requested by NOS and accepted by the Court an economic and financial expert analysis, which has already started. The related expert report has already been made available to the Court and parties. Therefore, awaits the scheduling of the court hearing. It is the understanding of the Board of Directors, supported by lawyers who monitor the process, that there is, in substance, good chance of NOS SA winning the action, because MEO has already been convicted for the same offense, by ANACOM. Nevertheless, it is impossible to determine the outcome of the action. Action brought by DECO In March 2018, the NOS was notified of a lawsuit brought by DECO against NOS, MEO and NOWO, in which a declaration of nullity of the obligation to pay the price increases imposed on customers at the end of 2016 is requested. In April and May 2018, the operators, including NOS, lodged a defence and are awaiting further developments in the process. The Board of Directors is convinced that the arguments used by the author are not justified, which is why it is believed that the outcome of the proceeding should not result in significant impacts for the Group's financial statements. 253 Interconnection tariffs At 31 December 2018, accounts receivable and accounts payable include 37,139,253 euros and 43,475,093 euros, respectively, resulting from a dispute between the subsidiary NOS SA and, essentially, the operator MEO Serviços de Comunicação e Multimédia, S.A. (previously named TMN Telecomunicações Móveis Nacionais, S.A.), in relation to the non-definition of interconnection tariffs of 2001. In what concerns to that dispute, the result was totally favourable to NOS S.A., having already become final. Contractual penalties The general conditions that affect the agreement and termination of this contract between NOS and its clients, establish that if the products and services provided by the client can no longer be used prior to the end of the binding period, the client is obliged to pay damages immediately. Until December 31st, 2014, the revenue from penalties, in the face of the inherent uncertainties, was only recognised at the time of receipt, and on December 31, 2018, the amounts receivable by NOS SA, NOS Madeira and NOS Açores from these invoiced compensations amounted to 58,933 thousand euros. During the financial year ended on 31 December 2018, receipts in the amount of 1,233 thousand euros of the amounts outstanding as of 31 December 2014 were recognised as revenues. From 1 January 2015, revenue from penalties is recognised taking into account an estimated collectability rate taking into account the Group's collection history. The penalties invoiced are recorded as accounts receivable and the uncollectible calculated values of these amounts are recorded as impairment by deducting the revenue recognised at the time of invoicing (Note 16). 45. Share incentive scheme On 23 April 2014, the General Meeting approved the Regulation on Short and Medium-Term Variable Remuneration, which establishes the terms of the Share Incentive Scheme ( NOS Plan ). This plan aimed at more senior employees with the vesting taking place three years being awarded, assuming that the employee is still with the company during that period. At 31 December 2018, the unvested plans are: NUMBER OF SHARES NOS PLAN Plan 2016 729,519 Plan 2017 836,519 Plan 2018 844,391 During the financial year ended on 31 December 2018, the movements that occurred in the plans are detailed as follows: STANDARD PLAN NOS PLAN BALANCE AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2017: 60,378 2,235,860 MOVEMENTS IN THE PERIOD: Awarded 856,941 Vested (58,519) (544,709) Cancelled / elapsed / corrected (1) (1,859) (137,663) BALANCE AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2018 2,410,429 254 (1) Refers mainly to correction made for dividends paid, exit of employees not entitled to the vesting of shares and other adjustments resulting from the way the shares are vested. The share plans costs are recognised over the year between the awarding and vesting date of those shares. The responsibility is calculated taking into consideration the share price at award date of each plan, for plans settled in shares, or at the closing date, for plans settled in cash. As at 31 December 2018, the outstanding responsibility related to these plans is 6,495 thousand euros and is recorded in Reserves, for an amount of 5,225 thousand euros, for plans liquidated in shares and in Accrued expenses, for an amount of 1,270 thousand euros, for plans liquidated in cash. The costs recognised in previous years and in the period, and its liabilities are as follows: ACCRUED RESERVES TOTAL EXPENSES Costs recognised in previous years related to plans as at 31 December 2017 1,226 5,252 6,478 Costs of plans vested in the period (500) (3,569) (4,069) Costs incured in the period and others 544 3,542 4,086 TOTAL COST OF THE PLANS 1,270 5,225 6,495 46. Subsequent events As of the date of approval of this document, there have been no other relevant subsequent events that merit disclosure in the present report. These financial statements are a translation of financial statements originally issued in Portuguese in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IAS / IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and the format and disclosures required by those Standards, some of which may not conform to or be required by generally accepted accounting principles in other countries. In the event of discrepancies, the Portuguese language version prevails. 255 47.

The Chief Accountant The Board of Directors 264 Notes to the financial statements at 31 December 2018 (Amounts stated in euros, unless otherwise stated) Introductory note until 27 August 2013 named ZON Multimédia Serviços de Telecomunicações e Multimédia, SGPS, S.A. established by Portugal Telecom, SGPS, S.A. ( Portugal Telecom ) on 15 July 1999 with the purpose of implementing its multimedia business strategy. During the 2007 financial year, Portugal Telecom proceeded with the spin-off of ZON through the attribution of its participation in the company to shareholders, which become fully independent from Portugal Telecom. During the 2013 financial year, ZON and Optimus, SGPS, S.A. ( Optimus SGPS ) have merged through the incorporation of Optimus SGPS into ZON. Thereafter, the Company adopted the designation of ZON Optimus, SGPS, S.A.. On 20 June 2014, because of the launch The businesses operated by NOS and its associated companies, which together form the NOS Group or Group , which includes cable and satellite television services, voice and Internet access services, video production and sale, advertising on Pay TV channels, cinema exhibition and distribution, and the production of channels for Pay TV and the provision of consultancy services related to information systems.

These Notes to the Financial Statements follow the order in which the items are shown in the financial statements. The financial statements relate to the Company on an individual basis and not consolidated were prepared for publication under the commercial legislation in force. As provided in IFRS, financial investments are stated at acquisition cost. Consequently, the financial statements do not include the effect of the consolidation of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, which will be made in the consolidated statements. The effect of these consolidation consists in an assets increase and 254,810 thousands euros, respectively. The financial statements for the financial year ended on 31 December 2018 were approved by the Board of Directors and their issue authorised on 7 March 2019. However, they are still subject to approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders in accordance with company law in Portugal. The Board of Directors believes that the financial statements give a true and fair Accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are described below. These policies were consistently applied to all the financial years presented, unless otherwise stated. Basis of presentation The financial statements were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations C The financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis from the ledgers and accounting records of the Company, using the historical cost convention, adjusted when necessary for the valuation of financial assets and liabilities (including derivatives) at their fair value. In preparing the financial statements in accordance with IFRS, the Board used estimates, assumptions, and critical judgments with impact on the value of assets, liabilities and the recognition of income and costs in each reporting period. Although these estimates were based on the best information available at the date of preparation of the financial statements, current and future results may differ from these estimates. The areas involving a higher element of judgment and estimates or areas when assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are described in Note 4.1. 266 In the preparation and presentation of the financial statements, NOS declares that it complies explicitly and without reservation with IAS/IFRS reporting standards and related SIC/IFRIC interpretations, approved by the European Union. Changes in accounting policies and disclosures The standards and interpretations that become effective on 1 January 2018 are as follow: • for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). These amendments incorporate guidelines on the accounting treatment of cash-settled share-based payments, which follow the same approach of payments based and settled in shares. • ation of the IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with the IFRS 4 Insurance complement the current options in the standard that can be used to bridge the concern related with the temporary volatility of the results. • beginning on or after 1 January 2018). The initial phase of IFRS 9 forecasts two types of measurement, amortised cost and fair value. All equity instruments are measured at fair value. A financial instrument is measured at amortised cost only if the company has it to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows represent principal and interest. Otherwise, financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit and loss. • after 1 January 2018). This standard establishes a single, comprehensive framework for revenue recognition. The framework will be applied consistently across transactions, industries and capitals IFRS 15 replaces the following standards and interpretations: IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers and SIC-31 Revenue Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services. • on or after 1 January 2018). The clarifications presented are about the transition and not about changes in the underlying principles of the standard. • periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). Interpretations clarify the accounting for transactions that include the receipt or payment of advance consideration in a foreign currency. • 1 January 2018). The amendments clarify if a property under construction or development, which was previously classified as Inventories, can be transferred to investment property when there is an evident change in use. • Improvements to international financial reporting standards (2014-2016 cycle that is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017/2018). These improvements involve the review of various standards, highlight the following: • -time Adoption of IFRS , an improvement that eliminated the short-term exemption for adopters for the first time in paragraphs E3-E7 of IFRS 1 because it served its purpose (which related to exemptions from some disclosures of financial instruments under IFRS 7exemptions 267 from some disclosures of financial instruments under IFRS 7, exemptions at the level of employee benefits and exemptions at the level of investment entities). These standards and changes had no material impact on NOS financial statements. At the date of approval of these financial statements, the standards and interpretations endorsed by the European Union, with mandatory application in future financial years are the following: • beginning on or after 1 January 2019). Amendments to IFRS 9 clarify that a financial asset meets the SPPI criteria regardless of the event or circumstances that caused the anticipated termination of the contract and regardless of which party pays or receives reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract. • option of early application). This standard sets out recognition, presentation, and disclosure of leasing contracts, defining a single accounting model. Aside from lower contracts than 12 months and low value (optional), leases should be accounted as an asset and a liability. • IFRIC 23 (interpret or after 1 January 2019). The interpretation addresses accounting for income taxes, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments that affect the application of the IAS 12. The interpretation is not applicable to taxes and charges that are outside the scope of the IAS 12, nor include specific requirements relating to interest and penalties associated with uncertainty over tax treatments. The Company does not expect any material impact resulting from the application of this standards and interpretations, except from the application of IFRS 16. Estimated impacts of IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 was issued in October 2017 and should be applied for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, being the early adoption permitted. This standard establishes the form of recognition, presentation and disclosure of leases, defining a single model of recognition. Transition The new standard will replace all current requirements, principles of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases prescribed in IFRS, particularly in IAS 17 Leases and should be applied retrospectively, adopting one of the following methods: i) full retrospective application: it implies the restatement of all comparatives periods; or ii) modified retrospective application: recognition of the cumulative effect, during the first period of application of the standard, as an adjustment to equity, and during the opening balance of the period when the standard is adopted. The Company will adopt the new standard at the effective date requested, using the full retrospective method. Leases A lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that transfers the right to use a good (the underlying asset), for a period of time, in exchange for a value. At the beginning of each contract, an entity shall evaluate and identify whether it is or contains a lease. This evaluation involves an exercise of judgment on whether each contract depends on a specific asset, if the 268 entity obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset and if the entity has the right to control the use of the asset. In the case of contracts that constitute or contain a lease, entities shall account for each component of the lease contained in the contract as a lease, separately from the other components of the contract that are not leases, unless the entity applies the practical expedient foreseen in the standard. NOS chose to separate nonlease components of the contract. IFRS 16 establishes that lessees account for all leases based on a single on-balance model recognition, similarly to the treatment that IAS 17 establishes for financial leases. The standard allows two exceptions to this model: (1) low value leases and (2) short term leases (i.e., with a lease term lower than 12 months). NOS did not adopt these exceptions. At the start date of the lease, the lessee recognizes the responsibility related to the lease payments (i.e, the lease liability) and the asset that represents the right to use the underlying asset during the lease period (i.e, Lessees will have to separately recognize the cost of interest on the lease liability and the depreciation of the ROU. The lessor's accounting remains substantially unchanged from the current treatment of IAS 17. The lessor continues to classify all leases using the same principles of IAS 17 and distinguishing between two types of leases: operational and financial. IFRS 16 also provides for additional disclosures about the assets and liabilities that their adoption will give rise to, whereby the Company anticipates a significant increase in the disclosures in the financial statements. Financial impacts It is estimated by the group that the impacts of the adoption of IFRS 16 occur on leasing contracts of vehicles. Additionally, from the application of IFRS 16, there will be a corresponding adjustment on taxes. The impacts estimated by the Group, from the application of IFRS 16, are as follows: 2018 IFRS 16 2018 REPORTED IMPACT RESTATED Revenues 6,567,958 6,567,958 Operating costs* 708,911 (121,842) 587,069 Depreciations and amortisations 4,373 112,503 116,876 Income before financial results and taxes (712,595) 9,338 (703,257) Financial results (288,156,296) 5,575 (288,150,721) Income taxes (755,819) 847 (754,972) Net Income 288,199,520 2,917 288,202,437 Asset 2,497,195,009 139,614 2,497,334,623 Other reserves and accumulated earnings 202,224,888 (6,520) 202,218,368 Liabilities 1,158,502,294 143,218 1,158,645,512 *Before depreciations, amortizations and impairment losses, integration costs, losses/(gains) with disposal of assets, net and other costs/(gains) non-recurrent. The following standards and interpretations, with mandatory application in future financial years, have not yet been endorsed by the European Union, at the date of approval of these financial statements: • Definition of material (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The intent of amending the standard is to clarify the definition of material and to align the definition used in international financial reporting standards. 269 • IFRS 3 (amendment), Business Combinations (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The intent of the amendment to the standard is to overcome the difficulties that arise when an entity determines whether it has acquired a business or a set of assets. • The general objective of IFRS 17 is to provide a more serviceable and consistent accounting model for insurance contracts between entities that issue them globally. • beginning on or after 1 January 2019, early application is permitted. The objective of the amendment is to harmonise the accounting practices and provide relevant information on decision-making. • 2019. The improvement clarified that (i) a company that is a risk capital company, or any other qualifying company, might choose to measure, its investments in associates and/or joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss at the moment of initial recognition and in relation to each investment. (ii) If a company that is not itself an investment entity holds an interest in an associate or joint venture that is an investment entity, the company might decide to maintain the fair value that those associates apply when measuring its subsidiaries by the application of the equity method. This option is taken separately for each investment on the later date considering (a) the initial recognition of the investment in that subsidiary; (b) this subsidiary as becoming an investment entity; and (c) when that subsidiary will be a parent company. • Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards (2015-2017 cycle) that is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The improvements involve the review of the IFRS 3 Business combination interest previously held in a joint operation, IFRS 11 Joint arrangements interest previously held in a joint operation, IAS 12 Income taxes consequences for income tax resulting from payments for financial instruments, which are classified as equity instruments and IAS 23 Borrowing costs borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. • Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards (issued in 29th March 2018 that is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The improvements involve the review of various standards. The Company has been evaluating the impact of this amendment. It will apply this standard once it becomes effective or when earlier application is permitted. Transactions and balances in foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currency are recorded at exchange rates on transactions dates. At each reporting date, the carrying amounts of monetary items denominated in foreign currency are updated by applying the exchange rate prevailing on that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value denominated in foreign currency are restated at the exchange rates of the respective dates on which the fair values were determined. Exchange rate differences on monetary items that constitute an extension of the investment denominated in the functional currency of the Company or the subsidiary in question are recognised as the exchange rate on -monetary items are classified under Exchange differences arising on the date of receipt or payment of foreign currency transactions and the resulting updates of the above are recognised in the income statement, under Foreign exchange losses / (gains) for all other balances or transactions. 270 At 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018, assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies were converted into euros using the following exchange rates of such currencies against the euro, as published by the Bank of Portugal: CURRENCY 31-12-2017 31-12-2018 US Dollar 1.199 1.145 Tangible assets Tangible assets are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and eventual impairment losses. The acquisition cost includes the purchase price of the asset, expenses directly attributable to the purchase and costs incurred in preparing the asset to be ready for utilisation. Costs incurred on borrowings for the construction of tangible fixed assets are recognised as part of the cost of the asset, whenever the period of construction / preparation is more than one year. Subsequent costs with renovations and major repairs that extend the useful life or productive capacity of assets are recognised as a cost of the asset. The costs of current maintenance and repairs are recognised as a cost when they are incurred. The estimated costs of dismantling and removal of the assets will be considered as part of the initial cost. Depreciation is calculated, once the asset becomes available for use by the straight-line method, on a monthly basis in accordance with the estimated useful life for each class of assets. The estimated useful lives for the most significant tangible fixed assets are as follows: 2017 2018 CLASS OF GOODS (YEARS) (YEARS) Buildings and other constructions 10 10 Basic equipment 3-4 3-4 Transportation equipment 4 4 Administrative equipment 2 10 2 10 Other tangible assets 8 8 The useful lives and depreciation method of the tangible assets are reviewed annually. The effect of any changes to these estimates is recognised prospectively in the income statement. The residual values of assets and their respective useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at the reporting date. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount of the asset, it is readjusted to the estimated recoverable amount by recognizing impairment losses (Note 2.6). Gains or losses resulting from the sale or write-off of a tangible fixed asset are determined as the difference between the realizable value of the transaction and the carrying amount of the asset net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses and are recognised in the income statement in the year that occurs the write-off or sale. Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, when applicable. Intangible assets are recognised only when they are identifiable, generate future economic benefits for the Company and can be measured reliably. 271 Amortisation of intangible assets is recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The estimated useful lives for the most significant intangible assets are as follows: 2017 2018 (YEARS) (YEARS) Computer Programs 3 3 Industrial property and other rights 3 3 The useful lives and amortisation method of the various intangible assets are reviewed annually. The effect of any changes to these estimates is recognised in the income statement prospectively. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the net fair value of the assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of a business, a subsidiary, jointly controlled company or associated, at the acquisition date, if this is not a business combination of entities under common control in accordance with IFRS 3. In the case of a business combination of entities under common control, Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the asset and liabilities of the acquired business. Goodwill is presented as a component of the acquisition cost of the financial investments, in the separate accounts of NOS, when business is embodied in an entity. Given the policy followed by the Company in the recognition and measurement of financial investments, on from jointly controlled company or an associated company. Goodwill is not amortised and is subject to impairment tests at least once a year, on assumptions at the date of the statement of financial position which may result in a possible loss of value. to subsequent reversal. For the purposes of impairment tests, goodwill is attributed to the cash-generating units to which it is related, which may correspond to the business segments in which the Company operates, or a lower level. On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the corresponding goodwill is included in determining the corresponding gain or loss realised. Impairment of tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill At each reporting date is carried out a review of the carrying amounts of tangible fixed assets and intangible assets of the Company to determine whether there is any indication that the recorded amount may not be recoverable. If there is any indicator, we estimate the recoverable amount of the respective assets in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount is estimated for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of (i) the fair value less costs to sell and (ii) the current use value. In determining the current use value, the estimated future cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that reflects market expectations for the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cash-generating unit for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 272 When the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, is recognised as an impairment loss. The impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement under Depreciation, amortisation, and impairment losses unless such loss offset a revaluation surplus recorded in The reversal of impairment losses recognised in previous years is recorded when there are indications that these losses no longer exist or have decreased. The reversal of impairment losses is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the captions referred in the previous paragraph. The reversal of the impairment loss is made up to the amount that would be recognised (net of amortisation) if no impairment loss had been recorded in previous years. Investments in-group companies Financial investments in Group companies (companies in which the Company holds directly or indirectly controlling, considering that control over an entity exists when the Group is exposed, and or has rights, as a result of their involvement, on the variable returns the entity's activities, and has the ability to affect this return through the power over the entity) are recorded under the caption Financial investments in Group companies', at their acquisition cost, in accordance with IAS 27, as Company presents, separately, consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS/IFRS. Under this caption are also recorded at nominal value, supplementary capital granted to subsidiaries. An evaluation of investments in Group companies is performed when there are indications that the recorded amount may not be recoverable or impairment losses recorded in previous years no longer exist. Impairment losses detected on the realizable value of the financial investments in Group companies are companies in the income statement. The expenses incurred with the acquisition of financial investments in Group companies are recorded as cost when they are incurred. Financial assets Financial assets are recognised in the statement of financial position of the Company on the trade or contract date, which is the date on which the Company undertakes to purchase or sell the asset. Initially, financial assets are recognised at their fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs, except for assets at fair value through profit or loss when transaction costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss. These assets are derecognised when: (i Company has substantially transferred all the risks and benefits associated with their ownership; or (iii) although it retains part but not substantially all the risks and benefits associated with their ownership, the Company has transferred control of the assets. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and shown as a net value when, and only when, the Company has the right to offset the recognised amounts and intends to settle for the net value. The Company classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial investments at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets measured at amortised cost, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. Its classification depends on the entity's business model to manage the financial assets and the contractual characteristics in terms of the cash flows of the financial asset. 273 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss This category includes financial derivatives and equity instruments that the Group has not classified as financial assets through other comprehensive income at the time of initial recognition. This category also includes all financial instruments whose contractual cash flows are not exclusively capital and interest. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of assets measured at fair value through profit or loss the income from interest and dividends. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are those that are part of a business model whose objective is achieved through the collection of contractual cash flows and the sale of financial assets, being that these contractual cash flows are only capital and interest reimbursement on the capital in debt. Financial assets measured at amortised cost Financial assets measured at amortised cost are those that are included in a business model whose purpose is to hold financial assets in order to receive the contractual cashflows, being that these contractual cash flows are only capital reimbursement and interest payments on the capital in debt. Cash and cash equivalents term deposits and other investments with maturities of less than three months which may be immediately realizable and with a negligible risk of change of value. hen applicable). Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to their contractual substance irrespective after deducting the liabilities. The equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the amount received, net of the costs incurred in their issue. Financial liabilities and equity instruments are regained only when extinguished, i.e., when the obligation is settled, cancelled or extinguished. In accordance with IFRS 9, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for: a) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. These liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, should subsequently be measured at fair value; b) Financial liabilities that arise when a transfer of a financial asset does not meet the conditions for derecognition or when it is applied the continued involvement approach; c) Financial guarantee contracts; d) The commitments to grant a loan at a lower interest rate than the market; e) The recognised contingent consideration by a buyer in a concentration of business activities to which IFRS 3 applies. Such contingent consideration shall be subsequently measured at fair value, with changes recognised in profit or loss. Financial liabilities of the Company include: borrowings, accounts payable and derivative financial instruments. 274 Impairment of financial assets At the date of each statement of financial position, the Company analyses and recognises expected losses on its debt securities, loans and accounts receivable. The expected loss results from the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The objective of this impairment policy is to recognise expected credit losses over the respective duration of financial instruments that have undergone significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition, assessed on an individual or collective basis, taking into account all reasonable and sustainable information, including prospects. If, at the reporting date, the credit risk associated with a financial instrument has not increased significantly since the initial recognition, the Company measures the provision for losses relating to that financial instrument by an amount equivalent to the expected credit losses within a period of 12 months. Derivate financial instruments Initial and subsequent recognition The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as exchange rate forward contracts, interest rate swaps, to cover its exchange rate risks, interest, respectively. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value on the date the derivative is contracted and are subsequently measured at fair value. Derivatives are presented in assets when their fair value is positive and in liabilities when their fair value is negative. In terms of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: • Fair value hedge when the purpose is to hedge the exposure to fair value changes of a registered asset or liability or an unregistered Company • Cash flow hedge when the purpose is to hedge the exposure to cash flow variability arising from a specific risk associated with the whole or a component of a registered asset or liability or an anticipated highly probable occurrence or exchange risk associated with an unregistered Company • Coverage of a net investment in a foreign operational unit. NOS uses derivative financial instruments with fair value and cash flow hedges. At the beginning of the hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the hedging relationship for which hedge accounting is intended to apply as well as the management and strategy purpose of such hedge. Before 1 January 2018, the documentation included the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the hedged risk and the manner in which the Company assessed the effectiveness of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument according with the Company's exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedge item or cash flows arising from the hedged risk. Such hedges should be highly effective to compensate changes in fair values or cash flows and would be assessed on a continuing basis in order to demonstrate their highly effectiveness over the reporting period. Beginning 1 January 2018, the documentation includes the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Company will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements: i) 275 ii) relationship; and iii) The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Company actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Company actually uses to hedges that quantity of hedged item. Hedges that meet all the quantifying criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for, as described bellow: Fair value hedges The change in the fair value of a hedging instrument is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognised in the statement of profit or loss. For fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortised cost, any adjustment to carrying value is amortised through profit or loss over the remaining term of the hedge using the EIR method. The EIR amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss. When an unrecognised firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. Cash flow hedges The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in OCI in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item. The Company uses forward contracts of: i) currency contracts for its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments; ii) interest rates to cover the risk of volatility of the interest rates; iii) own shares contracts for its exposure to volatility in own shares to be distributed within the scope of In the financial year of 2018, the Company did not make any changes in the recognition method. The amounts accumulated in OCI are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the separate component of equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and will not be recognised in OCI for the period. This also applies where the hedged forecast transaction of a nonfinancial asset or non-financial liability subsequently becomes a Company hedge accounting is applied. For any other cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in OCI must remain in accumulated OCI if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Otherwise, the amount will be 276 immediately reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. After discontinuation, once the hedged cash flow occurs, any amount remaining in accumulated OCI must be accounted for depending on the nature of the underlying transaction as described above. Subsidies Subsidies are recognised at their fair value when there is a reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Company will meet the requirements for their award. Operating subsidies, mainly for employee training, are recognised in the income statement by deduction from the corresponding costs incurred. Investment subsidies are recognised in the statement of financial position as deferred income and it is recognised as income on a systematic and rational basis over the useful life of the asset. If the subsidy is considered as deferred income, it is recognised as income on a systematic and rational basis during the useful life of the asset. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets Provisions are recognised when: (i) there is a present obligation arising from past events and it is likely that in settling that obligation, the expenditure of internal resources will be necessary; and (ii) the amount or value of such obligation can be reasonably estimated. When one of the above conditions is not met, the Company discloses the events as a contingent liability unless the likelihood of an outflow of funds resulting from this contingency is remote, in which case they are not disclosed. Provisions, for legal procedures taking place against the Company are made in accordance with the risk assessments carried out by the Company and by their legal advisers, based on success rates. Provisions for restructuring are only recognised when the Company has a detailed and formal plan, which identifies the main features of the restructuring programme and after these facts have been reported to the entities involved. Obligations that result from onerous contracts are registered and measured as provisions. There is an onerous contract when the Company is an integral part of the provisions of an agreement contract, which entail costs that cannot be avoided and exceed the economic benefits derived from the agreement. Provisions for potential future operating losses are not covered. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements, unless the exception provided under IFRS 3 business combination, and are disclosed whenever there is a good chance to shed resources including economic benefits. Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements, being disclosed when there is a likelihood of a future influx of financial resources. Provisions are reviewed and brought up to date at the date of the statement of financial position to reflect the best estimate at that time of the obligation concerned. Leases Leasing contracts are classified as: (i) finance leases, if substantially all the risks and benefits incident to ownership of the corresponding assets concerned have been transferred; or (ii) operating leases, if substantially no risks and rewards incident to ownership of those assets have been transferred. The classification of leases as finance or operating leases is made based on substance rather than contractual form. 277 The assets acquired under finance leases, the corresponding liabilities are recorded using the financial method, and the assets, related accumulated depreciation, and pending debts are recorded in accordance with the contractual finance plan. In addition, the interest included in the rentals and the depreciation of the tangible and intangible fixed assets are recognised in the income statement for the period to which they relate. In the case of operating leases, the rentals due are recognised as costs in the statement of comprehensive income over the period of the leasing contract. Income tax NOS is covered by the special tax regime for groups of companies, which covers all the companies in which it directly or indirectly owns at least 75% of the share capital and which simultaneously are resident in Portugal and subject to Corporate Income Tax (IRC). The remaining subsidiaries not covered by the special tax regime for groups of companies are taxed individually based on their respective taxable incomes and the applicable tax rates. Income tax is stated in accordance with the IAS 12 criteria. In calculating the cost relating to income tax for the period, in addition to current tax, allowance is also made for the effect of deferred tax calculated in accordance with the liability method, taking into account the temporary differences resulting from the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their values as stated in the consolidated financial statements, and the tax losses carried forward at the date of the statement of financial position. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities were calculated based on the tax legislation currently in force or of legislation already published for future application. As stipulated in the above standard, deferred income tax assets are recognised only when there is reasonable assurance that these may be used to reduce future taxable profit, or when there are deferred income tax liabilities whose reversal is expected to occur in the same period in which the deferred income tax assets are reversed. At the end of each period, an assessment is made of deferred income tax assets, and these are adjusted in line with the likelihood of their future use. The amount of tax that are either to be included in current tax or in deferred tax, resulting from transactions or events recognised in equity accounts, is directly recorded under those items and does not affect the results for the period. In a business combination, the deferred tax benefits acquired are recognised as follows: a) The deferred tax benefits acquired in the measurement period of one year after the merger, and that result from new information about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition are recorded against the goodwill-carrying amount related to the acquisition. If the goodwill carrying value is null, any remaining deferred tax benefits are recognised in the income statement. b) All the other acquired deferred tax benefits performed are recognised in the income statement (when Share-based payments The benefits granted to employees under share purchase or share option incentive plans are recorded in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments. In accordance with IFRS 2, since it is not possible to reliably estimate the fair value of the services received from employees, their value is measured by reference to the fair value of equity instruments (own shares) in accordance with their share price at the grant date. 278 The cost is recognised linearly over the period in which the service is provided by employees, under the equity. The accumulated cost recognised at the date of each statement of financial position up to the vesting reflects the best estimate of the number of own shares that will be vested, weighted by the time elapsed between the grant and the vesting. The impact on the income statement each year corresponds to the accumulated cost valuation between the beginning and the end of the year. In turn, benefits granted based on shares but paid in cash lead to the recognition of a liability valued at fair value at the date of the statement of financial position. additional debit related to costs associated to their management, which is debited to its subsidiaries and recognised in equity. Capital Legal reserve Portuguese commercial legislation requires that at least 5% of annual net profit must be appropriated to a legal reserve until it represents at least 20% of the share capital. This reserve is not distributable, except in case of liquidation, but can be used to absorb losses, after having exhausted all other reserves and to increase share capital. Share premium reserves Issue of shares corresponds to premiums from the issuance or capital increases. According to Portuguese distributable, except in case of liquidation, but can be used to absorb losses after having exhausted all other reserves and to increase share capital. Reserves for plans of medium term incentive According to IFRS 2 Share-based payments , the responsibility with the medium-term incentive plans settled by delivery of own shares is recorded as credit, under Reservations for mid-term incentive plans and such reserve is not likely to be distributed or used to absorb losses. The Company recognises in equity the responsibility of all the action plans of various companies in the NOS group, since it is responsible for its delivery to its employees, against results for the year and accounts receivable of subsidiaries when dealing with own employees or employees of subsidiary companies, respectively. Hedging reserves Hedging reserves reflect the changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges that are considered effective, and they are not likely to be distributed or be used to absorb losses. Own shares reserves legal reserve. Under Portuguese law, the amount of distributable reserves is determined according to the individual financial statements of the company prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the increases resulting from the application of fair value through equity components, including its application through the net profit can only be distributed when the elements that originated them are sold, exercised liquidated or when the end their use, in the case of tangible fixed assets or intangible assets. 279 Own shares The own shares are recorded at acquisition cost as a deduction from equity. Gains or losses on the sale of own shares are recorded under other reserves . Retained results This item includes the results available for distribution to shareholders and earnings per fair value in financial instruments increases, financial investments and investment properties, which, in accordance with paragraph 2 of article 32 of the CSC, will only be available for distribution when the elements or rights that originated them are sold, exercised, terminated, or settled. Revenue The Company's revenue is based on the five-step model established by IFRS 15: 1) Identification of the contract with the customer; 2) Identification of performance obligations; 3) Determining the price of the transaction; 4) Allocation of the price of the transaction to the performance obligations; and 5) Recognition of revenue. Thus, at the beginning of each contract, the Company evaluates the promised goods or services and identifies, as a performance obligation, every promise of transfer to the customer of any distinct good or service (or package of goods or services). These promises in customer contracts may be express or implied, provided such promises create a valid expectation in the client that the entity will transfer a good or service to the customer, based on the entity's published policies, specific statements or usual business practices. The Company only provide services so the recognition of revenue occurs at the time of performance of each performance obligation. Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest method, only when they generate future economic benefits for the Company and when they can be measured reliably. the correspondent amount is established. Accruals recognised as they are generated or incurred, regardless when they are received or paid. The costs and revenues related to the current period and whose expenses and income will only occur in future ve already occurred that relate to future periods, which will be recognised in each of those periods, for the corresponding amount. The costs related to the current period and whose expenses will only occur in that future periods are value is classified as Provisions. Financial charges on borrowings Financial charges related to borrowings are recognised as costs in accordance with the accruals principle, except in the case of loans incurred (whether these are generic or specific) for the acquisition, construction or 280 production of an asset that takes a substantial period of time (over one year) to be ready for use, which are capitalised in the acquisition cost of that asset. Employee benefits Personnel expenses are recognised when the service is rendered by employees independently of their date of payment. Here are some specificities: a) Termination of employment. The benefits for termination of employment are due for payment when there is cessation of employment before the normal retirement date or when an employee accepts voluntarily to leave in exchange of these benefits. The company recognises these benefits when it can be shown being committed to a termination of current employees according to a detailed formal plan for termination and there is no realistic possibility of withdrawal or these benefits are granted to encourage voluntary redundancy. When the benefits of cessation of employment are due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date, they are updated to their present value. b) Holiday, holiday allowances and bonuses. According to the labour law, employees are entitled to 22 days annual leave, as well as one month of holiday allowances, rights acquired in the year preceding payment. These liabilities of the company are recorded when incurred, independently of the moment of payment, and are reflected under the item Accounts payable and other . c) Labour Compensation Fund (FCT) and the Labour Compensation Guarantee Fund (FGCT). Based on the publication of Law No. 70/2013 and subsequent regulation by Order No. 294-A / 2013, entered into force on 1 October the Labour Compensation Fund schemes (FCT) and the Guarantee Fund Compensation of Labour (FGCT). In this context, companies that hire a new employee are required to deduct a percentage of the respective salary for these two new funds (0.925% to FCT and 0.075% to FGCT), in order to ensure, in the future, the partial payment the compensation for dismissal. Considering the characteristics of each Fund, the following is considered: The monthly deliveries to FGCT, made by the employer are recognised as expense in the period to which they relate; The monthly deliveries to FCT, made by the employer are recognised as a financial asset of the entity, measured at fair value with changes recognised in the respective results. Statement of cash flows The statement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the direct method. The Company classifies under change in value is negligible. For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the balance of cash and cash equivalents also include bank overdrafts included in the statement of financial position under Borrowings . The statement of cash flows is divided into operating, investment, and financing activities. Operating activities include cash received from customers and payments to suppliers, staff and others related to operating activities. The cash flows included in investment activities include acquisitions and disposals of investments in subsidiaries and cash received and payments arising from the purchase and sale of tangible and intangible assets, amongst others. Financing activities include cash received and payments relating to borrowings, the payment of interest and similar costs, finance leases, the purchase and sale of own shares and the payment of dividends. 281 Subsequent events Events occurring after the date of the statement of financial position, which provide additional information about conditions that existed at that date, are taken into account in the preparation of financial statements for the period. Events occurring after the date of the statement of financial position, which provide information on conditions that occur after that date, are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements, when they are materially relevant. Risk management Financial risk factors NOS as a holding company (SGPS) develops direct and indirect management activities over its subsidiaries. Thus, the fulfilment of assumed obligations depends on the cash flows generated by these. Therefore, the company depends on the eventual distribution of dividends by its subsidiaries, the payment of interest, repayment of loans and other cash flows generated by those companies. available funds will depend, in part, on its ability to generate positive cash flows and, on the other hand, is dependent on the respective results, available reserves, and financial structure. NOS has a program of risk management that focuses its analysis on the financial markets in order to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance. Risk management is handled by the Financial Management in accordance with the policy approved by the Board. There is also at NOS an Internal Control Committee with specific functions in the control area of risks of the activity of the Company. Exchange rate risk Exchange rate risk is mainly related to exposure resulting from payments made to suppliers of terminal equipment and producers of audiovisual content for the Pay TV and audiovisual businesses, respectively. dollars. Depending on the balance of accounts payable resulting from transactions in a currency different from the namely short-term foreign currency forwards, in order to hedge the risk associated with these balances. NOS has investments in foreign companies whose assets and liabilities are exposed to ex-change rate variations (the Group has two subsidiaries in Mozambique, Lusomundo Moçambique and Mstar, whose functional currency is the Metical, four in Angola, Finstar, ZAP Media, ZAP Cinemas and ZAP Publishing whose functional currency is the Kwanza). NOS has not adopted any policy of hedging the risk of exchange rate variations for these companies on cash flows in foreign currencies. Additional disclosures are made in the consolidated financial statements of NOS. Interest rate risk The risk of fluctuations in interest rates can result in a cash flow risk or a fair value risk, depending on whether variable or fixed interest rates have been negotiated. NOS has adopted a policy of hedging risk through the use of interest rate swaps to hedge future interest payments on bond loans and other borrowings. 282 NOS uses a sensitivity analysis technique which measures the expected impacts on results and equity of an immediate increase or decrease of 0.25% (25 basis points) in market interest rates, for the rates applying at the date of the statement of financial position for each class of financial instrument, with all other variables remaining constant. This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, since in practice market rates rarely change in isolation. The sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: • Changes in market interest rates affect interest receivable or payable on financial instruments with variable rates; • Changes in market interest rates only affect interest receivable or payable on financial instruments with fixed interest rates when they are recognised at fair value; • Changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities; • Changes in the fair value of derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting future cash flows from current net values using market rates at the end of the year. Under these assumptions, an increase or decrease of 0.25% in market interest rates for loans that are not covered or loans with variable interest at 31 December 2018 would have resulted in an increase or decrease in annual profit before tax of approximately 1.1 million euros (2017: 1.7 million euros). In the case of the interest rate swaps contracted, the sensitivity analysis which measures the estimated impact of an immediate increase or decrease of 0.25% (25 basis points) in market interest rates results in changes in the fair value of the swaps of over 319 thousand euros (2017: over 945 thousand euros) and down 320 thousand euros (2017: less 955 thousand euros) at 31 December 2018. Additional disclosures are made in the consolidated financial statements of NOS. Credit risk Credit risk is mainly related to the risk of a counterparty defaulting on its contractual obligations, resulting in a operating and treasury activities. This risk is monitored on a regular business basis, and the aim of management is to: i) limit the credit granted to customers, using the average payment time by each customer; ii) monitor the trend in the level of credit granted; and iii) analyse the impairment of receivables on a regular basis. accounts receivable derive from a large number of clients from a wide range of businesses and the subsidiaries obtain credit guarantees, whenever the financial situation of the customer requires. Additional disclosures are made in the consolidated financial statements of NOS. Liquidity risk NOS manages liquidity risk in two ways: i. ensuring that its debt has a high component of medium and long-term maturities appropriate to the characteristics of industries when its subsidiaries exert their activity; and ii. through contractual arrangements with financial institutions of credit facilities available at any time, for an amount that ensures adequate liquidity. 283 Based on estimated cash flows and taking into consideration the compliance with any covenants typically existing in loans payable, management regularly monitors the forecasts of liquidity reserves by subsidiaries of NOS, including the amounts of unused credit lines, amounts of cash and cash equivalents. Additional disclosures are made in the consolidated financial statements of NOS. Relevant estimates and judgements presented nt to make judgments and estimates that affect the statement of financial position and the reported results. These estimates are based on the best information and knowledge about past and/or present events, and on the operations that the Company considers may it may implement in the future. However, at the date of completion of such operations, their results may differ from these estimates. Changes to these estimates that occur after the date of approval of the financial statements will be corrected in the income statement in a prospective manner, in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors . The estimates and assumptions that imply a greater risk of giving rise to a material adjustment in assets and liabilities are described below: Relevant accounting estimates Provisions The Company periodically reviews any obligations arising from past events, which should be recognised or disclosed. The subjectivity involved in determining the probability and amount of internal resources required to meet obligations may give rise to significant adjustments, either due to changes in the assumptions made, or due to the future recognition of provisions previously disclosed as contingent liabilities. Tangible and intangible assets The determination of the useful lives of assets as well as the amortisation / depreciation method to be applied is crucial in determining the amount of amortisation / depreciation to be recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for ea for the assets and businesses concerned, and taking account of the practices adopted by sector companies at international level. Impairment assets, excluding goodwill The determination of a possible impairment loss can be triggered by the occurrence of various events, many of which outside the Company's sphere of influence, such as future availability of financing, cost of capital, as well as any other changes, either internal or external, to the Company. The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and determining the fair value of assets involve a high degree of judgment by the Board of Directors with regard to the identification and evaluation of different impairment indicators, expected cash flows, applicable discount rates, useful lives, and residual values. Impairment of goodwill Goodwill is subjected to impairment tests annually or whenever there are indications of a possible loss of value. The recoverable values of the cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated are determined 284 based on the calculation of current use values. These calculations require the use of estimates by management. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities When the fair value of an asset or liabilities is calculated, on an active market, the respective market price is liabilities, valuation techniques generally accepted in the market, based on market assumptions, are used. The Company uses evaluation techniques for unlisted financial instruments such as derivatives. The valuation models that are used most frequently are discounted cash flow models and options models, incorporating, for example, interest rate curves and market volatility. For certain types of more complex derivatives, more advanced valuation models are used containing assumptions and data that are not directly observable in the market, for which the Company uses internal estimates and assumptions. Misstatement, estimates and changes to accounting policies During the financial years ended on 31 December 2017 and 2018, no material misstatements relating to previous years were recognised. Financial assets and liabilities classified in accordance with the IFRS 9 categories financial instruments The accounting policies set out in IFRS 9 for financial instruments were applied to the following items: 31-12-2017 TOTAL NON OTHER LOANS AND FINANCIAL FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES FINANCIAL TOTAL RECEIVABLES ASSETS / ASSETS / LIABILITIES LIABILITIES LIABILITIES ASSETS Accounts receivable non current (Note 9) 546,344,616 546,344,616 546,344,616 Available-for-sale financial assets (Note 11) 76,727 76,727 76,727 Accounts receivable current (Note 9) 300,115,134 300,115,134 2,615 300,117,749 Derivative financial instruments (Note 20) 18,651 18,651 18,651 Cash and cash equivalents (Note 14) 177,880 177,880 177,880 TOTAL FINANCIAL ASSETS 846,714,357 18,651 846,733,008 2,615 846,735,623 LIABILITIES Borrowings non current (Note 16) 870,340,798 870,340,798 870,340,798 Accrued expenses non current (Note 18) 1,083,198 1,083,198 1,083,198 Borrowings current (Note 16) 170,523,609 170,523,609 170,523,609 Accounts payable current (Note 21) 98,656,368 98,656,368 98,656,368 Accrued expenses current (Note 18) 2,549,264 2,549,264 2,549,264 Derivative financial instruments (Note 20) 2,461,705 2,461,705 2,461,705 TOTAL FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 2,461,705 1,143,153,237 1,145,614,942 1,145,614,942 285 31-12-2018 TOTAL NON OTHER LOANS AND FINANCIAL FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES FINANCIAL TOTAL RECEIVABLES ASSETS / ASSETS / LIABILITIES LIABILITIES LIABILITIES ASSETS Accounts receivable non current (Note 9) 90,495,931 90,495,931 90,495,931 Available-for-sale financial assets (Note 11) 12,951 12,951 12,951 Accounts receivable current (Note 9) 1,082,216,492 1,082,216,492 16,942 1,082,233,434 Derivative financial instruments (Note 20) 153,172 153,172 153,172 Cash and cash equivalents (Nota 14) 456,716 456,716 456,716 TOTAL FINANCIAL ASSETS 1,173,182,090 153,172 1,173,335,262 1,173,352,204 LIABILITIES Borrowings non current (Note 16) 825,397,627 825,397,627 825,397,627 Accrued expenses non current (Note 18) 1,142,624 1,142,624 1,142,624 Borrowings current (Note 16) 214,680,298 214,680,298 214,680,298 Accounts payable current (Note 21) 92,717,405 92,717,405 92,717,405 Accrued expenses current (Note 18) 2,481,164 2,481,164 2,481,164 Derivative financial instruments (Note 20) 1,211,177 1,211,177 1,211,177 TOTAL FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 1,211,177 1,136,419,118 1,137,630,295 1,137,630,295 Considering its nature, the balances of the amounts to be paid and received to/from state and other public t included in the scope of IFRS 7.

In addition, the applicable accounting rules determine that gains or losses on the disposal of own shares are stated in reserves. At 31 December 2018, there were 2,069,356 own shares, representing 0.4017% of the share capital (31 December 2017: 2,040,234 own shares, representing 0.3960% of the share capital).

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; ► obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control; ► evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management; ► conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated and individual financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern; ► evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated and individual financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated and individual financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; ► obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated and individual financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion; ► communicate with those charged with governance, including the supervisory board, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit; ► from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, including the supervisory board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated and individual financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter; and ► we also provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

Anonymous complaints will only be accepted and treated on an exceptional basis and, in any case, no reprisal or retaliation will be tolerated against those that make the mentioned communications. The reporting of any signs addressed to the Fiscal Board, by letter sent to the post box address Apartado 14026 EC, 5 de Outubro, 1064001 Lisboa, or to the electronic mail address comunicar.irregularidades@nos.pt, choosing the author one of the above mentioned ways of communication. The Fiscal Board is responsible for receiving, recording and processing the communications of irregularities that occur in NOS or in the companies within the respective group and for undertaking other acts which are necessarily related with those powers. After being registered, the communications are subject to a preliminary analysis in order to ensure the degree of credibility of the communication, the irregular nature of the reported behaviour, the viability of research and the identification of the people involved or who have knowledge of the relevant facts and, in this regarding, must be confronted or surveyed. The report of the preliminary analysis shall concludes by the continuation or not of the investigation. If the Fiscal Board considers that the communication is consistent, plausible and likely, an investigation begins, conducted and supervised by the Fiscal Board, which will be made known to the CGS and the Ethics Committee.

The Internal Audit must assist the Fiscal Board. The Fiscal Board may also hire external auditors or other experts to assist in the investigation, when the specialty of matters requires specialized services. The Fiscal Board, within the limits of its powers, shall monitor the correct application of the procedure established by the aforementioned Regulation. III. Internal control and risk management 50. Entities responsible for Internal Auditing and risk management The internal control and risk management system at NOS consists of various key parties with the following responsibilities and goals: • Executive Committee The Executive Committee is responsible for the creation and functioning of -today management conferred by the Board of Directors. It is also responsible for discussing and 384 approving risk objectives, including the levels of risk acceptance, approving of strategic plans and consistent with those objectives. • Areas of business Each functional department in NOS business units is, as part of its responsibility in corporate or functional processes, responsible for the implementation of internal controls and for the management of their specific risks. In addition, for the development of certain risk management programmes, specific risk management teams may be set up, such as risk committees or working teams. These normally include an executive coordinator, a committee of directors and a team of pivots (interlocutors) representing the business units. • Risk Management The risk management areas work to raise awareness, measure and manage business risks that interfere with the fulfilment of goals and with value creation within the organisation. They contribute with tools, methodologies, support and know-how to the business areas. They also promote and monitor the implementation of programmes, projects and actions aimed at bringing risk levels close to the acceptable limits laid down by the management. • Internal Auditing Assesses risk exposure and verifies the effectiveness of risk management and of internal control of both business processes and information and telecommunications systems. Proposes measures to improve internal controls, aimed at more effective management of business and technology risks. Monitors the evolution of risk exposure associated with the main findings and non-conformities identified in the audits. This area reports to the Fiscal Board in respect to these matters. • External Auditor Verifies the effectiveness and functioning of internal control mechanisms and carried out in the public interest, the external auditor is responsible for verifying the accounts of the Company and for the respective issue of the legal certification of accounts and of an audit report, among other duties. • Fiscal Board It is the supervisory body with legal and statutory responsibility for evaluating the operating of the risk management and internal control systems and of the internal audit system, being recipient of the said reports, and decides on the work plan and resources assigned to the Internal Audit services. • Finance and Audit Committee As a specialized committee, it advises the Board of Directors on certain matters, including those relating to the functions of the External Auditor, Internal Audit and Risk Management, thereby reinforcing, in a complementary manner, the supervision of these matters that is carried out by the Fiscal Board. As a part of the Internal Control and Risk Management System, the Company has a corporate department specialising in risk the Department of Internal Auditing and Risk Management the mission of which is to contribute to effective management of NOS business risks. These Internal Auditing and Risk Management operations, through a systematic and disciplined approach in order to assess and help to improve the effectiveness of risk management, internal control and corporate governance processes. The area of Risk Management includes the teams from the Risk Management and Continuous Risk Monitoring Programmes. This area coordinates the development and maintenance of the Information Security, Personal Data Privacy and Business Continuity Programs. It is responsible for the operational management of the 385 continuous monitoring of risks activities, through follow-up of improvement and corrective actions, as well as key indicators in some business processes. These teams perform risk analysis, propose risk management policies for the Company and coordinate crosscutting programmes or projects to endow the organization of adapted procedures and the respective internal controls which will allow for the risk management. They also ensure the review, assessment and adaptation of the internal control manuals implemented in the main NOS businesses. There are also risk management functions in some of the areas of business, particularly when the existence of specific pivots or champions (interlocutors) is important for certain special aspects of risk management, such as the management of Business Continuity, Information Security, Internal Control Manual, Privacy, Services Management, as well as the case of integrated management system relating to Quality, Environment and Occupational Health and Safety. Within the assessment of the degree of internal compliance and the performance of the risk management system, the Finance and Audit Committee and the Fiscal Board receive the following reports: the annual assessment carried out by the External Audit on the Internal Control system; the indicators produced periodically by the Risk Management on the results of the Internal Control (for example, degree of implementation of the Internal Control Manual, coverage of financial risks by the Internal Control Manual, SelfAssessments results of controls, key controls, etc.). The area of Internal Auditing covers the Business Process Auditing and Systems Auditing teams. The following activities fall within its scope: assurance audits of processes and systems, compliance audits of the Internal Control Manual and the ISO 27001 certification, incident and complaint audits, as well as independent and objective advisory work. The activities of the Internal Auditing teams are defined under the Internal Audit Charter. The Internal Auditing activity is governed by the guidelines of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), including the definition of internal audit, the Code of Ethics and the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Actions and Resources Plan and on a prioritisation of audit work, using a risk-based methodology that includes the results of ERM Enterprise Risk Management and considers the roadmap for coverage of business procedures, telecommunications and information systems and legal obligations. The internal audit plan also considers the contributions of the Executive Committee, of other senior managers, of the Audit and Finance Committee and, separately, of the Fiscal Board which has a responsibility based on the law or on the Articles of Association to state its position on the working plan and the resources allocated to the Internal Auditing services. In accordance with good international practices, the Internal Auditing and Risk Management teams have the majority of their staff certified in audit norms and risk management methods, involving in total 28 certifications. These include the Certified Internal Auditor (CIA), the Certified in Control Self Assessment (CCSA), the Certified Information System Auditor (CISA), the ISO 27001 ISMS Lead Auditor, the ISO 22301 BCMS Lead Auditor, the ISO 31000 Lead Risk Manager, the Certified Continuity Manager (CCM), the Associated Business Continuity Professional (ABCP), the Certified Information System Security Manager (CISM), the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), the ISO 27001 ISMS Lead Implementer, the Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC), the Certified in the Governance of Enterprise IT (CGEIT), the ITIL Foundation (ITIL), the Project Management Professional (PMP) and the Certified Project Management Associate (CPMA). 386 51. Relationships with other bodies or committees The hierarchical and functional relationships are those specified below: • Internal Auditing and the Risk Management report hierarchically to NOS Executive Committee, namely to the CFO (Chief Financial Officer). • The Internal Auditing and the Risk Management report functionally to NOS Fiscal Board, as the supervisory body with responsibility based on the law or on the Articles of Association for assessing the performance of internal control and risk management systems and of the internal audit system, receiving the corresponding reports, and giving its opinion on the working plan and the resources allocated to the Audit Internal services. • Internal Auditing and the Risk Management (this in the Internal Control part) also report functionally to NOS Audit and Finance Committee, as the specialised commission that advises the Board of Directors on certain matters, including those concerning the Auditing and Risk Management functions, thus reinforcing, complementarily, the supervision of these matters already carried out by the Fiscal Board. • Internal Auditing secretaries the NOS Ethics Committee, in its capacity as committee responsible for overseeing and maintaining the NOS Code of Ethics, for monitoring its implementation and for ensuring that all members of corporate bodies and all employees of the company comply with it. The remaining responsibilities for the creation, operation and periodic assessment of the internal control and risk management system are defined in the Regulations of corresponding bodies or committees. General Meeting Remuneration Committee Statutory Auditor Board of Directors Fiscal Board Internal Audit Company Secretary CFO Audit/Risk Management Ethics Committee Executive Committee ,,, Risk Management Audit and Finance Commission Corporate Governance Commission Appointment and Evaluation Committee Hierarchical dependence Functional dependence 387 52. Other competent areas in risk control In addition to the areas referred to in the preceding sections, the Company has other functional areas with competence in internal control and risk management that make a decisive contribution to maintaining and improving the control environment. Particularly notable in this context are the following business areas and processes: • The areas of Planning and Control, in coordination with the corresponding pivots in the areas of business, are responsible for monitoring the implementation of Annual Action and Resource Plans (encompassed on the strategic plans of the Company) and the correspondent budgets and forecasts, in the financial and operational components; • The various areas of business and individual employees are required to comply with the procedures set out in the Internal Control Manual, ensuring that all acts or transactions engaged in are appropriate and properly evidenced; • The different areas of business have processes and indicators to monitor operations and KPIs; • There are areas dedicated to monitoring specific business risks and generating alerts, such as the Enterprise Business Assurance (control of subscription fraud, consumption fraud, and contents fraud) and Services Supervision teams, in the communications business; • The technical areas, including Networks and Information Systems, have indicators and alerts for interruptions in service and security incidents, on an operational level; • The various areas of business have internal controls that ensure not only their commitment in the environment of risk management and internal control, but also the permanent monitoring of the pattern of effectiveness and adequacy of these controls. 53. Main types of risk The Company is exposed to economic, financial and legal risks incidental to its business activities. The approach adopted by NOS for Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), is to incorporate risk management into NOS strategic planning activities. During the preparation of annual Action and Resources Plans, encompassed on the strategic plans, the business areas consider risks that may compromise their performance and objectives and define actions to manage those risks, within the levels of acceptance intended and established by the Executive Committee. The plans are discussed and approved by the Executive Committee. The main risks inherent to NOS business and the corresponding strategies and actions that have been adopted for their management will now be described. For some risks, we make reference to the strategies and actions to other sections of the Accounts Report where they are described with further detail. Economic risks • Economic Environment The Company was still exposed over the last few years to the effects of the economic environment experienced in Portugal during the last years and consequently to a general reduction in consumption. Despite the improvements on the economic and market environment verified more recently, mainly through the increase of the product, there is a risk of the market share, in clients and/or revenue, being affected by the unemployment rate, by the still high use of measures for reduction of public consumption and also by the private consumption variability. NOS has carefully monitored this risk and adopted strategies aiming to increase of 388 clients and counter the drop in revenue visible in the Portuguese telecomunications market. NOS has also been paying attention to the identification of other opportunities, in conjunction with the competition and technological innovation risk response strategies that are described below. • Competition This risk is related to the potential reduction in the prices of products and services, reduction in market share, loss of customers, increasing difficulty in obtaining and retaining customers. The management of competition risk has involved a strategy of investing in constant improvement in quality, distinctiveness and innovation for the products and services provided, as well as in its protection from competition, diversification of supply, combination of offers related with different businesses of NOS and the strengthening of the portfolio of broadcasting rights and the respective provision of contents as well as the constant monitoring of customer preferences and/or needs. The operational integration processes that have taken place over the past years in NOS have contributed to the development of a competitive position vis-à-vis its competitors. NOS intends to go even further in strengthening its competitive position, evolving from a logic of integration to a logic of transformation, and so has in place an operational transformation programme focused essentially on customer satisfaction, organizational fitness and operational efficiency. NOS is also aware of the consolidation and acquisition moves of its competitors in the communications, content and entertainment industries. • Technological Innovation This risk is associated with the need for investment in increasingly competitive services (multimedia services, messaging services, multiplatform TV services, cloud services, infrastructure and information technology services, etc.), which are subject not only to accelerated changes in technology but also to the actions of the players which act outside of the tradiditional communications market, like the OTT (over-the-top players) Operators. NOS has in place various initiatives on technological transformation which lay the foundation for long-term competitive differentiation. The Company also has been managing this risk by introducing technologies, services and innovative contents as described over the Management Report and also on the Non• Business Interruption and Catastrophic Losses (Business Continuity Management) Since the businesses of NOS are based above all on the use of technology, potential failures in technicaloperational resources (network infrastructures, information systems applications, servers, etc.) may cause a significant risk of business interruption, if they are not well managed. This may imply other risks for the Company, such as adverse impacts on reputation, on the brand, on revenue integrity, on customer satisfaction and on service quality, which may lead to the loss of customers. In the electronic communications sector, business interruption and other associated risks may be aggravated because the services are in real time (voice, data/internet and TV), and customers typically have low tolerance for interruptions. To address these risk, NOS develops and maintains the BCM Business Continuity Management programme, as well as other initiatives and actions as described on the Non• Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (Information Security Management) Bearing in mind that NOS is the biggest corporate group in the area of communications and entertainment in the country, its businesses makes intensive use of information and of information and communication technologies that are typically subject to security risks, such as availability, integrity, and confidentiality. Just like other operators, NOS is increasingly exposed to cybersecurity risks, related to external threats to the electronic communications networks and to the surrounding cyberspace. To address the security and cybersecurity risks, NOS develops and maintains the ISM (Information 389 Security Management), as well as other initiatives and actions detailed on the Non-Financial Statements, namely on t • Privacy (Personal Data Protection) Privacy risks are becoming more important, mainly associated with changes in the regulations on personal data protection, which is transversal to all sectors of activity and also applicable, in particular, to the protection of personal data, which is subject to specific regulations on security and privacy. To address these risks, NOS has an ongoing Privacy Program in order to monitor and continually improve the company compliance with the new General Regulation on Data Protection and with other regulations that have an impact on privacy. Some of the most relevant initiatives and actions are described under the Non Financial Statements, namely on on the • Service Fraud (Management of Communications Fraud) Customer or third party fraud is a common risk in the comunications sector. Perpetrators of fraud may take advantage of the potential v services. In view of this situation, NOS has a team dedicated to Fraud control, including subscription fraud, consumption fraud and contents fraud. In order to encourage secure use of communications services, it has developed various initiatives and implemented controls, including the provision of an internal platform with information on security risks and service fraud, as well as the continuous improvement of processes to monitor and mitigate these risks. Fraud controls are implemented to prevent anomalous situations of fraudulent use or situations of misuse with a direct impact on the costumer satisfaction, on the potential service disruption and on the e. NOS has also joined initiatives developed by the GSM Association (GSMA), namely the Fraud and Security Group (FASG). • Revenue and Cost Assurance (Enterprise Business Assurance) Electronic comunications businesses are subject to inherent operational risks associated with the assurance and monitoring of customer revenue and costs, from a viewpoint of revenue flows and platform integrity. Billing processes perform revenue controls, with regard to invoicing quality. NOS also Business Assurance teams that apply processes to control revenue integrity (underinvoicing or overinvoicing) and processes the cost control and services utilization with the aim of presenting a consistent chain of revenue and costs, from the moment the customer enters our provisioning systems, involving the provision of the communications service, up to the time of invoicing and charging. Financial risks • Tax The Company is exposed to changes in tax legislation and varied interpretations of the application of tax and tax related regulations in several ways. The Finance Department contributes to management of this risk, monitoring all tax regulations and seeking to guarantee maximum tax efficiency. This department may also be supported by external consultants whenever the questions being analysed are more critical and, for this reason, require interpretation by an independent entity. • Credit and Collections These risks are associated with a reduction in receipts from customers due to possible ineffective or deficient operation of collection procedures and/or changes in the legislation that regulates the provision of essential services and have an impact on the recovery of customer debts. The current adverse economic climate also significantly contributes to the worsening of these risks. They are mitigated through the definition of a monthly plan of collection actions, their follow-up and validation and the review of results. Where necessary, the procedure and the timings of these actions are adjusted to ensure the receipt of customer debts. The aim is to ensure that the amounts owed are effectively collected within the periods negotiated without affecting the financial health of the Company. In addition, NOS has specific teams for Credit 390 Control, Inbound Delivery, Collections and Litigation and, regarding some business segments, also subscribes credit insurances. Legal risks • Legal and Regulatory The electronic communications market in Portugal is subject to a regulatory framework emerging from European and national law. In Portugal, ANACOM, as a sector regulator, is resposable to ensure operators' access to the networks, in conditions of transparency and equality, as well as to promote competition and market development. To this end, it ensures the compliance and the supervision of a significant set of rules to which the market is subject, including the analysis of relevant markets, the identification of companies with significant market power (SMP) and the imposition of appropriate measures for the resolution of identified market failures. Within this context, in 2018 it should be highlighted the approval of the Portability Regulation, the analysis of the amendment of the conditions associated with the use of the MEO conduits and poles, the decision on the limits associated with zero rating offers, a new project for Regulation on Network Security and Integrity and a first public consultation with a view to the future allocation of radio spectrum for 5G. ANACOM is also responsible for ensuring the dissemination and monitoring the compliance with European directives applicable to the sector, and in 2018 was published the European Code of Electronic Communications, which assembles the four main European directives applicable to the sector (Framework-Directive, Authorization Directive, Access Directive and Universal Service Directive). This document shall be transposed to internal law until the end of 2020, being that in this process the participation of the sector regulator is expected, as well as the involvement of the relevant stakeholders. In addition, ANACOM is also responsible for ensuring the compliance by the operators with the European regulations directly applicable to Portugal, such as the TSM Regulation (which includes rules for roam-like-at-home and protection of network neutrality), the General Regulation on Data Protection and the e-Privacy Regulation. In addition to the specific rules relating to the communications sector, NOS is also subject to horizontal legislation, including competition law, being that in this case it can be subject to intervention by, amongst others, the Competition Authority. Finally, it should be pointed out that the management of the existing regulatory and legal risks is ensured by the Legal and Regulatory Department, which monitors the evolution of the applicable legal and regulatory framework, considering the threats and opportunities that represent to the competitive position of the NOS in the business areas in which it operates, 54. Risk management The risk management and internal control processes at NOS, including the methodologies used to identify, assess and monitor risks, are described in this section. The risk management and internal control processes are supported by a consistent and systematic methodology, based on the international standard Enterprise Risk Management Integrated Framework, issued by COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission). In addition, for the management of risks related to Information Security, Personal Data Protection and Business Continuity, specific methodologies were also considered in line with the standards from the ISO 2700x series Information Security Management and with ISO 22301 Business Continuity Management, as well as legal and regulatory requirements on network security and integrity (supervised by ANACOM) and on personal data privacy (supervised by CNPD). The methodologies adopted for the internal control system also took into consideration the references provided by organisations responsible for promoting the existence of control mechanisms in markets, 391 including recommendations from the CMVM Corporate Governance Code (previously in force) and from the IPCC (Portuguese Institute of Corporate Governance), as well as the Portuguese Companies Code. In addition, for aspects of internal control related to ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), the COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) framework was also considered. The diagram below illustrates the main stages of NOS general risk management methodology, which can be applied to entities or to the business processes of its main subsidiaries. 1 Evaluate 5 2 Monitor DECISION Source MAKING INFORMATION 4 3 Manage Measure Risk Management Cycle (ERM Enterprise Risk Management) In line with this general methodology, the management and control of risks are achieved using the main approaches and methods presented below: Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Approach: This approach seeks to align the risk management cycle with NOS strategic planning cycle. It enables NOS businesses to assign priorities and identify critical risks that may compromise its performance and its objectives, and to adopt actions to manage these risks. This is achieved through constant monitoring of risks and the implementation of certain corrective measures. Method: 1. Identify and assess business risks >> 2. Explore risks and Identify causes >> 3. Measure triggers >> 4. Manage risks >> 5. Monitor risks Business Continuity Management (BCM) Approach: It seeks to mitigate the risk of interruptions of critical business activities that may arise as a consequence of disasters, technical-operational failures or human failures. The scope of this process also includes the assessment and management of physica critical sites. Method: 1. Understand the business >> 2. Define resilience strategies >> 3. Develop and implement continuity and crisis management plans >> 4. Test, maintain and audit the BCM plans and processes. Information Security Management (ISM) Approach: It seeks to manage risks associated with the availability, integrity, confidentiality and privacy of information and personal data. Its goals are to develop and maintain the Information Security Policy and Privacy Policies, to verify the compliance of procedures with the policy, to 392 develop training and awareness programmes, and to establish and monitor KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for Information Security and Privacy. Method: 1. Identify critical information/data >> 2. Detail critical information/data support platforms/resources >> 3. Assess the security risk level >> 4. Define and implement indicators >> 5. Manage and monitor risk mitigation measures Continuous Monitoring of Risks and Controls (CM Continuous Monitoring) Approach: It can be used to continuously review business procedures, ensuring preventive, pro-active and dynamic maintenance of an acceptable level of risk and control. The Internal Control Manual systematises and references the controls, facilitating their disclosure and encouraging compliance by the different people involved in the organisation. Method: 1. Define processes, business cycles and data structure >> 2. Establish the design of controls >> 3. Implement, disclose and ensure the effective application of controls >> 4. Analyse and report status metrics for the implementation of controls >> 5. Follow up action plans and update controls. 55. Main features of the internal control and risk management systems related to the disclosure of financial information NOS recognises that, as is the case with other listed companies with similar activities, it is potentially exposed to risks related to accounting processes and financial reporting. The Company is thus committed to maintaining an effective internal control environment, especially in these processes. It intends to ensure the quality and improvement of the most important processes for preparation and disclosure of financial statements, in accordance with the accounting principles adopted and bearing in mind its goals of management has been conservative and prudent. Functional responsibilities for financial statements on the corporate level of NOS and subsidiary companies are distributed as follows: • Entity Level Controls are defined in corporate terms, including NOS, being applicable to all the group companies, and aim to establish internal control guidelines for NOS subsidiaries; • Process Level Controls and IS/IT Controls are defined in corporate terms, being applied to NOS subsidiaries, adapted to their specific characteristics, organisation and responsibility for processes. In view of this division, the controls related to collection of the information that will be the basis for preparation of the financial statements can be found, usually, at the departments of each of the subsidiary companies; the controls related to processing, recording and filing this information in accounting books can be found at a corporate level in the Administrative and Finance Department. The internal control and risk management system associated with financial statements includes the key controls specified below: • The process of disclosure of financial information is institutionalised, the criteria for preparation and disclosure have been duly approved, are fully established and periodically reviewed; • The use of accounting principles, explained in the Annexes of the Financial Statements notably on • The controls are aggregated by the business cycles that give rise to the financial statements, and by the corresponding classes and subclasses of transactions; 393 • Indexing is maintained between the controls defined in the Internal Control Manual and the four commonly accepted financial assertions: i. Completeness: to ensure that all transactions are recorded, that all valid transactions are submitted for processing and that there are no duplicate records; ii. Accuracy: to ensure that transactions are recorded correctly including recording in the accounts in the period in which they occurred, with appropriate accrual accounting; iii. Validity: which means that all transactions are valid, complying with two fundamental criteria: (i) they are properly approved in accordance with delegations of power and (ii) are related to the normal activities of the Company, in other words, they are legal; iv. Restricted Access: it seeks to ensure that there are appropriate restrictions on access to information in electronic format or any other means of protecting assets. In order to guarantee the know-how of all the those involved in the financial reporting process with regard to responsibilities, the Administrative and Finance Department shall prepare, for the most significant situations, a set of documents on the implemented policies and preocedures and their relevance to the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) and also addresses potential causes of risk that may materially affect accounting and financial reporting. These potential causes of risk include the following: • Accounting estimates The most significant accounting estimates are described in the Annexes of the Financial Statements. The estimates were based on the best information available during the preparation of the financial statements, and on the best understanding and best experience of past and/or present events; • Balances and transactions with related parties The most significant balances and transactions with related parties are disclosed in the Annexes of the financial statements. NOS adopts various measures to help manage risks and maintain a robust internal control environment, including initiatives of the following type: • Conformity tests These include periodical control self-assessment of the internal control system and the consequent revision of the Internal Control Manual, ensuring that it is always up-to-date. They also include corrective actions concerning control procedures considered non-compliant, as a result of conformity assessment by Internal Auditing and by the External Auditor; • Review and improvement of design of controls These include the review of the procedures of control and the strengthening of business cycles and financial flows with levels of relevant materiality, to improve the control environment and the control and perception of current risks (operational and financial). This reinforcement includes the creation of an aggregating vision of the life cycles of the assets or the associated financial flows, as well as the respective processes and systems that support them. In addition to the financial risks referred to in the section on the main types of risks with an impact on the business, the Company is potentially exposed to other financial risks that may have an impact on the financial statements, such as credit risk (related to balances receivable), liquidity risk (related to sufficient assets to cover liabilities), market risk (related to exchange rate and interest rate variations) and capital risk (related to financial loans and the remuneration of shareholders). In information can be found on financial risk management policies, as well as on how risks associated with the financial statements are managed and controlled. 394 IV.

During 2018, the Remuneration Committee did not engage any services to support the performance of its duties. The Remuneration Committee met 3 times in 2018, having decided on matters of assessment, remuneration and definition of the goals of the Executive Committee. The minutes of the respective meetings are always drawn up and signed. 68. Knowledge and experience of members The members of the Remunaration Committee hold a vast and recognized management experience, namely in listed companies as presented in item 19 of this report. III. Remuneration structure 69. Description of the remuneration policy A Remuneration Committee declaration on the remuneration policy for NOS management and supervisory compliance with article 2 of Law no. 28/2009, of 19 June a general outline of which is given below. best professionals in the market. Best practices in remuneration systems for listed companies suggest the use of models that incorporate annual bonus, profit sharing and/or the implementation of share allocation plans. The components of NOS compensation scheme for Executive Directors are in line with practices in other comparable companies. The variable remuneration associated with the achievement of management goals is applied through the following components: Profit Sharing and Share Allocation Plan. The Profit sharing can be proposed to shareholders by the Board of Directors. After assessment of the total amount to be distributed, the amount to be received by each member will also depend on alignment with the results. The Share Plans, approved, over time, at the General Meeting aim to guarantee the alignment of individual interests with the corporate goals and interests of NOS shareholders, rewarding the achievement of objectives that imply sustained value creation. The non-executive members of the Board of Directors, as they are not responsible for carrying out the defined strategies in a daily basis, have a compensation system that does not include any variable remuneration components, only a fixed amount. 399 Remuneration policy for members of the supervisory bodies The members of the Fiscal Board, like other Non-Executive Directors, only receive a fixed component. The Statutory Auditor is remunerated under the terms established in the contract, in accordance with the law. In view of the above, NOS considers that its remuneration model for the Executive Directors is properly structured, since: i) it defines a potential maximum total remuneration; ii) it rewards performance, through a remuneration which is adequate if the mechanisms of defense discourages excessive risk-taking, since fifty per cent of the variable components Profit Sharing and Share Allocation Plan are deferred in time, during three years; iv) it actively guarantees the adoption of policies that are sustainable over time, namely through the previous definition of business goals and because the effective payment of the deferred variable components depends on the achievement of objective conditions, associated with the economic soundness of the Company; v) it enables talent to be obtained and retained; and vi) it is in line with the comparable benchmarking. 70. Remuneration structure and alignment of interests The aforementioned compensation system also has to ensure that the interests of the Board of Directors members (in particular, Executive Directors, who may benefit from a variable component of remuneration) are in line with the long-terms business objectives. The success of this strategy lies in ensuring that the alignment is conducted through clear objectives that are consistent with the strategy, strict metrics to assess individual performance, along with appropriate performance incentives that simultaneously encourage ethical principles, while discouraging excessive risk-taking. Therefore, the creation of value needs not just excellent professionals, but also a framework of incentives that reflect both size and complexity of challenges. Each year the Remuneration Committee, in coordination with the AEC, defines the large variables to be assessed and their corresponding objective amounts. The variable component of the Executive Directors was calculated using the performance of NOS as measured by the previously defined business indicators. In 2018, have been considered the aggregates interest and taxes and before dividends, Financial Investments, Acquisition of Own Shares and Net Promoter Score. On the other hand, the goal of the component associated with the Share Allocation Plan, apart from complying with the already mentioned objectives for the Profit Sharing, is also to ensure the alignment with the creation of shareholder value and the strengthening of loyalty mechanisms. NOS has in operation a Share Allocation Plan, approved at the General Meeting on 23 April 2014 (named NOS Plan), applicable to collaborators that belongs to different organizational groups, including Executive Directors. It shall be highlighted, however, that, due to the deferral of the delivery of shares, during the course of 2018, s still possible, after the merger, to deliver these shares under these plans. 400 71. Variable component and performance The variable remuneration, using the components referred to above, seeks to consolidate a correct policy for setting objectives with systems that properly reward the ability to execute and to obtain results and to achieve ambitious performances, discouraging short-term policies and instead fostering the development of sustainable medium and long-term policies. The Share Allocation Plan defines the terms of the deffered shares vesting (deferral of 3 years), in compliance with the legal requirements in force regarding variable remuneration deferral. It should also be noted that despite the current Share Plans being deferred in time de facto (the NOS Plan and the Standard Plan) the Remuneration Committee limited, regarding the executive members, the which requires compliance with the following additional condition: The consolidated net situation in the year n+3, excluding any extraordinary movements occurred after the end of year n, and discounting an amount for each financial year correspondent to a pay-out of 40% on the net profit in the consolidated accounts of each year of the deferral period (irrespectively of the effective pay out), must be higher than the one calculated found at the end of financial year n. Extraordinary movements, in the period between year n and n+3, include capital increases, purchase or sale of own shares, extraordinary dividends, annual pay-out other than 40% of the consolidated profit of the respective business year or other profits. The net situation of year n+3, must be calculated based on the accounting rules used in financial year n, so that comparability is ensured. The distribution of shares, under the approved plans, being totally dependent on Group and individual performance, primarily aims to ensure the maximum creation of value in a medium and long-term perspective, thus encouraging sustainable policies in the long term. These plans are described in a more detailed way in item 86 of Chapter VI below. The objectives that are assessed generally correspond to profitability and growth variables that ensure the development and the sustainability of the Company and, as an indirect result, of national economy and its stakeholders as a whole. Maximum limits on variable remuneration The value of the variable components (including the Share Plans), when the allocation is decided by the Remuneration Committee, is limited to a maximum amount of 120% with regard to the fixed remuneration, in compliance with the best corporate governance practices in force on this subject. Guarantee of minimum variable remuneration There are no contracts with guaranteed minimums for the variable remuneration, regardless of the rent risk of the variable remuneration. 72. Deferral of variable remuneration Half of the variable compensation allocated was deferred for three years and its payment is dependent on a positive future performance. The definition of this condition for future access to the variable remuneration was already explained in the previous item 71. 401 73. Allocation of the variable component in shares The General Meeting approved on 23 April 2014 approved the Share Allocation Plan (NOS Plan). In this context, it shall be noted that there are no hedging or risk transfer contracts concerning a predefined amount of the total annual remuneration of the Executive Directors. Consequently, the risk underlying the corresponding variability of the remuneration is not mitigated. The vesting period for the shares of this Plan is three years, counted from the date of attribution, that is, their actual delivery, and the consequent availability, will only occur for the executive members, after three years of their attribution, upon verification of the conditions under which their delivery is subject, in particular, uponverification of positive performance as described in paragraph 71 above. 74. Allocation of the variable component in options No remunerations in options are implemented for Directors, that is to say that the Share Allocation Plan only allows the allocation of shares. 75. Annual bonuses and other non-cash benefits In 2018, no significant other non-cash benefits were given. 76. Supplementary pension or retirement schemes There are neither supplementary pensions nor early retirement schemes for Directors. 402 IV. Disclosure of remunerations 77.

VI. Share plans and stock options 85. Plans and targets The objectives of the Share Allocation Plan in force in NOS Group, mentioning all the details needed to be assessed (including the respective regulations) are: To ensure the loyalty of collaborators in the different companies of the Group; bjectives and the interests of NOS shareholders, rewarding their performance in relation to value creation for NOS shareholders, reflected in the value of its shares on the stock exchange. This Plan, which applies to collaborators that belongs to some organizational groups (including Executive Directors), is one of the pillars that makes NOS a benchmark company in personal and professional development matters and stimulates the development and mobilisation of employees around a common project. NOS Share Allocation Plan Regulation, which include all necessary elements for the correct evaluation of the Through the Share Allocation Plan a number of shares will be allocated, which is exclusively dependent on the compliance with the objectives established for NOS and on individual performance assessments. This compensation philosophy, through share programmes that help to align the collaborators, in particular Executive Directors, with the creation of shareholder value, is an important loyalty mechanism, apart from bolstering the performance culture of NOS Group, since their allocation depends on compliance with the corresponding objectives. To make NOS a benchmark in terms of international remuneration practices, adopting the best models of market-leader companies, is the main goal of these Plans, which have three main objectives: alignment with Following the deferral of the delivery of shares, will remain in force the plan prior to the merger called 405 86. Characterisation of plans NOS Plan A Share Allocation Plan which was approved at the General Meeting on 23 April 2014, for employees that belong to some organizational groups and are selected by the Executive Committee (or by the Remuneration Committee on proposal from the Chairman of the Board of Directors if the beneficiary is a member of NOS Executive Committee). The share vesting period of this Plan is three years from the date they are allocated, in other words, shares are actually delivered and made available to the executive members, only three years after they are allocated, if the conditions the delivery is subject to are satisfied, notably the positive performance under the terms referred to in item 71 above. 87. Share plans and stock options for employees and collaborators Conditions and Resolution on the number of shares to allocate to beneficiaries Under the NOS Plan, the Executive Committee shall select the beneficiaries of each Plan and decide on a case by case basis on the allocation of shares to the eligible collaborators. The Remuneration Committee has this responsibility for Executive Committee members. The allocation of shares to the respective beneficiaries depends entirely on performance criteria, of both the Group and the individual. The number of shares to be allocated is established using the amounts that are set with reference to the percentages of the remuneration earned by the beneficiaries, taking into account the assessment of NOS annual objectives as well as the assessment of individual performance. The specific number of shares to be given will be, therefore, the result of the division of the value provided by the average closing price, weighted by the respective volume, of Shares in the fifteen trading sessions prior to the reference date, except if the at its sole discretion other criteria that are deemed to be more appropriate. Shares can be delivered for no consideration or through a right to buy with a discount up to 90%. These shares, or the equivalent value in cash, are delivered after a deferral period of 3 years. However, should dividends be distributed or if the nominal value of the shares or share capital is changed during the deferral period, the initial number of shares under the Plan will be altered to reflect the effects of these changes, so that the plan is aligned with the total return achieved. On 31 December 2018, the plans that allow the delivery of shares are the following: NUMBER OF SHARES NOS PLAN Plan 2016 729 519 Plan 2017 836 519 Plan 2018 844 391 406 During the financial year ended on 31 December 2018, the movements under the Plans are detailed as follows: (1) It mainly includes corrections introduced by virtue of the dividend paid, shares related to plans exceptionally settled in cash and shares STANDARD NOS PLAN PLAN BALANCE AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2017: 60 378 2 235 860 MOVEMENTS IN THE PERIOD: Awarded 856 941 Vested (58 519) (544 709) Cancelled / elapsed / corrected (1) (1 859) (137 663) BALANCE AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2018: 2 410 429 related with termination of relationships with collaborators, not benefitting from the vesting of the shares. Share plan costs are recognised in the accounts over the period between the allocation and the vesting date of those shares. Total responsibility for the plans is calculated taking into consideration the share price at the allocation date for the plans settled in shares, or at the close date for the plans cash settled. As at 31 December 2018, liabilities for these plans are 6,495 thousand euros and are recorded under Reserves, in the amount of 5,225 thousand euros, for the plans settled in shares, and in Accruals of Costs, in the amount of 1,270 thousand euros, for the plans settled in cash. 88. Limits to the transfer of shares The rights to the shares allocated can only be disposed of after the respective vesting period, the length of which is of three years, according to the conditions described above.
