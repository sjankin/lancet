This is even more the case at times of upheaval, with the emergence of new risk categories and requirements. UBI Banca is one of Italy's leading retail banks. It is profoundly conscious of its responsibility as a decisive player in the country's economy, a responsibility that requires the ability both to listen and to communicate in the field in order to give direction to economic, as well as social, environmental and sustainable development issues. Given this role, UBI Banca plans to implement its vision of a Bank of unique quality: solid, reliable, efficient and accessible. A bank that makes people's lives simpler and supports the local economy, finding new ways to create value by meeting the needs of customers, local communities and investors, and improving relations with its employees and suppliers. It does this by prioritizing regulatory compliance and respect for people and the environment, helping to promote the universal principles of the Global Compact, of which UBI Banca is a signatory, and to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) announced by the UN's 2030 Agenda. Implementation of this vision depends on a sustainable growth strategy embodied by the principle of good banking, or “Fare banca per bene” (to bank fairly and well). In the first place, this means offering every customer excellent products, services and relations by combining simplicity, quality and innovation, knowing how to meet a healthy demand for credit, which creates growth, and managing customers' wealth responsibly. But “to bank fairly and well” also means contributing to the wellbeing of the community by supporting social and cultural initiatives and offering the best working conditions, and by cultivating people's talent, passions and commitment. In all these areas, UBI Banca has developed important initiatives and innovations with products and services offering significant social and environmental benefits. For example, the Bank was the first in Italy to provide money transfers using smartphones through the UBI Pay app, and it offers investment products such as UBI Comunità Social Bonds or Pramerica's social and environmental SICAV funds as well as social project finance. More in general, UBI Comunità and UBI Welfare help create shared value for local areas and communities. UBI Banca has received Top Employer certification for several years, thanks to its focus on people and the quality of its work policies, including equal gender opportunities. Attention to the environmental takes the form of a constant commitment to reducing CO2 the large-scale use of renewable energies is now well established and the consumption of natural resources for example by increasing the use of recycled paper. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report – Letter to Stakeholders – Page 1 Socially useful innovation in banking services requires a constant commitment. This is based on awareness of the Bank's significant social role and we are pleased to see this has been recognized at the highest institutional levels: UBI Welfare, as happened in 2013 for UBI Comunità Social Bond and in 2015 for UBI Pay, was awarded the 2018 National Innovation Award, the Premio dei Premi , given to UBI Banca by the President of the Senate. There is of course always room for improvement, especially in the role the Bank can play in helping to orient the choices of its customers and suppliers to accommodate important social and environmental issues. This may include the responsible management of new technologies, the fight against corruption and money laundering, the reduction in inequality and poverty and the fight against and adaptation to climate change. However, we are moving in the right direction. Sustainability is now an integral part of Group strategies, with an efficient system of principles, rules and processes, clear attribution of roles and responsibilities and mechanisms for involving stakeholders in identifying important sustainability issues (Corporate Governance). The risk management and internal controls framework is able to predict and manage the main risks in company activities. Specific sustainability goals are also included in the budget process and the Top management incentive programme. In this way and with this level of commitment, UBI Banca will continue to stand out in the market. Its solidity and resilience will enable it to continue to create sustainable value over time for all of its stakeholders.

Contractual conditions and terms of payment are constantly updated to comply with the legislation in force and with market conditions on the basis of periodical monitoring.

IT activities and other support functions are managed by UBI Sistemi e Servizi, while training and professional and managerial development is carried out by UBI Academy. IWBank Private Investments mainly operates through two channels: the network of financial advisors for asset management products and an Online Trading platform that gives retail customers direct access to financial markets with two platforms, one free-of-charge and the other paid for. Key changes during the year [GRI 102-10] The project to integrate the New Banks was completed during the first quarter of the year with the merger of Banca Teatina, leading to the creation of the Chieti District Headquarters within the Marches and Abruzzo Macro Geographical Area and further local units with responsibilities including the management of problem credit within their area. Substantial organisational changes at the Parent16 were designed to strengthen compliance, risk management and governance by:  assigning the role of Chief Compliance Officer to the Compliance Area Manager, in order to further increase the visibility and importance of Compliance, both within and outside the Group;  reallocating anti-money laundering safeguards from the Chief Risk Officer to report directly to the Chief Executive Officer and the Management Board in order to ensure and facilitate the complete independence of the assessments;  reallocating the Internal Validation unit to report directly to the Chief Risk Officer in order to strengthen the effectiveness and independence of the function;  reorganising the units reporting to the Chief Audit Executive in order to optimise the supervision of activities, with a focus on increased enforceability;  reinforcing the unit responsible for the Recovery and Resolution Plan, under the Chief Financial Officer, and the governance of conflicts of interest under the Chief General Counsel. The main actions taken in the commercial area concerned the following:  reviewing the approach to Customer segmentation, accelerating the programme of migration to direct channels and the redefinition of network roles, with a view to simplifying and strengthening commercial roles, introducing new roles and branch models in line with the new services models being offered;  reorganising the units within Corporate & Investment Banking, strengthening both their areas of specialisation and the organisational separation between product units and sales units (creating a unit within Global Markets Sales to co-ordinate services for the provision of sales, consultancy and the execution of transactions, establishing a staff unit for Support and Controls to manage projects, controls and updates to regulations);  reallocating complaints management and ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) 17 under the Chief Commercial Officer within the Customer Satisfaction unit, establishing a business unit to handle grievances and customer reports before a complaint is raised, in order to resolve problems as promptly as possible; 16 Reports and Financial Statements 2018, Consolidated Management Report Significant events in 2018. 17 With the exception of appeals to the Financial Banking Arbitrator (ABF) and Arbitrator for Financial Disputes (ACF).

IWBank, UBI Factor and Pramerica have also been affected by reorganisation of the business management units with the objective of making their commercial action even more effective. Lastly, the structure of the insurance company Bancassurance Popolari has been reviewed in line with the supervisory regulations concerning corporate governance and the internal control system. Commitments to sustainability [GRI 102-12:13] UBI Banca has governance mechanisms that comply with the requirements of the Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies, issued in 1999 by the committee for Corporate Governance formed by Borsa Italiana and updated in July 2015, 18, and maintains the commitment made in 2003 by the then BPU Banca, by endorsing the ten universal principles of the Global Compact in favour of human rights, the protection of labour and the environment and the fight against corruption. In the commercial context the Group complies with the European Code of Conduct on Home Loans signed by the European consumer and banking associations and with the principles of the the Code of Marketing Communication Self-Regulation of the “Istituto di Autodisciplina Pubblicitaria” (Italy's advertising standards authority), first issued in 1966. In 2014 it adhered voluntarily to the “Italian Responsible Payments Code” promoted by Assolombarda (Lombard employers association), making a commitment to comply with terms and conditions agreed for the payment of suppliers and more generally to spread a culture of efficient, punctual and rapid payment practices. To date, contracts with suppliers provide for a maximum deferral of payment of 90 days (0.07% of the total from date of invoice and 0.52% of the total at end of month from date of invoice). The average payment period in 2018 was 31 days.

In formulating sustainability priorities and objectives, particular account has been taken of the social and environmental risks that may be generated or sustained in various areas of the Group’s activities2, the associated opportunities and the impacts that the Group’s activities may have on society and the environment, with particular reference to achieving the UN 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Efficacy of internal control and risk management systems for the management of impacts generated or sustained by corporate activities, also from a social and environmental standpoint. Over the years, UBI Banca has constantly updated its organisational model and system of governance at Bank and Group level, in order to pursue its business mission and achieve its strategic objectives in line with market trends and the regulatory context. Since 2007, when it was formed as a joint stock co-operative company with a two-tier administration and control model as part of the merger between BPU Banca and Banca Lombarda e Piemontese and the relative banking Groups, UBI Banca has updated and simplified the structure of the Bank and the Group in stages, as follows:  transformation from a co-operative company into a joint stock company, approved by a resolution of the Shareholders’ Meeting on 10th October 2015 (filed with the Company Registrar of Bergamo on 12th October 2015), following the entry into force, on 26th March 2015, of Law No. 33 of 24th March 2015 (the conversion into law with amendments of Decree Law No. 3 of 24th January 2015 containing urgent measures for the banking system and investments), which, among other things, reformed the regulations for “popular” co-operative banks;  changeover from a federal Group model to the Single Bank (2016-2018), with the incorporation of the Network Banks into the Parent company, approved by the Meeting on 14th October 2016 as well as the incorporation of the three New Banks acquired in 2017;  simplification of the Group with the merger into the Parent of Centrobanca (6th May 2013) and Banca24-7 (23rd July 2012) and the merger between IWBank and UBI Banca Private Investments (2015);  focus on the core business and the reference market, through the disposal of the foreign subsidiaries Banque de Dépôts et de Gestion (2013) and UBI Banca International (2017). Finally, the Shareholders’ Meeting of 19th October 2018 resolved to adopt a one-tier system of management and control that will enter into force at the time of the renewal of the current Corporate bodies at the Shareholders’ Meeting to be held in April 2019. This corporate governance model is formalised in the organisation, management, and control model pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 on the corporate liability of legal persons, companies and associations even without a recognised legal personality (Model 231). In addition to representing grounds to exempt the Bank from liability in connection with the commission of certain types of crime and administrative offenses, this model also constitutes an act of social responsibility vis-à-vis the stakeholders because of the benefits that result in terms of the integrity and sustainability of operations. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Corporate governance – Page 21 For effective risk management, the Group has adopted Group regulations on integrated risk reporting, management and mitigation actions 1 and specific regulations governing particular types of risk, including a Reputational risk management policy, which requires socially responsible conduct, monitoring and responding to the economic, environmental, and social expectations of all stakeholders, with the objective of gaining competitive advantages and maximising returns in the long run. The management of other non-financial risks (sustainability risks) is governed as part of the UBI Banca Group Policy for the preparation and publication of the consolidated non-financial statement (NFS) for the UBI Banca Group in accordance with Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 and the relative implementing Regulation. Governance model [GRI 102-18:19 102-21:29 102-33 405-1] UBI Banca has adopted a two-tier governance system consisting of a Supervisory Board and a Management Board since 2007, the model that remained in force in 2018. The Supervisory Board performs the duties of strategic policy-making and supervision (including performance assessment) of the management of the Bank and is the highest governing body of UBI Banca. The activities of the Supervisory Board focus primarily on economic impacts, risks and opportunities and therefore the expertise required and performance assessments are mainly of an economic nature. In defining the new one-tier model in which Board of Directors will have authority, sustainability issues were a major consideration; there will be induction activities to develop collective awareness of the issue and the future Risk Committee will be given a policy making and monitoring role. For a detailed discussion of UBI Banca’s system of governance, see the report on this matter in the 2018 Reports and Financial Statements2. This report covers the structure; composition (more specifically in connection with gender diversity, qualifications, and expertise of the members); powers of the governing bodies; the processes and criteria for appointing the governing bodies and relative internal committees; processes for managing conflicts of interest and delegating authority; and mechanisms for developing expertise and performance assessment. The governance system is based on a constantly updated organizational structure with the aims of structural simplification and operational efficacy and efficiency 3. Remuneration and incentives [GRI 102-35:39] The remuneration and incentives policies are designed to direct decision-making and individual behaviors consistently with the pursuit of the mission of the Group and its strategic objectives with a view to sustainable performance over the long term. For information on the characteristics of the remuneration and incentives policies and the procedures for their implementation, with reference to the adoption of sustainability objectives and indicators, see the Remuneration Report4. 1 The regulations are designed to support the process of identification, measurement and monitoring on company risks, behavioural shortcomings and damaging events. 2 Reports and Financial Statements 2018, Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership structure of UBI Banca S.p.A in accordance with art. 123-bis of the Consolidated Finance Law. 3 Reports and Financial Statements 2018, Management Report – The organisational structure of UBI Banca. 4 Reports and Financial Statements 2018, Remuneration Report – 2019 Shareholders’ Meeting.

The Code of Ethics identifies the categories of major stakeholders: customers, staff, investors, suppliers, communities (with particular reference to local communities), public authorities, operators on the financial market, the media and opinion leaders and organisations representing stakeholders' interests. A report on the main issues that emerged from the processes of dialogue with stakeholders is given in the Consolidated Management Report 5. Ethical, social, and environmental aspects of management are co-ordinated by the Group's CSR Manager, responsible for UBI Banca's Corporate Social Responsibility Function, who reports to the Chief Financial Officer, who in his turn reports to the Chief Executive Officer. Specific responsibilities relating to sustainability issues have been deleted to the Mobility Manager6, Health and Safety Manager7 and Energy Manager8. Shareholders The Annual General Meeting is the main opportunity for engagement with shareholders whose comments on the financial statements and other issues on the agenda show which issues are important to them. In connection with significant events in the life of the Bank and with a view to any resolutions that may be submitted to a Shareholder’s Meeting in relation to them, Senior management inform and listen to the shareholders at public meetings in the field. Financial market operators The Group Investor Relations unit engages in investor relations activities with operators on the financial market (analysts and institutional investors), on an intensified basis in connection with important dates on the financial calendar or significant events such as issuances of debt securities. Most of the operators are interested in the strictly operating, financial and governance issues that are described in the Separate and Consolidated financial statements. 2018 2017 1 F IN AN CIAL CO MMUN ICATIO N No. of e v e nts No. of conta cts No. of e v e nts No. of conta cts 2 Conference calls/presentations 4 572 6 822 International conferences 13 225 7 219 Road show 15 84 17 182 Individual and group meetings 3 33 182 46 166 TO TAL 4 65 1 ,0 6 3 76 1 ,3 8 9 1 Events organised with investors and analysts of the share or with investors in debt instruments.

The media Relations with the media are handled only by the Media and Institutional Events Service and are designed to provide relevant and reliable information on the structure, activity, and financial position of the Bank, its policies and strategies, including social and environmental policies, and the impacts of action taken. UBI Banca’s communications strategy is targeted at print, radio, television and online media, generalist and specialist, with a local, national or international readership or audience, depending on themes and the intended audience. Relations are conducted according to the principles of integrity, transparency, independence and equal treatment for each newspaper and journalist. Notable new developments in 2018 were the integration of the Media Relations team into the Macro Geographical Areas, which has made the relationship with local newspapers and magazines more incisive, and the integration of Media Relations and Institutional Events activities, which has made it possible to develop synergies and increase the number of events held in the field, raising UBI’s media profile. 1 2018 2017 REL ATIO N W ITH THE PRESS Press articles 79 95 of which: financial 50 60 informational 13 11 social / local initiatives 5 19 on products and services 11 5 Meetings 45 40 1 Data not include the information notes disseminated at local level to the press in occasions of territorial relevance.

The significant topics are identified using a structured approach, governed by the Regulations for drawing up the consolidated non-financial statement, which provide for the involvement of Senior management and stakeholders (materiality analysis). With a view to the increasing involvement of stakeholders, the materiality analysis performed in 2018 using a questionnaire created for this purpose involved:  the Top management of UBI Banca and the Senior management of the main Group companies;  a sample of 4 thousand customers chosen at random on a statistical basis, using telephone interviews;  a sample of 1,700 employees (1,300 from the commercial network and 400 managers of central units and product companies) using an online survey;  over 100 Senior officers of institutions and social organisations at three meetings in the areas of Milan, Florence and Jesi (Ancona), organised co-operation with UBI Comunità and the local Macro Geographical Areas, with the support of AICCON11. The results of the survey, shown in the materiality matrix12, were examined and consolidated in an induction session with members of the Corporate bodies and the Top management of UBI Banca. At this session, the customers and employees were asked further questions to show, by creating a summary indicator, the valuation of the Group’s level of sustainability, also with reference to the social and environmental aspects of management and the initiative undertaken in relation to them. A sample of 1,300 customers of the competitor banks were asked the same questions, in order to obtain a comparison. The summary indicator of sustainability is among the indicators chosen for inclusion in the 2019 incentives scheme. On a scale from 0 to 100, the summary indicator of sustainability found is at 57 for UBI Banca customers, against 50 for the customers of other banks and 62 for employees. 9 Reports and Financial Statements 2018, Consolidated Management Report Commercial activity Customer satisfaction and Management of claims and complaints. 10 See also the Dialogue with Trade Unions paragraph, page 68 and Enhancement and wellbeing of personnel paragraph, page 50. 11 AICCON – Italian Association for the promotion of a co-operation and not for profit culture – a think tank created by the University of Bologna, the Alliance of Italian Co-operatives and numerous public and private sector organisations operating within the sphere of the social economy.

Values, principles, standard and norms of [GRI 102-16:17] behavior Compliance with the rules is the first pillar of the healthy and prudent management that has always characterized UBI on the market, and underpins the trust placed in UBI by its customers and stakeholders. It is the first step in the goal Fare banca per bene (to bank fairly and well) as a means for establishing a distinctive market identity through compliance with external regulations and with the values and principles and code of conduct independently developed by the company in its internal regulations. The responsibility to manage and spread a culture of regulatory compliance as a principle of integrity in corporate conduct is governed by the UBI Group's non-compliance risk management Policies1 incumbent on the organizational units responsible for the Audit (the Chief Audit Executive, a staff unit of the Supervisory Board) and Compliance (the Chief Compliance Officer, a staff unit of the Management Board) functions. The Code of Ethics, the Code of Conduct for Employees of the Group and the Management, Organisation and Control Model pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 (known as the 231 Model) constitute the main references on compliance with the regulatory texts, in terms of the risk of commission of crimes (including corruption, money-laundering and usury) or of engagement in activities that are illegal or inconsistent with the principles of ethics. The general principles are reflected in the specialized legislation governing different areas in the form of Policies, Regulations and Rule Books. The Group CSR Manager provides support and advice for training and communication activities and for the interpretation and implementation of the principles of the Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics includes a system for reporting and managing non-compliance, which is coordinated with the other channels for reporting unethical or unlawful conduct set out in Model 231/2001 and the Whistleblowing Policy. The Chief Audit Executive (in charge of the Internal Audit function) is responsible for receiving reports of alleged breaches of the Code of Ethics in writing (including to the dedicated email address codice.etico@ubibanca.it) and for carrying out the necessary investigations. While reports cannot be kept anonymous, they are 1 The non-compliance risk management Policies set out the basic principles and guidelines to safeguard against the risk of judicial or administrative penalties, significant financial losses or reputational losses as a result of breaching mandatory governance norms, and outlines the compliance organizational model. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Integrity in corporate conduct Page 28 kept strictly confidential and those making reports are protected against any form of retaliation, discrimination or penalty. The Internal Audit function records the reports received, carries out an initial assessment to determine their relevance and sends them to Management and Control bodies and the 231/01 Supervisory Body, should the alleged breach be deemed significant under the provisions of Legislative Decree 231/01, or to the organizational unit that manages relations with the stakeholder that has committed the alleged breach, or the body to which the former belongs, in other cases. As part of its reporting to the Governing bodies, the Internal Audit function prepares a quarterly report indicating the number of investigations carried out and the type of measures adopted. It also prepares an annual report on the proper operation of internal whistleblowing systems with aggregate information on the results of actions taken on whistleblowing reports received. The Code of Ethics is formally adopted by all the subsidiaries and brought to the attention of other companies in which an interest is held to encourage them to apply its principles to their conduct. It is available to staff on the company intranet and in hard copy for companies without access to the portal. It is given to the members of Corporate bodies and newly hired staff on signature of their contracts. It is published on the Group's website and given to everyone that enters into business contracts with the Bank or that represent the Bank, even when not employed by the latter. Suppliers are required to sign a declaration of acceptance as part of the relevant contractual arrangements. All business and organisational units are subject to the checks involved in implementing Model 231/2001. The 231/01 Supervisory Body regularly reports to the Corporate bodies on the adoption and effective implementation and updating of the aforementioned Model. Compliance [GRI 307-1 417-2:3 419-1] For reports on the findings and penalties to which UBI Banca and other companies in the Group have been subjected for noncompliance with the laws and regulatory texts, see the relevant paragraph of the Consolidated management report2. No reports emerged during 2018 of non-compliance affecting communication processes, the provision of investment services and Information Technology, which were arried out in accordance with the Group's internal regulations. Furthermore, no cases or circumstances were recorded involving violations of the regulations and/or codes of conduct adopted in the area of transparency for products and services and proper customer relations. Finally, no fines or penalties were received for non-compliance with environmental standards. In addition, no reports were received during the year of breaches to the Code of Ethics nor were any breaches of said code found when investigating reports received in 2017 and via the Whistleblowing channel.

The Anti-Money Laundering & Investigations Area, a staff unit of the Managing Director, is in charge of anti-money laundering activities. Transactions are monitored according to the amount limits set by the relevant Legislation by means of dedicated software applications which support the identification of evidence potentially connected with money laundering or other illegal activities, including corruption. Situations intercepted are then submitted for assessment by the organisational units responsible for the administration and everyday management of the customer relationship and then by the centralised control body. Staff training is crucial for the proper and effective implementation of regulations. The following activities were carried out during 2018:  1,441 hours of anti-corruption training, with classroom and virtual sessions organised by Group Compliance, aimed at 659 participants with roles of responsibility;  4,541 hours of online training for almost 3,700 participants on the principles of Model 231 and anti-corruption measures in UBI's policies and procedures, such as: loan granting, HR selection and management, management of conflicts of interest, active and passive cycle, customer complaints and reimbursements, sponsorships and gifts;  More than 13,300 hours of anti-money laundering training, both in class and by means of the e-learning platform, for approximately 6,000 participants. Training was provided for Network Staff, Central Management and customer-facing Group Company Staff.

Again, during 2018, there were no cases of corruption involving Group personnel. An attempt at corruption between private individuals was immediately and promptly reported by a UBI Sistemi e Servizi manager, and criminal proceedings were initiated against the person that made the attempt. Anti-competitive behavior [GRI 206-1] UBI has not received penalties for anti-competitive behavior. For full information, we report that as at 31st December 2018 a case involving anti-competitive behavior brought by another financial intermediary is pending before the Court of Milan for IWBank Private Investments. Said intermediary claims it has suffered damages worth approximately €409 thousand for alleged poaching of staff and financial advisors, who took customers with them. The case is still under investigation. Human rights [GRI 408-1 409-1 412-1:3 FS1:2 FS6] Given the location and type of business carried on, the scope within which there could be the risk of a breach of human rights is limited to the risks inherent in the business of Customers operating in certain industries (controversial industries, in particular, the weapons industry) and to the risks relating to the supply of diamonds and gold. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Integrity in corporate conduct Page 31 Therefore, operations including clauses or subject to human rights assessment only include those relating to international weapons trading operations and to the supply of diamonds and gold, which account for just over zero percent of the total operations carried out by the Group. There were no other contracts or investments which are subject to or include clauses that are subject to human rights assessment. Business with “controversial” economic sectors Where these sectors are concerned, considering the extremely marginal volume of activity, the Group has no specific Policies, except for the weapons and defence industry, for which the Group adopted a specific policy in 2008 3 (latest update in 2018) and in the area of gambling and gaming, for which it adopted an Internal Credit Area Directive in 2011. 2 1 2018 2017 CO N TRO VERSIAL SECTO RS (millions of euro) Weapons 134.5 0.25% 145.3 0.26% Tobacco 73.9 0.14% 87.1 0.16% Alcohol 50.7 0.09% 46.5 0.09% Furs 7.1 0.01% 8.2 0.02% Gambling 10.7 0.02% 12.6 0.02% Nuclear 0.0 0.00% 0.0 0.00% TO TAL 2 7 6 .9 0 .5 1 % 2 9 9 .7 0 .5 5 % 1 Loans at 30.11.

For data published in the 2017 Consolidated non financial declaration see the document published on the Group's website at http://www.ubibanca.it/pagine/Bilancio-Sostenibilita-IT.aspx. The main objective of the Group's Policy on weapons is to avoid the Group's involvement in operations potentially contributing to human rights violations and it therefore prohibits relations with enterprises involved in weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, biological and chemical) and other controversial weapons (mines, incendiary and laser weapons, fragmentation and depleted uranium weapons) and imposes restrictions and a rigorous authorisation process on the provision of banking and financial services for international weapons trading operations, depending on the types of weapons and the countries involved. In 2018, 298 banking transactions involving the export of weapons and armaments were carried out by leading industrial customers, of which:  240 for €22.8 million relating to armaments according to the terms of Law No. 185/1990, or military-grade weapons (88.8% to EU/NATO/OECD countries);  58 for €1.6 million relating to weapons for civilian use, classified as light weapons (all to EU/NATO/OECD countries). As in past years, all transactions were carried out in compliance with this Policy, and no waivers were granted4. In compliance with the commitment to transparency provided by the Policy, a more detailed report on the operations in question is published in the Social Responsibility Section of the Group’s corporate website concurrently with publication of the Government's report to Parliament pursuant to Law No. 185/1990 5. 3 http://www.ubibanca.it/pagine/Politiche-CSR-IT.aspx. 4 In 2018 Ubi Banca carried out 3 operations for 4.3 million euro, relating to weapons exports to two countries not admitted by the Group’s Policy on weapons (Kenya and Turkmenistan), as channeled by Nuova Banca Etruria customers before its entry into the UBI Group. 5 http://www.ubibanca.it/pagine/Politiche-CSR-IT.aspx.

In 2018 the amounts relating to the issue and the renewal of guarantees were excluded from the total; they are accounted at the time of the monetary settlement transaction regulatory of underlying transaction. For data in the 2017 Consolidated non financial declaration see the document published on the Groups' website at http://www.ubibanca.it/pagine/Bilancio-Sostenibilita-IT.aspx. 2 Weapons which, because of their specifications or technical and construction or design characteristics, are to be considered as having been constructed mainly for military use or for Armed Forces or Police (art. 2 Law No. 185/1990). 3 th Ordinary firearms pursuant to art. 2 Law No. 110 of 18 April 1975 and short firearms provided they are not automatic (art. 1 paragraph 11, Law No. 185/1990), commonly known as “light weapons , unless these are destined to the Armed Forces or the Police. In this case they are considered as weapons for military use. The Internal Gambling and Gaming Directive6 requires operations in this sector to be extremely marginal and highly stringent procedures to be used in the assessment of financing applications. Parties operating in this sector must not only meet appropriate credit rating criteria, but must also be already known to and approved of by the Bank and satisfy criteria of absolute integrity, seriousness and reliability. Anomalous conduct by customers is highlighted in a specific regulation, in order to identify situations involving risks relating to the lawfulness of the activities. The Supply of Diamonds The Group continued to sell diamonds until March 2018. As in the case of the weapons industry, it was important to consider potential involvement in activities that put human rights at risk. Checks were therefore carried out to confirm that all the diamonds, from the company Diamond Love Bond7, have guarantees of lawful origin and are certified conflict free (i.e. not from war zones or from operations to finance armed groups and conflicts) and child labour free (i.e. not originating from mining and processing activities involving child labour): Diamond Love Bond adopts strict ethical principles (it supports the principles of the Global Compact, also signed by UBI Banca); it complies with the rules of conduct for Diamond Companies and best practices recommended by the World Diamond Council System of Warranties and by the Diamond Trading Company; it complies with the Kimberley Protocol, originating from a resolution passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations of 1st December 2000, designed to break the link between illegal diamond transactions and armed conflicts. The Group to which Diamond Love Bond belongs is also the only representative of the diamond and jewellery industry that takes part in the UN Global Lead, the biggest sustainability initiative involving another 42 Corporations. In the first quarter of 2018, UBI Banca sold 54 diamonds for a sum of €470 thousand. Sales were suspended in April following proceedings 6 In Italy the law permits state-authorised license holders to offer gambling and gaming services. In this way the state can closely monitor a highly profitable area at extreme risk of unlawful conduct. 7 Diamond Love Bond is a Diamond Company authorised by the Belgian Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Energy and is based in Antwerp. It has an international network of offices and is present on all the diamond exchanges worldwide. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Integrity in corporate conduct Page 33 initiated in March 2018 by the AGCM (Competition and Markets Authority) to investigate a possible breach of the Consumer Code in the offering of diamonds via banks. At the end of September 2018 AGCM closed the proceedings without having found any unlawful conduct or breach of the Consumer Code by UBI Banca and without levying any penalties, accepting the commitment to make improvements proposed by the Bank, including, among other things, pre-contractual information informing customers that the Bank merely acts as an intermediary in the sale of diamonds, about the price of diamonds including all costs (among these commission due to the Bank for its role as intermediary), the risks inherent in buying diamonds, the absence of a repurchase obligation and how to exercise the right to withdraw. UBI Banca has adopted responsible diamond sales criteria (only offering diamonds to customers with assets of more than €100,000 at the time of the transaction and for whom the total value of the purchase is no more than 5% of their assets as at the date of the transaction) and reinforced monitoring of its intermediation business, with a specific procedure on several levels to check the effective and precise compliance with internal operating procedure customer disclosure requirements. In December 2018 mandatory training on ethical products for the approximately 2,000 salespeople began using e-learning. The training specifically focused on regulations governing improper commercial practices and there was a final test to authorise participants to use the sales platform. A new Group regulation setting out all the mandatory information to be given to consumers prior to purchases being made and supplementing the operating procedure is due to be rolled out in the first quarter of 2019. Sales will resume in 2019 once the regulatory, procedural and training actions identified have been carried out, confirming the absence of any sales goals. The Supply of Gold With the acquisition and incorporation of Nuova Banca Etruria in 2017, UBI Banca also acquired the gold business, which was extended to the Bank's entire sale network at the end of September 2018. In the past year the Bank has updated all of its internal regulations governing the sale of gold (Policy, Regulation and Rule Book). The Policy for the Responsible Supply of Physical Gold8 in particular recognises the fundamental role of foundries/refineries, which transform any material containing gold into saleable form, whether it is waste material or from mining, and underlines the strong international commitment for foundries/refineries to carry out appropriate due diligence about the source of the gold. UBI Banca only buys and sells gold ingots produced by refineries with internationally certified supplier due diligence practices and which are almost all included on the internationally recognised market standard, the London Good Delivery9 list. In 2018 a total of 860 sales and purchases and repayments of gold loans were carried out. As required, due diligence was carried out to check compliance with the supply policy. Since operations were extended to the Bank's entire sales network, a total of 2,356 hours of classroom training have been provided to all the sales personnel involved and a distance learning (e-learning) course has been provided as backup. Training also covered the issue of social responsibility, illustrating the Policy for the Responsible Supply of Physical Gold adopted by UBI Banca and the business processes implementing it. 8 The Policy sets out the internal guidelines for the responsible supply of gold, with specific reference to the risk of human rights breaches and the financing of armed groups in the supply chain. Its content is based on the “Model Supply Chain Policy for a Responsible Global Supply Chain of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High Risk Areas” in the “OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chain”. http://www.ubibanca.it/pagine/Politiche-CSR-IT.aspx. 9 List managed by the London Bullion Market Association, which has a Gold Guidance Manager.

Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Integrity in corporate conduct Page 34 Creation of value Key Aspects The creation of value1 is crucial for ensuring the remuneration of shareholders and personnel and for maintaining and increasing the assets needed to support its lending business. The creation of value benefits all stakeholders, directly or through the indirect impact of the Group's grassroots activities and in the communities involved. Units of the Group contribute to the creation of economic value, which benefits all of the stakeholders, by implementing the Business Plan and the Transformation Plan. Progresses are systematically monitored by the UBI Banca Steering Committee at dedicated sessions, in order to promptly adopt any necessary corrective measures. During 2018, implementation of the Business Plan included completion of the Unica Bank2 project, continued rationalisation of the distribution network and the work force 3 through improved efficiency and cost containment and projects introducing innovation in processes, products and services4 to make the Group more competitive on the market in terms of quality and convenience. Economic value generated and distributed [GRI 201-1 201-3:4 202-1 204-1] The reclassification of the Consolidated income statement highlights the economic value generated by the Group, which is reflected essentially in the prices customers pay for the products and services it provides, net of any losses and impairment losses on loans. In keeping with UBI Banca's commercial banking focus, the share of financial assets is in fact limited. As concerns the issue of climate change, which has become key to measuring the sustainability of human activities, whether social or productive, the Group has no direct exposure, and consequently there is no significant impact on value creation. Minor impacts may occur in relation to supply processes, especially with regard to fuel and electricity costs, and to commercial and lending processes, in the event of extreme weather events affecting the operational capacity of corporate clients (a risk which is, however, mitigated by the high sector diversification of the Group’s lending). Business opportunities are linked to promoting private and corporate investments in energy saving and the use of alternative energies and to supporting corporate investments in complying with changing regulatory requirements and improving the efficiency of products and production processes. 1 In the context of the Consolidated non-financial statement, value creation is measured by calculating the economic value created and distributed to the stakeholders, using the method for reclassifying the consolidated income statement ABI has proposed for banks. 2 Reports and Financial Statements 2018, Consolidated Management Report Significant events in 2018. 3 Reports and Financial Statements 2018, Consolidated Management Report Significant events in 2018. 4 Reports and Financial Statements 2018, Consolidated Management Report Commercial activity and Research, Development and Innovation.

Employees Economic value distributed to employees also includes coverage for commitments resulting from internal funds, consisting of defined benefits and having the nature of items on companies’ balance sheets. In this connection, contributions are allocated to the “Provision for risks and charges: Pension and similar obligations”, which are subject to periodic actuarial measurement in compliance with IAS 19 “Employee benefits”. It also reflects payments made to external pension funds in the framework of defined contribution plans from which all of the Group's employees benefit. Remuneration, which is the main component of the economic value distributed to employees, consistently exceeds the minimum provided by the Trade Unions. 1 AVERAGE SAL ARY F IRST JO B CO MPARED W ITH TRADE UN IO N MIN IMUM 2018 2017 (%) Men 114.2% 112.8% Women 114.8% 111.3% 1 Basic salary provided by the National Collective Labor Agreement as a level of remuneration for professional insertion (art. 46). Shareholders Share capital is composed of ordinary shares, each of which has equal dividend rights. As a result of its capital strength, UBI Banca has consistently been able to pay a dividend to the shareholders, even during the most difficult years. In addition to shareholder dividends, economic value distributed to shareholders includes the Group's profits attributable to minority shareholders included in the consolidation. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report – Creation of value – Page 37 Suppliers The economic value distributed to suppliers comprises revenues from purchases of goods and services, almost entirely from suppliers resident in Italy. Where possible and appropriate, depending on the type of products or services, use is made of suppliers who operate in the vicinity of our individual operating premises. Public administration UBI Banca has never received any form of public funding, and in fact, in addition to paying tax, contributes to regulatory instruments for the resolution of banking crises and safeguarding customer deposits5. The Bank has carried out operations with Central Banks as part of subsidized funding programmes (such as TLTRO) for financial stability purposes or to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy, and has used resources from the system Funds, to which it contributes, to carry out voluntary redundancy programmes 6 and employee training programmes7. Community and the environment The share of economic value relating to the community and the environment consists of costs incurred during the year for social purposes (independently of the actual payments made during the same year) and profits allocated to the reserve available to the governing bodies (Board Fund) for projects and institutions with a charitable, humanitarian, social, cultural or artistic purpose in accordance with article 44 of the articles of association. The Group has devoted substantial, consistent expenditure and investments to reduce its environmental impacts, that are not accounted for in the distribution of the economic value created.

Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report – Creation of value – Page 38 Customer relation Key Aspects Developing mutually satisfactory customer relation and loyalty means being able to offer excellent products and services that meet requirements and are delivered with transparent information, as well as respecting individuals, their interests, security and privacy. Digital and product innovation is an essential component of the quality of the offer, based on changing customer needs, preferences and behavior. Digital transformation has established a service model centred on a variety of digital channels and increasingly tied to technologies that increase internet data flow and the associated security problems. Changes in customer behavior and expectations are increasingly influenced by the ethics and values of the relationship, as well as by the quality and costs of the product and services offered. Acquiring and retaining customers better than one's competitors therefore requires a competitive strategy capable of building and strengthening loyalty ties whenever possible and whatever the means of contact, in order to meet customers' expectations with regard to transparency, reliability and proper conduct. It is also the opinion of the Bank of Italy that the quality of relationships between the bank and its customers is a key strategic factor for the competitiveness and soundness of intermediaries and that good rules, effective self-regulation and correct behaviour are the cornerstones of customer protection. In UBI Banca respect for customers is safeguarded in terms of security (business continuity, reliability of information and data protection systems, physical security in branches), the transparency of products and services (clear and comprehensive information), responsible marketing (alignment of sales proposals with customer needs and profiles, accuracy of advertising messages and sales contacts), respect for privacy and, more in general, regulatory compliance, including corporate governance codes. In the Italian context, all these aspects are governed by specific legislation and regulations for the sector, that the Group incorporates into its internal regulations (Policies, Regulations and Rule Books) which are distributed to all employees on the corporate internet and covered by specific refresher courses. In particular, the Group has adopted an internal Policy for managing Inducements1, Risk Appetite Framework Policy for the trading, sale and subscription of financial products, a Policy for managing proposals to make unilateral changes to the terms and conditions for customers 2, the Group product development and management Policy3, Guidelines on Commercial Practices Aimed at 1 The Policy incorporated criteria to implement the obligation to act in the best interests of the customer and ensure that commercial information is correct and transparent. 2 The Policy contains the strategic guidelines and general principles that the Group intends to adopt for exercising the right to unilaterally change the conditions of contracts (termed “ius variandi”). The main provisions for the implementation of this Policy are included in the Regulation implementing Bank of Italy provisions on the transparency of banking and financial operations and services. 3 The Policy establishes guidelines for the development and distribution of new products and the maintenance over time of catalogue products in order to interpret the needs and characteristics of intended customers accurately and to achieve quality, technology innovation, competitiveness and regulatory compliance consistent with the mission, strategy, business objectives and overall corporate architecture of the Group. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report – Customer relation – Page 39 Consumers4 and a Regulation implementing Bank of Italy provisions on the transparency of banking and financial operations and services 5, the Privacy Regulation, the security Policy, logical security Regulations and specific Rule Books. Compliance with these regulations is based on the following organisational and technical controls: Organisational controls managed by the Chief Commercial Officer and Chief Wealth and Welfare Officer for management and level-1 controls, the Chief Risk Officer and Chief Compliance Officer for level-2 controls and the Chief Audit Executive for level-3 controls. Technical controls consist of dedicated support platforms for commercial activities (e.g. identification of customers to which determined products and services should be offered on the basis of an analysis of their life cycle and behavioural profile and therefore of their possible unmet financial needs) and of protection tools on IT systems. The Customer Satisfaction & Claims department enables UBI Banca to continuously monitor customer satisfaction through customer satisfaction surveys and complaints6 management, so that Group business can be guided by the quality of the customer experience 7. Transparency [GRI 417-1] The Bank of Italy provisions on the transparency of banking and financial operations and services set minimum and general standards for the preparation of the documentation used to provide customers with information (structure of the documents, essential information, choice of terminology, standardisation of some common types of contract) and they also introduce obligations for banking and financial intermediaries as well as for the marketing of traditional banking services of an organisational or control nature for compliance with regulations governing transparency and integrity in relations with customers. In general the transparency rules complement those required by other areas of regulation concerning transparency and proper conduct towards customers including, for example, those relating to investment services, regulated by the Consolidated Finance Law, insurance products or the provisions of the Consumer Code. In 2018, 2,760 complaints were received in relation to communications and information sent to customers, out of an overall total of more than 18 thousand. The increase from 529 complaints in 2017 is due to expansion of the Group perimeter. Responsible sales [GRI FS15] On the necessary assumption that the banking sector (including the producers and distributors of banking products and services) “must take the needs of its customers into consideration when developing a product”, the principal relevant Authorities have issued specific guidelines to strengthen measures for the prevention of inappropriate commercial conduct and operational errors that could cause serious damage to customers, with consequent negative repercussions on the relationship of trust between the customer and the bank and potential damage to market integrity. These provisions regulate the definition and implementation of suitability requirements for all banking products offered in relation to 4 The guidelines are intended to set out behavior relating to commercial practices more clearly, in compliance with the provisions of the Code of Conduct, providing useful information about operating in compliance with the provisions of Title III of the Consumer Code. 5 The Regulation implements Bank of Italy provisions which assume business relationships based on good faith and integrity and are intended to improve the effectiveness of transparency tools, regulate the behavior of intermediaries in order to promote more considered customer choices in line with their financial requirements and make it easier to compare offers and promote competition in the market. 6 Reports and Financial Statements 2018, Consolidated Management Report – Commercial activity, Complaint Management. 7 Reports and Financial Statements 2018, Consolidated Management Report – Commercial activity, Customer Satisfaction. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report – Customer relation – Page 40 specific characteristics of the customer to whom the product is offered and require the suitability requirements to be maintained throughout the life cycle of the product and/or the relationship with the customer. In this context, the principle of suitability is defined, although with differing areas of application, for both the producers and distributors. Since 3rd January 2018, with the entry into force of the MiFID II, such provisions also apply to the provision and management of investment services and products and, since 1 st October 2018, with the entry into force of the Insurance Distribution Directive, the principles of tailoring offers to customer characteristics also apply to the provision and management of investment and insurance services and products. Following the European Banking Authority Guidelines on governance and control devices for retail banking products, the Bank of Italy issued a measure on 5th December 2018 amending and supplementing the regulations on the “Transparency of operations and banking and financial services Proper conduct in relations between intermediaries and customers”, containing specific requirements in the policies and procedures that intermediaries are required to adopt to develop, distribute, monitor and revise products and services. This is being implemented by introducing process changes aligning the products and services offered with the interests, aims, characteristics and level of ability and financial literacy of the target market. UBI Banca has put in place a process for the products distributed by other Group companies, to add to processes specifically adopted by the companies. The processes involve various specialist functions within the Group in assessing the compliance and transparency of pre-contractual, contractual and regular reporting information, as well as operational aspects such as technological, financial and human resources to allocate to the development of new products and services and the updating of existing products and services. The characteristics and needs of customers are surveyed through special consultation and interview procedures (e.g. focus groups with customers, potential customers and commercial distribution network staff) and systematic procedures (e.g. the Consultation Project customer satisfaction survey or complaints management) and through the analysis of competitors’ products and services (benchmarking). Particular attention is paid to the placement of complex financial products. In compliance with the recommendations of the Supervisory Authority, UBI Banca does not place products on the CONSOB “Black List” (Communication No. 0097996/14) on the primary market, because it considers that these are not appropriate to retail customers. According to CONSOB recommendations, these are products which could only be advised for retail distribution by adopting special precautions and following an assessment of whether they are in the interests of customers and on whether sufficient information is available to assess their characteristics and the principal risks. Measures have also been taken in relation to the IWBank online trading platforms, to prevent customers from dealing in complex products that are in the “Black List”. General Data Protection [GRI 418-1] The new GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), applicable in all EU countries since 25 th May 2018, promotes the move from the formal approach of EU Directive 95/46 (the original data protection directive) to a substantial approach to protect consumer Privacy. In fact the Regulation focuses strongly on making data controllers responsible for adopting proactive conduct that can prove the practical adoption of measures to protect personal data and their free circulation. UBI Banca has chosen to consider the GDPR and national personal data protection law not as a series of constraints with which to comply or risk heavy fines, but as an important challenge to embrace in order to continue monitoring and strengthening the Bank's ability to ensure the protection of its stakeholders' rights and fundamental freedoms, while guaranteeing the free circulation of data, which is crucial for economic and social growth. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report – Customer relation – Page 41 In line with the GDPR and taking into account the type, scope, context and aims of data processing, as well as the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, UBI Banca adopts technical and organisational measures to guarantee the maximum level of protection and, given developments in technology, continuously revises its security measures. Security checks are also extended to suppliers appointed as data processors. Data protection also involves constant fraud monitoring, in order to prevent fraud and provide information to users (personnel, customers and suppliers) about the most appropriate antifraud measures and tools for using the internet and mobile banking services safely. The IT Security & Business Continuity department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi constantly adopts appropriate personal data protection measures for the entire Group and all its stakeholders, in accordance with the provisions of Legislative Decree No. 196 of 30th June 2003 (“Privacy Code”), security regulations and the best industry standards, ensuring the protection of its information systems from cyber attacks, IT incidents, personal data breaches and fraud, which could harm the rights of data subjects. In the event of a data breach, every Group company, in its capacity as data controller, shall make the notifications required under articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR in the time and manner indicated in the Regulation. A business continuity plan involves a series of technical and organisational controls and a series of regular monitoring and tests on Disaster Recovery, in order to guarantee critical processes and protect against data loss including in an emergency. As concerns the acquisition and processing of personal data for commercial purposes, the fundamental rights and freedoms and the dignity of those concerned are always guaranteed in compliance with Legislative Decree No. 196 of 30th June 2003 (Privacy Code) on the protection of personal data. The Data Protection Officer is responsible for personal data protection, and heads the unit set up under the Chief Commercial Officer. The Data Protection Officer reports annually to the governing body on the adequacy of the security measures adopted and, therefore, on the Bank's compliance with the legal requirements for personal data protection. In addition, where necessary, the Data Protection Officer submits a report to the governing body on the critical areas in personal data protection and notifies the Regulatory Authority of any personal data breaches. In 2018, 7 privacy-related complaints were received (compared with 47 in 2017), the majority of which related to cases of mandatory notifications to institutional databases like the Centrale dei Rischi and CRIF. No complaints of formal irregularities were received concerning data treatment and no events occurred which resulted in customer data breaches or losses.

Lending policies enable small to medium enterprises to access financial services and increase their integration into value chains and markets (SDG 9.3), technology innovation in industry and investment in technological research and development. Financing for high-quality, sustainable and resilient infrastructures supports economic development and human wellbeing (SDG 9.1). Welfare services for businesses help guarantee universal access to essential health care service, medicines and quality treatment (SDG 3.8). UBI Banca pursues its business mission by applying its distinctive ability to interpret the needs and development of the social and economic context of the areas served and to foster their development with appropriate credit solutions and services. Its widespread distribution network collects household savings to fund both household life projects and business projects, generating growth in the local area through careful selection and support of the most deserving economic projects, whether established and robust or new but with a high growth potential. Globally, in 2018 the need to create a more sustainable social, environmental and economic development model by means of partnerships, in line with the goals of the UN 2030 Agenda (SDGs), became increasingly widespread and accepted. Increased inequality, migration flows and climate change are in fact making social and economic players worldwide more aware of the need to step up cooperation in order to identify new responses to society's needs. Italy continues to be affected by factors such as the falling birth rate, ageing population, new emerging forms of poverty, increasing numbers of elderly people that are not self-sufficient and the need to integrate migrants and unemployed young people. Given the structural fall in public resources, these factors show the urgent need for solutions that can only be found through inclusive collaboration between the public, private and private social sectors. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the local economy – Page 43 The civil economy is playing an increasingly important role in the country's economic and social development, which has also had a not insignificant impact on employment. ISTAT data from the 2016 permanent census of not for profit organisations confirms that the Third Sector is large and continuing to grow. Previous surveys had come to the same conclusion. It therefore makes sense to increase UBI Banca's presence in the sector, particularly in social enterprise and Third Sector entities in general. As at 31 st December 2016, there were more than 343 thousand not for profit institutions active in Italy (+2.1% compared with the 2015 Census and +14% compared with 2011), which between them employ almost 813 thousand people (+3.1% compared with the previous year and +19.4% compared with 2011). In order to provide adequate support for development of the Third Sector, including in its role as a link between the public and private sectors, in 2011 UBI Banca set up UBI Comunità, a brand that represented the service model and dedicated sales offer. Since 2017 this has been the name of a specific sales division within the department of the Chief Commercial Officer. UBI Comunità reaches out to all of the Third Sector, civil economy and public entities, and where possible, encourages synergy between the various groups. Closeness to the local area, a multi-stakeholder approach, development and dissemination of the networks of contacts, knowhow and expertise, together with a wide range of products and services, are the main levers of UBI Comunità for creating shared value for local areas and communities. Over the years this has led to the introduction of important initiatives and innovations, such as the Social Bonds. The specialist commitment to the Third Sector was further reinforced in the latest Business Plan, which considers it a strategically important relational and economic asset. The aim is to support investments with a social impact and social entrepreneurship projects linked to the development of the local area, community and new supply chains. The role as strategic partner for the sustainable growth of lay and religious not for profit organisations also involves creating synergies and forms of convergence and crossover between the public, private and private social sectors. No less important is the sector of public entities, which is subject to constantly changing rules and influenced by the ongoing changes to Italian structural policies, as well as the economic situation. By means of the UBI Comunità advisory services, products and services for municipalities, universities, schools and colleges, hospital, provincial administrations and various institutions, UBI Banca aims to create positive impacts on the local areas and to support the efficient management of public services. A new area of commitment for UBI Banca is company welfare. It recently launched the UBI Welfare service as part of its corporate services. The aim is to support companies in the implementation of dedicated employee welfare plans, as part of an integrated consultancy service. More specifically, technology innovations and the challenge of Industria 4.0 require a revision of the models underlying industrial relations in order to respond to the new ways in which people will be involved in the corporate production process. Within this context, UBI Banca has decided to share its many years of in-house experience in managing the company welfare of its own employees with client companies, focusing in particular on SMEs and microenterprises. With the vision that it has gained from being a bank that pays careful attention to the needs of its communities, companies, households and Third-Sector operatives, UBI Banca was the first Italian bank to offer a company welfare solution to its customers, creating ad-hoc products and solutions simple for companies to implement and a dedicated network of specialists in the field. This means the Bank is able to support companies in the process of putting in place the most appropriate welfare policies and to offer employee education initiatives. In this sense UBI Welfare is an initiative encompassing a wealth of opportunities for companies, well beyond the immediate, albeit important, tax and contribution relief. The aim is to offer tools to improve a company's performance in terms of organisation, personnel and social initiative. UBI Banca's broader goal is also to help develop welfare ecosystems in the various areas that will be able to meet the new needs of enterprises, people and communities. The aim is to Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the local economy – Page 44 create a proximity network in which the local Third Sector companies and operatives can not only become clients but also welfare service providers (meeting high quality and service standards), and significantly extend their market reach. This encourages economic development in the individual areas and consolidates a vision of company welfare as a key value multiplier. The key focus is on social, health care and welfare services, many of which are provided by the Third Sector. Responsibility for UBI Welfare is incumbent on the commercial division responsible for Welfare and Protection, reporting to the Chief Wealth & Welfare unit established in 2016, having the following broader mission:  to adapt customer advisory services to planning of financial wellbeing for persons and households throughout the life cycle;  meeting key financial requirements in different phases of the life cycle for persons and their families, helping protect the quality of life in old age through an integrated, innovative and broad spectrum in asset management and insurance coverage;  incorporating an increasingly important supply of social, health care and welfare services. Local presence [GRI FS7] The commitment to the local economy presumes a knowledge of local economic realities that can only be gained through local presence. This factor is reflected in the features of the Group’s commercial network, which is present in small centres 1, in the organisation of the distribution of branches into Macro Geographical Areas, and in the decentralised levels responsible for lending2. Indirect economic impacts [GRI 203-1:2 FS7] In connection with the value of local presence, business and credit policies must be applied to meet the real requirements of local economic transactors, and specifically small businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises with the objective of promoting and sustaining the development of a sound economic and entrepreneurial fabric capable of generating economic and social value in the medium and long term. Legality Rating Ministerial Decree 57/2014 introduced the Legality Rating for companies, to combat corruption and other illegal practices, and established that banks must take it into account in order to reduce check timings and costs and to determine the credit rating of enterprises and related financial conditions for access to credit, should this be important based on the performance of the client's account. The Rating is valid for two years and may be renewed on request by the enterprise involved. Ratings may range from a minimum of “one star” to a maximum of “three stars” on the basis of the requirements the enterprise meets. UBI Banca has added specific rules for assessing the Legality Rating to the loan check and decision-making process. Depending on the time required in the process, the data on the business volume for agencies that have a Legality Rating are published annually, as soon as they become available, in the Social Responsibility section of the Group's corporate website pursuant to the requirements under the regulatory texts governing transparency 3. 1 See also the Group profile paragraph, page 5. 2 Reports and Financial Statements 2018, Consolidated Management Report Commercial activity. 3 http://www.ubibanca.it/pagine/Legality-ratings-EN.aspx. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the local economy – Page 45 Finance for development At the end of 2018 UBI Banca had loans of €93.3 billion 4, which exceeds direct funding by €1.1 billion. The additional funding needed was acquired as a result of the Group’s ability to access the financial market and public sector funds, some of which subsidised, destined for small and medium-size enterprises. Joint projects exist with entities and institutions at the local, national and community levels, including trade associations and the associated guarantee bodies, the Guarantee Fund for SMEs pursuant to Law No. 662/1996, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Central Bank (ECB), through participation in the TLTRO II long-term financing programme. The Bank also participates in the SME Initiative organised by the European Investment Fund (EIF) and, under the agreement signed, from early 2019 will be able to provide funding at favourable rates for investment projects of companies operating in the regions of the Italian Mezzogiorno (Abruzzo, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Molise, Puglia, Sardinia and Sicily). Also in 2018, it entered into an agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB), which makes funding available for investments in social activities. In its lending to support enterprise development – particularly SMEs – UBI Banca has launched initiative focusing on areas representing the best of Italian enterprise, such as tourism and agribusiness, which significantly contribute to Italy's GDP thanks also to the country's cultural heritage, landscape and food and wine tradition, and to commerce. Special loan facilities are dedicated to supporting growth in new entrepreneurial ideas (Start-up Loans) and female entrepreneurship (Invest in Women and Women in Start-ups). With its international presence and with its UBI World programme, the Bank also provides support to Italian business clients on foreign markets to make sure they obtain the necessary financial assistance together with a series of support services for the internationalisation of their activities. In 2018 the cooperation agreement with Confindustria – Industria 4.0 signed in 2017 to promote the function of the Digital Innovation Hubs5 (DIHs) was further expanded to incorporate content about the supply chains, sustainable development and welfare. As regards sustainable development, the Group will offer enterprises the Research, Development and Innovation facility for investments in environmental impact reduction, maintaining jobs and the creation of new jobs. For this purpose, the Bank has started to develop methods to assess the social impact of investments and will be working with Confindustria to develop a culture of welfare in the associate enterprises. 4 Gross loans as at 31st December 2018. 5 Technology districts created to help SMEs adapt to the new industrial revolution.

The service enables enterprises to respond to the modern needs of enterprises, people and the local area, and supplements public services in the field of health, welfare, education, leisure and protection and finding a better home life/work balance. UBI Welfare includes an internet platform and a selection of services for managing the company welfare plan, with extremely simple methods also for managing flexible benefits, alternative forms of payment consisting of fully tax-free goods and services. Marketing is supported by Welfare Specialists located throughout the area. These new professional figures have been specially trained to accompany entrepreneurs through the process of structuring and managing their welfare plans. Marketing is also supported by enterprise contact campaigns, focusing in particular on enterprises with a Collective Bargaining Agreement requiring mandatory welfare benefit solutions, which therefore have a direct interest in adopting solutions for the straightforward and immediate payment of small sums to their employees. In 2018 UBI Banca struck an agreement with the Consorzio Nazionale della Cooperazione Sociale CGM, whose members include more than 700 social enterprises all over Italy providing welfare services to individuals, and 11 additional cooperation agreements with trade and employer associations operating in various industries and regions of Italy, representing small and medium-sized enterprises, larger industries and pharmacy owners. 6 Reports and Financial Statements 2018, Consolidated Management Report – Commercial activitiy. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the local economy – Page 48 To investigate and understand the changing welfare needs in society, UBI Banca has also supported the establishment of the UBI Welfare Observatory, which is run by ADAPT Specialist Industrial and Labour Relations Training School established in 2000 by Professor Marco Biagi, with scientific coordination provided by Professor Michele Tiraboschi. On 14 th March 2018 the Observatory published the first “Report on Employment and Company Welfare in Italy”, prepared on the basis of surveys carried out in the areas in which the UBI Banca Group operates. The study looked at the main national collective bargaining agreements covering the subject, over 2,000 second-tier collective bargaining agreements (predominantly supplementary company agreements), in addition to the most significant local area agreements ordered by economic sector. Given the growing importance of supplementary healthcare in Italy, the services include a combination of healthcare service modules, which make up different Health Plans based on the choices of participants. Healthcare services are offered by means of the Cassa di Assistenza Aziende Italia, established in 2016, and its Health Plans, to which enterprises can sign up for their employees, external staff and families, and benefit from tax relief where available. Health plans are flexible, with various maximum insured amounts and coverage, based on the company's needs and the categories of employees. Insurance risk coverage and payment for services is implemented by means of collective health policies taken out between the Fund and the Insurance Company partner. In 2018 UBI Banca also began marketing social-interest insurance policies: the new BluReddito and BluImpresa Multirischi. BluReddito is a new single-premium insurance package providing coverage for individuals, which combines a non-life and an optional life policy (term life insurance), in order to give the client and their family financial tranquillity in the event of unexpected life events that could harm their financial situation.BluImpresa Multirischi is a product dedicated to coverage for the main risks to which small commercial, production and services businesses, small industries and offices, and small to medium-sized professional firms are subject. It offers overall coverage for material and direct damage to the premises in which the business is conducted or its contents following fire and/or natural events and, for contents only, following thefts or burglaries. The policy also offers the option of coverage for material and direct damage caused to third parties and injuries to employees when carrying out the insured business, including assistance for various emergency situations in all cases. Coverage for indirect damage in the event of business interruptions is also provided. UBI Comunità for growth in the Third Sector and the civil economy With over 24,800 clients – of which 6% comprises “Not for Profit Organisations” (cooperatives and social enterprises), 79% “Not for Profit Social Organisations” (associations, foundations, etc.) and 15% religious organisations – UBI Banca has a market share of 6.9% in the Third Sector. With €2.5 billion and €0.8 billion respectively in deposits and loans with the Third Sector, its share is far higher than the industry average7. 7 BASTRA data on sub-group 51 (Not for Profit Organisations).

This has included support for investments in projects with a social impact and powerful social initiatives to support the weakest members of society (e.g. through Social Bonds, Social Project finance and the “Trust in Life – Durante e Dopo di Noi”) project. To support the expansion and consolidation of social entrepreneurship using financing instruments, in the last quarter of 2017 UBI Banca was the first banking institution to join the ABI-CDP Convention of the Ministry for Economic Development 8 of 28th July 2017 on the Revolving Fund to support enterprises operating in the social economy. At the end of the year, the Bank obtained a €50 million Social Activities MBIL financing facility from the European Investment Bank (EIB)9. In 2018, under its convention with the Ministry for Economic Development (MISE), UBI Banca granted 6 loans for approximately €10 million, 5 of which are still awaiting approval from the MISE and 1 of which was approved in December 2018 by the MISE and is currently being processed. While under the EIB facility (completed and implemented during the first quarter of the year), 17 loans have been granted, for a total of €12.9 million. The Convention with the MISE was made possible by combining the expertise of the Concessional Financing Unit in internal measurements techniques and instruments for assessing creditworthiness with that of UBI Comunità, enabling the immediate transfer of consolidated experience in other areas. In this context, social impact assessment (for which UBI Banca applies the social return on investment—SROI methodology to projects in connection with Social Bonds) becomes particularly relevant, not only as a proxy for the value of social enterprises, but also as a fundamental element for defining their eligibility for access to concessional financing that banks are required to verify and measure. To capture and add more value to the specific nature of the various Third Sector entities, UBI Banca has developed a specific method for measuring creditworthiness, which acquires useful qualitative/quantitative information for investigating the type and social value of their activities (intangible assets). In 2017, in conjunction also with operators in the sector, the Reporting form for Third Sector entities and the Detailed information form on loan applications from Third-Sector entities were updated and implemented. These two instruments support the commercial network and provide feedback on internal assessments of business opportunities and evidence on creditworthiness and financial and economic sustainability, that can also be 8 The Convention establishes the terms and mechanisms for submitting concessional financing applications provided under the Decree of 3rd July 2015 of the Minister of Economic Development on granting of concessional financing (70% at the concessional rate of 0.50% with CDP funds and 30% at market rates with bank funds) designed strictly for social enterprises, social cooperatives, and related consortiums, with total funding of €200 million from the Revolving Fund to support enterprises and Investments in research (FRI) managed by the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. 9 Medium and long-term financing under advantageous conditions with terms of up to 20 years supported with investments with social implications developed by public, private and private social entities. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the local economy – Page 50 used to define conditions to be applied to financing, potentially with an “incentive-based” approach depending on the levels of autonomy defined in the business policies. The project to develop a specific “Assessment of Ecclesiastical or Religious Entities Form” began in 2018, and should be completed by the end of 2019, to boost the assessment capacity of these entities. UBI Banca has developed innovative investment products to support the funding requirements of not for profit organisations. These include Social Bonds (which this year reached the significant goal of €1 billion place with 92 projects supported since 2012), UBI Pramerica open-ended collective funds SICAV/Ethical Funds (see the section on Commitment to the Community) and initiatives to involve employees and clients in supporting fund-raising campaigns by primary client organisation to which UBI Banca offers dedicated fund-raising instruments such as Solidarity Credit Transfers, UBI Pay and Payroll Giving 10.

UBI Banca offers qualified services management for public bodies, with efficient solutions, specialist technical advice and the ability to create value partnerships for the community and for local economic development. During the year, the Treasury and Cash Service was further improved, promoting the adoption of efficient solutions and simplified operations, with the use of innovative platforms (Siope+ and Pago PA), and supporting digitisation processes. More than 94% of transactions are now processed electronically using the IT Ordinance, facilitated by the legal requirements introduced by Siope+, which enables entities to reduce operational risks and rationalise 10 Solidary Credit Transfers allow customers who use Qui UBI and Qui UBI Affari to make free bank transfers to Third Sector entities; UBI Pay is a smart phone application that enables customers to send money without paying commission using the Jiffy interbank network; Payroll Giving is an option available to UBI employees to donate a sum (such as €10) which is then deducted from their wages.

Services for public bodies have also been enhanced by the introduction of internal processes offering structured support and operational coordination for tenders for the granting of funding, guarantees and products sold by the Bank launched by the competent bodies in the various local Macro Geographical Areas. At the end of the year there were 2,120 managed entities – municipalities, provinces and regions, hospital, schools and universities – and several important partnerships with universities were developed during the year.

Personnel constitute an asset with values, capabilities and competencies, the recognition and enhancement of which are essential conditions for achieving UBI Banca’s mission. The profound changes in the banking industry business model, together with digital transformation and expansion of the Group's perimeter, have created new opportunities for professional development, which required a management plan in order to achieve efficiency and profitability. Actions to optimise the workforce and reduce labour costs therefore work alongside initiatives and investments to increase and enhance our human capital, starting with attracting talent and continuing with training and professional development programmes, flexible working and corporate welfare. Accordingly, “organisational wellbeing” is the Group’s objective, with policies and processes designed to implement regulations governing health and safety in the workplace in a substantive, not only a formal manner. This is also pursued in the knowledge of achieving both a greater competitive advantage as a result of higher productivity and improved performance by workers (less absenteeism and staff turnover and greater customer satisfaction) and savings for society in general in terms of both tangible and intangible social costs generated for example by injuries, operational errors, legal disputes, insurance claims, litigation and care expenses. The scientific literature has shown that organisational wellbeing is closely associated with factors such as the corporate climate, the commitment of employees, labour satisfaction and work-life balance. Personnel management is incumbent on the Human Resources Area, which reports to the Chief Operating Officer, based on established processes and practices aligned with best practices at national and international levels. The quality of the policies implemented in the management, development, training and best use of talent, professional growth and benefits offered to employees meant that UBI Banca again received international certification from the Top Employers Institute for 2018. From a regulatory point of view, conditions of employment and occupational health and safety are specifically dealt with and governed by Model 231, which sets out specific administrative formalities, checks and monitoring for the hiring of personnel from Third countries (in connection with the criminal offence of employing illegal immigrants) and for health and safety in the workplace. The responsibility for managing issues relating to occupational health and safety lies with the Health & Safety Manager (who heads the workplace Prevention and Protection Service, a staff unit of the Chief Operating Officer) who works in close cooperation with employers and those responsible for prevention, coordinating the application and maintenance of the Health and Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Enhancement and wellbeing of personnel – Page 52 Safety Management System through regular monitoring, revision of safety targets and checks to ensure procedures are correctly applied. Employment and turnover [GRI 401-1 202-2] In 2018 initiatives to contain labour costs and increase efficiency and profitability continued, against a background of continuing complex economic and market conditions. Organisational and management operations are carried out in accordance with social sustainability criteria, under arrangements with Trade Unions involving oversight mechanisms for the redeployment of staff involved in reorganisation plans, and the use of voluntary flexible working arrangements and retirement incentives. Role change and retraining processes are accompanied by special training programmes, to make the most of our human and professional resources. 2018 1 IN TRAGRO UP MO B IL ITY 2017 (Displacements with contract detachment or transfer) of w h ich of w h ich con tract con tract Total tran sfers Total tran sfers Men 853 483 10,390 5,641 Women 542 331 6,982 3,467 TO TAL 1 ,3 9 5 814 1 7 ,3 7 2 9 ,1 0 8 1 Data derive from the project Single Bank and from incorporation of the New Banks. Actions with an impact on staff dynamics are included under generational turnover in the Business Plan, with 1,100 hiring in 2017-19 against 3,000 redundancies (all voluntary under the early retirement plan, implementing the trade union agreements of 26th July 2017 and subsequent agreements). In accordance with trends in the distribution model and the effort to simplify operations, the hiring of personnel from the external market aims above all to incorporate young new graduates – mainly in order to expand the sales network and support development of the multi-channel service – and specialised skill profiles not present in the Group, to contribute to the development of new skills and professional capacities. To this end, UBI Banca has implemented an Employer Branding strategy, which means it has a constant presence in the universities in the relevant areas, where most hiring takes place. It holds orientation meetings, on-campus selection events, presentations and talks from employees (there are a total of 40 initiatives). It also makes an incisive use of digital communication channels with announcements, which help reach active candidates, and targeted campaigns, which are also effective in attracting passive candidates. Testimonials, guidelines and social media posts have helped spread awareness of UBI Banca as a valid employment option. The UBI Banca Employer Branding actions have received recognition in the research carried out by Universum: the ranking of ideal companies to work in puts UBI Banca in 36 th place for graduates in economics and 19th place for graduates in law. There has also been a significant increase in students graduating in STEM degrees, where the Group is in 89 th place. In 2019, actions to improve the awareness of UBI Banca as an Ideal Employer will continue, with an Employer Branding strategy including two main projects: the UBI Ambassador Employee Advocacy project and the mobile gamification app UBIverse . In terms of the hiring of professional and senior management personnel, the profiles evaluated are predominantly concentrated in areas where the Group's offices, policy activities and monitoring operations are located. In 2018, 15 new Senior managers were hired, 73% of whom are resident in Lombardy.

At Group level, they include acquisitions and transfers. The substitution index was equal to approximately 30%, which equates to one incoming resource for every three departures. Voluntary turnover is stationary at 0.8%, the same as in 2017, showing a high sense of belonging in the Group. The average length of service is 19 years and 7 months (20 years and 2 months for men, and 18 years and 8 months for women). In 2019, operations will continue to rationalise the network with the optimisation of the work force defined in the organisational structure and the distribution model: searches on the external market, in addition to direct investment to introduce a significant number of young digital natives into the business structures, will therefore be targeting the new professions deriving from digital transformation and reinforcing of the governance structures that maintain relations with the market regulators and supervise the maintenance and development of ICT systems. Benefits and work-life balance [GRI 401-2:3] In order to protect the health and wellbeing of the personnel, a number of contractually defined mechanisms are provided for all the employees of the Group. Benefits All employees are provided with various benefits comprising:  collective welfare plans including pension, health and insurance coverage under the relevant regulations;  child assistance and canteen benefits to provide meals as well as sports and recreational activities;  preferential conditions for access to products and services offered by the Bank/Company; Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Enhancement and wellbeing of personnel – Page 55  collective transport services between the Bank's main offices and financial subsidies for mobility within the area. In the preparation of corporate welfare plans, UBI Banca aims to harmonize at Group level the various forms of supplementary pension and welfare benefits and insurance so that adequate levels of benefits are provided in the various companies. In support of younger colleagues as they enter the work force, regulations were introduced to enhance the corporate contribution to supplementary pension schemes and first-homepurchase incentives. Additional welfare benefits, to which variable premiums can also be allocated, are supported through the reimbursement of certain household expenses (e.g. schools of all types and levels, campus expenses, textbooks, canteen services and care for elderly family members) or through education/recreation and sports services provided by the Bank. Staff members certified to have disabilities of more than 70% are eligible for a corporate contribution in addition to their supplementary coverage. 2018 2017 CO STS CO STS SER VICES AN D CO N CESSIO N S F O R EMPL O Y EES IN CUR R ED IN CUR R ED (thousands of (thousands of 3 N O .

Work-life balance During the year structural changes were introduced to some aspects of social and corporate welfare policy, in order to foster a better balance between the Company's technical, organisational and production needs and employees' personal, family and working lives, by implementing forms of flexibility such as part-time work, voluntary work reduction/suspension1, hour banks and smart working. The Company gives precedence to requests to work part time from male or female workers with proven serious personal or family reasons. Where work suspension for maternity/paternity is concerned, measures have been introduced to protect organisational mobility for workers and flexible hours compatible with the requirements of their jobs. Smart working, introduced for 500 employees, is an innovative working solution that can help reconcile the private and professional spheres, productivity and environmental sustainability. 1 Partly paid extraordinary leave, regulated by agreements with the social parties. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Enhancement and wellbeing of personnel – Page 56 Smart working is currently offered to the central management departments, but the goal is to expand the pool of users and make this option more attractive by sharing technologies that can support and aid a growing number of smart workers. To support the expansion of smart working, all staff have been given the opportunity to see the Smart Working Stories videos. These feature two UBI managers talking about their experiences of using this tool, highlighting the importance of a relationship of trust between managers and smart workers and a continued guarantee of professional efficacy and efficiency to the smart managers. Permits are also an important tool for reconciling personal and family needs with work. Particular attention is devoted to the situations of employees directly or indirectly in disability circumstances, by introducing experimental supplementary paid leave in addition to the paid leave provided under Law No. 104.

Families of employees on duty or retiredworking or retired with disabled children who are not self-sufficient not only receive financial support directly from the company, but also receive support from the Association Clematis Onlus (www.clematisonlus.org). The charity was set up in 2002 at the initiative of a group of employees from the former Banca Popolare di Bergamo – Credito Varesino and financially supported by the Group. The Association has taken out insurance to guarantee a supplementary annual income to disabled children in the event of the death of both parents, and pays allowances to families for rehabilitation training and various aids. A total of 71 households are covered by the insurance, including 38 families of retired employees, benefiting 74 disabled children. Parental leave Italian law provides a mandatory period of leave for female employees and workers, normally during the two months before and three months after childbirth, and a voluntary period away from work for both parents2. In addition to the legal requirements, the Group has come to agreements with Trade Unions to facilitate the timing and manner of returning to work after maternity leave and the request for extended part-time work (agreement of 26th July 2017, art. 3.1 Part-time Work and art. 3.2 Maternity and Paternity). Agreements also cover, again in 2 Parental leave have the right to optional leave (if the employment relationship is continuous) up to the first 12 years of the life of a child, for a period of between two and not more than 10 months, which can be increased to 11 months if the working father takes leave from work for either a continuous or staggered period of no less than three months. This total period may also be taken by the parents simultaneously.

For the value reported in the 2017 Consolidated non financial declaration see the document published on the Group's website at http://www.ubibanca.it/pagine/Bilancio-Sostenibilita-IT.aspx. 3 In 2017 gender data are not included due to detection difficulties. In 2018, an innovative training project was designed for employees – male and female – becoming parents. The aim is to develop across-the-board skills such as empathy, listening and time management. Becoming a parent makes life more complicated and requires people to manage several roles at once. Scientific research has confirmed that, starting with the transformational energy of caring for a child, parents gain and perfect across-the-board skills that are increasingly indispensable and sought-after by organisations. This approach helps make parents aware of their innate and acquired skills, which they are often already using, and helps them apply them practically also in their professional lives. In addition to classroom activities, the programme includes online skills training involving distance training sessions. In January 2019 the first initiatives were already timetabled. Occupational health and safety3 [403-1:10] According to the World Health Organisation's definition, health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not just the absence of disease or infirmity . This concept has been adopted not only in Italian law (Legislative Decree No. 81/08, art. 2, paragraph 1, letter o), but also by UBI Banca, which has gone beyond mere formal compliance with the legal requirements, aiming to make constant improvements, thanks also to the adoption of an Occupational Health and Safety Management System. Adoption of the system is particularly important from a financial and reputational point of view. It is not a legal requirement, but offers substantial protection to ensure correct compliance with all legal requirements, in order to contain risks by systematically monitoring the efficiency of procedures and appropriateness of processes. At the same time it incorporates all new safety regulations and involves workers and Management, who are required to actively participate in the implementation and maintenance of health and safety conditions within the company. 3 The foreign companies (Pramerica Management Company and UBI Trustee) are subject to the provisions of the Luxembourg Code du Travail. The recent construction of the building where all the business is based and careful facility management (provided by CBRE Asset Service) ensures that all security problems are managed, monitored and kept in line with statutory requirements. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Enhancement and wellbeing of personnel – Page 58 Health and Safety Management System The UBI Banca management system is based on UNI-INAIL Guidelines, which are the practical embodiment of the Model 231 Guidelines both for serious or grievous bodily harm due to breach of accident prevention regulations and for health and safety in the workplace. The system is subject to internal controls and covers 20,403 Group employees, equivalent to 99.9% of the total employees. Health and safety policies are distributed together with the Health and Safety Management System Regulations in all the Group's legal entities operating in Italy. They also take into account injury data and the outcome of health monitoring by the Corporate physician. The Regulations were originally approved in 2014 and then updated in 2018, to take into account the need to align the previous version with UBI Banca's new organisational structure and the consequent changes to roles and processes in the context of health and safety. They set out: the roles and responsibilities of the various people directly involved (Employer, Delegated Managers, Prevention and Protection Service Manager and Corporate physician) and the Company and Group units involved in implementing the policies (Human Resources, Managers of the Macro Geographical Areas, UBIS Real Estate, UBIS Sicurezza Fisica, UBIS Acquisti, UBIS Infrastructures Services and UBI Academy); the processes for the active and conscious engagement of staff; communication flows between the various structures and mechanisms for integrating the Occupational Health and Safety Management System into the corporate processes; and the planning, monitoring and regular review of the system's efficacy (specifically required by the UNI-INAIL Guidelines). Prevention is guaranteed primarily by constant monitoring of the workplace and equipment. Checks are carried out regularly by Prevention and Protection Service staff, who inspect the various operational units located in the area. The hazard identification and risk assessment process involves verifying the risk context using a check list accompanied by measures in the field, i.e. specific surveys. The data collected is entered onto a dedicated application (Bansic), which is used to generate a series of instructions and/or recommendations, classified by the level of risk, for the functions responsible for reducing or eliminating risk by means of technical and/or organisational measures in accordance with the operational plans approved by the employer. The Prevention and Protection Service schedules risk assessment updates, which are normally every five years. 1 TECHN ICAL IN TERVEN TIO N TO REDUCE RISKS 2018 2017 Fire prevention, emergency management, emergency exits 3,290 2,902 Plant (machinery, maintenance) 1,083 918 Premises (floors, walls, window ledges, staircases, architectural barriers) 1,164 699 Ergonomics (lighting, work stations, micro-climate) 350 491 Certificates and documents 111 738 TO TAL 5 ,9 9 8 5 ,7 4 8 1 Data of Adriatica Bank and Carilo, Tirrenica Bank and Federico del Vecchio Bank are not included. To make the strategy for improving safety levels more effective, since 2013 the traditional programme of workplace measures has been integrated with an analysis of injuries that have taken place in the workplace, in order to determine their causes and to develop preventive measures. Statistics on the frequency and severity of injuries show that the main cases are: accidental falls in the office or on stairs; car or pedestrian injuries during missions; collisions with doors, furniture or work equipment or squashing of fingers when closing safes or drawers. Given the importance of prevention in work carried out by external suppliers (installation and maintenance work), the Purchasing Manager responsible for prevention monitors supplier qualifications, and operational checks are carried out by those in charge of prevention for the technical areas (UBIS Real Estate, UBIS Sicurezza Fisica and UBIS Infrastructure Services). Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Enhancement and wellbeing of personnel – Page 59 Safeguarding health The UBI Group uses companies specialised in compliance with all the requirements of the current law on monitoring health, Legislative Decree 81/2008, particularly in the Occupational Therapy service, the role of Corporate physician, the tasks carried out by qualified professionals directly appointed by the company and the provision of worker training and refresher courses4 The Corporate physician appointed works with employers and the Occupational Preventional and Protection Service to improve the efficiency of the management system based on specific knowledge of the company organisation, production unit and risk situations, putting in place measures to safeguard the health and psychological and physical wellbeing of every worker. To this end, the Corporate physician visits the workplaces of staff whose health is monitored and provides employers with specific documentary evidence of their findings. For individual workers, the Corporate physician judges their suitability to their specific role, creates and updates their medical records, provides information about the health checks they are given and informs them about the results. The employer collects the aggregate results of clinical and instrumental tests in anonymous form in specific reports, and illustrates the results at regularly held meetings. Every employee may raise medical/health problems related to the workplace or their job with the Corporate physician. There is a dedicated email address for this purpose, which only the Corporate physician can access. In addition to regulatory requirements, supplementary healthcare assistance safeguards and promotes workers' health. This takes the form of insurance coverage or coverage by healthcare Funds. Personnel in service or retirement can benefit from a network of top-level affiliated healthcare services all over the country. There are nursing centres in cities with the highest number of personnel (Bergamo), and in 2018 automated mobile centres were set up to monitor workers' hearing, blood pressure, heartbeat and eyesight (Bergamo and Brescia). Environmental monitoring of air quality and for radioactive gases (such as Radon) will be carried out in branches and major buildings in 2019. Robbery risk To manage the risk of individual exposure to robbery, a procedure providing psychological support has been put together with the help of the Corporate physician. This is structured according to the severity of the event and is aimed at all employees involved in events, including those classified as violent . Every robbery is classified based on a series of critical parameters, and every worker involved in the event is identified as a subject exposed to the risk. Once the level of severity has been identified, the Occupational Prevention and Protection Service takes action to manage the issues relating to employees' risk perception. Staff involved are sent a questionnaire designed by a team of psychologists and the Corporate physician. Response to the questionnaire is not mandatory. The Corporate physician analyses the questionnaire in order to identify the people to email offering expert support by a consultant psychologist. All the activities and documentation for which the Doctor and team of psychologists are responsible are subject to the same safeguarding of health data. 4 Training courses include company courses on fire risks and first aid, in accordance with art. 3 of Ministerial Decree No. 388/2003, which covers workers in various professional environments.

In 2018, work continued to implement safety measures, emergency exits and medical emergency alarm systems in accordance with Legislative Decree 81/08, particularly in the branches of the three New Banks. Burglary-proof systems include the installation and activation of remote systems for opening safes for all branches. Since the branch renovation project, branches have in any case been fitted with sliding doors instead of the traditional knobs. Buildings considered to be strategic because of the presence of data processing rooms have their security systems mapped out. In October work also began at the Brescia branch to improve the garage access systems, to segregate access to al floors and to install CCTV and alarm systems with creation of the building's new internal alarm room. In accordance with the targets that have been set, security improvements have also been made to the San Marco Garage in Bergamo and the accommodation at Milano Marittima. Health and safety training With the support of UBI Academy, whose Director-General is specifically delegated to deliver health and safety training, the Group as continued spreading a culture of safety at all levels. This involves systematic worker training plans with classroom teaching and an e-learning platform that provides a record of training, in accordance with the requirements of the StateRegions Conference Accord of July 2016. The Occupational Prevention and Protection Service identifies the training programme each worker will attend based on their role/tasks and their resulting exposure to risk. The entire training programme meets the regulatory requirements for training introduced by the State-Regions Conference Accord of December 2011. Training comprises a general section on the basic concepts of occupational prevention and safety applicable to all business areas, and a specific section on risk, covering issues such as injuries,machinery and equipment, microclimate and lighting, electrical installations in general, video terminals and work-related stress. This specific section is structured according to the risks relating to the job, potential damage and consequent banking sector prevention and protection measures and procedures. The content and duration of the training is based on the outcome of risk assessments and takes into account risks typical to the sector. For example, for robbery risk training is split between the sales network and central management.

The Regulations Portal manages notices concerning corporate and/or Group regulations. The Human Resources Health and Safety section publishes documentation about the company organisation and emergency management, as well as educational equipment used in training courses and other information. A dedicated email address enables staff employed in the various organisational units, Workers' Safety Representatives (including after they have carried out workplace surveys) and those with safety-related responsibilities to report any risk situations to the Prevention and Protection Service, in order to enable the competent organisational units to put in place the necessary technical and organisational measures. Another email address, reserved for use by the Corporate physician, is available to interested parties to report health issues in confidence. The UBI Sistemi e Servizi Service Desk assistance service application also enables those with safety-related responsibilities to directly report factors that could potentially lead to incidents of a certain significance. The traditional categorisations based on maintenance requests (IT or property-related) have been integrated so it is possible to report risks of tripping, collisions or falls relating to injury events. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Enhancement and wellbeing of personnel – Page 62 Injuries and occupational illnesses An examination of data on injuries finds no categories of workers more exposed than others to the risk of injuries in relation to their occupational role. In fact, again in 2018, the highest percentage of injuries related to events happening to employees on their way to and from work 5. As regards the risk of suffering psycho-physical damage during robberies or of being involved in attacks by customers, 4 events took place in 2018 (3 robberies and 1 attack), equivalent to 1.9% of the total accidents reported.

Professional development [GRI 404-2:3] In fare banca per bene (to bank fairly and well), UBI Banca is constantly focused on quality, simplicity, innovation and constant improvement, not only in customer relations, but also in human resources management. Career paths are constantly tailored to stakeholders' needs. In this context the priority goals are to develop human capital, focus on professional development and consolidate a culture of assessing and recognising merit. Programmes for upgrading employee skills and transition assistance In Human Resources, the traditional competences model is being constantly updated. It has to remain in line with a corporate population increasingly in possession of digital skills. It is therefore the Company's responsibility to put together tools and processes to ensure a permanent system of training in these key competences, encompassing a variety of formal and informal training occasions and processes in an increasingly integrated and fluid manner. UBI Banca has adopted a Performance Management process, which combines evaluation with development activities, by designing targeted management and training activities designed to support personalised development paths based on the areas for improvement, professional goals and potential of each employee.

Most Relevant Personnel in not included because it is affected by specific assessment tools for managerial services. In the total workforce 39 employees are not included because of unavailable classification ( external operations base). 2 In 2017 the following were excluded from the professional assessment perimeter : newly recruited personnel, those on parental leave, staff of minor companies in the Group and personnel on external contracts. The total number of 2017 professional evaluation cards includes 24 cards associated with employees classified as ND (external operations base) who have not been included in this table. Since 2017 a new phase has been added to the process: Self-assessment, giving every employee the opportunity to express their opinion of the elements assessed by their manager. In 2018 an additional tool was developed to resolve the problem of the process taking place annually: this is Continuous Performance assessment, an innovative method for a dynamic, participatory assessment process. The tool offers managers and staff the opportunity to exchange information in real time on the goals assigned for the current year. This helps deliver the tool's goals, which are to work on awareness and the exchanging of information on a constant basis, in order to develop career paths in line with individual ambitions and the company's needs. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Enhancement and wellbeing of personnel – Page 65 systematically collects a vast range of comments and opinions from managers, staff and colleagues by means of questionnaires. In 2018, 250 staff were involved. In view of the positive experiences of previous years, in 2018 management was again offered Individual Coaching (15) and Team Coaching (28), courses that aim to put managerial skills to their best use, and the pilot project Coaching Your Self was launched. This is an online Coaching platform for developing skills by means of a guided, structured process. Considering technical skills to be a strategic requirement to address the complex changes taking place and in compliance with the European MiFID II Standards, UBI Banca has continued with skills certification courses, particularly for managers providing financial consultancy, to whom classroom and online training was provided. A corporate role project has also been launched as a competence-focused investment – the Job Family Model – which classifies central unit jobs by standard jobs and levels of expertise, in order to tailor professional training and development courses to individual knowhow. Another way to harness the new competences needed in a constantly changing environment is through Smart Working, introduced in the Company in 2014 under a test trial. The spread of Smart Working also involves developing key skills for the smart worker and smart manager. In the former, the planning, organisational and goal-focused skills are stimulated by autonomous management of their smart working day, with increasing use of digital communication. In the latter, an assessment model is used which is increasingly goalbased rather than dependent on physical presence, an approach that can be supported and guided also by the company's tools (such as Continuous Performance). 2018 2017 CAREER PRO GRESSIO N S Men W omen Total Men W omen Total Within professional Areas 509 52.0% 470 48.0% 979 371 50.3% 366 49.7% 737 From professional Areas to Middle manager 170 55.2% 138 44.8% 308 146 61.6% 91 38.4% 237 Within Middle managers 266 68.9% 120 31.1% 386 223 73.1% 82 26.9% 305 From Middle to Senior manager 8 100.0% 0 0.0% 8 2 66.7% 1 33.3% 3 TO TAL 9 5 3 5 6 .7 % 7 2 8 4 3 .3 % 1 ,6 8 1 7 4 2 5 7 .9 % 5 4 0 4 2 .1 % 1 ,2 8 2 Training and education [GRI 404-1] Training activities are managed by UBI Academy, the UBI Group Corporate University, whose object is the study, planning, consultancy and provision of services for the training and the professional and managerial development of all Group personnel.

Requirements and training programmes are assessed on an annual basis, incorporating the indications from the Business Plan and the needs identified by the top organisational levels of the Parent company, with specific reference to training on regulatory requirements. All training initiatives are structured and planned each year with the support of the Human Resources Area. All of the didactic material on technical banking, commercial, credit and financial topics to support the classroom activities is subject to approval from the Group's Compliance department. The training courses for specialist roles (such as in Compliance, Audit, Risk management, Finance and Project management) also give participants a certificate on completion. Training plan The 2018 Training Plan has been designed to provide standard regulatory updates, and also to support implementation of the 2019-20 Business Plan and activation of the new distribution model IMPACT, which operates mainly in 4 areas:  to strengthen competence and effective commercial behavior, including revenue challenges for the sales network;  to disseminate the approach to new digital technologies throughout the Group;  to develop the managerial and leadership roles of company managers and the adoption of good organisational practices in order to foster collaboration and effective communication;  to grow individual talent in order to ensure adequate productivity levels. The most important training activities during the year included:  in regulation, the Progetto MiFID II, to comply with the training updates required by the MIFID II directive, with an online training course of 30 hours for around 9,000 people providing financial information and advisory services;  in sales, the Modello IMPACT, to disseminate commercial conduct in line with the newly adopted distribution model of the same name and to develop the skills required by the new roles. It involves developing blended training courses in particular for Consultants (Households and Individuals, Digital Development and Business Team) and Branch Managers (the latter involved in two days dedicated to learning more about the sales method, change management and sharing the expectations and strengths of the IMPACT Model);  in talent development, the launch of the new programme UBINEXT, which will join the programme in place since 2014, offering behavioural and specialist training, industry-wide experience, involvement in project work and participation in events with external Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Enhancement and wellbeing of personnel – Page 68 observers, to develop the key competences of the future (40 employees were involved in 2018);  for management roles, classroom training sessions, team building and individual and group coaching, including by means of tools such as Skype for business and online training platforms to develop management skills in the five relationship, management, intellectual, innovative and emotional areas; courses on Organisational wellbeing with the purpose of increasing team management skills on the one hand, and on the other effective communication and inter-departmental collaboration in order to share outstanding conduct and actions. Other initiatives In 2018 training activities on communication between the generations continued, with the project “Generational Exchange: Experience and Energy”, which involved 12 participants from a variety of generational settings, in an active discussion on relevant, current issues for the Group. The aim is to attempt to exchange and learn from different experiences and to make communication and collaboration more effective. Specific initiatives were dedicated to the professional development of Top management of the Group, to update them about the main regulatory and legal changes and their relative impacts on internal models and processes (e.g. the new developments in corruption between private individuals introduced by Legislative Decree No. 231/01 and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Monitoring training UBI Academy uses internal and external mechanisms to monitor the efficacy and efficiency of the entire training process. First of all, UBI Academy adopts a Quality Management System and regular internal and external audits are carried out to check and confirm the ISO 9001:2015 Quality Certification. On an annual basis, the Quality Manager uses the reports received as a basis to record the verified cases of non-compliance and identifies the actions required to prevent them and/or to eliminate their underlying causes. In second place, training involves users filling in a perceived quality questionnaire. A monthly report is prepared for the Management on the quality level recognised for every training initiative. Corrective measures are put in place for those not reaching the minimum level required. Finally, mainly for technical /professional courses, there is a learning questionnaire to evaluate the acquisition of training content and, if necessary, to plan additional reinforcement actions.

The scenario in Italy is one of a high level of worker protection which UBI Banca considers its duty to maintain both on a daily basis and with regard to the management of large organisational changes; it is a duty which goes beyond mere compliance with regulations. National collective bargaining, which sets not only minimum wage levels, but also specific negotiation procedures to protect workers in the implementation of substantial organisational changes. UBI Banca has always approached such negotiations by seeking mutually agreed solutions through transparent, concrete and continuous dialogue, beyond the minimum duration for these procedures (45 days set in the National Collective Labour Agreement for the banking sector). Freedom of association and collective bargaining [GRI 102-41 407-1] All employees of both UBI Banca and the other Group companies with registered offices in Italy (more than 99% of the Group’s total workforce) are covered under national collective bargaining agreements and are not subject to any restrictions to the freedom of association and participation in Trade Unions. All trade union organisations operate freely without restrictions and the Group makes adequate operational means available to them to conduct trade union activities.

The quality of relations with the unions has enabled the Group to reach solutions that meet the needs of labour force optimisation and flexibility. These have been – and will continue to be in the near future – critical factors towards reaching efficiency and profitability targets. About 80 days, or 580 hours, of meetings were held with labour union representatives in 2018. The main topics discussed were: gradual harmonisation of second-level contract terms, in continuity with agreements reached in 2017, with measures added for the staff of the product companies and the newly merged banks; an early retirement scheme for workers close to the pension age, thereby fostering generational turnover; the effects of commercial policies on employees, where a joint understanding was reached in terms of principles and implementation measures needed; and finally, implementing welfare policies for the staff, with measures to improve work-life balance. The following major agreements were signed over the course of the year:  11th January: agreement on second-level contract terms for the employees of the product companies;  24th January: agreement to harmonise the benefits granted by the company for predecease, insurance coverage for disability or death due to injury and, for those employees with company insurance policies, healthcare-related benefits;  1st February: agreement on second-level contract terms for the employees of the three New Banks merged into UBI Banca;  3rd May: formation of a bilateral committee to evaluate commercial policy issues;  31st August: agreement on smart working, in an effort to improve employees’ work-life balance, which allows work to be carried out, on some days, at an alternative company office or from home;  6th September: agreement for access to extraordinary solidarity fund benefits for 369 employees;  8th November: agreement to renew for 2019 the voluntary work-life balance measures through extraordinary leave and part-time working hours;  7th December: joint statement of principles and actions to be taken with regard to the effects of commercial policy implementation on the workers;  18th December: agreement, in the context of work-life balance goals, allowing employees to performing a portion of their job training exercises online in a ‘smart’ way, or in locations other than the assigned workplace. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Dialogue with Trade Unions – Page 71 Equal opportunities and non-discrimination Key Aspects Impact on the SDGs Managing diversity to ensure equal Personnel management policies opportunities and non-discrimination for help UBI achieve the targets of human and professional achievement for all non-discrimination (SDG 5.1), individuals is both an ethical imperative and equal opportunities and the full, a strategic priority in an increasingly effective participation of women at competitive and constantly changing market, all levels of decision-making in in order for the Group to enhance its human economic life (SDG 5.5), as well as capital by attracting and nurturing all equal pay for work of equal value talents. (SDG 8.5). All human resource processes are designed to prevent any form of discrimination and to promote equal opportunities by adhering to the principles of fairness and transparency. Concretely, this entails initiatives to facilitate better balance between professional and private life, as well as measures to provide support towards returning to work from maternity or paternity leave and from long absences in general. As regards remuneration, the entire Group has official remuneration and incentive policies according to which compensation is based on merit and fairness, with the latter intended as consistency in salaries amongst positions with comparable roles and responsibilities, while offering the same career development opportunities to all. Special attention is devoted to the management of disciplinary proceedings. In this connection, UBI Banca has adopted specialised guidelines applicable throughout the Group designed to ensure a proper, transparent approach through formally-established investigation, decisionmaking and judgment processes and through periodic reporting on the measures taken. Equal opportunities [GRI 405-1:2] Managing diversity, especially in terms of gender, is crucial to ensuring equal opportunities for personal and professional development for all employees, and concretely includes taking steps to promote wellbeing and a healthy work-life balance for all staff. In 2018, for all employees (both men and women) experiencing parenthood, an innovative training project began with the aim of developing universally valuable skills such as empathy, listening skills and time management. In fact, parenthood makes daily life more complex and increases the need to handle several different roles; scientific studies have shown that the transformative energy involved in parental care leads to the acquisition and improvement of ever more essential and in-demand organisational skills. This approach brushes aside old corporate organisational paradigms and embraces more contemporary, creative and useful ones that help make parents more aware of skills they naturally possess and have often used, enabling them to apply these skills concretely in the professional sphere as well. The training programme includes both classroom activities and online skills training to pursue distance training objectives; the first such initiatives were scheduled to begin in January 2019. All Group personnel were invited to view videos called Smart Working Stories in which two UBI managers recounted their experiences using smart working tools to find balance between private and professional life. The main topics covered were the importance of a relationship of trust between the smart worker and his/her superior, and the opportunity to become a Smart Manager while continuing to work effectively and efficiently. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Equal opportunities and non-discrimination – Page 72 Equal opportunity conditions are reflected in the Group workforce and in the female/male wage comparison. Composition of the Group workforce Equal opportunities begin with the selection process, through candidate assessments based on fairness, on transparency and on valuing differences in the cultural background, age, gender and physical abilities. There was broad gender equality in the personnel hired by the Group in 2018, with 52% being female, contributing to a further increase in the proportion of female staff, in line with the trend over the last three years. Particular attention is also devoted to handling job applications from persons belonging to legally protected categories (for the most part, persons with disabilities), involving objective selection evaluations that take into account professional and behavioural requirements, candidates’ work capabilities, followed by the creation of suitable working conditions to enable the candidates to best express their abilities and professional skills.

Loans to purchase or renovate property to help families afford a decent home (SDG 11.4). Various forms of collaboration with Third Sector organisations and Public Bodies, as well as private clients and businesses, create partnerships to pursue social goals. Throughout its history UBI Banca has combined a commitment to business with a strong focus on the social and cultural context. It has promoted projects and partnerships appropriate to the times and the various contexts. Acting as a driver not only for the economy but also for the social wellbeing of local communities promotes the creation of strong relationships with authorities, institutions and social organisations. This helps integration into the local economic and social fabric and is positive for both reputation and commercial positioning. In this context the Group’s support to families in difficulty, attention paid to more vulnerable members of society and contribution to important social causes and projects are part of its overall business strategy. The development of business activities with social aims is a heritage shared by the entire Group, in particular by UBI Comunità, which acts as an incubator for new ideas and initiatives. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the Community – Page 75 Strategic philanthropic activities – donations and sponsorships – are managed in accordance with specific internal regulations (the Regulations for the Management of Donations and the Regulations for the Management of Sponsorships), which set out the responsibilities and processes. Donations are made using specific profit reserves as well as a part of the revenues from products and services. The allocation of profits to reserves is covered by art. 44 of the UBI Banca articles of association, which sets the level at 2% and a maximum of €12 million for the part of equity in the financial statements that can be distributed, after deducting the minimum statutory reserve amount and any amounts decided by the shareholders' general meeting for setting up or increasing reserves, including extraordinary reserves or other reserves (the Board Fund). Each year the Supervisory Board approves an Annual Intervention Plan for UBI Banca, setting general guidelines for the efficient allocation of these resources to the initiatives with the greatest potential for impact and change. The Supervisory Board decides on the most farreaching initiatives (usually inter-regional), establishing the amounts to allocate to the Group Foundations, while local interventions are referred to the Macro Geographical Areas (MGAs). In order to ensure more effective relations with local communities, a Local Operational Team (LOT) has been set up for each MGA, comprising an MGA manager and Member of the Supervisory Board who has experience of the local areas, supported by the UBI Comunità Area Manager and Corporate Social Responsibility Manager. The Supervisory Board examines the Annual Intervention Plans of the Macro Geographical Areas, verifies that they are in substantial compliance with the annual guidelines and expresses its prior opinion on MGA initiatives that are “significant” (amounting to €20,000 or more) and/or extend over several years. Allocation of part of the revenues from products and services (in particular within UBI Comunità and Pramerica) is carried out according to the methods set out when they are put together and explained in the information prospectuses for the placement of financial products. UBI Banca sponsorships of organisations and events, which are often representative of the history and traditions of the local areas, are managed by the Sponsorship Function within the Communications Area according to the available budget, which is set on an annual basis. The process of selecting the projects to support uses an IT application (Optimy), which guarantees transparency and traceability throughout. Access to financial services [GRI FS7 FS14 ] The Group is committed to facilitating physical and virtual access to financial services by disadvantaged persons on the basis of the needs identified, with regard to physical disabilities – by eliminating physical barriers to branches and offices, sensory disabilities – by improving the remote channels for using telephone and digital banking services, and situations of social and economic marginalisation. Elimination of physical and sensory barriers In the last two years, 11 new ramps, 7 stair lifts or elevators and 16 conveniences accessible by differently abled people were installed at Group buildings and branches. All the Group's ATMs are designed to use specific graphics for partially sighted people, with larger numbers and letters. More than 1,300 ATMs (55% of the total and 14 at IWBank equating to 73% of the total) are already fitted with audio support solutions that considerably help partially sighted and non-sighted people, and all new equipment to be installed moving forward will features these solutions. The two support features are activated simply by pressing key 5 on the keypad, which can be identified by touch. The Group's Home Banking website – Qui UBI – and ubibanca.it and ubibanca.com websites have been made compatible with the Level 1 W3C standard, so that all the functions can also be used by partially sighted people. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the Community – Page 76 Financial inclusion UBI Banca has identified the risk of marginalisation or social exclusion of the more vulnerable segments of the population because of difficulty accessing banking and financial services as an important social cause. It is committed to providing appropriate responses, which in practical terms are mainly implemented through the commercial and lending policies and range of products and services of the commercial area, as well as through UBI Comunità activities supporting not for profit organisations that are working to reduce inequality and poverty. The conventions implemented by Fondazione Welfare Ambrosiano and Finlombarda for “Advances” on the Cassa Integrazione in Deroga, Cassa Integrazione Guadagni Straordinaria and Contratti di Solidarietà (special temporary lay-off scheme, extraordinary state redundancy/lay-off scheme and solidarity contracts) for employees affected by the crises and corporate reorganisations/restructuring were terminated and not renewed. Instead, UBI Banca signed up to other financial inclusion initiatives. Since August 2018, with the new “basic account” (introduced in 2012 and renewed following transposition of the “PAD” Payment Account Directive), UBI Banca has expanded its range to include products for consumers with basic financial requirements, who only use certain services and carry out a small number of transactions each year. These are Conto di Base Ordinario (Ordinary Basic Account), Conto di Base gratuito (Free Basic Account) for socially disadvantaged groups and Conto di Base Pensionati (Pensioners' Basic Account) (6,609 accounts existed at the end of 2018, 421 of which were opened during the year). To facilitate access to credit, in particular for purchasing a first home, in June 2018 the Bank formalised its participation in the Memorandum of Intent between the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and the Italian Banking Association ABI (the 2014 Stability Law Guarantee Fund for 50% of the capital part of mortgages for a maximum of €250,000). The project is supported by the Guarantee Fund for first-time home buyers set up with the MEF (The Fund Manager is Consap) and is available to all citizens, with priority given to certain categories, such as young couples, single-parent families and young people. UBI Banca offers two products: Mutuo Flessibile (Flexible Mortgage), with which repayments can be suspended or the repayment schedule changed if certain extraordinary events occur, and Mutuo casa per giovani coppie (Young Couples' Mortgage), which is designed to include those who do not have a permanent employment contract. Young people are also included in the category of the more vulnerable, who have greater difficulty accessing credit. For studying and other projects there are the unsecured loans Diamogli Futuro (Let’s give them future), in conjunction with the ABI and Department of Youth of the President's Office of the Council of Ministers, and the personal loans Piccole Spese (Small Expenses) and Grandi Progetti (Great Projects). For anti-usury purposes also, pawn credit continues to be offered 1, providing immediate cash in return for the pawning of valuable items to meet temporary financial needs not only of families in the more vulnerable groups in the society, but also of small shopkeepers and businesspeople. This is provided at 12 branches in Milan, Pavia, Bergamo, Varese, Monza, Como, Brescia, Crema, Fossombrone, Pesaro, Macerata and Rome, with average loans of around €1,880. 1 Pawn credit is one of the most ancient forms of lending practiced by the “Monti di Pietà” banks created in the 15th Century by the Franciscans to combat usury, and today is still the last real resort in access to credit.

In line with its commitment to financial education and savings activities, UBI Banca has created Investment Savings Plans (PAFs), which enable even those with limited resources to save sums however small (there are almost 270 thousand accounts, of which more than 24 thousand were opened in 2018), and products dedicated to young people:  Clubino, the savings account for children aged 12 and under, with more than 133 thousand accounts currently in existence, 8 thousand of which were opened in 2018, which encourages children to save and think about the future from a young age; Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the Community – Page 78  I WANT TUBI’, the current account and online banking for topping up mobile phones and monitoring expenditure from PCs, tablet or smartphones for young people aged between 13 and 18. There are around 21 thousand accounts, of which more than 5 thousand were opened in 2018;  QUBI’ <30, the zero-fee package for young people aged under 30, which comprises a current account, internet banking and debit card. There are currently 159,812 accounts, of which 45,675 were opened in 2018. Financial Education [GRI FS16] Globalisation, the growth of the global economy, expanding worldwide population and related rise in the use of natural resources have led the UN and the European Commission to implement projects to foster long-term growth that is sustainable for the ecosystem, businesses and households. In this framework, the efficient use of resources and financial instruments is an essential component of economic, environmental and social stability, and thanks to its social role in the local areas, the Bank can make an important contribution to the efforts that all institutions need to make. In line with the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (“to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”), UBI Banca helps generate growth processes that create value for society by means of a financial education project that aims to develop conscious citizenship principles in order to build a stable, secure and sustainable future. The project is mainly aimed at schools of all levels and types in area in which the Group operates, but thanks to the numerous partnerships of UBI Comunità, it applies a multistakeholder approach also to associations, foundations, sports clubs and their respective stakeholders (teachers, volunteers and young people in the community). The activities involve several Group businesses and are implemented in conjunction with FEduF the Foundation for Financial Education and Savings. The project has three main parts. Educational programmes for schools  KIDS for primary schools, to explain the economy to young children in a fun way;  JUNIOR for children in the first year of secondary school, to introduce them to economic citizenship issues by encouraging them to reflect on the principal functions of finance and their impact on people's everyday lives;  TEENS for older secondary school pupils, which introduces the basic notions needed for knowledge of economic rules, preparing young people to join and actively participate in the social, cultural, professional and economic world around them. Conferences and local events These are seminars that aim to educate young people about the risks of gambling and about investment behavior, which aim to explain the main rules of statistics and mathematics underlying certain commercial practices that encourage the importance of saving. In 2018 UBI Banca took part in the Financial Education Month organised by the Committee for the planning and coordination of financial education projects 2, with initiatives in Jesi, Benevento, Arezzo and Bergamo. Pramerica has organised eight Financial Cocktail Parties throughout Italy. These are events informing people about economic scenarios and the performance of the financial markets, and 2 The Committee has the task of planning and promoting financial awareness raising and education initiatives in order to measurably improve Italian people's competence when it comes to saving, investment, pensions and insurance. It comprises eleven members and is headed by a director with proven competence and experience in the field appointed by the Ministry for the Economy and Finance, in agreement with the Minister of Education, universities and scientific research. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the Community – Page 79 offer hints and suggestions about investing savings, as well as answering queries and questions about the investment world. Between 100 and 150 clients took part in each meeting. IWBank also contributed to disseminating financial education in its presentation in the main mass media of the research project: il futuro è oggi (Future is today), to help investors in their long-term financial planning, and in its Made in Italy excellence roadshows on investment behavior and informed investment (involving 500 current and potential customers in 11 Italian cities). Combined School and Work Programmes Following the mandatory introduction of Combined School and Work programmes as part of the Good School Reform (Law 107 of 13th July 2015), UBI Comunità joined with the UBI Academy and UBI Selection and Employer Branding to organise a 40-hour project to meet the needs of schools and students, which increasingly expect their bank to act as an education partner. In this way, the Bank contributes to the development of economic and financial skills among young people. The programme comprises three training days in classrooms with inhouse teachers, which alternate traditional teaching with workshops involving group work, role play and practical work. In the workshops the young people work in teams on an enterprise project with the guidance of a tutor. In 2018 UBI Banca dedicated several initiatives to the world of sport, in order to extend economic education to those outside the school system. These included a project in conjunction with the sports federations CONI and FeduF, Campioni di risparmio (Saving Champions). The aim was to raise awareness and inform athletes about economic citizenship, conscious money management, financial planning, savings and the legal aspects of economics and individual entrepreneurship. They also included educational partnerships with Juventus and Atalanta, with initiatives for young football players. UBI Banca and Juventus designed a training course for young people at the J College (a sports college for young people in the Juventus Youth Sector ranging from the Young National to the Primavera player categories), to educate them in the correct use of money. Interactive lessons for young players in Atalanta's Primavera and Berretti categories were provided at the Zingonia sport centre to educate them about gambling addiction and investment behavior, as well as the importance of saving.

Long-standing relations with educational institutes and faculties of economics, law and computer sciences at public and private universities and business schools play an important part in achieving this objective. UBI Banca offers funding for bursaries and services for students, as well as work experience opportunities. In 2018 around 150 young undergraduates and new graduates spent time at the company, 98 of which on extra-curricular work experience. 23 young people were subsequently hired by the Group. Under the Combined School and Work programmes, more than 800 students from 24 Institutes in the local communities were able to gain experience of the world of work and acquire the fundamental components of economic citizenship and financial culture. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the Community – Page 80 Actions taken for social initiatives [GRI 201-1 415-1] Social interventions, whether occasional or as part of agreements lasting several years, are intended to promote and enhance the identity of the Group and reinforce its brand. The choice of initiatives to be support takes into account the positive impacts they can generate for stakeholders as a whole, in terms of reducing social costs and/or increasing the social and economic development of a community. In order to achieve the maximum economic and social return from the amounts paid out, it is thus important to identify and support the best initiatives in terms of how well they match the areas where the bank operates and their impact in the area. This gives rise to “collaborative growth”, aligning social intervention with business strategies by acting on three fronts:  enabling growth, involving factors such as professional training, high-quality education, improved quality of life and a reduction in the problems that lead to costs for the community and social hardship;  strengthening demand, involving factors such as the size and quality of the relevant markets (e.g. social housing initiatives, with actions that can support the demand for mortgages);  strengthening the competitiveness of communities, by encouraging investments and development activities. No payments, whether direct or indirect, are permitted to: political parties, movements, political committees and other political organisations, their representatives and candidates, congresses or festivals with political propaganda purposes 3.

UBI Comunità initiatives In 2018, UBI Comunità developed new important partnerships with leading not for profit organisations, in line with the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7, Goal 17 of which is about developing partnerships to achieve social objectives. These included:  Local archdioceses, dioceses and religious organisations, as part of the business unit which co-ordinates commercial initiatives for ecclesiastical and religious bodies;  the Italian Cancer Research Association (AIRC), for which UBI Banca has been an institutional partner for the November fundraising campaign I Giorni della Ricerca (Research Days), by means of various initiatives (in-branch fundraising and via internet banking, payroll giving, the AIRC-personalised UBI Comunità Enjoy card and the UBI Pay App payment function for donations by smartphone using the Jiffy network). The 2018 communication and fundraising campaign, which was widely covered in the local and national media, enabled AIRC to collect almost €6 million to fund training programmes for young researchers and innovative cancer treatment projects; of these funds more than €500 thousand was allocated to various Group-led initiatives, the most important of which is the in-branch distribution of Cioccolatini della Ricerca (Research Chocolates) for which since 2013 UBI Banca has contributed more than €5 million to top cancer research funded by the AIRC; 7 The SDGs are 17 major goals set by the UN General Assembly in its resolution “Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, approved on 25 th September 2015. Goal 17 is to: “Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development”.

Also a direct contribution through the Social Bonds and Pramerica's Social 4 Planet Sicav;  Anffas Onlus (the National Association for Families with Cognitive and/or Relational Disabilities) and the CGM Cooperative Group, with which UBI Banca, in association with its trust company UBI Trustee, created the innovative project Trust in Life. The project provides services and financial support to people with severe disabilities and their families, and manages the various financial resources from the personalised support programme, the Progetto di Vita (Project for Life) by means of a trust including a multi-beneficiary approach. This project is also intended to organise interventions to support the social inclusion of people with severe disabilities, by activating local networks and the specific expertise of partners, with an approach that is open to all those in the area with an interest in working together to share experiences and skills. To that end, meetings involving the key public and private stakeholders were held in local communities in 2017 to present and investigate the content of the legislation and the project. In 2018 it continued information events were organised in local communities and a tender launched to bring together initiatives and best practice put forward by members of the Anffas and GCM networks in accordance with the “Dopo di noi” law (Law No. 112/2016). The projects selected will be supported by UBI Banca, which will forgo part of its income from the new credit card named Hybrid. The UBI Comunità Social Bonds and SICAVs and Ethical Funds play an important role in generating resources for use in social projects as part of their profits are set aside for such purposes. From their launch in 2012 to the end of 2018 the Group has supported 92 important local social projects through the issue of the same number of Social Bonds. It has made donations worth almost €4.9 million and set up funding facilities for over €21 million. In 2018, UBI Banca placed four new bond issues worth €65.5 million, which produced donations of €235 thousand, with a further €60 thousand for projects from 2 Social Bonds issued in 2015 and 2016 (AIRC and Save the Children). In order to allocate resources more effectively and efficiently to the initiatives that have the greatest impact on change and increase accountability to customers who subscribe bonds and to Group stakeholders more in general, as part of the structuring process for Social Bonds and the upfront placement of SICAV or Ethical Funds, UBI Banca uses social impact measurement to evaluate the projects to support. The tool used is Social Return on Investment (SROI), which converts an estimate of the expected social impacts of the project into monetary terms (ex ante valuation) and the impacts achieved on its completion (ex post valuation). For the application of SROI, UBI Banca is assisted by an outside independent company with experienced professionals, which checks the compliance of the methodology used for data collection and the relative sources, the monetisation of the expected and achieved impacts of the project, the calculation of social value and verification of the underlying assumptions, as well as checking that the results of the project are consistent with its aims. Normally 30% of the donation is disbursed on completion of the project, once it has passed the independent ex post check and has been found to have met expectations and complied with social and environmental requirements. SROI was applied ex ante to the 3 projects shown in the table at page 86, with very positive results in terms of the expected social impact.

In the commercial area, the UBI Comunità Social Edition initiative also continued. This involves the issue of an Enjoy UBI Comunità prepaid card, customised with the logos of the not for profit organisation for which they are issued. UBI Banca waives its right to part of the commissions on these cards and donates them to the not for profit organisation. Customised cards for six organisations were issued in 2018, including AIDO Lombardia and AIRC, for a total of around 15,400 cards, of which approximately 8,700 are active, generating a donation of approximately €17,200. Foundation initiatives Over the years the Group has set up a series of foundations and acquired others as part of merger projects. The foundations operate autonomously in their own local communities, in accordance with their respective articles of association. The most significant initiatives in 2018 were:  for the UBI Banca Popolare Bergamo Foundation Onlus, the contribution to the Donizetti Theatre Foundation for the theatre, ACLI Bergamo for “Molte Fedi sotto lo stesso cielo”, Intercultura Onlus Foundation for bursaries for deserving children, and Ducato di Piazza Pontida for cultural events in the city of Bergamo;  for the UBI Banco di Brescia Foundation, the contributions to the Italian Alpine Club (CAI) of Gavardo and San Giorgio Onlus Foundation of Brescia for recreational activities for disabled children, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore of Brescia for culture and research, and Cuore Amico Fraternità Association Onlus for training for medical and paramedical personnel in hospitals in Mali;  for the CAB Foundation, contributions to the restoration of the Brescia Academy (Ateneo di Brescia), in order to promote its cultural heritage, to the Friends of Palazzo Martinengo and to the Parish of the Cathedral of Brescia for cultural projects;  for the Banca Popolare Commercio Industria Foundation Onlus, contributions to Friends of Edoardo Onlus for the Bottega di quartiere project, VIDAS Foundation for complete care free of charge for terminally ill patients and Robin Food Onlus to support families with economic and social difficulties;  for the Banca Popolare di Vigevano Foundation Onlus, contributions to the Sant'Ambrogio Social Cooperative Onlus to promote recreational activities, Premio Duse to support cultural activities, Anffas Vigevano, Prometeo 2050 and Caritas Foundation for assistance and social solidarity;  for the UBI Foundation for Varese ONLUS, contributions to the Giacomo Ascoli Foundation for Pediatric Oncology, Bellora Foundation of Gallarate for Autism Sufferers, Piatti Foundation for differently abled people, Gallaratese Society for Local Studies, Parish of Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the Community – Page 86 Saint Maurizio Vedano Olona, Parish of Saints Fermo and Rustico and Parish of Saints Vitale and Agricola for artistic and environmental projects;  for the Bruschi Foundation of Arezzo, educational art and antiquities projects at the Fiera Antiquaria di Arezzo, la Historic House Museum and historic buildings in the heart of the medieval city, the Exhibition Gallery, and publication of catalogues, reviews, books and series. Employee involvement Group employees are also involved in charitable initiatives through fundraising projects and a corporate voluntary work programme. Each employee can donate €6 a year directly deducted from their pay to ProSolidar (a national banking fund for solidarity and charity initiatives) and the Bank matches the same contribution. Prosolidar is a bilateral organisation managed by the ABI and national secretaries of the banking trade unions and is the world's first organisation set up by a national collective bargaining agreement and funded by equal contributions from employees and companies. Donations made to it by Group employees in 2018 amounted to over €222 thousand. The company voluntary work project Un giorno in dono (A day as a gift) in its fifth year, attracted 1,171 colleagues, 5.5% of the company's workforce. It involved 90 not for profit organizations, located in 42 cities and 15 regions, and 170 activities to choose from. As in previous years, the aim was to raise awareness among employees about various areas of social marginalisation, ranging from assistance to differently abled people to elderly people, children, families with problems and hospitals, and including environmental and cultural projects and support for countries with limited resources. As well as strengthening the company's group spirit, the project aims to increase solidarity within the Group. For every day of voluntary work provided, UBI Banca paid €100 to the organisation of the employee's choice, for a total of €117,100. Enjoy Special Edition, an account card especially for Group employees, who help to support social projects simply by using the card. UBI Banca does not charge interbank fees on POS transactions using these cards, donating the full amount to a social project. In 2018 this amounted to almost €18,600, almost half the total funding of all the organisations involved. The money was donated to the Italian Association to combat Neuroblastoma, which won the fourth Donation Day organised by the Italian Donation Institute, and will be used to pay for a bursary for research into pediatric tumours. UBI for art UBI Banca owns an important art collection, including works from the fourteenth to the twenty-first centuries that come from the collections of the banks that have joined the Group over the years. As well as paintings, sculptures and drawings, the collection also includes buildings and historic archives, installations, graphic art and applied art in workplaces and museums. The project UBI ARTE enables UBI Banca to make its collections available to the public; in seven Italian cities during the year UBI Banca took part in the Festival of Creative Culture and Invitation to the Palazzo, events organised by the Italian Banking Association ABI and in the Autumn Days of the Italian Environmental Fund FAI. Permanent and temporary loans of works from the collection to museums and exhibitions have been encouraged. These included the Tosio Martinengo Art Gallery in Brescia, Civil Museum of Montepulciano and Zust Art Gallery in Rancate. Finally, in October 2018, the website (https://arte.ubibanca.com/ubiarte_raccolta/index.aspx) and Instagram profile @arteubibanca were launched. These are dedicated to the collection and the activities the Bank supports to help cultural institutions in the local areas. It includes seven news columns, a section dedicated to the historic buildings, archives and collections, and a search function that enables easy browsing of the works.

Socially responsible investments [GRI FS7 ] In recent years Pramerica SGR has stepped up its commitment and dedication to designing sustainable, responsible investment products (SRIs): 3 funds operating under Italian law first and two Luxembourg sub-funds next, all of which under a sustainability approach thanks to the support of the ECPI advisor. All the products exclude enterprises belonging to sectors exposed to regulatory and reputational risks from the investment universe (i.e. controversial areas such as weapons, tobacco and gambling). The sub-funds also take a best-in-class approach, which directs investments towards enterprises with outstanding production processes, corporate governance criteria, management of human capital and relations with the local community based on principles of social and environmental responsibility. The funds Pramerica Azionario Etico (launched in 2005), Pramerica Obbligazionario Euro Corporate Etico (launched in 2015) and Pramerica Bilanciato Etico (launched at the end of 2017) each year contribute a percentage of their annual management fees (the first two 5% and 4% Pramerica Bilanciato Etico). For 2018 the contributions from the first two funds amount to a total of €50,000, to be paid to a beneficiary to be identified, while the Pramerica Bilanciato Etico contribution is €67,823, for CasAmica Onlus for the project “Sempre più vicini ai malati lontani da casa e alle loro famiglie: CasAmica apre le porte dell’accoglienza anche a Roma e Lecco”.8 8 The Project is designed to support the opening of two new houses in Rome and Lecco, to accomodate patients and their relatives travelling to hospitals that are far from home.

Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the Community – Page 89 Commitment to the environment Key Aspects Impact on the SDGs Responsible management of the use of Use of renewable energy sources materials, energy consumption, waste through the Group's energy treatment, and corporate mobility. sourcing requirements and making financing available for Contributing to improved environmental public and private investments in plants and services for customers and local infrastructure support the attainment of the infrastructure endowments and more objectives of energy transition (SDG 7.2) and generally, support the transition to an increased energy efficiency (SDG 7.3). economy that has a reduced environmental impact. Responsible management of the Group's properties and operations, financing for environmental investments by households and enterprises, as well as in infrastructures, contribute to the development of more sustainable cities (SDG 11.6). The widespread awareness that protecting the environment is a global priority requires everyone to engage in reducing the impact of human activities in terms of both natural resource consumption and pollution, with particular reference to reducing the amount of waste generated and to fighting global warming by avoiding emissions of greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting gases. Given the nature of its activities, UBI Banca’s efforts with respect to its direct environmental footprint are directed especially towards reducing energy and paper consumption as well as towards using renewable energy – efforts which even have financial benefits. With regard to its indirect environmental footprint, efforts are focused on supporting the energy transition, the development of a green economy, as well as projects and infrastructure with environmental aims. Besides promoting more eco-friendly economic development, this commitment also helps the Group seize new business opportunities and gain a reputational advantage. In Italy, the environmental impact of productive activities are subject to specific regulations, with environmental crimes enumerated in Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, including in the areas of waste disposal, the selection of suppliers and management of relationships with them, and the use and operation of heating and cooling systems. For these sensitive activities, the Model 231 adopted by UBI Banca contains special protocols and assigns specific roles and responsibilities. Taking a proactive approach to environmental responsibility, in line with the principles of the Global Compact, UBI Banca has adopted a group-wide Environmental Policy since 2008. This policy was being updated as at the end of 2018 and related implementation rules are expected to be adopted in 2019. For business missions, a Travel Policy is in force that favours the use of collective public transport. Specific responsibilities are entrusted to:  the Energy Manager, who is head of the Energy Management operational unit at UBI Sistemi e Servizi; for all Group companies it serves, this unit is responsible for analysing energy needs, for drawing up strategies and plans to optimise energy consumption and to reduce emissions (including improvements to the energy efficiency of buildings and systems), and for monitoring the application of these plans and the results achieved. The Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the environment Page 90 Energy Manager is allocated a specific budget, including for the purpose of using renewable energy;  the Mobility Manager, who is head of the Group’s Welfare function (appointed pursuant to the Ronchi Inter-Ministerial Decree entitled “Sustainable Mobility in Urban Areas”), is responsible for establishing and managing (in cooperation with the relevant internal functions and public bodies) policies regarding systematic employee travel arrangements, with the aim of reducing private vehicle traffic and its environmental consequences, by means of alternative transport solutions to lower environmental impact (such as shuttle bus services and bicycle racks at company facilities) as well as mobility management arrangements (e.g. purchasing electric bicycles). Energy consumption and related emissions are monitored through semi-annual consumption progress charts drawn up for the UBI Sistemi e Servizi Real Estate Department (an excerpt containing electrical energy usage only is also sent to the UBI Sistemi e Servizi Management Committee) and through the annual consolidated non-financial reporting cycle, in the form of the Sustainability Report and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), whose data are subject to independent verification (by an auditing firm). Materials used [GRI 301-1:2] The Purchasing Department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi manages the purchasing cycle for Group companies. The main raw materials used are paper and toner for printouts for internal use and also those destined to customers. The key initiatives adopted in this area aim to reduce consumption, especially of natural resources, via document digitalisation, optimising printing processes and using recycled paper. Reducing consumption Now that double-sided printing has become a standard printer setting, a new step forward has been taken with the Secure Print project, which has introduced new ways of managing print jobs from workstations, for the time being in the main management headquarters. Print jobs are no longer executed automatically; instead, the user must first confirm them by placing his/her ID card into a card reader installed on the printer or multifunction device. This system also automatically cancels any print jobs that have not been confirmed within 24 hours of being sent to the printer queue. The introduction of Secure Print led to savings of 1,753 reams of A4 size paper in 2018. Considering that recycled paper now accounts for 56% of all A4 paper used, this entails savings of 121,869 litres of water, 28,034 kWh of energy, 5,785 kg of wood and 3,688 kg of CO2 emissions. The digitisation of bank branch forms through advanced electronic signatures (AdES) enables documents that would otherwise need to be printed and physically signed by the customer to be signed electronically. In 2018, about 64% of bank account transaction receipts were digitised and processed via electronic signatures, thus saving 45 million sheets of carbonless copy paper, while 16.7% of contracts were digitised, thus saving 6.8 million sheets (or 13,600 reams) of recycled paper, and hence saving 299,200 litres of water, 102,000 kWh of energy and 19 tons of CO2. In 2019, transaction slips for internal use will also be digitised, as will a wider range of contracts (for new credit facilities, unsecured loans, trading, securities portfolios and financial consultancy), to save a further 6.8 million sheets of carbonless copy paper and 16.8 sheets of recycled paper (33,600 reams in all, and hence saving a further 739,200 litres of water, 252,000 kWh of energy and 47 tons of CO 2). Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the environment Page 91 Use of recycled paper In 2017, the Purchasing Department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi began a pilot project to evaluate the possibility of replacing pure cellulose paper with recycled paper (Steinbeis Classic White ISO 70-80 g/m2 100% recycled) at all UBI Banca bank branches and in some central offices. After the two test phases were completed – which involved at first 3 branches and later all former Banca Regionale Europea branches of the UBI group – recycled paper was procured to the tune of 56% of all paper ordered from January to October 2018 (292,794 reams, equivalent to saving 31.5 million litres of water, 5.6 million kWh of energy, 2.2 million kg of wood and 468 tons of CO2. In 2019, recycled paper use is forecast to increase to 90% of the total, once old supplies run out at the operational units involved and the scope of application is completed, leading to estimated savings of 60.4 million litres of water, 10.8 million kWh of energy, 4.2 million kg of wood and 897 tons of CO2.

Energy consumption [GRI 302-1:4] UBI Banca is a multi-site concern which operates in properties generally classifiable as for service use and it is subject to specific regulations on energy and energy efficiency which include the following:  Law No. 10/1991 “Implementing provisions for the National Energy Plan as regards energy efficiency, energy savings and the development of renewable energy sources and the related Presidential Decree No. 412/93 “Regulation containing rules for the design, installation, use and maintenance of the heating systems in buildings for containing energy consumption, in implementation of art. 4, paragraph 4 of Law No. 10 of 9th January 1991”, along with Presidential Decree No. 74/2013 “Regulation setting the general criteria for running, operating, monitoring, maintaining and inspecting heating and cooling systems in buildings and for the preparation of hot water for human use, as per art. 4 paragraph 1 (a) and (c) of Legislative Decree No. 192 of 19 th August 2005”;  European Directive No. 2002/91/EC: “On the energy performance of buildings”, implemented by Legislative Decree No. 192/2005 as subsequently amended by Legislative Decree No. 311/2006;  Legislative Decree No. 102/2014 “Implementation of EU Directive No. 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency”, as subsequently amended by Legislative Decree No. 141/2016. Electrical energy is procured and used to ensure the functioning of the branches, offices and data processing centres of the whole Group. Energy supply policies therefore aim to reduce the risks associated with supply disruptions (by using suppliers selected on the basis of cost, service quality and technical, commercial and financial reliability), while at the same time containing operating costs. Given the amount of energy consumed and the related impact on the environment, it is in keeping with the Group’s Environment Policy that the priority objectives in this matter are to use resources rationally, to eliminate wastefulness and to use energy from renewable and/or low-emission sources. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the environment Page 92 Energy-saving initiatives The Group consumes energy in its daily activities mainly through the machines used to perform corporate processes (computing centres and IT devices), lighting systems and air conditioning systems. In order to reduce energy consumption, and thus the potential impact from the risks of energy cost increases or stricter legislation on the energy efficiency of buildings and installations, UBI Sistemi e Servizi has:  adopted an eco-compatible design model for all construction and building renovation plans for both offices and branches. This model is regularly kept up to date with technological advances available on the market and its energy section is broken down into three areas for efficiency measures: electricity and lighting (LED lighting), machines and installations (highly efficient heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems) and architectural/structural aspects (extremely high-performing insulation, doors and windows);  conducted energy audits on its facilities (and has done so since 2013, before laws and regulations such as Legislative Decree No. 102/2014 were enacted) and made plans to carry out the most substantial energy efficiency initiatives that emerged from the audit findings. I principali interventi realizzati nel 2018 sono:  the installation of a new high-performance cooling system in the Brescia data processing centre, which intelligently uses a free cooling pump to air condition the rooms and reduce annual electricity consumption by about 38%;  the installation of high-efficiency LED lighting systems at the headquarters at Via Cefalonia 62 in Brescia;  within the context of periodic computer hardware renewals, the purchase of 864 new desktop computers with monitors, 1,714 laptops, 521 mini-desktops and 1,123 recentgeneration monitors: these new devices are more energy-efficient than the models replaced. Building automation at the branches From late 2016 to November 2018, UBI implemented a building automation project, becoming the first bank in Italy to do so. An intelligent monitoring and feedback system was installed (one of the largest cloud systems ever created) in 1,400 branches (including branches of the New Banks). This system continuously records and measures energy consumption and enables programmed management of electricity loads and remote verification that systems are working properly. The cumulative amount of energy saved through this project up to the end of 2018 was 4.5 million kWh, equivalent to 1,967 tons of CO2. As from 2019, when all branches are expected to be connected, the automation system will reduce CO2 emissions by an estimated 2,889 tons per year. It was most recently installed in three large buildings in Brescia, Bergamo and Jesi, with the goal of reducing energy consumption by about 20%; as from 2019, it is estimated that energy consumption will be reduced by 1,620,000 kWh per year, equivalent to 522 tons of CO2. For the coming years, the Group is considering installing this system in all of its other main regional offices. The advantages of building automation lie not only in reduced energy consumption and more efficient facilities management, but also in the ability to use an energy consumption database to gain access to the white certificate incentive mechanism, as well as in the improvement of workplace safety. The system’s control centres will in fact be able to recognise overloads and faults automatically outside office hours, which improves safety and reliability. Sustainable mobility action The main measures taken in terms of sustainable mobility involve employees’ commutes to and from work. The aim is to provide incentives not to travel in automobiles. For several years now, covered bicycle parking has been in place in some of the main offices, while the Group also runs a coach shuttle service between the Bergamo, Varese, Brescia and Milan offices (as well as one that goes around the city of Milan). Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the environment Page 93 Following the merger of the three New Banks, additional coach bus services were instituted between Macerata and Jesi and between Pesaro and Jesi. In 2018, a transport service was activated for personnel involved in the merger project, consisting of two 9-seater minivans, which throughout the year enabled these employees to reach even areas not adequately served by public transport, including Macerata, Arezzo, Jesi, Chieti and Cuneo, for employee shadowing and procedure release activities. The shuttle buses carried 300 passengers a day on average in 2018, resulting in an estimated 1,000 tons of CO 2 emissions less than if individual cars had been used. Another major contributor to reducing energy consumption and emissions that is related to employee mobility is the smart working, with 7,086 days worked in 2018. The E-Mobility Project The Group has commenced an E-Mobility Project to gradually bring electric cars into its corporate fleet, which can be used by employees for short to medium distance travel. At the end of June 2018, the first electric vehicle was added, a Renault Zoe-R90, which in its first four months was driven 2,400 km, resulting in 240 kg less CO 2 emissions compared to the diesel cars currently in use. For this vehicle, a wallbox charging station was installed in the car park at the UBI Sistemi e Servizi premises in Brescia. In 2019, the Group plans to add nine more electric cars to bring the total in its fleet to ten. Considering that each car travels 15,000 km per year on average, this will reduce CO 2 emissions from work-related commutes by approximately 15 tons. An equal number of charging stations will also be installed. The objective for 2020-2021 is to purchase 30 electric cars, or 10% of the Group’s entire vehicle fleet, maintaining a 1:1 ratio of electric cars and charging stations.

Emissions [GRI 305-1:7] The emissions produced by the Group mainly relate to greenhouse gases and the other pollutants produced by the use of energy from fossil fuels, whereas emissions of ozonedepleting gases are not significant, especially as over the years, heat pumps and refrigerators have gradually been replaced in keeping with current legislation on the use of refrigerant gases. Reducing CO2 emissions is a priority goal in the struggle against climate change, which the Group pursues both by reducing its consumption of energy in general and by using renewable energy. The energy savings actions carried out in 2018, along with the fact that 97.5% of the electricity consumed came from renewable energy sources 1, led to total Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions savings of around 1,768 tons. 1 Figure taken from Certificates of Origin issued by energy suppliers CVA Trading and A2A.

The receipt of the fourth copy of the accompaniment form by the producer/holder is necessary for the release of that party from responsibility for the proper disposal or recovery of the waste. The copies of the accompaniment form must be kept for five years. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the environment Page 99 Solid urban waste is managed by the public collection service and we are therefore unable to measure the quantity and methods of disposal. The total amount of hazardous waste transported amounted to 8,841 kg; no treatment was carried out to manage this waste. Such hazardous waste accounts for 0.4% of total separated waste and consists of retired electronic equipment (94.56%), lead batteries (4.98%) and medical waste (0.46%), all of which is entrusted to authorised local companies for disposal. None of it is imported or exported. Products and services with specific environmental [GRI FS8 413-2] benefits The Group applies commercial and lending policies in support of environmentally beneficial investments by both individuals and businesses, most notably in those related to energy savings and the energy transition to reduce CO2 emissions, through specific products:  for individual customers, Forza Sole (Sun Strength), a loan to purchase and install domestic photovoltaic systems, and Creditopplà Ritrutturazione Casa (Home Refurbishment) to cover the expenses of home renovation and energy-efficient retrofitting projects, which also receive tax breaks under current legislation;  for businesses, Nuova Energia Fotovoltaico (New Photovoltaic Energy) for the installation of photovoltaic systems, Energie rinnovabili (Renewable Energy) for the installation of systems for generating electricity and/or heat from wind, biogas and biomass and Full Power leasing for investments in renewable energy and energy savings. UBI Banca also subscribed to a Region of Puglia initiative entitled “Aid to protect the environment”. The aim of this initiative is to promote and support energy efficiency plans for local SMEs and micro-businesses by granting them loans for the purpose at reduced interest rates. Loans backed by resources made available by the EIB may not be granted for activities whose environmental impact is not substantially reduced and/or compensated for in compliance with EU and Italian law. 2018 2017 O p eratio n s O p eratio n s PRO DUCTS W ITH EN VIRO N MEN TAL AIMS No. Di s burs e d Re ma i ni ng No. Di s burs e d Re ma i ni ng (millions of euro) (millions of pri nci pa l (millions of pri nci pa l euro) (millions of euro) (millions of euro) euro) IN DIVIDUAL S 0 0 0 0 0 0 Renewable energies #RIF! #RIF! #RIF! #RIF! #RIF! #RIF!

With regard to major project finance investments, there was a heavy concentration of market assets in 2018, as the leading players consolidated their positions. This consolidation was accompanied by a financial optimisation process achieved through major refinancing operations. Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 2018 Sustainability Report Commitment to the environment Page 100 UBI Banca participated in structuring major transactions involving leading national operators (such as in the acquisition of the second largest Italian photovoltaic business, RTR, by the number one operator, F2i Energie Rinnovabili), obtaining solid positioning on the market, which will enable the companies to seize new opportunities, from structured support to the development of new power capacity that will not receive public subsidies (grid parity projects). 2018 operations were also important from a geographical perspective, as there were projects not only in the regions where the Group has a long history (northern Italy and Puglia), but also in the areas covered by the 3 new acquired and merged banks. In Tuscany alone, UBI Banca played significant roles involving substantial amounts in structuring project financing for major investments in the field of abstracting, carrying and purifying water, for local companies Acque SpA in Pisa, Nuove Acque in Arezzo and Gaia a Marina in Pietrasanta. All projects financed passed the authorisation processes required by Italian law (environmental impact assessment, declaration of commencement of business, consolidated authorisation, economic/financial sustainability assessment, building permits, etc.) and the technical, legal, administrative and insurance evaluations conducted on behalf of the Bank by first-rate international independent consultants. 2018 2017 PROJECT FINANCE OPERATIONS IN Power Power Power Power PORTFOLIO FOR RENEWABLE ENERGIES No. installed financed No. installed financed AND THE ENVIRONMENT (MW) (MW) (MW) (MW) Energy 131 3,104 731 141 2,699 733 of which: wind farms 23 1,760 252 25 1,846 286 photovoltaic plants 90 1,184 414 97 743 386 other renewable energy plants 18 161 66 19 110 61 Enviroment 8 0 0 6 0 0 of which: waste tratement plants 1 0 0 1 0 0 water supplies and treatment plants 6 0 0 4 0 0 district heating systems 1 0 0 1 0 0 TOTAL 139 3,104 731 147 2,699 733 PRO JECT F IN AN CE PO RTF O L IO F O R REN EW AB L E EN ERGY AN D THE 2018 2017 EN VIRO N MEN T F in an cin g g ran ted d u rin g th e year Numbers of contracts 17 14 of which: for renewable energy 11 14 Amount authorised (€ million) 652 329 of which: for renewable energy 336 329 Amount disbursed (€ million) 336 206 of which: for renewable energy 222 206 F in an cin g o u tstan d in g at th e en d o f th e year Numbers of contracts 139 147 of which: for renewable energy 131 141 Amount authorised (€ million) 1,668 1,528 of which: for renewable energy 1,514 1,435 Amount disbursed (€ million) 1,379 1,264 of which: for renewable energy 1,262 1,177 In all, as at the end of 2018 the Group’s portfolio contained renewable energy project-related loans totalling €1.8 billion (68.2% of which in project finance).

This is an annual publication. The previous edition covers the financial year 2017, and was published in March 2018. This document has been drafted in accordance with the comprehensive option of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards and the Financial Services Sector Disclosures, established in 20161 and 2013, respectively, by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). For calculations of the economic value generated and distributed to stakeholders, as well as for environmental indicator calculations, the specific guidelines set by the Italian Banking Association (ABI), updated in 2010 and 2018 respectively, were also taken into account. For further details about environmental indicator calculation methods, see the appendix to the ‘Commitment to the environment’ section. This report constitutes the twelfth consecutive edition of the Group’s Sustainability Report since its inception by UBI Banca in 2007. It also fulfils UBI Banca’s obligations regarding periodic Communication on Progress as per the United Nations Global Compact for subscribing institutions. Reporting content and topic boundaries [GRI 102-45:49] This report pertains to the Parent company UBI Banca and all other companies that are fully consolidated within the UBI Banca Group, with the sole exception of the companies listed in the table below.
