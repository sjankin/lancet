Coordinating and preventing risks mean protecting people, places and operations to guarantee businesses’ sustainability. Promoting efficiency, at all levels, with waste reduction and better use of resources, is an essential requirement to keep the balance in search of prosperity. By executing a strategy based on the pillars “Oriented Growth”, “Controlled Risk” and “Outstanding Efficiency”, we work everyday at EDP Energias do Brasil to promote “better energy, a better future and a better world”. Those were guidelines that have characterized our actions in 2011, a period in which we promoted the spread of the United Nations Organizations (UNO) Global Pact principles. We valued aspects concerning human rights, labor relations, environment and corruption combat by assuring that progress and the creation of sustained wealth are only present as long as they are inserted in an ethically healthy and developed scenario. The worsening of the international microeconomic conditions and the growing shortage of resources have turned the attention and attempts of companies and individuals. Our strategic policies of oriented growth, controlled risk and outstanding efficiency, defined years ago, fairly continue sticking to global needs. Organic growth The decrease in losses and distribution defaults, along with the structures and processes reorganization in all the group’s companies have led to a focused action on quality, operational efficiency and better results. Such measures have become particularly necessary on the grounds that there will be the third cycle of tariff review at EDP Bandeirante in 2012, which will probably have a significant impact on the generation of cash. In 2011 we reached outstanding results by expanding the energy generation portfolio. Elebrás Cidreira I (Tramandaí) Wind Farm started operating and it supplies 70 MW of clean and renewable energy to the national electric system. We attended meetings at the regulatory institution to show that our Mascarenhas and Angical power plants’ operational conditions guaranteed generation above the one set in +9.5 MW and +46.8 MW, respectively. Thus, 55.3 MW were added to our generation capacity without the need to expand the plant. The biggest step taken in 2011 was the acquisition of the rights to explore the Santo Antônio do Jari (373 MW) Hydroelectric Power Plant, located on the border of Pará and Amapá states, which will be concluded in 2015. That transaction clearly shows the accomplishment of our guidelines to increase generation with controlled risk. Totally licensed, the project uses a renewable source and already has a long term contract to trade its energy. Although there were non-manageable facts that have negatively affected the construction of the Porto de Pecém I thermal power plant (delay in granting, strikes, severe weather conditions), the power plant is supposed to start operating in 2012. The growing decrease, in the last three months of 2011, in electric energy consumption at EDP Escelsa concession area and also among the industrial customers at EDP Bandeirante concession area, along with the work market “warming”, caused negative impact on the gross margin as well as on the operational results that, compared to the previous year, rose less than expected. 21 annual report 2011 António Pita de Abreu Chief Executive Officer 22 presentation The stock market has recognized we are a company with a consistent delivery history, which reflected a rise of 13.9% in the titles in 2011. In 2011, our net revenue amounted to R$5,401.7 with a rise of 7.3% compared to 2010, and the EBITDA reached R$1,537.6 million (an increase of 1.8%). The public offering of shares, in July 2011, allowed EDP Energias de Portugal to income R$810.7 million with the sale of share capital, besides increasing the liquidity of EDP Energias do Brasil titles. On December 11, 2011 our controller announced an agreement to sell 21.35% of its share capital to China Three Gorges International, a China Three Gorges (CTG) subsidiary – a Popular Republic of China state company. Looking ahead In 2011, we consolidated the concept of innovability into our businesses, by launching the first smart city project in Aparecida, São Paulo state. The initiative called Inovcity not only comprises cutting-edge technology for smart grids, but also prioritizes the community awareness of efficiency issues on energy consumption. Five pillars give support to the project: supplied microgeneration, electric mobility, public lighting, energy efficiency and social inclusion. The improvement of the population’s life quality and the optimization of energy resources are the main drivers of EDP Energias do Brasil actions. The capability of reinventing is a fundamental attribute to think about the future. Due to the development of a new energy model, it is of utmost importance to keep the focus on innovation in order to sustainably meet the growing needs of supplying energy to all the society. An environmental and social unbalanced society is not prone to have incomeable businesses. We will keep our path to increase generation and improve distribution performance, with respect to people and the environment. We will develop business models related to the electric sector new paradigms without neglecting the quality and security of the service delivered. We follow the Global Pact Principles in our actions. This way, we value aspects related to human rights, labor relations, environment and corruption combat certain that it is only possible to reach sustainable growth by acting ethically. As of the financial year 2012 on, EDP Energias do Brasil will start being run by Ana Maria Fernandes who was the chief-executive (CEO) of EDP Renováveis S.A. and has great experience in the energy sector, finance and investments areas. We wish the new CEO all the best. We are sure that she will lead our team and raise our corporate governance standards. With a fulfilling sensation of having accomplished our task to place EDP Energias do Brasil at higher levels of efficiency and growth we thank all –counsellors, directors, employees, customers, suppliers and other entities – for their extremely important participation in our results.

The main challenges are highlighted below: The energy consumption in the Brazilian electric system rose by 3.6% in 2011, with a total of 430.1 GWh (gigawatts-hour) a) Necessary changes to comply with Normative Resolution according to information from Energy Research Company (EPE). #367/2009, which has approved the Electric Sector Equity All classes presented increase, mainly the commercial (+6.3%) Control Manual; and residential (+4.6%) sectors. The industry grew less (+2.3%) b) Necessary changes to comply with the Normative Resolution in performance characterized by a differentiated dynamic #395/2009, which approved the Electric Energy Distribution among the country’s regions. Procedures for the National Electric System (Prodist); The commercial class consumption rates remained high, on c) Necessary changes to comply with the Normative Resolution average throughout the year, on the grounds that the sales were #396/2009, which established the Regulatory Accounting triggered by factors such as growing lower unemployment rates and approved the changes in the Electric Sector Accounting and families’ income. The commerce and services segments Manual, established by Aneel Resolution #444/2001. may continue growing above the other sectors – a trend that d) Compliance with the Normative Resolution #414/2010, which may remain in the next years due to the modernization of establishes the general conditions of electric energy supply, service sector and the good sales in retail business. by changing commercial processes, besides the installation of new service points, changes in billing procedures, According to EPE, the lowest growth in the residential segment is communication and customer service. justified mainly by climate issues such as low temperatures and early rain seasons. On top of that, even with the good scenario The EDP Energias do Brasil’s distribution companies operate with regulated tariffs and its results partly depend on regulatory for the work market, with historically low unemployment rates actions. Its respective concession contracts define the annual and the growing amount of earnings, the consumer took a adjustments, periodic tariff revision and the possibility of cautious attitude. extraordinary tariff revision. The industrial segment has different performance in different regions of the country. The greatest growth occurred in During the periodic tariff revision, Aneel determines the income demanded by the distributors so as to cover the Installments A the Center-west region, consequence of the beginning of and B. The costs of energy purchase for its consumer market, eletrointensive industry (iron-nickel) operation and rewarming of the costs of energy transport and sector charges are part of cold chambers’ activities and also the beginning of iron-nickel Installment A. Installment B is composed of capital costs (the industry activities in the North of the country. In the Southwest, remuneration, reintegration quota and operational costs). the expansion was limited to 1.9%. In the Northeast, there was a 2.9% retraction – consequence of the closing down of an The periodic tariff revision occurs every three years for EDP aluminium unit and the interruption of energy supply in the Escelsa and every four years for EDP Bandeirante. However, region in the beginning of the year. the income of those distributors may be impacted by inflation. Therefore, the annual tariff adjustment intends to offer the Three auctions took place in 2011. In August, the 12th New distributors the possibility of not having that inflation impact Energy Auction (A-3 of 2011) and the 4th Reserve Energy during the revision period.

On December 20th, the 13th New Energy Auction (A-5 of 2011) took In 2012, EDP Bandeirante will pass through its third tariff revision place in order to deliver energy in 2016. On that occasion, EDP cycle, because on October 23rd, 2011 (date of the contract) negotiated the sale of 55,6 average MW from four wind farms there were not methodology and definite procedures published located in Rio Grande do Norte. by Aneel. The tariffs were extended until the subsequent tariff 29 annual report 2011 social and economic value adjustment, approved by the publication of the Normative Farm (Tramandaí) in Rio Grande do Sul aggregated Resolution #433/2011 and the tariff revision process will 31.5 MW to the EDP Energias do Brasil generation happen according to the publication of the Normative portfolio (45% of the wind farm’s installed capacity). The Resolution #471/2011. recognition of the additional installed capacity of Peixe Angical Hydroelectric Plant and the repowering of the The new methodology impacts on Installment B, which third Mascarenhas Plant’s generator unit in June added, represents around 25% of the energy bill, refer to operational respectively, 46.8 MW and 8.5 MW to the generator farm costs and the distributors’ investments. Among the changes and enabled EDP to end 2011 with 1,827.9 MW of installed there is the extinction of the reference company (model of capacity. efficiency and productivity) and the application of operational costs, reduction of weighted average cost of capital In 2011, the company acquired the rights to explore the (regulatory WACC) and expansion of the items classified as Santo Antônio do Jari Hydroelectric Power Plant, located other revenues which are used for low tariffs. During the on the border of Pará and Amapá states, and, from 2015 Public Hearing #040/2010, EDP Energias do Brasil actively on, will add more 373 MW of installed capacity to the EDP participated in the discussions of new methodologies, in Energias do Brasil generator farm. However, the purchase order to contribute for the improvement of tariff revision of the Cabeça de Boi and Fazenda small hydroelectric methodology. At the same time, the company structured power plants announced in 2010 was not concluded, due internal actions to keep the economic stability of its to the lack of compliance with the transaction preceding distributors with efficiency in revenues and costs. EDP Escelsa conditions and the construction of Couto de Magalhães will pass through its third cycle in 2013. Hydroelectric Power Plant, located between Mato Grosso and Goiás states, is still under evaluation. In generation, the Administrative Rule MME #861/10 approved the physical guarantee revision calculation methodology The net energy generated from hydropower in 2011 for hydroelectric plants. Based on that new methodology, reached 7,873 GWh, an increase of 8% compared to the the Administrative Rule MME # 11 from May 19th of 2011 previous year, and the energy generated at the wind defined the increase of the Physical Guarantee of Peixe farms has reached 75.5 GWh this year. | GRI EU2 | Angical Hydroelectric plant in 9.5 MW average and of Mascarenhas Hydroelectric plant in 11.5 MW average.

Released in 2010, the EDP2020 Award Innovation and Entrepreneurship Award stimulates innovative projects in the Aparecida city was chosen because it presents the ideal energy sector, expanding technologies and clean energy features for the implementation of a pilot project like this solutions, intelligent networks, electric mobility, sustainable one. In technical terms, the city has all the necessary cities, among other aspects. The winner of each edition conditions to an easy energetic balance control, extremely receives an R$100,000 prize to put their idea into practice. important information for the project. In terms of scale, Aparecida has approximately 15 thousand customers, 78 will be able to transmit permissions to perform services at distance, for instance, cutting and reconnection of power supply as well as reading for billing. The energy efficiency will be organized through the donation of efficient bulbs to all low-voltage customers and the donation of 460 efficient refrigerators and 570 efficient showers to low-income customers who meet the criteria for classifying by the regulatory agency, the National Agency of Electric Energy (Aneel). In the same way, more than 200 public lamps using LED technology will be installed in order to evaluate performance and quality. Through such actions, it will be possible to reduce energy consumption and its consequent environmental impact. As regards electric mobility, 5 recharge spots for electric vehicles will also be installed and 19 electric vehicles (17 scooters and 2 bicycles) will be donated to be used by the Municipality, by the National Sanctuary and by the local Archdiocese. Thus, it will be possible to replace the use of combustion engine vehicles and eliminate the corresponding emission of the greenhouse gases. Anticipating another industry trend, photovoltaic solar panels will be also installed in selected places for testing the distributed generation and evaluate their impact on the energy distribution network. At last, there is a set of social actions, of environmental education and of professional training in order to present a compatible size with research and regulatory criteria the project and spread the concepts of energetic efficiency that also allows the implementation of a robust and and sustainability. These actions will be developed at comprehensive test, given the number of customers. elementary schools in the city as part of the EDP at Schools Project, receiving study sets, teaching material and In order to test various technologies to create a more training support material for the dissemination of energy efficient city, the project is structured in many energetic efficiency. different stages of implementation.

Our responsibility is to issue a limited assurance report on this information. Procedures of limited assurance The limited assurance procedures were performed in accordance with Rule NBC TO 3000, issued by the Brazilian Federal Accounting Council (CFC) and with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3000), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, both related to Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information. The procedures of limited assurance comprised: (a) the planning of the work, considering the importance, coherence, amount of quantitative and qualitative information and the operational and internal control systems that served as a base for the preparation of the annual sustainability report of EDP; (b) the understanding of the calculation methodology and the consolidation procedures of the performance indicators through interviews with the personnel responsible for the preparation of information; (c) the comparison, on a sample basis, of the quantitative and qualitative information with the information disclosed at the Annual Sustainability Report; and (d) the comparison of the financial indicators with the financial statements and/or accounting records. Reporting criteria The information contained in EDP´s Annual Sustainability Report, base year 2011, was prepared according to the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines (GRI-G3.1) for sustainability reporting and the AA 1000 APS (2008) principles. 144 Scope and limitations The objective of our work was to apply limited assurance procedures on the information disclosed in EDP´s Annual Sustainability Report, base year 2011, on profile items (disclosures that set the overall context for understanding organizational performance such as its strategy, profile, and governance), on management approach and on the sustainability performance indicators, not including the appropriateness of its policies, practices and sustainability performance. The applied procedures do not represent an examination in accordance with the audit rules for financial statements. In addition, we do not provide any assurance on the achievability of future information (such as targets, expectations and ambitions) nor on qualitative information that is under subjective evaluation. GRI-G3.1 Application Level According to the GRI-G3.1 guidelines, EDP declares an A+ Application Level for its Annual Sustainability Report, related to the year-end December 31 2011. EDP has reported the profile items, the core performance indicators and the indicators of the “Sustainability Reporting Guidelines & Electric Utility Sector Supplement – RG Version 3.0 / EUSS Final Version 2009”, as well as additional indicators that were considered material for its stakeholders. We have considered that the applied procedures were sufficient to agree with the application level declared by EDP in compliance with the GRI-G3.1 guidelines. Conclusion Based on the applied procedures, we have not identified any relevant modification that should be made on the information reported at EDP’s Annual Sustainability Report, related to the year-end December 31 2011, to agree with its compliance to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI-G3.1) guidelines and with the registries and files used for its preparation.
