The principles are a natural part of our everyday operations; it constitutes how we do business and it is integrated in our offer. Acting as a consultancy in sustainability, we are deeply committed to spreading knowledge and business strategies complying with the 10 principles. As for our own business, the aim is to report our commitment to corporate responsibility in a clear and transparent way. The following are our activities and performances reported in relation to the principles. Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Respect supports the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Respect supports the Human Rights, as stated in the United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We understand and respect the importance of supporting the Human Rights as a part of business behaviour. Respect will not, in any way, be complicit in actions violating the Human Rights in our operations, nor any of the applicable parts of the Swedish law. This also applies to partnership agreements and we encourage all our partners to respect and support the Human Rights. Our most important contribution is helping our clients to adapt their business to minimise risks of violating the Human Rights. We offer human rights related services as part of our services, e.g. Respect supports in visualising risks with Country Risk Assessments as a tool for managing and eliminating violation of human and labour rights in risk areas. In addition, Respect regularly holds seminars, trainings and workshops for business partners and customers, higher management as well as other members of the workforce, in order to help them to minimize the risks of violating of the Human Rights in their sphere of influence. No violations of the Human Rights, as stated by the UN, as a result of Respect’s operations, have been reported since the last COP.

Respect supports and honours the Global Compact’s principles on labour standards, follows the Swedish law on all applicable areas, and respects the labour standards set by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions on labour rights. All employees are free to form and join independent trade unions, and Respect will not in any way hinder arrangements in regards to meeting possibilities; rather offering support with practical assistance. Respect strongly condemns the use of forced or compulsory labour, as well as child labour. We do not accept such abuse as part of our operations, and actively engage in spreading information about the importance of the abolition of forced or compulsory labour and child labour. Respect’s management regularly arranges dialogues with co-workers, in order to be a flexible and self-critical organisation, ready to meet the needs of its most valuable resource: its employees. Equality, diversity, and gender equality are key values for Respect; in our daily operations, in regards to employment, and as part of our offering to clients. Spreading awareness and encouraging respect of labour rights is also part of Respect’s offering to clients. Respect contributes by conducting risk assessments, holding workshops and helping customers to develop companywide strategies for social responsibility. Respect is committed to spreading the value of the rights of the worker. Since the last COP, no reports of Respect being complicit in any violations to labour standards, as stated by the ILO, the UN or the Swedish law, have been reported.

Respect supports and follows the principles on environment set by the Global Compact. We are aware of our responsibility and environmental impact. We apply a pre-cautionary approach to environmental issues. We also respect and stay current with the Swedish laws on environmental issues. Environmental awareness is also vital to Respect when it comes to suppliers and partners. The majority of Respect’s employees use public transport alternatively walk or cycle to work. Our travel policy urges employees to go by train on business trips, if other transportation is not highly motivated by price or distance. We encourage and assist our customers and business partners to reduce their climate impact generated from their operations. Respect also offers clients consulting in decreasing impact, and has developed an online tool for climate impact assessment – www.svante.se. Furthermore, we encourage companies to become climate neutral – minimize climate impact through different measures and offset the remaining greenhouse gas emissions by supporting projects, mainly in Least Developed Countries (LDCs); via CDM-projects or credible VER-projects. We consider it self-evident to measure and reduce our own climate impact. Last year (2011) the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions generated from Respect operations were 18.56 tonnes CO2e, 1.97 tonnes CO2e per employee. In order to neutralise climate impact from business operations, Respect offset the remaining emissions generated in 2011 via buying credits from Kikonda Forest Reserve; a reforestation/afforestation project in Uganda. The project is certified by the CCBS, meaning it has a broad sustainability focus aiming at strengthening the local community and providing social and environmental benefits. For Respect’s calculations, we have chosen to include the whole of scope 1 and 2, plus the parts of scope 3 we are able to calculate and influence (i.e. business trips, commuting to and from work, paper use, energy carriers etc.), from the GHG Protocol. We have a wide client base that we support with environmental services. We continuously assist to decrease their impact on the environment and the climate, e.g. through carbon accounting, carbon offsetting, environmental strategies and strategy implementation, reviews of environmental impact, sustainability reporting according to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and more. Respect also remains Silver Partner of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), assisting companies with their reporting as well as strengthening their measures, and adapting new strategies, to combat and tackle climate change. There have been no reports on Respect violating any laws or regulations regarding the environment since the last COP.
