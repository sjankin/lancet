A new reality The lack of progress at the COP17 in Durban and the ongoing discussions around a carbon tax for shipping could give the impression that regulations are far off and unclear. The reality is quite the opposite. 2010 saw the introduction of new fuel mandates requiring the use of extra low sulphur fuel while in any EU port, and while sailing in the North Sea and Baltic ECA zones. Effective August 2012, the IMO has also officially designated waters off North American coasts as an area in which stringent international emissions standards will apply for ships. These will reduce air pollution, but also increase fuel costs significantly for all vessels. Staying one step ahead of environmental regulations, WWL has been actively working to cut emissions and fuel consumption through investments in vessel design and technology. This will contribute to mitigating some of the increases in fuel costs, but to go further we need to work closer together with customers and partners to adjust to this new reality. Only together can we develop the game changers that will have real impact on supply chain efficiency. Arild B. Iversen, CEO Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics …the best way to reduce environmental risk and cost is to be an environmental forerunner. Delivering Results As a forerunner, we believe in setting goals, tracking performance and delivering results. Reducing emissions from our ocean fleet is the single greatest way to improve our environmental performance. To achieve this, we operate our vessels with low-sulphur fuel at sea and use fuel with lesser sulphur content for auxiliary engines at berth. Our new buildings and retrofits focus on more fuel-efficient design and equipment that reduces environmental impacts. As of 2011, 14% of vessels in our fleet have been equipped with Ballast Water treatment systems ahead of pending regulations.
