John Easden Chairman 2. Actions and Outcomes 2.1 Human Rights Principles 2.1.1 Policy and Goals Our values are based on treating all our stakeholders with respect and integrity; irrespective of whether they are a client, an employee, or members of the public we may come into contact with, all bring value to our organisation. Our employees and agents are at the heart of our business and we actively promote an environment of open communication, continuous personal development and self-improvement. We encourage teamwork and innovation and endeavour to recognise and reward each individual’s contribution to our business. In all our activities we recognise our responsibility to respect the rights of those members of the public we come into contact with. We have a particular focus on effective communication and negotiation and providing information and advice in areas such as legal rights and, where appropriate, health and safety considerations. Our Corporate Social Responsibility Policy is issued to all staff and includes the UN Global Compact’s ten principles and our staff handbook includes policies focussing on Equal Opportunities, Flexible working, Parental leave, work life balance and Anti-harassment. 2.1.2 Implementation Within the last twelve months Face2Face has appointed a full time Human Resources Manager and a Head of Compliance who is responsible for the following areas: CSR 001 28/06/2012 Company Confidential Page 3 of 7 Corporate Social Responsibility Communication on Progress • Corporate Social Responsibility • Occupational Health and Safety • Environmental Management • Quality Management • Complaint Management The Head of Compliance ensures that all policies and procedures are communicated throughout the organisation, maintains our accreditations and in conjunction with the HR Manager focusses on the health and welfare of all staff and a recently revised staff handbook has been made available to all employees. Staff are involved in all aspects of Health, Safety and Environment issues through our recently formed committee. 2.1.3 Measurement As part of our commitment to ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 we have introduced various measurement activities which include: • Staff absence recording – number of days and reasons for absence • Exit Interviewing • Personal Development Programmes • Incident and Near Miss Reporting 2.2 Labour Principles 2.2.1 Policy and Goals The relevance to Face2Face predominantly revolves around recruitment where discrimination could occur and the Health and Safety of all employees. We have a transparent recruitment process with a policy to give priority to internal recruitment. Before any job is advertised a job description is made available to all applicants and they are given the opportunity to discuss the position with their head of department or HR Manager. All applicants, if they so desire, are given guidance on interview techniques. Any external recruitment is carried out by the HR Manager and Head of Department and all applicants are required to present evidence as to their suitability for the role, any additional documentation required by law and any further details as required by our clients. The Health and Safety of our employees is of paramount importance to us, hence our OHSAS 18001, it is our aim to eliminate all risks and provide information and support on all matters relating to the overall welfare of our staff. CSR 001 28/06/2012 Company Confidential Page 4 of 7 Corporate Social Responsibility Communication on Progress 2.2.2 Implementation All new employees are given a full induction when joining the company which includes all policies and procedures relating to Health and Safety, Grievance Procedures, Antiharassment, Recruitment etc., . A copy of the staff handbook which details all company policies is also made available and any changes to the handbook are communicated to all employees. The Head of Compliance in conjunction with the HR Manager is responsible for ensuring the protection of labour rights within the organisation; however the overall concept is embedded throughout the organisation. Health and Safety risk assessments have been carried out and guides have been given to all employees informing them of the steps that have been taken to ensure their safety and the things that they can do for themselves. Personal Protective Equipment has been provided in some cases. 2.2.3 Measurement • All recruitment information is controlled by the HR Department and relevant statistics (gender, ethnicity, age, etc.) are provided to management as required. • Data has been collected during the past 12 months which details the competencies, qualifications and skills of existing employees these are used to identify any ‘gaps’ in training requirements. • Near miss and incident reporting • Accident recording • Audits as per ISO conformance 2.3 Environmental Principles 2.3.1 Policy and Goals We are committed to good environmental practice as part of our overall approach to Corporate Responsibility and we recognise our responsibility to minimise our environmental impacts where practicable. With the accreditation of ISO 14001 we have identified our environmental aspects and impacts and our goal is to reduce our impacts Our most significant impacts on the environment are from: • The energy we use at our offices for lighting, cooling and power; • The materials we use in our operations, particularly paper and other stationery; and • The waste materials that we dispose of. We aim to: CSR 001 28/06/2012 Company Confidential Page 5 of 7 Corporate Social Responsibility Communication on Progress • Establish and maintain comprehensive environmental management systems • Ensure that we comply with environmental legislation, regulations and other applicable requirements; • Continue to improve our performance against our specific targets for managing our environmental impacts and • Continue to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of their respective responsibilities in relation to the Company’s Environmental Management System 2.3.2 Implementation Within our Environmental Management System (EMS) ISO 14001, we have a policy which all employees are bound to comply with and we have set ourselves targets to reduce our impact on the environment, these have been set at company level and at operational level. Some of our targets include: • Increasing the amount of recycling • Implementing an environmental purchasing policy e.g. purchasing FSC paper products. • Changing our energy supplier to that of a renewable energy supplier • Introducing new technology to reduce paper consumption • Reducing the amount of printing Procedures and work instructions are in place within the EMS which ensure that we comply with any legal requirements and to assist us in achieving our objectives. The Head of Compliance has overall responsibility for the EMS but the whole ethos is embedded throughout the organisation. 2.3.3 Measurement The Head of Compliance has a responsibility to report to management on a quarterly basis on the progress of the EMS and present findings from audits in addition to statistical information as follows: • Paper usage • Waste/recycling activity • Energy usage 2.4 Anti-corruption principles 2.4.1 Policy and Goals Face2Face has completed an assessment and identified the following risks for the business: CSR 001 28/06/2012 Company Confidential Page 6 of 7 Corporate Social Responsibility Communication on Progress • Inducement by suppliers • Inducement by clients • Client entertainment • Customer entertainment • Employee activity The basis for our documentation is derived from The Bribery Act 2010 and a policy has been issued to all members of staff which details the implications of the act and how it can impact on them in the normal course of their duties. 2.4.2 Implementation Procedures and policies implemented as a result of the act include, Receipt of Gifts and Code of Conduct and ethics which include detail on improper remuneration and procedures for entertainment. A procedure is also in place for Client hospitality which includes Directors approval for costs incurred. As part of the company’s commitment to Quality Management our policy and procedures are audited and reviewed and a system is in place for documenting all gifts and hospitality. Responsibility for anti-corruption and bribery lies with the Managing Director but all employees are trained in how to handle any situation which they might find themselves in. 2.4.3 Measurement Our current measure for corruption is based on the Managing Directors perception according to the information provided by his managers, staff and owners. Any area highlighted for further investigation would be delegated to the Head of Compliance or any other body necessary for full audit and reporting. Our robust recruitment process also includes proof of citizenship and credit scoring which can theoretically reduce our exposure to risk of corruption.
