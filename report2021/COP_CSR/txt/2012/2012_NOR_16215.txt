That was the background for one of the goals for 2011, i.e. to evaluate and revise the strategy and goal “The main focus addresses processes related to CSR. The work has been based on global megatrends and the opportunities and risk challenges facing the Earth with a view to climatic change for KONGSBERG and shortages of central resources such as energy, food in this perspective.” safety, access to clean water, the loss of biological diversity, etc. The main focus addresses opportunities and risks for KONGSBERG in this perspective. Technological innovation will be a key element for resolving the major global challenges facing the Earth. There are significant business opportunities inherent in a large number of markets. We believe that KONGSBERG has the expertise to play a part in many of these areas. The megatrends also represent substantial risk. These megatrends already have an impact on individuals, companies and states, and their influence will no doubt loom larger in the years ahead. It will be important for KONGSBERG to ensure the acceptance of our stakeholders to operate and further develop the business activities that we have today (‘licence to operate’). Among other things, this means that we must continue and intensify our efforts related to anti-corruption, human rights, workers’ rights and climate and the environment.

Other dilemmas are that weapons are not supposed to cause undue harm, especially to civilians, and ensuring that one of the Group’s products is not used wrongly or does not fall into the wrong hands. We are aware of the special responsibility incumbent upon us as a defence manufacturer. KONGSBERG respects that some people are critical of Norway having a defence, a defence industry and alliance-related obligations. There is, however, broad political consensus on this policy.

(“the Report”). The Report is the responsibility of and has been approved by the management of the Company. Our responsibility is to draw a conclusion based on our review. We have based our work on the international standard ISAE 3000 “Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The objective and scope of the engagement were agreed with the management of the Company and included the subject matters on which we provide our conclusion below. Based on an assessment of materiality and risks, our work included analytical procedures and interviews as well as a review on a sample basis of evidence supporting the subject matters. We have performed interviews of the managers responsible for sustainability aspects at corporate and selected reporting units represented by Kongsberg Defence Systems – Arsenalet, Kongsberg (Norway) and the units Kongsberg Satellite Services AS and Kongsberg Spacetec AS in Tromsø (Norway). We believe that our work provides an appropriate basis for us to provide a conclusion with a limited level of assurance on the subject matters. In such an engagement, less assurance is obtained than would be the case had an audit-level engagement been performed. Conclusions In conclusion, in all material respects, nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to believe that: • Kongsberg Gruppen has applied procedures to collect, compile and validate sustainability data for 2011 from its reporting units to be included in the Report, as summarised on page 3, and data presented for 2011 is consistent with data accumulated as a result of these procedures and appropriately presented in the Report. • Data reported for 2011 from the reporting units visited, as specified above, has been reported according to the procedures noted above and is consistent with source documentation presented to us. • Information about activities related to corporate social and environmental responsibility, presented on page 18, appropriately reflects performance related to the objectives for 2011. • Kongsberg Gruppen applies a reporting practice for its sustainability reporting that is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines reporting principles and the reporting fulfils Application Level B+ according to the GRI guidelines. The GRI Index presented on pages 42 – 44, appropriately reflects where relevant information on each of the elements and performance indicators of the GRI guidelines is presented. The Company’s reporting on UN Global Compact is consistent with the description on page 3 and the UN Global Compact table presented on page 20 appropriately reflects where relevant information on each of the UN Global Compact principles is presented in the Report.
