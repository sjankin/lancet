In 2007 Kjaer Group A/S further confirmed our support for a cleaner environment by joining UN’s environmental initiative, Caring for the Climate. The UN’s principles for sustainability (the UN Global Compact) are an important point of reference for all activities and are incorporated in the company’s governance framework: The Kjaer Group Way of Management (KWOM). The Kjaer Group Way of Management was introduced in 2008, and hereby also the principles of the “Triple Bottom Line” whereby social and environmental targets and results are pursued in the same way as financial targets. In 2011, our main focus was to finalize the Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) policies in all entities, which was done in cooperation with external consultants. The next important step is the implementation of international standards for subsequent certification of business critical areas. Thus, on behalf of Kjaer Group’s 300 employees, I reaffirm our commitment to compliance with the 10 Principles of the Global Compact. I hope you will find this Communication on Progress informative and I invite you to view the Kjaer Group website www.kjaergroup.com and our Annual Report 2011. Per S.
