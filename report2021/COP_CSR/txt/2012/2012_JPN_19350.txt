Based on Michihiro Kitazawa our commitment of leading to a responsible and susPresident and Representative Director tainable society through our pursuit of innovation in Fuji Electric Co., Ltd. 12 Special Feature Manufacturing Techniques Contributing to Eco-Friendliness throughout Product Lifecycles —Design, Procurement, and Production of Inverters Embodied in Fuji Electric’s Corporate Philosophy is our pledge to continue to be an eco-friendly company comprised of responsible corporate citizens in a global society. By accomplishing this goal, we hope to contribute to environmental preservation through the lifecycles of our various products. In this special feature, we will present some of the initiatives being introduced throughout the lifecycle of our mainstay inverter products, which are a key component for realizing energy savings in industrial fields. Design Pursing Longer-Lasting, More-Durable Products Inverters are combined with motors and are widely used in industrial and social infrastructure, including air conditioner fans, water circulating pumps, cranes, and elevators. By adjusting motor output and optimizing rotation frequency according to use, inverters are able to contribute to energy savings. The Company’s inverter design and development divisions are pursuing energy savings and working to extend product lifespan with the aim of reducing the environmental impact of these products. Extending product lifespan is a particularly important theme to be addressed as a part of the product’s lifecycle due to the contributions that longer-lasting products can make to effective resource utilization. In addition to increasing lifespan, we are also designing and developing inverters to be more durable, as they are central components in a variety of equipment and machinery and must be used continuously over long periods of time. Design and development efforts in the pursuit of energy savings and extended product lifespans 13 Special Feature: Manufacturing Techniques Contributing to Eco-Friendliness throughout Product Lifecycles Doubling Product Lifespans to Reduce Resource Usage The Japan Electrical Manufacturers’ Association (JEMA) has not formulated standards for inverter lifespan. Rather, the Company has established its own product lifecycle standards, based on which it targets lifespans of 15 years. These standards were established with the aim of enabling customers to use our products with peace of mind for as long as possible. For inverter components that must be replaced, such as condensers and cooling fans*, we take a number of steps to ensure that these components are also long-lasting. Carefully reevaluating each step of the manufacturing processes for these components, we stringently select materials, revise the designs of printed wiring boards (PWBs), and improve soldering equipment. Through these efforts, we have successful developed components with lifespans of approximately 10 years, whereas their predecessors only lasted 5 years. These longer-lasting components help reduce resource usage as well as free customers from the hassle of frequent replacements. In our constant quest to improve the durability of Fuji Electric inverters, we test them under high-temperature and high-humidity environments, while frequently stopping and starting testing apparatuses. We feel that these testings are a necessary step in ensuring satisfactory levels of durability. Furthermore, the Company aims to reduce the environmental impact of its inverters when they are disposed of. To this end, coordination with quality assurance and procurement divisions is pursued to develop product designs that do not contain hazardous substances, and are compliant with the European Union’s Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive and other environmental regulations. In these ways, we are targeting environmental impact reductions throughout the lifecycle of our products and remain conscientious of this goal throughout our design and development activities. * The standard replacement term is five years for condensers used in inverters and two to three years for cooling fans. VOICE Equating Long Lifespans with Quality in Product Designs Were an inverter to cease functioning due to one of its components wearing out, it could bring a factory’s production line to a halt. For this reason, long lifespans are incredibly important for inverter components. In particular, condensers are critical to the durability of our inverters as they play an important role in filtering electrical interference. Bearing this in mind, we have compared the condensers of various manufacturers, inspecting their materials as well. For use in our inverters, we have selected those condensers that, through these comparisons, proved to be exceptionally heat resistant and capable of handling significant loads while also matching the operating conditions of all Fuji Electric inverters. (Left) Temperatures surrounding inverters greatly affect lifespan, thus making Yuhei Suzuki cooling fans vital to longevity. Therefore, we selected optimal fans based on Standard Drive Development Section the results of airflow simulations conducted from various angles, and have Development Department also redesigned the structure of our inverters to increase the cooling effect (Right) gained from fans. Takanori Shintani Due to such improvements, the inverters we currently sell have lifespans Global Drive Development Section Development Department as long as 10 years. Going forward, we will continue to target higher levels of customer satisfaction by developing inverter designs that equate long lifespans with quality. 14 Procurement Compiling Databases of Chemical Substances Contained in Components Inverters are created by assembling over 500 different components, including fan motors, cooling units, electric components, power semiconductors (insulated gate bipolar transistor modules (IGBTs)), and plastic cases. In making its inverters, the Company procures a number of these components from other manufacturers. The procurement division of the Suzuka Factory in Japan, where the Company’s inverters are produced, selects suppliers based on the Fuji Electric Green Procurement Guideline*, which set standards for procuring components with low environmental impact. The division also carefully manages each component to ensure that they do not contain any substances prohibited by these standards. In this way, we are reducing environmental impacts across the entire supply chain. Specifically, we require suppliers to submit a certificate showing that prohibited substances are not used or contained in their products. Furthermore, Fuji Electric compiles databases on the chemical substances contained in the various components it uses, and shares this information throughout the Company. This information sharing enables the Company to reduce the burden of conducting environmental impact studies relating to itself and its suppliers. Moreover, with the aim of promoting compliance with environmental regulations, we periodically hold explanatory forums for suppliers to verse them on the Company’s procurement policies. Fuji Electric conducts annual environmental audits investigating manufacturing subcontractors to ensure that they adhere to our procurement policies. As part of this process, we visit the factories of subcontractors to ensure that they are taking care to manage and prevent usage of prohibited substances. If any issues are detected, we promptly instruct the concerned party to implement improvements. * This material procurement guideline outlines standards for evaluating suppliers based on three areas: measures for environmental preservation, measures for construction of management systems for chemical substances contained in products, and measures for content of chemical substances for supplied Suppliers were called to the Suzuka Factory materials. to discuss means of reducing component numbers VOICE Sharing a Spirit of Environmental Preservation My company is a press and sheet metal processing company founded in 1971. In an effort to reduce the environmental footprint of the surrounding community and contribute to environmental preservation, we have acquired ISO 14001 certification and have also established environmental goals. Our efforts toward meetings these goals are accelerating every year. We supply Fuji Electric’s Suzuka Factory with sheet metal and pressed products for use in inverters and motors. The factory orders components from us when they are needed, and we deliver these using the “milk run” method. As we receive orders on a daily basis, production volumes are stable and we are able to keep our inventories low. Masahiko Maeda We share a mutual goal of environmental preservation with Fuji Electric, and are President working together to implement initiatives that help protect the environment. Maeda Technica Co., Ltd. 15 Special Feature: Manufacturing Techniques Contributing to Eco-Friendliness throughout Product Lifecycles Reducing CO2 Emissions through the “Milk Run” Method Procurement divisions are working to reduce CO2 emissions associated with the transportations of products. One way we are realizing such reductions is through a logistics method known as the “milk run” method. In this method, one large-scale truck collects components from various different suppliers. We have operated one such route since fiscal 2010. Previously, deliveries along this route entailed several trucks making roundtrips between the Company’s factory and one of six component manufacturers. However, we now use only one large-scale truck to collect deliveries from all six manufacturers. This has resulted in annual CO2 emissions reductions of 4.5 tons. Further, Wuxi Fuji Electric FA Co., Ltd., a subsidiary located in China that manufactures inverters, is actively procuring components locally. By purchasing components from local manufacturers rather than have them delivered from Japan, the Company is reducing the CO2 emitted when transporting these components. This company procures approximately 80% of components locally, with the principle exception being the core IGBTs that are produced by Fuji Electric’s Matsumoto Factory in Japan. Logistics truck on a “milk run” VOICE Promoting Indispensable Cooperation with Partner Companies In procurement divisions, our efforts to reduce environmental impacts can be divided into two main categories: selecting eco-friendly components and reducing logistics-related CO2 emissions. For the former, we work in close coordination with design and development divisions to ensure that they consider environmental impact reduction when selecting components to be used in drawing up designs. For the latter, we are considering expanding the scope of the logistics initiative (Left) involving the “milk run” method that was implemented in fiscal 2010, Tatsuya Suzuki Inverter and Servo System Design Section as this initiative has proven to be highly effective. Also, Wuxi Fuji Design Department Electric is increasing the amount of components it procures locally. Cooperation with partner companies is absolutely essential to the (Right) Hiroshi Furuichi success of such efforts by procurement divisions. Going forward, we Purchasing Section will continue to work together with suppliers and subcontractors as Purchasing Department we vigorously pursue improved product quality and environmental preservation. 16 Production Reforming Production Processes to Minimize Chemical Use At Fuji Electric factories, we are striving to develop manufacturing processes that not only guarantee the high levels of quality and functionality that customers expect but that are also eco-friendly. To this end, we are implementing ongoing improvements throughout all areas of production sites. These include the development of new production technologies that reduce resource usage and waste production during manufacturing and the introduction of production facilities that improve electricity and fuel efficiency. Inverter production begins with the creation of circuit boards. In mounting IGBTs, condensers, and other electronic components to these boards, chemicals such as solder, flux, and cleaning agents are used. In order to minimize the use of these chemicals, we analyze production line processes while sending boards down the line at different angles and speeds and measuring the chemical usage and remaining stock volumes. This information is applied to the development of production processes that use lower volumes of chemicals. Furthermore, we aim to prevent over usage of chemicals or unnecessary release into the atmosphere stemming from deterioration or malfunction of production equipment. In this pursuit, we utilize data collected by analyzing each piece of equipment to inspect and improve facilities, while also preventing waste. Going forward, we plan to begin production of circuit boards at our production bases in China. To reduce the environmental footprint of our overseas production bases, we will implement the chemical-reduction initiatives that we have put in place in Japan. Circuit board production equipment VOICE Achieving Both Improved Productivity and Lower Environment Impact With the aim of making our manufacturing operations eco-friendly, we have continued to inspect various production facilities used for soldering processes in search of ones that required lower volumes of chemicals. Based on these inspections, we chose to introduce tabletop selective soldering system to replace the previously used inclined wave soldering system. Previously used facilities enabled solder to be applied to several electronic components at once by submersing them in a solder basin. However, this required flux—a substance used to facilitate this process—to be applied to the entire board, thus resultYasuhiro Shiramizu ing in wasted chemicals. Furthermore, this process requires the use of large amounts Manufacturing Engineering Section Manufacturing Department of nitrogen, as it is effective in limiting the oxidation of solder. The introduction of the selective soldering system has enabled us to realize substantial reductions in flux and nitrogen, with flux usage down 97% and nitrogen usage down 94%. In this manner, we believe that ideas for reducing chemical usage are often inspired by daily productivity improvement efforts. In the future, we will continue to pursue greater reductions in environmental impact through such straightforward and diligent efforts. 17 7 Special Feature: Manufacturing Techniques Contributing to Eco-Friendliness throughout Product Lifecycles Reevaluating Production Facilities to Reduce Energy Usage When replacing or introducing new production facilities, we make sure to select those that feature low energy usage. In fiscal 2011, we confirmed the energy usage levels of all our production facilities. This was a move inspired by the significant pressure that was placed on the supply and demand balance for electricity at the time, a result of the Great East Japan Earthquake which occurred in March 2011. Production lines for circuit boards must be equipped with means of preventing the accumulation of static electricity by controlling levels of humidity. The steam-based humidifiers that were used previously successfully raised humidity levels, but a large amount of electricity was required for heating the water this equipment used. For this reason, we decided to switch to more energy-efficient equipment. Dry fog humidifiers, which do not require heating, were judged to be capable of maintaining sufficient levels of humidity for the operation of circuit board production lines, and their introduction helped realize substantial levels of energy consumption reduction, reducing energy usage by 97% when compared to previous facilities and leading to a year-on-year decrease of 47 tons in CO2 emissions. We have also implemented other measures to reduce our environmental impact through lower electricity and fuel usage, including introducing LED lighting and electric forklifts. Humidity-adjusting dry fog Lowering CO2 Emissions at IGBT Production Bases The IGBT power semiconductor modules mounted on highly efficient manner, enabling these systems to realcircuit boards are a core element of inverters as they ize generation efficiency of closer to 80%. Since 2002, optimize electricity control for the entire device.

To reduce its environmental footprint while still meeting this substantial electricity demand, the Matsumoto Factory has introduced cogeneration systems. Cogeneration systems are a type of in-house generator that utilizes city gas as a fuel source to generate electricity and heat energy. The generation efficiency (ratio of energy used in generation that is converted into electricity) of a standard generator is around 40%. CoCogeneration generation systems, however, utilize exhaust heat in a System Unit 3 18 Segment Overview Subsegment / Main Products New Segments for Developing Energy-Related Businesses Power and Social Infrastructure Striving to create a system for developing energy-related Power Thermal / Geothermal / businesses utilizing energy technologies based on electricity Generation Hydraulic power generation Nuclear power-related equipment and thermal energy, Fuji Electric changed its segments in Social Energy management systems April 2012.

To better respond to the demand this will create, we are strengthening the human side of operations by bolstering local sales staff and promoting local employees to management positions, while also taking steps to develop an integrated production system that allows for variChina ous aspects of operations—ranging from product development to production—to be conducted locally. In this market, our business expansion efforts will be centered on our four principal sales bases—located in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, and Chengdu—through which we will develop inverter, power semiconductor, ED&C component, and measuring instruments and equipment operations targeting the market for energysaving measures. As one facet of these efforts, we will work to further expand our sales network by increasing the number of sales distributors, while approaching new customers through collaboration with local companies. In addition, we will implement customer service improvement initiatives, such as offering technical engineering training to distributors. In other regions of Asia, internal demand is expected to rise and there will most likely be demand increases associated with reconstruction efforts following the Thailand floods. Amidst these rises, our main targets will be Indonesia and other ASEAN markets in which investment in social and industrial infrastructure has begun to accelerate. In these markets, we will pursue the expansion of businesses related to inverters, Asia UPSs, and plants and systems for thermal and geothermal power generation projects and manufacturers like and Others steelmakers. The expansion of our sales network is also being targeted, and we increased the number of branches of our Indian sales and marketing company and also established sales companies and bases in Vietnam, Myanmar, and Cambodia. At the same time, we enhanced the ability of overseas bases to respond appropriately to demand by bolstering staff and strengthening engineering functions. In Europe, we will target business growth by introducing new power semiconductor and inverter products and expanding sales distributor networks in regions where demand in the markets for new energy and energy-saving measures is expected to increase. For power semiconductors, we will push forward with R&D initiatives geared toward creating products for Europe responding to the demand for high-capacity products for wind power generation and other systems. These initiatives will be principally conducted at the technical center established in Frankfurt, Germany. In regard to inverters, target markets include air conditioning and water treatment systems, cranes, and elevators. Targeting these markets, we will bolster local sales engineer staff and accelerate efforts to promote acceptance of our specifications. As we forecast increased development of infrastructure for renewable energy, we will endeavor to strengthen our responsiveness to local demand for power plants as well as our engineering systems in these fields. In April 2012, Fuji Electric approved plans to conduct capital participation in Hudson Ranch Power II LLC, which will conduct a geothermal power generation project in California in the United States. An investment The Americas agreement entailing the acquisition of a 10% stake in the Company was subsequently concluded. Moving forward, we will advance measures in preparation for the commencement of operations at this project in 2015, while also acquiring additional orders for geothermal power. We will also expand sales of Quick Chargers in the EV market, which is projected to see demand growth into the future. Going forward, we are planning the establishment of a sales base in Brazil. Leveraging this base, we will work to develop businesses relating to growth markets in Central and South America by entering into markets for inverters, power semiconductors, and industrial plants and systems, and developing new products for these markets. 27 Manufacturing FY2011 Major Initiatives Production in the vending machine business had previthat contains development, production, and sales funcManufacturing ously been conducted by two bases: the Mie Factory and tions.

Aiming to meet this demand, the Company developed a silicon semiconductor detector that features greatly improved radiation sensitivity and a dosimeter that employs this detector. This dosimeter can simultaneously measure accumulative exposure over a given period of time and rates of exposure over specific increments of time. This convenient portable device is the first dosimeter in Japan to feature such functionality. We also developed a system for measuring radiation in food. By placing this easy-to-use system in cardboard boxes or other packaging together with food, it enables the food’s exposure to radiation to be monitored continuously. It can also determine whether or not food items are below the mandated exposure limits in only 12 seconds. 29 Japan’s First* SiC-SBD Device-Equipped Industrial Inverter Demand for industrial inverters is rising around the world due to higher concern for energy Research and Development consumption reduction. In light of this, Fuji Electric has developed an industrial inverter equipped with a SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD). This is the first SiC device-equipped industrial inverter in Japan to contain such a diode, and it is able to reduce electricity consumption by over 20% in comparison with preceding Fuji Electric products that employ silicon components. * As of April 2011, based on Company data Power Conditioners for Mega Solar Power Generation Systems Featuring World-Leading Efficiency*—The PVI Series Plans to develop large-scale solar power generation facilities are in progress around the world, as these so-called mega solar power generation systems are a viable source of renewable energy. To assist these efforts, the Company developed a series of power conditioners that feature superior efficiency and high capacities, perfect for use in mega solar power generation systems. As one conditioner in this series can realize capacity of 1,000 kW, systems can be constructed using fewer conditioners. Furthermore, by employing Fuji Electric’s 3-level converters, which utilize proprietary technologies, these power conditioners are able to operate with world-leading efficiency—98.5%—and minimal energy loss. By packaging these items with components that provide basic functions, such as switchgears and transformers, we have also succeeded in reducing installation and assembly times. * As of April 2012, based on Company data FRENIC-HVAC and FRENIC-AQUA Inverters for Use in Air Conditioning and Water Treatment Systems In Asian countries experiencing significant growth, such as India and the ASEAN nations, power supply cannot keep up with the expansion of air conditioning and water treatment infrastructure, so efforts to save energy through inverter control of fans and pumps are progressing rapidly. The Company has developed inverters for use in air conditioning and water treatment systems that are resistant to both dust and water and come standard equipped with specialized functionality. A slim design allows the units to be mounted against a wall, like mainstream products sold in Asian and European markets. Moreover, the standard features of these units include a number of functions vital to the operation of fans and pumps in air conditioning equipment and water supply and drainage facilities, such as input interface for temperature sensors and controllers. Super J-MOS Series of MOSFETs that Realizes Industry-Leading Levels of Loss Reduction Initiatives to become more environmentally friendly in the fields of IT and new energy, among others, are focusing attention on power semiconductors with efficient power conversion. Among the principal devices used for power conversion in semiconductors are metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). Fuji Electric has successfully developed the Super J-MOS series of MOSFETs featuring industry-leading levels of loss reduction as well as its newly developed superjunction (SJ) structure, which achieves low on-resistance performance. These devices realize a 14% reduction in electricity usage when compared to conventional Fuji Electric products. Ultra-Energy-Efficient Vending Machines Equipped with Hybrid Heat Pumps Vending machines have been installed in various locations due to the convenience they provide in allowing people to purchase beverages and other items with ease. However, as the drive for electricity saving gains momentum, there has been a rising need to reduce the amount of energy used by these machines. In light of this trend, we have developed ultra-energy-efficient vending machines that employ a hybrid heat pump and a new cooling system. The heat pump is used to cycle heat between the machine and the atmosphere while the cooling system optimally controls the flow of coolant in response to temperature changes. Compared to vending machines released by Fuji Electric in fiscal 2011, these new machines realize a 40% reduction in electricity consumption. 30 T O P I C S Development of All-SiC Modules for Power Semiconductors and Power Conditioners for the Next Era of Energy Savings Power semiconductors contribute to energy savings in a wide range of equipment, including industrial robots, data center servers, HEVs, and solar and wind power generation systems. These components also help make equipment smaller and lighter. For use in such power semiconductors, Fuji Electric has developed modules that are made entirely of SiC modules and that can realize reductions in electricity consumption and size much greater than those achievable using conventional silicon modules. We have also developed power conditioners that employ these all-SiC modules. Unique Package Construction that Amplifies Electricity Use and Size Reduction Through the Strengths of SiC All-SiC Modules SiC features superior heat resistance and durability.

At the same time, we are aggressively pursuing efforts to reduce the environmental impact of our production activities, which form the base of these initiatives. Fuji Electric has established and is constantly improving its environmental management system to promote this sort of environmental management. We have created an environmental protection system, set and are working toward environmental targets, and are reinforcing our internal audits. Simultaneously, we are striving to enhance the environmental awareness of each employee.

PRIMARY INITIATIVES Promoting Efforts to Make Electrical Power Use Visible and Conserve Energy At the Otawara Factory, we installed the F-MPC System—a power monitoring system made by Fuji Electric—to promote energy conservation and ensure that our use of electricity remained within our contracted amount, with full-fledged operations commencing in fiscal 2011. This system makes electricity use visible at 150 measurement points on production equipment and lines throughout the factory. Its use led us to completely reconsider the need for air conditioning and lighting equipment, particularly at night or on holidays, thereby lowering power consumption. Consequently, we succeeded in reducing the equivalent of 50 F-MPC System tons of CO2 per year. 43 Environmental Report Contributing to Reduced CO2 Emissions through Products Fuji Electric evaluates the degree of product environmental t Products that are contribution and eco-friendliness on a companywide plateco-friendly and are superior in their form.

This indicates that using products we sold in fiscal 2011 for a one-year period would contribute to a 772,000-ton reduction in CO2 emissions. Products Eco-Product Definitions Products that have a reduced environmental impact over the entire product lifecycle, from the use of raw materials, the procurement and production of Eco-Friendly Products components, and through distribution, use, disposal, and recycling UPSs, vending machines, IGBT modules, etc. Products that contribute to environmental preservation during use Environmental Geothermal power generation systems, energy monitoring equipment, Contribution Products inverters, etc. SUPER ECO-PRODUCTS Industrial Fuel Cells Contributing to Reduction in CO2 Emissions Fuel cells supply clean energy. As they use oxygen and hydrogen to generate electricity and emit only water, emissions of harmful substances that could lead to environmental pollution are essentially zero. Furthermore, harnessing the heat that fuel cells emit when generating electricity to heat water can lead to reduction of 680 tons of CO2 emissions per year. Fuji Electric’s industrial fuel cells retrieve hydrogen from city gas and generate electricity. However, if a disaster or other situation interrupts the supply of city gas, the fuel cells can be switched to the use of LP gas, enabling them to be used for backup power generation. Introduced at the Kawasaki and Fukiage Factories in fiscal 2011 44 Products that Reduce CO2 Emissions Fuji Electric has established Eco-product Certification Standards for products that contribute to society-wide reductions in environmental impact. Here, we will introduce some of Fuji Electric’s eco-products that help prevent global warming by reducing CO2 emissions. Factories Inverters Inverters are used in a wide variety of equipment, including elevators, building air conditioning systems, and factory manufacturing facilities. By optimally controlling the rotation speed of the motors that move such equipment, inverters eliminate energy loss during operation and contribute to energy savings. CO2 emissions reduction: Power Plants Approx. 10.3 tons / year Geothermal Power (50.2% reduction) (Compared to damper control) Generation Facilities Geothermal power is energy generated using the geothermal steam created by subterranean magma. As geothermal power generation does not require the burning of oil or coal, CO2 emissions are substantially lower than those from thermal power generation. Furthermore, this power source is able to provide supplies of electricity that are more stable than other renewable energy sources. CO2 emissions reduction: Data Centers Approx. 378,000 tons / year Local Air Conditioning (Compared to thermal power generation) Systems Data centers consume extraordinary amounts of electricity. Fuji Electric’s local air conditioning systems help identify localized heat accumulations to provide efficient cooling for these facilities.

By combining these features with light-emitting diode (LED) displays, we have created ultra-energy-efficient vending machines that realize substantial reductions in electricity consumption. Automobiles CO2 emissions reduction: IGBTs Approx. 332 kg / year (49.4% reduction) IGBT modules are a type of power semiconductors. They are (Comparison between models released in fiscal 2006 used in inverters, EVs, and the power conversion equipment and those released in fiscal 2012) of wind and solar power generation facilities, and are essential to realizing energy savings.

Therefore, we have mounted a proactive effort to reuse the pure water emitted by the Matsumoto Factory, which manufactures these products. From the left In the past, we used equipment to process wastewater that had not lost Yoshiharu Kato, Tadataka Izutani, its level of purity, reusing this water in production processes. In fiscal 2011, Makoto Miyazawa, equipment within the factory also began reusing water with a lower degree Environment & Facility Planning Department, Matsumoto Factory of purity, following confirmation of its commercial viability. We process wastewater having a lower level of purity through microfiltration membranes and other equipment, using it in cooling towers and for general use within offices. These efforts have reduced our water requirements by approximately 1,000m3 per day. FUJI ELECTRIC (CHANGSHU) IN CHINA Efforts to Reduce Emissions of Metal Waste and Reuse Resources Fuji Electric (Changshu) Co., Ltd., resells “punch plate”—the magnetic sheet steel and other metals that are generated during the press process when manufacturing magnetic contactors and thermal relays—and reuses such materials as resources. Through its thorough quality improvement and waste Punch plate generated during the reduction activities, the company is also boosting yields, reducing the amount press process of waste that is generated. These efforts have earned the company high praise from its environmental ISO audit institution, the China Association for Standardization. TSUKUBA FACTORY IN JAPAN Community Welfare Facilities and Environmental Protection Activities In 2011, the Tsukuba Factory, which makes uninterruptible power supply systems (UPSs) and backup power generation equipment, began cooperating with the nearby Asunaro Society, a social welfare corporation, to reuse as resources irreparable or discarded products that had previously been proConsigning the disassembly and cessed as industrial waste. separation of products to a social We have consigned the disassembly and separation of these products to welfare corporation the Asunaro Society, which conducts these activities at a workplace set up inside the Tsukuba Factory. In 2011, these efforts led to the 100% effective use of such resources as the factory’s discarded batteries and metal scrap, reducing its industrial waste emissions 59% from the preceding year. Furthermore, the commission paid to the Asunaro Society, balanced against the revenue generated by selling on these resources, led to a 30% reduction in processing costs. We have begun working with the Asunaro Society, which strives to provide work opportunities for people with disabilities, on environmental protection and community contribution initiatives. We plan to continue these activities going forward. 48 Management Structure CORPORATE GOVERNANCE To realize its corporate mission, Fuji Electric is reinforcing its corporate governance by increasing management transparency and enhancing the oversight function.
