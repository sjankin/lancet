We present for your kind attention Vnesheconombank Group’s Sustainability Report for 2011. It is not for the first time that we are offering you an overview of Vnesheconombank’s non-financial activities, but it is actually the first report that encompasses the non-financial performance of all its subsidiaries i.e. VEB Group. Some of the subsidiaries were consolidated under the umbrella of the parent company during the crisis, others have been part of the Group for several years, and still others were established not so long ago. But each of the Group entities is actively working to achieve the goals of economic and environmental sustainability and social welfare. Within a relatively short period of time, the Bank for Development built up a profile of a solid financial corporation. That is true not only because of the Corporation’s official name, but also in view of an important mission it has to play in the national economy. Currently, the Group includes major banks of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, specialized credit organizations: SME Bank, Roseximbank, and leading investment and engineering companies. The recently established development corporations operating in strategically important Russian regions — OJSC North Caucasus Development Corporation and OJSC the Far East and Baikal Region Development Fund — are demonstrating successful performance. As a follow-up to numerous consultations with representatives of the public authorities and business community OJSC Russian Agency for Export Credit and Investment Insurance (EXIAR ), the mission of which is to create an advanced system of state support for exports, and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which primarily aims to raise huge foreign investment for major strategic projects, were founded. Certainly, we very much hope that investments coming to the Russian market will be followed by breakthrough technologies, managerial experience and advanced models of production organization that our foreign partners possess. Admittedly, approval by the Supervisory Board of Vnesheconombank’s Development Strategy up to 2015 was a milestone event of the year. In compliance with the Strategy, within the shortest timeframes possible, we are expected to secure support for developing innovative sectors of the economy, ensure modernization of the Russian enterprises and reduce infrastructure constraints to the growth of the national economy. Considerable efforts and resources will BACK TO CONTENTS 6 VNESHECONOMBANK GROUP SUSTAINABILITY ﻿ REPORT-2011 be devoted to supporting Russia’s high-tech industrial exports. A much wider range of instruments will be used to encourage SMEs. Certainly, Vnesheconombank is aiming to increase its role in implementing state investment policies. These are all not simple challenges to address and it took foreign countries decades to tackle them. But the ambition would not put us off. We acknowledge we have set the right pace and been moving forward swiftly. To illustrate, over the first 5 years of operation as a development institution the Bank’s loan portfolio exceeded RUB 500 billion, posting a 40% increase on the previous year. The positive dynamics and the resilience obtained enable us to strive for new and even more ambitious goals. At the same time, we realize there are no easy solutions to complex development tasks. It is only through investment both in construction of new and modernization of the existing domestic industrial facilities, as well as through smart investment in human capital that further growth could be encouraged. We are aiming to address these complex development issues applying the whole range of instruments the Group possesses. Accomplishing the CSR Strategy is designed to facilitate achievement of the strategic goals we are facing. Developing the document is what we might call a symbolic initiative for Vnesheconombank. It will allow for integrating the CSR principles into the system of corporate governance at all levels. The basic principles embedded in the fundamentals of our business activities include openness and transparency, responsibility towards stakeholders, priority participation in important socioand environmentally-friendly projects. In light of this, Vnesheconombank’s subscription to the UN Global Compact might be viewed as a hallmark event of the past year. For us, accession to the major international initiative means greater integration in the global community, an important step towards greater transparency and joining the international sustainability effort. This agenda is of paramount importance for Vnesheconombank. Delivering large-scale projects we are looking far beyond economic efficiency and give due consideration to the impacts that our activities and decisions could exert on the environment and society. We are seeking during the early expert assessment stages to embed the most efficient financial models. The solutions should incentivize project initiators and operators to apply technologies aimed at enhancing energy saving and reducing pollutant emissions. Overall, our energies are focused on encouraging Russian producers to apply ecologically effective innovative technologies. Chairman’s Statement 7 Over the 5 years of operating as the Bank for Development, financing of more than 30 projects aiming to increase energy efficiency — Vnesheconombank’s commitment amounting to RUB 300 billion — was approved. Among the projects approved were 16 major targeted projects intended to enhance the efficiency of natural resource utilization, environmental protection and improvement of the environment situation with Vnesheconombank’s commitment exceeding RUB 240 billion. The social component of investment projects also has an important role to play. Thus, in the course of implementing projects approved for Vnesheconombank’s financing, more than 150 thousand jobs were created or are planned to be created, the number of jobs retained approximates to 40 thousand. The new and modernized jobs will open up new opportunities and social prospects both for experienced workers and university and college graduates. The projected budgetary efficiency resulting from the project delivery will be in the range of RUB 915 billion. Each of our projects is the outcome of joint efforts of line ministries, regional administrations, independent experts and the Group staff. We recognize it is collegial decisions that contributed to the success of our endeavors. In the future, we would seek to further pursue joint efforts and hopefully the synergy effect would add value and help deliver good results for Russia and other countries.
