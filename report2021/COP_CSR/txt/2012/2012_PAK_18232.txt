We're committed to reducing our impact on the planet and delivering more sustainable products and solutions to our customers. And we can only do this if sustainability is at the heart of everything we do. That's why we aim to integrate sustainability into every area of our business. The Sustainability Report covers our sustainability strategy, Key Performance Indicators, our annual and long-term targets and the work we have done so far. Sustainability Sustainability Report Report Ever 'Green' The work we do to create a better future stems from our Economic, Social and Environmental Performance, which form the basis of our sustainability framework. ICI Pakistan Limited Annual Report 2011 79 Statement of the Chief Executive Dear Stakeholders, Welcome to the ICI Pakistan 2011 Sustainability Report. This is our fourth effort to report our progress on our journey of sustainable development and as we continue to progress on this journey, we also continue to raise the bar on our reporting standards. From a simple account of our activities in 2008, this year we have applied a GRI B+ standard for a more transparent and compliant report. Contributing to sustainable development means consciously balancing short and long-term interests; integrating economic, environmental and social considerations into business decisions; and regularly engaging with our many stakeholders. With our diverse portfolio of products, we practically touch every life in the country some way or the other and this is a responsibility we take very seriously. Sustainability is therefore woven into our culture, practices, processes and the products we offer. In this report you will read about the many ways in which we integrate sustainability into our operations Sustainability is no longer a fancy word or a right ‘thing to do’. It is a conscious effort to change the way we operate, as individuals and as a company. In our case studies we share with you innovative examples of how our teams have come up with simple but effective ideas to build sustainability into everything they do, and we are truly proud of their efforts. You will see how our innovations are helping to address some of the most pressing problems related to energy, the environment, safety and other issues. In 2010, we developed Key Performance Indicators relating to economic, social and environmental factors with defined objectives for 2015. This report defines the ambitious goals we’ve set and our progress toward meeting them. You will also read about our commitment to people; our employees who make this company so diverse and vibrant and the communities in which we operate and how we give back to them. We approach this report with the same commitment as we approach all our responsibilities, and through it we aim to show you a clear, transparent picture of what we are doing as a company to achieve our economic, social and environmental objectives. We hope to receive your feedback and views in order to help us build on our strengths today, and create a more sustainable tomorrow for all. Regards, Waqar A Malik 80 ICI Pakistan Limited Annual Report 2011 Sustainability Strategy During 2010 we put in place a framework built around the triple bottom line concept of economic, social and environmental factors. Based on the framework we conducted a stakeholder engagement program and developed KPIs for each segment in complete alignment with our parent company. A company wide awareness of the sustainability framework was created to unify understanding of the sustainability agenda. The next steps were to restructure the Sustainability Council broadening the base and extending the scope and functionality within the organization to bring about a more defined action based approach. Due to strategic changes within the organization, we did not achieve our objective of restructuring the Sustainability Council. While smaller groups within each Business are working to develop plans to achieve our 2015 goals, the broad base of decision makers to be inducted in the Sustainability Council has not happened and we continue on the structure established previously. This council was made up of a multi-disciplinary team representing each segment of our operations.

Regular plastic remains for up to 100 years, posing risks to water sources, soil, wildlife and marine life. When exposed to sunlight or when buried, oxo-biodegradable material degrades like natural materials (such as wood, straw and leaves), without damaging the environment. This year we decided to try and adopt this technology and as a start, 30,000 paper envelopes used for mailing EOGM Booklets and Annual Calendars were replaced with oxo-biodegradable bags. Little did we know that what was experimental technology for us, would make such a breakthrough in the market. The vendor with whom we had developed the bags started receiving successive orders from other corporate and business entities. Within ICI Pakistan, we are now working on the possibility of introducing this technology for packaging our products. Besides being biodegradable, there is significant paper saving as well. With just this initiative, we saved 600 kilos of paper; an amount that roughly translates into saving 10 trees! We feel that for a greener planet, it is small steps like this, which when done collectively, can really go a long way.

We aim to do business with partners who endorse our ethical values and our social and environmental standards. The two main measures of our progress are signing of the Vendor Policy by suppliers and Supplier Support Visits by our teams.

Health, Safety, Environmental and Security standards, as formulated in our Code of Conduct and legislative requirements of the country. Our program of on-site visits to Critical Suppliers aims to identify and develop critical suppliers as sustainable business partners. Through formal feed-back and follow-up visits, we work together with our suppliers to improve their overall sustainability. We also conduct HSE assessments which outline a two year process as to where they are at present and where they need to be and then work them to ensure they get there. Traditional dimensions like price, cost, time, delivery, punctuality and product quality no longer define a sustainable business. Our vendor partnerships are linked to suppliers and vendors accepting a code of behavior similar to ours. Breaking this code of conduct jeopardizes future relationships and agreements. Key Performance Indicators: 2011 Overview: We could only sustain the 2010 levels in terms of vendor policy signed by the suppliers. Non-product related suppliers sign-off also showed a beginning in 2011 with the Polyester Business. Future Plans: Our future continues to bring all our direct suppliers both product and non-product related into our umbrella of sustainability efforts. Apart from the targets defined for 2015, we would also like to carry out a relook and review of direct level 1 suppliers to ensure we have covered everyone while measuring our above mentioned KPIs.

ICI Pakistan Limited Annual Report 2011 95 Taking ‘Weathershielding’ to new heights! Over the years, Alternative Thinking has become a norm with us. It is a shift of consciousness that is transforming us and our relationships with society and the natural world. It is helping us to not only rise to emerging business challenges but translate them into opportunities. This ability to think fresh and develop innovative solutions that enhance resource efficiency is helping us transform many lives in the country. An interesting example of this is the creative solution we came up with for recycling panaflex skins used for communication material such as standees and banners. We started off with recycling campaign banners to make school bags and earlier this year gave out five hundred bags to deserving students. This led us to think of finding more ways to put these skins to good use. After the countrywide marketing campaign of our Weather Shield Sun Reflect paint, a group of employees collected all the outdoor signage skins used during the launch campaign and decided to use them for a community uplifting project. Sajawal is a far-flung low-lying town in the province of Sind, subject to much rainfall. It was one of the worst affected areas of Sind in the torrential monsoon and resulting floods which severely affected the country last year. Consequent to the floods, people have rebuilt some of their homes however there are still smaller and deprived communities who live in makeshift houses. Our team chose a small village with families living in mud houses with makeshift mats for roofs. In the monsoon season, these mats are unable to hold water and the huts become uninhabitable. Our team replaced the makeshift mats with durable panaflex Weather Shield skins on the roofs and sealed them to prevent leakages during rain. A total of ten houses were actually ‘Weather Shielded’ turning this monsoon into a source of relief rather than distress for the people of this community. 96 ICI Pakistan Limited Annual Report 2011 Community Investment Our community investment activities are managed through the ICI Future Plans: Pakistan Foundation which is a separate legal entity with its own The Foundation plans to initiate a rehabilitation program for flood Board of Trustees. The Foundation is governed by a Trust Deed that affectees of Sind. Due to water stagnation, water borne diseases clearly outlines policies and procedures and clearly defines the scope have spread across the region. We plan to start a project to provide of community investment activities. The accounts of the Foundation clean drinking water to at least five locations within Sind. Other plans are audited every year by A.F. Ferguson & Co. are to expand the scope of Ilm-o-Hunar program and take it to more The Foundation is focused towards community development through locations. investment in education, health, environment and infrastructural development along with disaster relief.

We built two villages in the affected areas of Munda Headworks in Khyber Pakhtoon Khuwa and Rajanpur Village of Rahim Yar Khan in Punjab. Both villages were completed and handed over to the communities in 2011. In 2011, excessive monsoon rains brought about another series of floods, this time severely affecting the province of Sind. We put together a relief program for over 7000 flood victims in 8 areas, including Nawabshah, Umerkot, Badin, Mirpurkhas and T. M. Khan. These areas were especially chosen as there was little or no access to medical facilities. Along with this, 4 veterinary camps (T. M. Khan, Umarkot, Badin and Kario) were set up, and approximately 12,000 animals were treated. This year, we launched a skill development program ‘Ilm-o-Hunar’ with aim of creating opportunities for sustainable development. So far, a painter training course and an electric wiring program has been launched under the program. Our staff actively contributes their time in giving back to our communities and in 2011 a total of 3675 hours were spent by 197 employees and their families on volunteering.

With rapid development and growth of the industrial sector and a subsequent increase in waste generation, this mantra has never been more relevant! An efficient waste management system always follows a hierarchy which begins with the prevention and/or reduction of waste at the source, followed by reuse and recycling of the waste. Safe disposal of the waste is always the last resort when it is no longer considered as potentially useful. At our Polyester Business, we put our heads together to come up with a solution to effectively recycle waste generated during the production of the polymer into a value added proposition. The procedure involved segregating waste, followed by its refinement and then performing an analysis to determine the various chemical components that it is composed of. After series of experimentation, a recipe for adding this waste to the process was developed. The first category of the waste known as pot filter waste exists in a very crude form and cannot be used as a raw material in the batch polymer process directly while the second category of waste was the recovered catalyst waste from the MEG Recovery System. As a result of this initiative, a total of 135 drums of the first category of waste have been recycled completely and converted into valuable and consumable 39 tons of chips, ensuing in zero inventories. Along with this, a total of 25 drums out of 80 of the second category have been recycled so far and the process is still underway. This initiative is not only a safe and an eco-friendly way of disposing hazardous waste, it has also led us to save many millions on treatment and raw material costs.

This reduction becomes significant because both of our manufacturing sites, Polyester and Soda Ash, have on an average operated on less than optimum levels of production rates throughout 2011 in view of the prevalent natural gas and power shortages in the country. Future Plans: We continue to remain committed to reduce the Company’s carbon footprint. Energy efficiency is intended to be at the core of this ambition. Our site level energy conservations plans will be looking at technology upgrades, equipment modernization and asset maintenance to realize our objective. Installation of Glycol Ejector at Polyester, lighting upgrade and boilers major refurbishments are some highlight projects in the pipeline. Energy Consumption (GJ/te) 108 ICI Pakistan Limited Annual Report 2011 Let it rain over me! Since time immemorial, rain has been regarded as a blessing for mankind, providing it with its most basic necessity; water. Rainwater has been used to provide drinking water, water for livestock, water for irrigation, et cetera. So why not also use it in the sector that consumes a great chunk of the world’s fresh water reserves; the industrial sector. In the city of Lahore, an average of 710 millimeters rain was recorded per year over the past four years. Since any area that receives 250 millimeters or more is regarded as an agricultural land with abundant rainfall, this means that the city has a great potential for storing and harvesting rainwater. Based on this, our Paints team designed a pilot project for rain water harvesting and successfully utilized 5000 liters of rainwater in direct paint making in 2011. We are the first company in Pakistan to utilize rainwater directly in water based paint manufacturing. The idea of rain water harvesting was floated around June’11 with feasibility studies and planning completed the next month. With the start of the summer monsoon, 5000 liters of rain water was collected, by August, in small storage vessels on the new warehouse roof. A sample of the collected water was sent to the laboratory for a chemical analysis and a lab scale batch was whipped up using this rainwater to check for any abnormalities and confirm that it is indeed fit for use. Once the lab gave the go ahead, the 5000 liters was used to manufacture 14 batches of emulsion. Given the successful execution of the pilot project, plans are in order to scale it up next year. The potential of rainwater harvesting during the monsoon season by using a few roofs of our Paints Site is 2 million liters in 4 months alone! So our Paints team is all set to get storing all that rainwater since opportunity ‘thunders’ but once!

The scope of our assurance Our assurance provides the reader with an independent, external assessment of the report. It is intended both for the general reader and for more specialist audiences who have a professional interest in ICI Pakistan’s sustainability performance. Our assurance used disclosed information as its starting point and then investigated the underlying systems, processes and sustainability performance information to arrive at its conclusions. We have also assured the performance information in the report. The criteria used are the GRI G3 Principles for Defining Report Quality. That is to say that, based upon the procedures conducted, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the data is not in accordance with the GRI G3 Principles. ICI Pakistan is entirely and solely responsible for the contents of the report, United Registrar of Systems for its assurance. The limitations of our review Our work did not include physical inspections of any of ICI Pakistan’s operating assets. Opinion and findings In our opinion ICI Pakistan’s sustainable development reporting for 2011 reflects the principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness. Specific comments in relation to the key principles above are: Inclusivity: Does ICI Pakistan accept responsibility towards those on whom it has an impact? Does ICI Pakistan involve stakeholders in developing a strategic approach to corporate responsibility and sustainability? ICI Pakistan has taken a positive step of involving stakeholders in the development of its approach to sustainable development. The section on stakeholder engagement in the report is more detailed than in the past and reflects an open and inclusive approach towards reporting. It actively seeks to work with a wide range of other organisations to find shared solutions to common problems. This is particularly notable when tackling issues outside the boundaries of its operations such as environmental regulation and industry standards. Last year we commented that ICI Pakistan’s reporting could be strengthened by providing more clarity over the key stakeholders for each priority area. We are encouraged in this respect that this year’s reporting has a much stronger focus on the company’s partnership-based approach to setting sustainability objectives and to managing local issues. Materiality: What are the issues that really matter to the ICI Pakistan's sustainability performance (“material issues”)? How does ICI Pakistan identify these issues? Previously we commented that ICI Pakistan should provide more information on the steps taken to review its priority areas and the system used for reporting against them. This year’s reporting reflects work undertaken in this area during the period under review. There is also evidence of ICI Pakistan taking a more holistic approach to key issues, particularly with regard to its strategy on carbon reduction projects. The next step, as noted last year, will be to provide a more rounded assessment of the extent to which its overall objectives with regard to the management of its most material issues are being met. This would demonstrate how the business as a whole is moving to be truly sustainable in a resource-constrained world. Given the impact of climate change, reducing carbon emissions remains a material issue for all business entities. ICI Pakistan is clearly making significant progress here. It would be helpful for ICI Pakistan to share its methodology, outturn and lessons learned fully in future reports. Responsiveness: Does ICI Pakistan respond to stakeholder issues that affect performance through its actions and communications? There is evidence of ICI Pakistan’s partnership approach to tackling issues being embedded across the business at corporate and local levels, and that this approach is informed by, and responds to, dialogue with key stakeholders. Data and case studies presented by the individual businesses and operations also evidence this. 114 ICI Pakistan Limited Annual Report 2011 However, as noted previously, future company-wide reporting will be strengthened by the inclusion of more of the voices and experiences of key groups and organizations, to demonstrate how ICI Pakistan responds to their needs and expectations when working with them. Reliability of performance information There is continued evidence of the ICI Pakistan's system for collecting and reporting sustainability having been well embedded and producing robust performance information. While the data in the system is ‘self-certified’ by local operations and the corporate communications function, we believe that ICI Pakistan has an effective programme of checks and balances to help review data accuracy and ensure consistency. These checks help to improve the utility and comparability of information, particularly with regard to qualitative assessments of performance, as well as enabling operations to use the information more effectively to manage their approach to sustainable development. No systematic or material errors or omissions were identified. Uncertainty and limitations relating to the methodologies and data used in the assessment of ICI Pakistan’s sustainability performance were clearly explained to URS. ICI Pakistan expressed its commitment to continually improving the quality of its data management processes and the reliability of reported information. The Report and other sources of information to which it refers, are considered to provide a detailed account of ICI Pakistan's management approach and performance. Looking ahead, it might be worthwhile for ICI Pakistan to take on the challenging step of evaluating the social return on investment of sustainability activities. Our assurance team Our assurance team has been drawn from our global Climate Change and Sustainability Services Practice, which undertakes engagements similar to this with a number of signiﬁcant local and international businesses. Conclusion Through its 2011 sustainable development reporting ICI Pakistan continues to provide a robust demonstration of how it involves stakeholders and responds to their needs and interests in managing its most material issues. Based on the scope of work carried out, URS concludes that the Report provides an accurate and fair representation of ICI Pakistan’s policies, strategies, management system, initiatives and performance in 2011.
