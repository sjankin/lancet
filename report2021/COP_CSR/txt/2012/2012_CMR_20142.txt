We have set up community networks and committees to raise awareness and change attitudes and behavior. Our interventions have included refurbishing schools and encouraging basic education so that children are able to access the education they deserve. To further reduce the chances of female children becoming ensnared in early marriage and sexual abuses, we have also ensured that families, not just children, are helped. Parents remain in good health through our moringa planting project to fight malnutrition among vulnerable children and mothers also to sustain green development. Our partners have also constructed new wells so that clean water is available closer in their houses, and farmers’ fields. This access to water has encouraged families to grow their own food, and not become overly reliant on supplies from elsewhere. During these years, we have accomplished new projects in the Eastern Region, Center Region and Western Region in Cameroon. In addition, TIDA has also supported significant projects on farming and environment sustainable programs. As a result, we have designed a new program model for TIDA, which will ensure that in the future, new projects will follow a strict set of institutional objectives designed to achieve greater results and impact. These efforts will help TIDA to accomplish its mission: to contribute to fight poverty, corruption and violence in Cameroon. We still depend self financially on the members and sympathizers generosity to accomplish our programs since the year 2000. We take this opportunity to thank the yearly effort made by all the contributors both sympathizers and TIDA volunteers to reduce human suffering on earth. So far we continuing maintaining our membership with UN CSO ECOSOC, UNGLS, and we participate in UN GLOBAL COMPACT since 2011. Happy seasons to you all, and let’s welcome the year 2013 with full of hope and success.

TIDA fulfils its vision through three main areas of work: supporting grassroots organization projects; facilitate network building; and sharing good practice. Our programmatic approach is designed to strengthen and empower local communities to deliver key services and take ownership of the projects. This helps to secure long term and lasting impacts for vulnerable populations. To achieve this, TIDA and its partners: • Build partnerships and improve dialogue between grassroots organizations and unions. All of these groups are represented on local project steering committees; • Cooperate closely with local groups and authorities; • Integrate projects within national frameworks of action against corruption; • Build local capacity to ensure ownership and long-term sustainability; • Ensure project accountability through monitoring, impact assessment and evaluation. Research on the prevalence area of corruption, hunger and provides an objective picture of working and living conditions for vulnerable population. It enables TIDA to target its support most effectively and informs the design of its programs. TIDA shares lessons learned and examples of good practice so that local leaders can learn from its experience.

To demonstrate how these projects have reduced family’s sufferings, we narrate the achievements of each project region by region. TIDA’s program model and core programmatic principles TIDA undertook a fundamental review of its program model in order to strengthen its approach towards the elimination of poverty, violence, corruption. The overall TIDA development goal, in alignment with the TIDA mission, is to contribute to the reduction of poverty , corruption and violence. In order to achieve these overarching goals, two strategic objectives and six immediate specific objectives were identified during the TIDA review. The two strategic objectives are i)to promote sustainable development projects by introducing multipurpose plant “moringa” as friendly environmental plant and maize that can raise family income and contribute to their nutrition. ii) To build network with grassroots associations for awareness and fight against poverty, corruption and violence. The actions are: PREVENTION To prevent of malnutrition its related diseases, protection indigenous population against violence, corruption and authority abuses. N° 00000911/RRDA/JO6/BAPP BP 35364 Yaoundé, Tel 237 99 05 73 34, 77619926 Info Email: associationtida@yahoo.com, Site web: www.tidahumaniste.fr.gd ASSOCIATION TONDJI INTERNATIONAL DE DEVELOPPEMENT To initiate participatory and inclusive processes at district and community level that lead directly to the sustainable growing of local populations, education and other basic social services. To improve access to quality education and other basic social services at district and community level; Advocacy and awareness-raising To support advocacy to social change and raise awareness to challenge acceptance of corruption and violence at all levels (district and community); grassroots organizations capacity-building. To strengthen capacities at all levels to combat corruption and violence growing, through the development of appropriate structures, policies and mechanisms; Economic strengthening To strengthen livelihoods /economic improvement at community and household level; safety and health for children; These objectives are further underpinned by six core programmatic principles: a. Human rights based programming Human rights based programming entails that interventions are designed not only in respect for basic human rights principles, but aim to promote the realization of human rights for all human beings, and in TIDA case children especially who are innocently victims of hunger, violence and corruption. TIDA interventions are rights-based by nature, as the direct contribution to fulfilling children’s rights to education and health, to freedom from economic exploitation. b. Gender Although commitment to achieving gender equality has been made by many organizations (including governments) over a long period of time, in many situations there is still a continued need for targeted interventions to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment. All TIDA projects incorporate an early gender analysis and clearly identify activities that aim to promote gender equality, within the context of the N° 00000911/RRDA/JO6/BAPP BP 35364 Yaoundé, Tel 237 99 05 73 34, 77619926 Info Email: associationtida@yahoo.com, Site web: www.tidahumaniste.fr.gd ASSOCIATION TONDJI INTERNATIONAL DE DEVELOPPEMENT planned interventions for the improvement of women income and fight against domestic violence. c. Partnerships TIDA aims that all funded activities, wherever possible, are designed, planned and implemented in genuine partnership with other existing organizations and/or institutions, with the purpose of: • Avoiding duplication; • Building on existing knowledge, experience and lessons learned; • Using the different expertise and skills available with different partners; • Realizing the most cost-effective implementation modality; • Strengthening social cohesion. All kinds of partnership are of interest to the TIDA – for example, with government bodies and authorities, academia, unions, civil society organizations (CSOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), media and the private sector. TIDA encourages private-public partnerships for project delivery, where these meet the five criteria above. d. Measurability TIDA receives funding on the basis of the effectiveness of the funded projects to make a significant reduction in the incidence mother and child malnutrition and corruption growing in Cameroun. Therefore the principal components of all projects funded by TIDA is the capacity to measure qualitative and quantitative progress against baseline indicators, so that TIDA and other stakeholders can verify the impact of project interventions (or the lack of impact). e. Sustainability In order to increase sustainability of interventions, TIDA projects strive to complement existing efforts to contribute to fight poverty, and corruption in the country. Where appropriate, TIDA encourages the replication or enhancement of successful models to reach greater communities. TIDA encourages the formulation of a clear exit strategy for each project to demonstrate how the effects and impact of the interventions will be sustained beyond the completion of the project. These should demonstrate the extent to which the experience and lessons learned can be disseminated and benefit other partners at risk.

Stakeholder Participation Experience across the majority of development sectors has shown that stakeholder participation is essential for interventions to be relevant and effective and also accepted, supported and sustained into the future, beyond the life of the current project. All TIDA projects are encouraged to develop strong stakeholder partnerships. Projects are developed and implemented in a participatory manner which ensures that stakeholders’ suggestions and concerns are incorporated in the design.

By the end of the program in 2012, the moringa farm project had prevented 1,370 children from malnutrition. The project tackles the root causes of poverty, malnutrition and education activities. Against this background, the project provided a support to growing families, on the condition that , they have all children enrolled in school and that they produce acceptable business plans. Thanks to the support financial and technical, beneficiary families were able to increase and diversify their income and thus reduce poverty. They used the moringa products in their dishes and they market heir goods to others families. Fighting malnutrition, sharing good farming practices and accumulating common savings. Support to vulnerable populations in the area Children’s welfare is at the centre of the project’s approach. During the summer of 2011, 2.276 vulnerable populations have benefited from TIDA moringa plants distribution. This was an opportunity to provide specific care and rest for children living far away from the farming area. Planting moringa plants in their house would help their environment and benefit from its highly nutritious leaves. Because the success of the project relies on a participatory approach, several workshops and meetings were held to raise awareness, train and strengthen the capacity of health workers and farmers. A total of 2,245 people were reached in 2012 through these workshops and meetings for farmers. Furthermore, nine meetings were held to raise awareness local leaders about the harmful effects of corruption in the water sector in rural areas in Cameroon. Over 100 people attended, social workers, heads of villages, elders.

Education Improving access and quality of primary education are proven strategies in eliminating authorities abuses on peasants and marginalized indigenous mbororos and pygmees . Therefore the main focus of the project is to improve the services provided by both pre-schools and basic schools so that children have access to an appropriate learning environment. During the year, teaching and learning materials as well as sports and recreational materials, were procured. The quality of teaching was improved through the support for private schools teacher training. Three teachers from the two sponsored nursery schools were retrained in new teaching methodologies on health and hygienic issues. Household Economic Strengthening Poverty is one of the root causes of hunger in the families. In order to improve food security and livelihoods of households with female children at risk of entering sexual abuses, the project procured and distributed conservation farming kits. Items that make up these kits include fertilizer, N° 00000911/RRDA/JO6/BAPP BP 35364 Yaoundé, Tel 237 99 05 73 34, 77619926 Info Email: associationtida@yahoo.com, Site web: www.tidahumaniste.fr.gd ASSOCIATION TONDJI INTERNATIONAL DE DEVELOPPEMENT maize seed, agricultural lime, and a conservation farming handbook. A total of 45 vulnerable families whose children were identified by the program received these kits and improved their yield and crops. With this kit, each household was able to produce between 20 and 30 bags of maize at 50 kg per bag. This greatly increased the food security of these households. The improvement of food security will enable these families to free other resources or income to support the children to stay in school. IIIWestern Region project partners The project partner is Fondation Reine de Coeur Mfout Sabiatou in Foumban The project is firstly to promote the access of quality of education for children. Secondly, implemented the project focuses on health, as experience has shown that ill-health of adults is one of the main reasons children are pushed to stay uneducated. Thirdly, the project has a water and school sanitation component that focuses on reducing the need for withdrawn and ‘at risk’ children from travelling long distances to fetch water, while at the same time ensuring that the school environment is safe and healthy. N° 00000911/RRDA/JO6/BAPP BP 35364 Yaoundé, Tel 237 99 05 73 34, 77619926 Info Email: associationtida@yahoo.com, Site web: www.tidahumaniste.fr.gd ASSOCIATION TONDJI INTERNATIONAL DE DEVELOPPEMENT Finally, the project seeks to improve food security, in response to the reality that food insecurity at household level often drives children in the areas into child labour. Education The education interventions were aimed at improving access to, and the quality of, education of female children. In 2011 and 2012. In order to create employment and improve the local economy, the project trained local builders at the two building sites. When completed, the new infrastructure will improve access to education for children withdrawn from school. Three teacher pedagogical review sessions were conducted , thus contributing to the improvement of the standard of teaching and the learning of the pupils. Health Healthy parents are able to fend for their families and are therefore much less likely to use their children to complement their household incomes. In 2012, the health component project reached 2650 patients with treatment, testing and counseling services as well as 1896 patients through outreach clinics. The preventative and school health program reached 33 schools as planned with child right for health messages to school children, hygiene and health talks, de-worming, presumptive treatment of bilharzias as well treatment of common skin conditions. In Cameroon, there is no social health care for children under five years. A Government program on free malaria treatment has a limit and could not help vulnerable children at all. Food security The project contributed to improving household food and the promotion of conservation agriculture, the distribution of moringa plants and seed distribution. Working with model farmers in selected villages, the project successfully introduced or piloted conservation agriculture as a low cost and labour-saving methodology to attain food security in Koutaba and Mancha. Conservation agriculture is sustainable and involves the use of crop residues as mulch for soil fertility (manure after decomposition), weed control and conservation of moisture. As a result of the adoption of conservation agriculture, household poverty has been reduced, elderly headed households can produce enough food for their families, children of targeted farmers go to school, farm productivity has increased and farmers can grow other main crops like maize, thus diversifying their food and income sources.

Water and sanitation Access to clean water is important for health reasons. Children, especially girls, often spend long hours fetching water, thus missing out on or interfering with school. In addition, inadequate school sanitation facilities are linked with high absenteeism of girls. In 2011, TIDA drilled 10 shallow wells in the project area, providing safe water for 133 households with children in or at risk of water born diseases. TIDA’s program of work has been informed by principles since it was set up in 2000. In 2012, after eleven years, it is time to review progress and develop a new vision to continue Millennium Development Goals beyond 2015. The Millennium Development Goals in Cameroon is far to achieve its target in Cameroon. The local development ngos, associations have no support and consideration from the government. To get consideration, an N° 00000911/RRDA/JO6/BAPP BP 35364 Yaoundé, Tel 237 99 05 73 34, 77619926 Info Email: associationtida@yahoo.com, Site web: www.tidahumaniste.fr.gd ASSOCIATION TONDJI INTERNATIONAL DE DEVELOPPEMENT organization must have link with the political party on power, either have a link with the first lady foundation or must belong to secret societies related to the government officials. The corruption system today in the country has metamorphosed into an intelligent system of corruption where only CONAC the national institution installed by the government to fight corruption has a limited roles to play and be influenced by the government. TIDA was denied membership into CONAC in 2011 for denouncing corrupters; this is one of the evidence of non clarity. In the rural areas the authority’s abuses by military, road gendarmes, judges, divisional and sub divisional officers are at the front page despite of speeches of the president of the Republic of Cameroon against corruption. How can a corrupt government fight corruption? Some corruption behavior had its root from colonial institutions to show power and domination. TIDA resolved that there must be an urgent need of an Independent National Committee set up by civil societies to fight corruption and have the power to summit cases for justice in Cameroon.

It will be adequately resourced and recognized broadly as a reference point and source of information on good practices. TIDA is identifying appropriate stakeholders and developing their capacities so that they can act effectively as national catalysts for policy change. To support their efforts, TIDA is building partners’ capacity in advocacy and providing training development and corruption issues, human rights related to UN Conventions. TIDA is also building awareness on the corruption in the water sector with appropriate tools and materials introduced by WIN WATER INTERGRITY NETWORK. Maximizing use of resources and using expertise in-kind. Through closer collaboration with other stakeholders working to eliminate corruption, shared costs in joint initiatives could maximize use of UN GLOBAL COMPACT resources. We used jointly the anticorruption manual of the MINISTRY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF FINLAND Department for Development Policy and EQUITAS manual on human right.
