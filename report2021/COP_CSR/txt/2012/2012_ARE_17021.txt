United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress JUL11 – JUN12 Statement of continued support 24th June 2012 Commercial Bank of Dubai (CBD)’s mission statement on Society reads: “To be recognised for our ethical banking practices and for our contribution to the social well-being of the communities in which we are present.” In order to systematically measure our performance in the realm of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), we endeavour to benchmark and validate our related approaches and results against international best practices and criteria of bodies such as the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), Social Accountability International (SAI) etc. as well as those prescribed and monitored by the local authorities. Two years since becoming a signatory of the UNGC, CBD reaffirms its support of the principles of the UNGC in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption, and continues to embed the principles into its standards, policies, behaviours and values. CBD is the only financial institution in the UAE that is a signatory of the UNGC. CBD is the only financial institution in the Middle East and Northern Africa region to achieve the Social Accountability (SA8000) certification. The elements of the standard are based on the principles of International Human Rights, norms as delineated in International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions, the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. CBD’s SA8000 Manual is accessible by all employees through intranet, and audited by an independent third party, twice a year. As part of our annual Communication on Progress in respect of the UNGC principles, we commit to continually improve the integration of the principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. Our sustained performance as a responsible corporate citizen of the UAE led to the achievement of the ‘CSR Label’ conferred by the Centre for Responsible Business, Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry in September 2011.

Brief definitions of the principles as adopted by CBD and published in its SA8000 Manual are as follows: a.

In case any child / young labour is found to be working, to ensure that suitable remediation measures of such children are undertaken. b. Forced Labour: To ensure that there is no forced or compulsory labour under any conditions (i.e. bonded, forced, and/or compulsory prison labour) and to respect the ILO conventions on forced labour; also, to ensure disclosure of all the terms and conditions related to recruitment, preemployment or employment periods. c. Freedom of Association & Collective Bargaining: To permit the employees without any direct or indirect impediments or negative consequences for collective bargaining through parallel means of communication with senior management; also, to respect the ILO conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. d. Discrimination: To provide equal treatment to all workers in all the matters like employment, training, promotion and compensation on the basis of their capability to perform the jobs regardless of race, caste, national origin, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, union membership or political affiliations or age; also, to respect the ILO conventions for eliminating discrimination. 4. The Bank’s supplier selection procedure has separate sections to review the suppliers’ conformity with international norms on Child Labour, Forced Labour, Freedom of Association & Collective Bargaining, and Discrimination. Commercial Bank of Dubai, 24JUN12 Page 3 of 7 United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress JUL11 – JUN12 Progress: 1. Health and safety of employees is a primary concern and accorded high priority. CBD has partnered with an internationally certified body to conduct ‘First Aid’ & ‘Fire Marshal’ courses for CBD employees. Representatives from every department and branch are trained as Fire Marshals and First Aid Specialists. Periodically, fire evacuation drills are conducted. 2. In order to promote/develop a healthy workplace, all CBD premises have been declared as no smoking areas for staff and customers, and all computer monitors have anti-glare screens. 3. CBD has insurance cover for its customers on loans taken by them. This insurance covers death and disability. Staff members and their dependants are also well covered for their medical expenses and treatment. 4. The HRPPM is reviewed periodically by the HR Department and the latest version is communicated and made available on the intranet. All policies governing Labour are reviewed fortnightly by the HR Committee. Employee welfare and compliance are integral components of the Bank’s Balanced Score Card and reviewed periodically by the senior management. 4. CBD’s SA8000 management system has been subjected to six-monthly audit since Dec 2008; the sixmonthly SA8000 audit for the period Jan-Jun 2012 is under review. 5. The non-management representatives of the SA8000 (i.e. the Social Accountability Representatives SARs) are ‘elected’ in CBD through an open and transparent voting procedure through the intranet. 6. Besides the SARs, all employees have direct channels of communication with the senior management. 7. As a consequence to the adoption of the SA8000 principles, changes were made to the HRPPM, especially in case of discrimination. Now, all employees (male and female, irrespective of nationality) are eligible to avail all benefits (esp. allowances). The only discrimination practiced is a positive one, i.e. preference to UAE nationals in recruitment, training and career development as per the labour laws of UAE, and permitted by SA8000. 8. Due to stringent monitoring of suppliers’ conformity with international labour norms, we have been able to influence some suppliers (service providers) to adhere to improved working hours and conditions for their employees. We propose to continue monitoring suppliers and enforce more adherence to UNGC and SA8000 principles.
