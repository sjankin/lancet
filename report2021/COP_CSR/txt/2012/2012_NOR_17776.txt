At the start of the year, the situation was the Board tight and power prices high, but the situation improved significantly of ­Directors through the year and the reservoir water levels in the Nordic region were far higher than normal at year-end. The Nordic power prices fell 2011 as the ­reservoir water levels rose, and were on average 11% lower than in 2010. Statkraft’s power plants had high uptime rates, but hydropower production was lower than in 2010 due to the market situation. The gas power production was also lower than in 2010 as a result of periods with negative margins. Total production in 2011 was 51.5 TWh, 10% lower than in 2010. Due to negative unrealised changes in value and non-recurring items, the result for the year after tax was slightly positive. Underlying operations were solid with an EBITDA margin of 49%. The amounts invested increased in accordance with the strategy, reaching a gross total of about NOK 9 billion. IMPORTANT EVENTS AND STRATEGY ACHIEVEMENT IN 2011 In 2010, Statkraft’s strategy was focused on areas where its comparative advantages were considered to be best suited to create maximum values for the owner and society in ­general. The new strategy aimed for growth in five areas: ππ European flexible power production and market operations ππ International hydropower ππ Wind power in Norway, Sweden and the UK ππ District heating ππ Small-scale hydro in Norway In 2011, the Group reached several milestones in its focus areas. Nordic and other European flexible power production and market operations Statkraft increased the long-term power contract volume, and several new contracts were entered into in 2011. The new power agreements starting delivery in 2011 and 2012 amount to a total annual volume of 6.6 TWh, and the Group’s total long-term contract volume is now about 20 TWh per year. These are agreements entered into with mainly Norwegian companies. In Norway, Statkraft is upgrading its hydropower plants with a budget exceeding NOK 1 ­billion. In Sogn og Fjordane County, Statkraft is constructing the Eiriksdal and Makkoren hydropower plants to replace three older power plants which will be shut down, and Nedre Røssåga power plant in Nordland County is also undergoing modernisation. The Eiriksdal and Makkoren development is scheduled for completion in 2014, while the modernisation of Nedre Røssåga is scheduled for completion in 2015. In addition, efforts are underway to expand Svartisen power plant in Nordland with a new unit. The expansion has been delayed 15 months due to technical problems, and is expected to resume operation in late 2012. The total investment for the Svartisen expansion is about NOK 400 million. The supply of new renewable energy to the market over the course of 2011, combined with falling power prices and high gas prices, resulted in low margins for gas power plants in Germany. The German power market is in substantial and rapid change, and this, combined with low demand, has caused Statkraft to write down the gas and biopower plant portfolio and to decide that the older Emden 4 gas power plant in Germany will be put in cold reserve with reduced workforce. This capacity will be replaced by expansion of a different gas Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors 05 power plant, Knapsack II (430 MW), where construction started in 2011 and will be completed in 2013. The total investment for the plant is about NOK 3 billion. International hydropower Statkraft decided to start construction of the Cetin project in south-eastern Turkey. The project will consist of two power plants of 401 MW and 116 MW, respectively, combined with a regulation reservoir. The project is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2015. The expected cost is about NOK 4 billion. In addition, Statkraft is constructing the Kargi hydropower plant in Turkey. The 102 MW plant is scheduled for ­completion in late 2013, and has an investment ceiling of NOK 2 billion. Through the subsidiary SN Power, acquisitions were made in the Brazilian company Enerpar and an agreement entered into to acquire 40.65% of the shares in the Brazilian company Svein aaser Desenvix. Enerpar (wholly owned) is a power trading company, while Desenvix develops, Chairman of the Board and Chair of builds and owns small and medium-sized hydropower plants. The acquisition of the stake ­Statkraft’s Compensation ­Committee, Board ­member since 2010 in Desenvix was completed on 9 March 2012. The total rehabilitation of the Ambuklao power plant in the Philippines, which SN Power owns together with Aboitiz, was completed and the power plant is now in full production. The plant has an installed capacity of 105 MW and an annual mean production of about 332 GWh. SN Power’s subsidiary Agua Imara has decided to develop the Bajo Frio power plant in Panama. The project will be realised with a local partner. The 58 MW power plant is scheduled for completion in the summer of 2014 and has a development cost of about USD 200 million. SN Power acquired the remaining 20% of the shares in Norvind and now wholly owns a 46 MW wind farm in Chile. The acquisition took place in combination with SN Power ­divesting itself of Hidroeléctrica Trayenko in Chile. At the end of 2011, the Group had five power plants under construction outside of Northern Europe – Kargi (102 MW) and Cetin (401 MW and 116 MW) in Turkey, Cheves (168 MW) in Peru and Bajo Frio (58 MW) in Panama. The total investment for these developments is expected to reach about NOK 9.5 billion. In addition, Statkraft SF has a 20% shareholding in Theun Hinboun in Laos, which will be expanded by two power plants to increase the capacity from 220 MW to 500 MW. Wind power The Group approved and started the construction of three wind farms. Stamåsen (60 MW) and Mörttjärnberget (85 MW) in Sweden are scheduled for completion in 2012 and 2013, respectively, and Baillie in Scotland (52.5 MW) is scheduled for completion in 2012. The total investment for these projects is about NOK 2.8 billion. In addition, Statkraft and Statoil are building the Sheringham Shoal offshore wind farm (317 MW) off the coast of the UK. At the end of 2011, 21 wind turbines had been installed, of which ten were in operation. The farm is scheduled for completion in 2012. This is the Group’s first offshore wind construction project. The project has suffered cost overruns and delays, and the value of the plant has been written down. District heating Statkraft was awarded a licence to develop 45 GWh of district heating in Ås. The initial heating delivery has been scheduled for 2012. The total investment amounts to about NOK 170 million, and Statkraft has been granted NOK 38 million in subsidies from Enova. Statkraft acquired Bio Varme. The business includes 80 GWh in operation, 50 GWh under development and 70 GWh under planning. Small-scale hydro Småkraft started operations at four new plants in 2011. At the end of the year, the company had 28 power plants in operation (annual production of 328 GWh) as well as 21 legally binding licences (183 GWh). 06 Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors Other important events Statkraft sold the real estate company Sluppen Eiendom AS in Trondheim with a booked gain of NOK 126 million. Fjordkraft AS sold the shareholding in Scanenergi AS and Scanenergi Elsalg AS with a booked gain of NOK 123 million. Changes in the corporate management team Jens Bjørn Staff became the new CFO on 1 October. In addition, the corporate management team consists of Christian Rynning-­ Tønnesen (President and CEO), Hilde Bakken (Staffs), Asbjørn Grundt (Market operations and IT), Steinar Bysveen (Generation and Industrial Ownership), Øistein Andresen (International Hydropower) and Jon Brandsar (Wind Power and Technologies). Health and safety There was one fatal accident in consolidated operations and four in ­associates. A contractor died in connection with a development project in Turkey, where Statkraft owns 100%, three contractor employees died in connection with a development project in Theun Hinboun Power Company in Laos, where Statkraft SF owns 20%, and one employee died in the Istad Group in Norway, where Statkraft owns 49%. All accidents have been investigated and followed up. To achieve the goal of zero working accidents with ­serious consequences, the work to follow up and implement preventive activities in the operations and projects will be strengthened. Furthermore, high safety requirements are also set for partners and ­suppliers. MAJOR TRANSACTIONS IN RECENT YEARS In recent years, Statkraft has carried out several transactions, with the asset swap with E.ON AG at the end of 2008 and the acquisition of SN Power in 2009 being the largest. The former transaction entailed that E.ON AG acquired Statkraft’s shareholding of 44.6 % in E.ON Sverige AB in return for assets and a 4.17 shareholding in E.ON AG. The swap trade yielded a gain of NOK 25.6 billion. The acquisition from 50% to 60% in SN Power meant that the company went from being a joint venture to a subsidiary. Parts of the business Statkraft acquired from E.ON AG have had a satisfactory development and have generated positive results. The E.ON AG shareholding has fallen significantly in value, and the value was NOK 10.8 billion at the end of 2011. This is NOK 12.3 billion lower than at the acquisition on 31 December 2008. More than one-third of the lower value is due to unrealised currency losses. Investments in E.ON Sverige AB (formerly Sydkraft) have yielded a return, from the shares were acquired, of about 10% annually based on the current value of the assets and the E.ON shares. EBITDA AND NET PROFIT* SN Power represents one of the Group’s focus areas and has a high activity level in NOK mill. ­connection with project developments. In spite of relatively high costs in connection with 16000 growth, the company has had a positive development since Statkraft’s acquisition, and the contribution from associates and joint ventures has increased in recent years and amounted 12000 to NOK 459 million in 2011. 8000 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 1) A tight resource situation in the first half and relatively low spot prices in the second half of 4000 the year as a result of high inflow and mild weather resulted in the Group’s overall production at spot prices being substantially lower than in 2010. Compared with 2010, a year with signifi0 2009 2010 2011 cant higher prices and production, the Group had a considerable decline in revenues. The EBITDA, underlying operations* recorded net operating revenues totalled NOK 17094 million and the operating profit NOK Profit before tax, underlying operations* Net profit, financial 6203 million. This represents a decline of 26% and 51%, respectively, compared with 2010. The lower spot sales revenues were partly offset by a high percentage of contract sales. * Unrealised changes in value exclusive trading and origination, material non-recurring items are not included. 1 Figures in parentheses show the comparable figures for 2010.

Based on the recorded result, the return on equity after tax was 0.1% (11.8%), and the return on total capital after tax was 0.8% (6.0%).

EUR/MWh 90 Market and production Statkraft’s revenues come from spot sales (sale of own production in spot markets), contract sales to the industry, financial trading, distribution grid operations, 60 as well as district heating and power sales to end-users. The fundamental basis for Statkraft’s revenues comprises power prices, water management and production. 30 The power market The majority of Statkraft’s production is generated in the Nordic region and Germany. The Group is also exposed in other European markets as well as markets 0 ­outside Europe through its subsidiary SN Power. Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Price interval 2006–2010 Average 2006–2010 Power prices in the Nordic region fell through 2011, and the average system price on Nord 2010 Pool ended at 47.2 EUR/MWh, 11% lower than in 2010. Power prices in Germany were higher 2011 than in 2010 for most of the year, and the average spot price (base) on the European Energy Exchange (EEX) ended at 51.1 EUR/MWh, 15% higher than in 2010. Compared with the average prices for the years 2006-2010, the price was 13% higher in the Nordic region and 7% higher in Germany. The average gas price at the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) in the Netherlands was 21.9 EUR/MWh, an increase of 26% from 2010. SPOT PRICE, EEX Power consumption in the Nordic region is relatively high compared with other European EUR/MWh countries as a result of the combination of cold winters and a high percentage of electric 90 heating, as well as a relatively high percentage of power-intensive industry. In 2011, the demand for power fell by 4% in the Nordic region and 5% in Norway compared with the 60 ­preceding year. Total production in Norway was 125.2 TWh, an increase of 4% from 2010, and 3.2 TWh was exported (corresponding to 3% of the production). 7.6 TWh was imported in 2010. Overall, 370.5 TWh was produced in the Nordic region, a decline of 1% from 2010, and 5.2 TWh 30 was imported (corresponding to 1% of the consumption). 19.2 TWh was imported in 2010. 0 At the end of December, the overall water level in the Nordic region’s reservoirs was 112% Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec of normal, corresponding to 95 TWh. The water level was 79% of maximum capacity, which Price interval 2006–2010 Average 2006–2010 is 121 TWh. Measured in TWh, this represents an increase in the reservoir water levels of 2010 about 75% compared with the end of 2010, when the water level was 45% of maximum 2011 ­capacity and 64% of normal. 08 Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors NORDIC RESERVOIR WATER LEVELS Production Statkraft’s production is determined by capacity, access to resources ­(hydrological balance and wind), spark spread (margin between power and gas price) and 100% power optimisation. At the end of 2011, the installed capacity amounted to 16 430 MW, with ­hydropower contributing 13 249 MW, gas power 2178 MW, wind power 321 MW, district 80% ­heating 666 MW and biopower 16 MW. 60% The Group’s energy production totalled 51.5 TWh, as well as 0.9 district heating, declines 40% of 10% and 14%, respectively. The hydropower production declined by 8% and the gas power 20% production by 30% to 46.0 TWh and 4.6 TWh, respectively. The wind power production, which amounts to a relatively small percentage of the Group’s upstream production, 0% 1 7 13 19 25 31 37 43 49 Week increased by 24% to 0.8 TWh. Biopower production amounted to 0.1 TWh, a decline of 11%. 2009 2010 2011 The demand for power varies through the day and through the year, and the power markets Median are dependent on capacity that can be adjusted in line with demand. Statkraft’s large share Source: Nord Pool of flexible production capacity, combined with sound expertise in analysis and production, contribute to the Group’s consistently sound water resource management. This is achieved through carefully planned power optimisation as well as available power plants in peak demand periods. This expertise is also used in the flexible power production on the Continent. Statkraft’s large reservoir capacity with a combination of seasonal and multiple-year reservoirs enables the Group to manage the water resources in a perspective spanning more than one year. Accordingly, the production can be kept high in periods with high prices and lower in periods with low prices or when concerns for the reliability of supply dictate otherwise. Statkraft’s Nordic hydropower production in 2011 was about 92% of the annual mean ­production. As a consequence of a lot of precipitation through large parts of the year, the resource situation at year-end is sound. Underlying operating revenues Gross operating revenues fell by 23% to NOK 22 298 million, while net operating revenues fell by 20% to NOK 18 120 million. The power production is primarily sold in the spot market, under long-term industrial contracts and in the end-user market. In addition, the Group also delivers power at terms set by the NORDIC HYDROPOWER PRODUCTION authorities (concessionary power and lease agreements for industrial power). The produc2010 (47,8 TWh; 102% av årsmiddelproduksjon) tion revenues are optimised through financial power trading, and the Group also engages in 8,3 TWh; 17% trading activities.

These contracts have successively expired over the past years, and the last expired in July 2011. As these contracts have expired, the number of new contracts with the power-intensive industry has grown. New power agreements with delivery starting in 2011/12 amounted to an annual volume of 6.6 TWh at the end of 2011, and the Group’s total long-term contract volume was about 20 TWh per year, corresponding to about 45% of the Group’s annual mean production for Nordic hydropower. These agreements have mainly been entered into with Norwegian industry. Most of this takes place under the auspices of the Statkraft AS Group, but the volume also includes lease agreements that Statkraft SF has with the power-intensive industry. The majority of the volume is contracted to 2020. In 2011, a total of 17.4 TWh was delivered to the Nordic industry, an increase of 5%, ELLEN STENSRUD and the revenues amounted to NOK 6010 million, an increase of 31%. The v­ olume correDeputy chair, Board member since 2007 sponded to 40% of the Group’s Nordic hydropower production. Concessionary sales at statutory prices In Norway, Statkraft is required to cede a share of the power production to counties and municipalities where the power is produced, so-called concessionary power. The price for this power corresponds to the average production cost, which is substantially lower than the power market price. In 2011, the revenues from concessionary power amounted to NOK 401 million (NOK 308 million), and the volume amounted to 7% of the Group’s Nordic hydropower production. Portfolio management To mitigate risk related to uncertainty in future price and production volumes, as well as to increase the long-term revenues, the company hedges production revenues through financial power trading. The share of the production that is hedged changes in line with market development expectations. As power prices are influenced by other commodity prices such as coal, oil, gas and CO2, and as these prices can both be input factors in gas power production (gas and CO2), and price adjustment factors in ­contracts, Statkraft also engages in financial trading with these commodities. Statkraft’s analysis activities occupy a key position in the trading. The analysis activities are based on collection and processing of hydrological data and other market data. The data are used to estimate market prices and optimise the flexible production. In 2011, the result from the Nordic and Continental portfolio management amounted to NOK -124 million, ­compared with a positive contribution of NOK 308 million in 2010. The negative value in 2011 relates to losses on sales contracts in the first quarter. These contracts were entered into before power prices rose sharply in the latter half of 2010. In addition, losses were incurred on sales contracts for coal as a result of relatively high coal prices. Trading and origination Statkraft is also engaged in relatively short-term positioning with financial standard contracts (trading) and trading with structured products and customised agreements for industry and industry and commerce (origination). The realised income can vary substantially from period to period and year to year. In 2011, realised and unrealised income from trading and origination amounted to NOK 834 million, an increase of 14% from the preceding year. The origination activities generated the bulk of the improvement, partly as a result of the activities expanding into new markets. Downstream activities The downstream activities in Statkraft consist of grid operations, ­district heating and power sales to end users. The sales revenues from these activities are large, but the margins are low compared with the other activities. In total, the revenues from the down­ stream activities amounted to NOK 6597 million, a decline of 18%. The decline in grid revenues is due to the divestment of Trondheim Energi Nett AS in the first half of 2010, while the revenues from end-user sales and district heating declined as a result of lower prices and demand. 10 Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors Other operating revenues amounted to NOK 868 million, a decline of 20%. The decline is ­primarily due to revenues lost due to the sale of Skagerak Fibernett AS in early 2011 and compensation from Statkraft SF for an agreement in connection with Oksla power plant in 2010. Energy purchases amounted to NOK 2964 million, a decline of 37%. The decline is primarily due to Fjordkraft buying a larger share of the power for the end-user business internally in the Group, as well as lower gas purchases for power production. Transmission costs associated with the transport of power totalled NOK 1215 million, a decline of 24%. The decline is mainly due to lower production. HALVOR STENSTADVOLD Chair of Statkraft’s Audit Committee, Underlying operating expenses Operating expenses for 2011 amounted to NOK 9730 million, Board member since 2003 a decline of 4% from 2010. Underlying OPERATING EXPENSES Figures in NOK mill. 2011 2010 Salaries and payroll costs 2 759 2 726 Depreciation 2 461 2 543 Property tax and license fees 1 254 1 236 Other operating expenses 3 256 3 598 Operating expenses 9 730 10 103 Salaries and payroll costs increased by 1%. The increase is due to ordinary wage ­development, increased activity in the segments International hydropower and Wind Power, ­acquisition of activities, as well as insourcing of the operation of Swedish hydropower. The sale of Skagerak Fibernett AS and Trondheim Energi Nett AS in summer 2010, as well as provisions in 2010 in connection with restructuring, has the opposite effect. Depreciation declined by 3% from 2010. The decline is primarily due to the Group writing down assets by a total of NOK 2.3 billion over the last two years as well as the sale of Trondheim Energi Nett AS. Property tax and licence fees increased by 2% from 2010. The calculation basis for property tax on power plants is based on an average of the results for the power plant over the last five years, and high power prices will therefore influence tax costs. Statkraft’s license fees are relatively stable and are adjusted in line with the consumer price index, with the first UNDERLYING EBITDA adjustment taking place on 1 January five years after the licence was granted and every NOK mill. fifth year thereafter. Property tax increased by 3% to NOK 970 million. The increase relates 60% 35 000 primarily to an increase in the Swedish property tax from 2.2% to 2.8%.

Historically, Statkraft has had high EBITDA margins as a result of operating expenses in ­connection with hydropower production being low. This to some extent offset by higher tax Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors 11 rates for Norwegian hydropower production through economic rent taxation. The EBITDA margin was 49% in 2011 (52%). The decline in the margin was mainly a result of lower Nordic prices and production. Lower operating expenses, excluding depreciation, offset the decline somewhat.

Unrealised changes in value on energy contracts Unrealised changes in value on energy contracts, excluding trading and origination, amounted to NOK -1152 million (NOK 62 million). In the second quarter, Statkraft decided to change its accounting practice for power sales agreements entered into in EUR where the other contractual party uses NOK as its functional currency. Changes in value recognised in the income statement in this connection amounted to NOK -1082 million and relate primarily to agreements entered into in 2009 when the EUR was exchanged at slightly more than NOK 9. The change in contract terms from the fourth quarter of 2011 has resulted in the power ­purchase agreement with Herdecke being evaluated at fair value. Statkraft’s percentage of unrealised losses associated with this contract impacted the annual result with NOK -505 million. Other unrealised changes in value are partly due the to Group’s contracts being indexed against various commodities, currencies and indices. In 2011, higher gas prices were the ­primary influences on these unrealised items. Significant non-recurring items Non-recurring items excluded from the calculation of the underlying profit amount to NOK -1035 million in 2011 (NOK 70 million). In the second quarter, Statkraft sold the real estate company Sluppen Eiendom AS to ­Trondheim Næringspark AS with a booked gain of NOK 126 million. Non-current assets and receivables in connection with gas and biomass power plants in Germany were written down by NOK 1029 million and NOK 58 million, respectively, NOK 1087 million in total Share of profit from associated companies and joint ventures The Group has major shareholdings in the Norwegian regional power companies BKK AS and Agder Energi AS. Outside of Norway, the growth in several instances takes place through ownership in partly-owned companies. The share of profit from the Group’s associates amounted to NOK 898 million in 2011, an increase of 17%. The Sheringham Shoal offshore wind farm in the UK (50% shareholding) was written down by NOK 338 million, primarily as a result of delays and cost overruns. However, increased 12 Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors contributions from BKK, Agder Energi and SN Power’s associates companies in the ­Philippines caused a positive change in the profit shares compared with 2010. Financial items Net financial items amounted to NOK -3635 million in 2011 (NOK -917 million), of which NOK 390 million was realised. Statkraft’s external debt was considerably higher than financial investments, and this resulted in realised net interest charges of NOK 936 ­million in 2011. However, other financial items, mainly dividend from E.ON AG and realised currency gains from internal loans, were positive, amounting to a total of NOK 1326 million. Financial income amounted to NOK 2015 million (NOK 2060 million). Statkraft places ­significant amounts in banks and securities at times, particularly ahead of major payments. silvija Seres ­Counterparties are continually followed up to reduce the risk of losses. The return on Member of Statkraft’s Compensation investments was NOK 290 million higher in 2011 as a result of higher average invested Committee, Board member since 2010 amounts and somewhat higher market interest rates. At the end of 2010, Statkraft received a contribution of capital from the owner of NOK 14 billion, increasing cash and cash ­equivalents in 2011. Other financial income (total financial income exclusive of interest income) fell by NOK 318 million mainly due to lower currency gains on realised external debt. Financial expenses amounted to NOK 1625 million (NOK 1607 million). Interest costs ­(including guarantee premiums to the State) fell by NOK 38 million compared with 2010 as a result of lower average debt. The effect of the lower debt was somewhat offset by higher market interest rates. Other financial expenses (total financial expenses exclusive of interest income) were NOK 56 million higher in 2011. Unrealised changes in value for financial items amounted to NOK -4025 million, and the reduction of NOK 2656 million compared with 2010 relates primarily to lower unrealised ­currency gains on internal loans and lower write-down on E.ON AG shares than in 2010. Unrealised currency gains on internal loans amounted to NOK 246 million in 2011, a ­reduction of NOK 3127 million from 2010. The large gain in 2010 was the result of a marked strengthening of the NOK and SEK in relation to EUR, while the strengthening of NOK and SEK against EUR was moderate in 2011. Statkraft owns 83 415 119 shares in E.ON AG, corresponding to a shareholding of 4.17%. At year-end, the shareholding was entered in the balance sheet with market value of NOK 10 782 million. The change in value in 2011 was NOK -4085 million, of which NOK -4103 million has been recognised as a loss under unrealised changes in value, and where NOK 18 million has been recognised in comprehensive income. The share price fell from EUR 22.87 to EUR 16.67 per share in 2011. The part of the unrealised loss that is attributable to the lower share price amounts to NOK 3988 million (NOK 3625 million), and the weakening of the EUR against NOK explains NOK 97 million (NOK 1193 million). The Group has four loan portfolios in NOK, SEK, EUR and USD, respectively. The portfolios are exposed to both variable and fixed interest rates, with exposure to variable interest rates amounting to 63%. The average current interest rates in 2011 for loans denoted in NOK were 4.6%, in SEK 2.9%, in EUR 3.9% and in USD 3.6%. Debt in USD is in relation to project financing in SN Power. Statkraft has entered into agreements with its financial counterparties for the settlement of interest and currency rate changes in value, limiting counterparty risk resulting from derivative contracts to one week’s changes in value (cash collateral). Taxes The recorded tax expense was NOK 1721 million lower than in 2010, and amounted to NOK 3427 million. The decline in tax costs was primarily due to a lower result before tax, Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors 13 but was partly offset by recording negative resource rent income carryforwards in 2010 of INVESTMENTS IN NEW CAPACITY about NOK 1400 million as income.

This reorganisation was finalised with Loans in nonNorwegian the implementation of new segments effective as of 1 January 2011. The segment structure markets is presented on the basis of the internal management information which the management ­systematically reviews and uses for resource allocation and goal attainment. The segments are Nordic hydropower, Continental energy and trading, International hydropower, Wind power, District heating and Industrial ownership. Areas not shown as separate segments are presented under the heading Other business. LONG-TERM LIABILITIES, DEBT REDEMPTION PROFILE NOK mill. Nordic hydropower is the largest segment and includes hydropower plants in the Nordic 8 000 region. The production assets are mainly flexible and include 169 hydropower plants in ­Norway (107), Sweden (59) and Finland (4), with a total installed capacity of more than 6 000 10 500 MW. The segment’s revenues come mainly from sale of power in the spot market 4 000 as well as long-term contracts, the latter mostly with power-intensive industry in Norway. In Norway, Statkraft also delivers concessionary power. Multiple-year reservoirs and the 2 000 flexibility of the power plants enable optimisation of power production in relation to the hydrological situation and price situation. Nordic hydropower is therefore optimised over 0 longer time periods than one year. 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 >2022 Loans in subsidiaries Continental energy and trading includes gas power plants in Germany and Norway, hydroLoans in Statkraft AS Loans from Statkraft SF (back to back) power plants in Germany and the UK and bio-based power plants in Germany, as well as Baltic Cable, the subsea cable between Sweden and Germany. Total installed capacity for the segment’s 20 power plants is slightly less than 2500 MW, while Baltic Cable has a capacity of 600 MW. The power production is optimised in relation to the prices on input factors (fuel, carbon and hydrology) and sales prices (power and green certificates). The segment includes trading and origination, as well as revenue optimisation and risk mitigation related to both the Continental and Nordic production. This enables the Group to exploit its overall market expertise in the best possible manner. The trading involves extensive use of standardised and structured power contracts, gas, coal, oil and carbon. International hydropower operates in emerging economies with expected high growth and substantial need for energy. Statkraft focuses on selected markets where the Group’s hydropower expertise can be applied. The activities include the shareholding of 60% in SN Power as well as the Group’s hydropower activities in Southeast Europe with emphasis on Turkey and Albania. SN Power owns interests in 20 hydropower plants in South America, Asia and Africa, as well as one wind farm and one thermal power plant in South America. These power plants have a total installed capacity of 990 MW (SN Power’s share). In addition, SN Power owns two hydropower plants totalling 197 MW (SN Power’s percentage) under construction. SN Power is also engaged in power trading in Brazil. In Turkey, Statkraft owns a hydropower plant of 20 MW, while three hydropower plants totalling 619 MW are under construction. Investments are often made in partnership with local players or international investors. The segment’s result is characterised by expensing substantial costs in connection with project development. Wind power includes Statkraft’s investments in land-based and offshore wind power. The segment has five land-based wind farms in operation in Norway, Sweden and the UK, with a total installed capacity of 276 MW. The revenues mainly derive from sale of power at spot prices as well as green certificates. In addition, the segment has three wind farms – two in Sweden and one in the UK – under construction. These will have an installed capacity Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors 15 t­ otalling 129 MW (Statkraft’s share), and are scheduled for completion in 2012 and 2013. In ­Norway and Sweden, the segment has a large project portfolio within land-based wind, where the priority is to achieve final licences so that construction can start. Offshore wind concentrates on the UK market. Statkraft and Statoil own the offshore wind farm ­Sheringham Shoal 50-50. The wind farm will have an installed capacity of 317 MW and is scheduled for completion in 2012. Together with three partners, the offshore wind projects at Dogger Bank are being developed towards the licence application stage. In addition to the write-down on the investment in Sheringham Shoal, the result has also been characterised by expensing of project development costs. Project development costs will for a period ­continue to impact the segment result. District heating operates in Norway and Sweden. Further growth will primarily take place in Norway where Statkraft is one of the two largest suppliers of district heating. The total installed capacity is 377 MW in Norway and 231 MW in Sweden. In Norway, about 700 commercial customers and about 9000 households are supplied with district heating, while about key figures 2011 – SEGMENTs Continental InterStatkraft AS Nordic energy and national Wind District Industrial Unit Group hydropower trading hydropower power heating ownership Other Income statement Gross operating revenues NOK mill 22 298 12 674 4 106 1 065 350 555 7 842 -4 295 Net operating revenues NOK mill 18 120 12 045 1 230 796 329 357 3 198 165 EBITDA, underlying NOK mill 10 851 9 119 -17 219 -0 146 1 746 -363 Operating profit, underlying NOK mill 8 390 8 002 -413 -1 -104 40 1 297 -430 Unrealised changes in value and non-recurring items NOK mill -2 187 -765 -1 347 -92 59 -42 Operating profit NOK mill 6 203 7 236 -1 760 -93 -104 40 1 356 -472 Share of profit from assosiates and joint ventures NOK mill 898 0 -98 449 -389 4 933 -2 Balance sheet Investments in associated companies and joint ventures NOK mill 16 109 -0 533 5 875 650 1 9 050 0 Other assets NOK mill 127 768 48 761 5 759 8 467 2 711 2 660 13 899 45 511 Total assets NOK mill 143 878 48 761 6 292 14 342 3 361 2 661 22 949 45 511 Investments, maintenance NOK mill 1 129 469 303 69 1 8 248 32 Investments, new capacity NOK mill 5 217 1 397 1 446 959 491 401 348 175 Investments in shares NOK mill 1 923 0 585 1 051 187 97 2 Upstream business Installed capacity MW 15 763 10 555 2 474 1 010 276 1 355 94 Production, actual TWh 51.5 38.2 4.9 2.4 0.7 4.9 0.3 – of which hydropower TWh 46.0 38.2 0.3 2.3 4.9 0.3 – of which gas power TWh 4.6 4.6 – of which wind power TWh 0.8 0.1 0.7 – of which bio power TWh 0.1 0.1 District heating Installed capacity MW 665 608 57 Heating supplied GWh 815 771 44 Number of customers Thousand 12 11 1 Downstream business Number of distribution grid customers Thousand 181 181 Energy supplied TWh 7.1 7.1 Number of end-user customers Thousand 408 408 Total volume supplied TWh 11.9 11.9 16 Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors 1600 customers in Sweden receive district heating. The revenues are influenced by power prices, grid tariffs and taxes, and the price to customers is adjusted monthly or quarterly. Waste, biomass, oil and gas are important input factors in the production of district heating. In Norway, the customer basis is being strengthened through mandatory connection. Industrial ownership includes management and development of Norwegian shareholdings. The segment comprises the companies Skagerak Energi AS, Fjordkraft AS, BKK AS (49.9% shareholding), Istad AS (49%) and Agder Energi AS (45.5%). The two former companies are included in the consolidated financial statements, while the other three companies are reported as associates. Skagerak Energi’s activities are concentrated around the production of power, district heating operations, distribution grid operations, electrical contracting activities and natural gas distribution. The production assets comprise 45 wholly and partlyowned hydropower plants with a total installed capacity of 1355 MW, as well as 57 MW of district heating. The company has about 181 000 distribution grid customers and more than 700 district heating customers. Fjordkraft’s activities are concentrated around the sale of electricity to households and companies, and the company had more than 400 000 ­customers at the end of 2011. Other activities includes Small-scale hydropower, the shareholding of 4.17% in E.ON AG, real estate management in Trondheim (sold in 2011), innovation, group functions and ­eliminations. The pro forma figures for 2010 also include Trondheim Energi Nett AS and the solar energy activities, which were divested in 2010. Strategy Increased need for clean energy creates business opportunities for Statkraft. The strategic platform aims for growth in: • European flexible power production and market operations • International hydropower • Wind power in Norway, Sweden and the UK • District heating and small-Scale hydro in Norway In addition to these areas, Statkraft will continue to support a sound development in the regional companies in Norway where Statkraft has ownership interests. Furthermore, the innovation strategy has been amended to strengthen Statkraft in the growth areas. Statkraft’s strategy is based on an evaluation of the market’s attractiveness and Statkraft’s ability to create value. In December 2010, Statkraft received NOK 14 billion in new equity from the owner to implement the Group’s strategy. The premises for the strategy are that business development, construction and operation of power plants must be based on high health, safety and environment standards. The planned activities in emerging markets outside of Europe contribute to increased challenges in connection with the risk of corruption, health, safety and the environment as well as upholding Statkraft’s corporate social responsibilities. These challenges must be handled in a satisfactory manner over time in order to create value. European flexible power production and market operations: Statkraft’s ambition in ­European flexible power production is to maintain the position as Europe’s largest producer of hydropower and be an important supplier of flexible power production to Europe. On the basis of fundamental market analysis and a well-defined business model, Statkraft seeks to exploit the power plants’ flexibility to produce electricity when commercially attractive and the need for power is greatest. Statkraft will prioritise modernisation and expansion, as well as further development of expertise, models and systems to ensure ­efficient operations and increased creation of value from existing hydro and gas-fired Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors 17 power plants. The Group furthermore seeks to increase profitability and reduce risk through market operations. Statkraft will consider portfolio optimisation and selective investments in hydropower in north-western Europe. The Group will prioritise hydropower in the Nordic region, Germany, France and the UK. The market outlook for north-western Europe is uncertain due to expectations of low or possibly negative growth in demand and considerable increase in renewable energy production. Statkraft will therefore emphasise understanding of the consequences for the future power balance, power prices and the value of flexible power production. International hydropower: Statkraft has a strategy for development of hydropower with ambitions to strengthen the Group’s position in attractive emerging markets. Statkraft inge ryan invests in international hydropower both directly and through the subsidiary SN Power. Member of Statkraft’s Audit Committee, The strategy for international hydropower is based on expected economic growth in Board member since 2010 selected markets, increased need for clean energy as well as a large potential for hydropower. Statkraft and SN Power have sound expertise related to development and production of hydropower which can form the basis for creation of value in new markets. Statkraft is developing hydropower production in the Turkish market, and is planning development of the Devoll project in Albania together with the Austrian company EVN. SN Power prioritises development of hydropower in Peru, Chile, Nepal, India and the Philippines, where company already owns production capacity. SN Power also develops investment opportunities in Brazil and Vietnam. Agua Imara, a subsidiary of SN Power, is considering investment opportunities in southern Africa and in Central America. Wind power: Statkraft’s ambition is to establish a position among the most profitable and cost-effective players in the industry within onshore wind power in Norway and Sweden. As regards onshore and offshore wind power in the UK, Statkraft’s ambition is to develop a future attractive position. The wind power market in Europe is considered to be attractive due to the rising need for new renewable power production. Public subsidy schemes and reduced costs for wind power are necessary to maintain satisfactory profitability. Statkraft has a large project portfolio in Norway and Sweden. Statkraft will prioritise the work to secure binding licenses, establish cost-effective solutions within development, operation and maintenance and strengthen the wind analysis expertise. Within offshore wind power, Statkraft owns Sheringham Shoal 50-50 with Statoil. The project is scheduled for completion in 2012. The Group develops projects on the Dogger Bank in the UK up to the license stage in cooperation with partners. Any investment decisions for the projects on the Dogger Bank will be made at a later point in time. District heating and small-scale hydro: Statkraft’s ambition is to further develop profitability, strengthen its position as one of the two largest district heating players in Norway and realise growth also outside existing license areas. In Sweden, Statkraft plans further development of existing plants, but has no ambitions regarding growth in new areas. Statkraft’s ambition within small-scale hydropower production in Norway is to grow through industrial ownership in Småkraft AS. Småkraft invests in and builds small-scale hydropower plants in partnership with local landowners. Småkraft AS is owned by Statkraft AS (40%), Skagerak Energi AS (20%), BKK AS (20%) and Agder Energi AS (20%). Corporate governance Statkraft’s corporate governance will contribute to sustainable and lasting value creation in the Group. Efficient and transparent management and control of the business will form the basis for creating long-term values for the owner, employees, 18 Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors other stakeholders and society in general, and will help inspire confidence among stakeholders through predictability and credibility. Open and accessible communication will ensure that the company has a good relationship with society in general and the stakeholders who are affected by the company’s activities in particular. Statkraft applies the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance (NUES) within the framework established by the company’s organisation and ownership. Non-compliances are attributable to the fact that Statkraft is not a publicly listed company and that the Norwegian state is the sole owner of the company, as well as restrictions contained in the Articles of Association. The non-compliances relate to non-discrimination of shareholders, tradability of shares, dividends, the annual general meeting, the election committee and the corporate assembly. Statkraft also applies the Norwegian State’s ten principles for good ownership. Corporate governance and management, and an account of business management pursuant to Section 3-3b of the Accounting act are described in detail in the chapter “Corporate ­governance” in the annual report on Statkraft’s website. The work of the Board of Directors There were no changes in the Board’s composition in 2011. The Board of Statkraft AS held 12 board meetings in 2011. In addition to day-to-day operations and the Board’s follow-up of new industrial power agreements, a significant share of the Board’s work in 2011 was in relation to SN Power’s investment decisions and development of hydropower plants in Asia and South America. Statkraft is also in the process of establishing a presence as a significant hydropower player in Turkey, onshore wind power in the Nordic region and offshore wind power in the UK. Over the course of 2011, Statkraft also became an important player in district heating in the Nordic region. The Board has appointed an audit committee consisting of four of the directors. The audit committee has held five meetings during the course of the year. The Board also has a compensation committee consisting of the chair of the Board and two of the Board members. The compensation committee has held two meetings during the course of the year. Risk management The key risk factors for Statkraft relate to market operations, treasury management, project execution, operating activities and framework conditions. The international growth contributes to increased project risk, both in the development and construction phases. Handling of risk is important for value creation and is an integrated part of all business activities. The administration has a central investment committee that evaluates risk, profitability and strategic adaptations related to individual investments and across the project portfolio. The most important risks from the individual units and risks that are relevant to the Group as a whole are aggregated and included in Statkraft’s corporate risk map. The risk map is reported to and followed up by the Corporate management and Board. There are substantial volume and price risks related to power production and trading. In the Nordic power market, precipitation levels and winter temperatures are of great significance and cause considerable fluctuations in both prices and output volumes. In addition, power prices are influenced by the price of gas, coal, oil and carbon. In addition, gas power production is directly exposed to both gas, oil, electricity and carbon. Statkraft manages this market risk by trading in physical and financial instruments in several markets. The increased integration of the energy markets is of great significance for business models and risk management, and great emphasis is placed on analysing the different markets in connection. Internal mandates have been established for all trading, and these are subject to continuous follow-up. Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors 19 The central treasury department coordinates and manages the financial risk associated with foreign currencies, interest rates and liquidity, including refinancing and new borrowing. The most important instruments for risk management are forward currency contracts, interest swap agreements and forward interest agreements. Currency and interest rate risk are regulated by means of mandates. Furthermore, limits have been set for liquidity and counterparty risk, and the exposure and credit rating of counterparties are carefully monitored. Both market risk and the other financial risk, as well as exposure connected to the issued mandates, are followed up by independent middle office functions, and are regularly reported to Group management and the Board. All processes in the value chain are exposed to operational risk. There are many risks and challenges related to the execution of the Group’s investment projects and operations. THORBJØRN HOLØS The safety of our employees and contractors is critical and requires high level of attention, Employee-elected Board member, both as regards injuries, accidents and security. The most critical aspects are in ­connection member of Statkraft’s Audit Committee, Board member since 2002 with the development of Statkraft’s international activities. Major attention is given to development of sound systems and learning, establishing barriers and ensuring compliance to avoid delays, cost overruns and incidents. Risk associated with framework conditions and the effect of political decisions is significant, and Statkraft has implemented systems for handling of regulatory issues. Exposure to ­subsidy schemes in connection with the development of clean energy in a number of markets and uncertainty in relation to their future development are emphasised when making investment decisions. Internal control Internal control is a key element in sound risk management, and Statkraft is focusing on f­ urther development of internal control. Statkraft has a system for internal ­control over financial reporting that shall ensure reliable financial reporting. Statkraft has a corporate audit function to assist the Board and management in making an independent and impartial evaluation of whether the Group’s internal control procedures and significant risks are sufficiently managed and supervised. Corporate Audit shall also contribute to on-going quality improvement in internal management and control systems. Statkraft has a management system that includes all governing documents and facilitates an efficient, systematic and uniform management of the Group with sufficient degree of ­formalisation, documentation and compliance. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT The purpose of Statkraft’s activities within innovation, technology and research and development (R&D) is to strengthen the company’s competitive advantages within the core activities, and monitor trends and developments that may influence the markets Statkraft operates in. The operational R&D work is performed in the business areas, and in cooperation with external R&D units with complementary expertise. Results are measured on the basis of generated value creation. Statkraft is the largest industrial player in the scheme Centres for Environmentfriendly Energy Research (FME) and expensed NOK 150 million on R&D in 2011. Three R&D programmes have been established to strengthen the competitiveness of the company. These are Future hydropower, Competitive wind power and Energy from biomass. Projects concluded in 2011 have contributed to (i) improved production planning for power plants through further development of power optimisation and risk management tools, (ii) increased effect in the low load range for Francis turbines through implementation of a ­nozzle system for reduction of pressure pulsations, (iii) new methods for optimal management and maintenance monitoring of wind turbines, (iv) new qualification routines for risk 20 Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors reduction in the development of offshore wind turbines, as well as (v) reduced energy costs and emissions in the district heating activities through optimisation of the combustion ­process in some bio-based district heating plants. In addition, activities have been established in areas that may affect Statkraft’s markets or, in the longer term, become new business opportunities: Osmotic power uses the osmotic potential arising between fresh water and salt water, and Statkraft opened the world’s first osmotic power prototype at Tofte in 2009. Statkraft is working with the aim of developing an osmotic power pilot of 1-2 MW. A cooperation agreement was entered into in 2011 with the Japanese company Nitto Denko, one of the largest ODD VANVIK global players in membrane production. Employee-elected Board member, member of Statkraft’s ­Compensation Flexible power generation is a central pillar of Statkraft’s activities and analyses are ­Committee, Board ­member since 1993 ­therefore prepared of various other storage technologies (battery technologies, flywheels, compressed air storage) that are alternatives to water reservoirs. Optimised use of smart grids, distributed energy resources and consumer flexibility aim to provide higher reliability, higher efficiency in the energy distribution and improved flexibility as regards demand. Statkraft is looking into the possibility of establishing a district heating plant based on ­geothermal energy in connection with one of Statkraft’s district heating plants. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Corporate responsibility in Statkraft Responsible practice is the basis for all of Statkraft’s activities. This means that the Group’s activities must be conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and in line with Statkraft’s internal guidelines and good international practice in areas such as health and safety, environment, human rights and anti-corruption. Corporate responsibility is a line responsibility and an integrated part of the business from assessment of country risk and project development to day-to-day operations. Statkraft is a member of the UN’s Global Compact and is committed to following up the ­initiative and its ten principles. The following is a brief summary of Statkraft’s work and results in the corporate responsibility area in 2011. A more detailed review can be found in the Corporate Responsibility report. Sound business practice Statkraft’s fundamental ethical principles are described in Statkraft’s Code of conduct. The Code of conduct applies to all companies and employees in the Statkraft Group, and Statkraft’s business partners are expected to have standards that are consistent with Statkraft’s Code of conduct. In 2011, Statkraft also further developed its ethical guidelines aimed at the Group’s suppliers. Dilemma training for both managers and employees form an important component of the ethics work in Statkraft. To support these efforts, handbooks and training programmes on anti-corruption andhealth and safety were launched in 2011. In addition, corporate responsibility was a topic in several workshops and training sessions for both managers and new employees. Statkraft encourages employees to blow the whistle on questionable conditions and has facilitated this through the Group audit, which is an independent whistleblowing channel. No whistleblower cases were registered in 2011. Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors 21 Role in society Statkraft creates values for owners and local communities where the Group is present. It is important for Statkraft to maintain good relations with all stakeholders and the Group therefore emphasises an open dialogue and collaboration with everyone affected by the company’s activities. Over the course of 2011, Statkraft contributed NOK 8841 million (NOK 17 472 million) in financial value creation, of which NOK 4288 million (NOK 5973 million) was returned to the owner as ­dividend, while taxes and fees to the state and municipalities amounted to NOK 4987 million (NOK 6679 million). Statkraft’s total investments in the balance sheet of 2011 amounted to NOK 8269 million (NOK 3740 million), of which NOK 3641 million (NOK 1999 million) in Norway and NOK 4628 million (NOK 1741 million) abroad. Of these investments, 63% were connected to expansion of p ­ roduction capacity. In 2011, as in previous years, the Statkraft Fund awarded NOK 5 million to organisations and projects that in various ways focus on the connections between energy, climate and ­sustainable development. Corporate responsibility in projects In 2011, Statkraft has further developed a decision-­ making model for the execution of major development projects. The model presents a ­system of common terms and concepts and ensures a comprehensive approach from the early phase and through stepwise decision processes in the Group. The basic principle is that each main decision must be accompanied by structured and documented information on several topics, including corporate responsibility, as part of the basis for decisions. The model will be further developed in 2012 with focus on training. Environmental impact No serious environmental incidents were registered in 2011. However, 185 less serious environmental incidents were registered (92), of which three with high ­environmental risk and 51 breached applicable license terms. Most of the environmental ­incidents were short-term breaches of the operations provisions, minor oil spills and nonconformities in connection with waste management. These incidents had little or no effect on the environment. Statkraft works to map and limit the activities’ impact on biodiversity in Norwegian water regulation areas. A mapping of the Nore catchment area was completed in 2011. Mapping of another four water regulation areas has started and will be completed in 2012. As regards follow-up of the operations’ impact on biodiversity, the focus is on migrating fish – in particular salmon and eel (hydropower), birds of prey in particular sea eagles and golden eagles (onshore wind power) and marine mammals (offshore wind power). Statkraft’s greenhouse gas emissions amounted to 1 161 900 tonnes of CO2 equivalents in 2011 (1 693 400 tonnes), of which 93% was from the Group’s gas power activities. The Group buys emission quotas in the voluntary CO2 quota market to neutralise greenhouse gas emissions from fuel consumption, business travel and accidental emissions. In 2011, about 91% of the Group’s power and district heating production was based on renewable energy sources. In 2011, Statkraft consumed 1150 GWh of electricity (737 GWh). All electricity consumed in the Group has been certified as renewable in accordance with RECS (Renewable Energy Certificate System). A major energy efficiency project was initiated at the production unit’s Norwegian hydropower plants in 2010. The goal is to reduce energy consumption by 35 GWh/year. The first part of the project (Nore, Rana and Aura power plant groups) was completed in 2011 and will be continued in more power plant groups in 2012. The efficiency drive primarily involves installation of control systems for pumps, ventilation, heating and lighting. 22 Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors In 2011, Statkraft generated 96 700 tonnes of hazardous waste from power and heat ­production. This is treated in accordance with applicable regulations. The main part of this (99.7%) is residual products from waste incineration plants and bio combustion plants. Employees and organisation At the end of 2011, the Group had 3358 full-time equivalents (3301). This is an increase of 2% compared with 2010. The Group has employees in 24 countries, and 33% (28%) of the staff work outside Norway. The average service time in Statkraft is 10.7 years and the employee turnover in 2011 was 6.8%. Statkraft strives to attain a more even gender distribution in the Group, and more women in managerial positions. In 2011, 23% of the Group’s employees were women (23%) and the percentage of women in managerial positions was 20% (22%). The female percentage in ­Norway (25 %) is somewhat higher than in other countries. The female percentage among new employees was 23%. The Group strives to obtain a more even gender distribution in the manager development programme. 44% of Statkraft’s board members are women. The Board follows up the work to achieve an even gender balance, including compliance with statutory requirements relating to gender distribution in the Boards of subsidiaries and companies where Statkraft has major ownership interests. Statkraft wants a diverse working environment and considers equal treatment a tenet in its recruitment and HR policy. Employees and others involved in Statkraft’s activities will be selected and treated in a non-discriminatory manner. Statkraft works in a focused and systematic manner to recruit and is an attractive employer both among graduates and experienced employees. The Group has a popular trainee ­programme which was continued with 6 new trainees in 2011. Good leadership and a positive working environment which provides development opportunities are strategically important areas in Statkraft. Statkraft’s management platform was revised in 2011. The platform highlights the most important drivers for sound management as regards the company’s further development and to achieve the Group’s strategic ­ambitions. In 2011, an employee survey was held in Statkraft, Skagerak Energi and SN Power. The purpose of the survey was to improve Statkraft as a workplace, and the results will be followed up by each individual department. In 2010, Statkraft entered into an agreement with the European Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU) concerning the establishment of a European works council (Statkraft European Works Council, SEWC). The works council was established in 2011 with employee representatives from Norway, Sweden, Germany and the UK. SEWC ensures a good flow of information about decisions that affect the organisation in different ways, and provides employee ­representatives from the different countries with a formal and accepted arena where they LOST-TIME AND TOTAL RECORDABLE INJURIE RATES FOR EMPLOYEES AND SUPPLIERS can meet the corporate management. 20 Health and safety Statkraft has a clear goal of zero working accidents with serious consequences, but this has not been achieved in 2011. The same goals and requirements relating 15 to health and safety apply wherever Statkraft has activities. Clear requirements and close 10 follow-up in all operations and project phases are decisive to achieve safe and sound ­workplaces and good results. 5 In 2011, five fatal accidents took place in connection with Statkraft’s activities. 0 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 In the Istad Group in Norway, where Statkraft owns 49%, an employee died in February LTI – employees TRI – employees when a tracked vehicle tipped over. In December, a contractor died in the Kargi development LTI – contractors project in Turkey, where Statkraft owns 100%, when he was hit by scaffolding elements and TRI – contractors then fell from a height. Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors 23 Three fatal accidents took place in the expansion project at Theun Hinboun (THXP) in Laos, where Statkraft SF owns 20%. In January, a contractor died after being crushed by the boom of a forklift during work in a head race tunnel. In March, a contractor died from electrocution during work below a 22 kV power line, while one contractor died in November in connection with power line construction. In addition to police investigation, all fatal accidents have been reviewed by independent investigations immediately following the incidents. The investigation reports, including improvement measures, have then been presented to and followed up in the respective boards. A number of measures have been implemented following the accidents, for example increased focus on applicable guidelines for working at heights and use of safety equipment. In general, lena halvari all projects emphasise sound health and safety expertise among own employees and basic Employee-elected Board member, safety training of all employees with contractors and subcontractors to an even greater extent. Board ­member since 2010 The indicator for lost-time injuries, LTI rate, was 4.5 (3.4) among the Group’s employees in 2011, while the indicator for all types of injuries, TRI rate, was 10.0 (6.8). For contractor employees, LTI rate was 3.4 (13.6) and TRI rate was 6.2 (16.4) in 2011. In total, 280 injuries (81) were recorded, of which 141 (52) were lost-time injuries, among the Group’s employees and contractor employees. The total number of injuries has risen significantly in 2011, primarily due to the fact that all activities where Statkraft’s shareholding exceeds 20% as of 2011 have now been included. Earlier figures only included businesses where Statkraft’s shareholding exceeded 50%. There was a marked decline in the injury frequency for contractor employees from 2010 to 2011. The decline is assumed to be the result of both the injury-preventive work and a safer and more complete registration of hours worked, but the result is far from ­satisfactory as there have been several fatal accidents involving contractor employees. The Group emphasises learning from injuries, near-misses and unsafe conditions. In 2011, 6125 unsafe conditions and 365 near-misses were recorded. There has been a special focus on implementing common routines for investigation of serious incidents and further ­highlighting health and safety requirements in all project phases. This has been supported by training measures on different levels, which will be continued in 2012. Several focused campaigns have also been initiated, including a traffic safety campaign in SN Power aiming to reduce the risk of traffic accidents and a health and safety campaign in the production unit aiming especially to reduce the number of eye injuries. Absence due to illness in Statkraft was 3.4% in 2011 (3.4%), which was below the target of 4.0 %. All Norwegian companies in the Group have entered into Inclusive workplace (IA) agreements, with active follow-up of absence and close cooperation with the company health service. RESULT ALLOCATION The Board of Statkraft SF proposes a dividend of NOK 4288 million, corresponding to 85% of the dividend basis. The dividend basis is calculated as the consolidated result for Statkraft SF after tax and minority interests, adjusted for unrealised gains and losses. The dividend will be disbursed from Statkraft SF, and in order to provide Statkraft SF with sufficient ability to ­disburse dividend, the Board proposes the following allocation of the net profit in Statkraft AS: Amounts in NOK million Net profit in Statkraft AS’ company accounts 1 838 Allocation of net profit for the year: Allocated dividend from Statkraft AS to Statkraft SF 4 900 Transfer from (-) other equity -3 062 The parent company’s distributable equity was NOK 11 704 million at year-end. 24 Statkraft annual report 2011 Report from the Board of Directors outlook Statkraft is well-positioned at the beginning of 2012. High inflow and mild weather combined with relatively low production in the Nordic region in the fourth quarter have resulted in a positive resource situation. The Group has secured a solid flexibility which provides the opportunity to step up production in response to high demand. In accordance with the Group’s strategy, the project activity level is high, especially within wind power, hydropower and district heating. Statkraft is a significant developer of hydropower, nationally and internationally, through its own organisation and SN Power. The growth is driven by growing demand for energy internationally and the need for energy with the lowest possible carbon emissions. In Europe, Nordic hydropower is expected to gain an even more important role as the need for flexible power increases with the increasing share of solar and wind power. The flexible hydropower production, combined with more cables for power exchange between the Nordic region and the Continent, represents a significant potential for long-term, sustainable value creation. In Germany, Statkraft will replace the phased-out older gas power in Emden with an ­ongoing expansion at Knapsack. Statkraft has several wind farms under construction, and assumes that the continuation of subsidy regimes for wind power and cost cuts will ensure profitability in new projects as well. Statkraft’s Board and Corporate management focus on efficient operations and further ­profitable development through long-term investments, as well as good exploitation of ­market positions, human resources and opportunities.

The Group reports operating segments in accordance with how the corporate management makes, follows up and evaluates its decisions. The operating segments have been identified on the basis of internal management information that is periodically reviewed by the management and used as a basis for resource allocation and key performance review. As a result of a change in the Group's strategy, Statkraft was reorganised in 2010. This reorganisation was finalised with the implementation of new segments effective as of 1 January 2011. The financial information in this report has been reclassified in accordance with the new segment structure. We are presenting the underlying results for each of the segments. The underlying results consist of ordinary results, adjusted for unrealised effects from energy contracts (excluding Trading & Origination) and material non-recurring items. The segments that have been implemented with effect from 1 January 2011 are: Nordic hydropower is the largest segment and includes hydropower plants in the Nordic region. The production assets consist mainly of water regulation facilities and include hydropower plants in Norway, Sweden and Finland. Continental energy and trading includes gas power plants in Germany and Norway, hydropower plants in Germany and the UK and bio-based power plants in Germany, as well as Baltic Cable AB, the subsea cable between Sweden and Germany. The segment includes trading and origination, as well as revenue optimization and risk mitigation related to both the Continental and Nordic production. In this manner, the Group can take advantage of its overall market expertise in the best possible manner. International hydropower operates in emerging economies with expected high growth and substantial need for energy. Statkraft focuses on selected markets where the Group's hydropower expertise can be applied. Wind power includes Statkraft's investments in land-based and offshore wind power. The segment has land-based wind farms in operation in Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Offshore wind concentrates on the UK market. District heating operates in Norway and Sweden. Further growth will primarily take place in Norway where Statkraft is one of the two largest suppliers of district heating. Industrial ownership includes management and development of Norwegian shareholdings. The segment includes companies that are consolidated in the consolidated accounts, and companies that are reported as associates. Other activities include small-scale hydropower, the shareholding of 4.17% in E.ON AG, innovation, internal financial loans to other segments from Statkraft Treasury Centre and group functions. Group items include non-recurring items, unrealised effects on energy contracts excluding Trading & Origination, eliminations and unallocated assets.

The fundamental basis for Statkraft's revenues comprises power prices, water management and production. Statkraft optimises its hydropower generation based on an assessment of the value of available water in relation to actual and expected future spot prices. This is done irrespectively of contracts entered into. In the event that Statkraft has physical contractual obligations to supply power that deviate from actual output, the difference is either bought or sold on the spot market. Necessary spot purchases are recorded as a correction to power sales. Physical and financial contracts are used to hedge underlying production in the form of purchase and sales positions. Sales positions are taken to hedge the price of a specific part of the planned future output. Buying positions are taken to adjust the hedging level if the assumptions change and Statkraft is considered to have a too highly hedged position. All contracts are recognised as adjustments to the underlying revenue from production based on the margin between the contract price and the spot price (system price for financial contracts).

As a result of this, intercompany purchases performed by Fjordkraft AS are presented on a separate line. Statkraft has long-term physical sales contracts with power-intensive industrial customers and the wood processing industry at prices set by the Norwegian Storting (parliament), as well as obligations to supply power to local authorities at concessionary prices. These contracts are entered into at prices below the market level. Statutory-priced industrial contracts mostly ran out in 2011. In addition, Statkraft has a number of other physical contractual obligations of varying duration to both Norwegian and international customers. 08 OTHER OPERATING REVENUES NOK million 2011 2010 Power plant leasing revenues 453 522 Other leasing and service revenues 387 230 Other operating revenues 607 721 Total 1 447 1 473 Other operating revenues include a gain of NOK 126 million from the sale of Sluppen Eiendom AS.

Statkraft entered into several long-term power sales contracts in the first half of 2011. Statkraft then decided to change its accounting policies for power sales agreements entered into in EUR where the other contractual party uses NOK as its functional currency. 2) Gas purchase agreements previously regarded as own use, are now treated as financial instruments because of changes in the contents of the agreements. 11 SALARIES AND PAYROLL COSTS AND NUMBER OF FULL-TIME EQUIVALENTS NOK million 2011 2010 Salary 1 970 1 817 Employers' national insurance contribution 306 295 Pension costs 362 36 Other benefits 121 239 Total 2 759 2 387 The Group employed an average of 3329 full-time equivalents in 2011. The corresponding figure for 2010 was 3414. As of 31 December 2011 the Group employed 3358 full-time equivalents. The corresponding figure for 2010 was 3301. Pension costs are described in further detail in Note 12. 12 PENSIONS Defined benefit schemes Funded defined benefit schemes The companies in the Group have organised their pension schemes in the National Pension Fund (SPK), own pension funds as well as in insurance companies. Employees in the Group’s Norwegian companies participate in public service occupational pension schemes in accordance with the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund Act, the Norwegian Public Pension Service Pension Fund Transfer Agreement and the regulatory framework governing public service pensions. 2468 employees and 1219 pensioners were covered by benefit schemes as of 31 December 2011. Pension benefits from the SPK are guaranteed by the Norwegian state (Section 1 of the Pension Act). The occupational pension schemes cover retirement, disability, surviving spouse and child’s pension. With maximum accrual, the retirement schemes provide pension benefits amounting to 66% of pensionable income, up to 12 times the National Insurance Scheme’s basic amount (G). In connection with the pension reform in 2010 changes were decided regarding adjustment for life expectancy, individual guarantee and new regulation of current pensions. The scheme change was recognized in the pension liability as of 31 December 2010. Adjustment for life expectancy will entail those born in 1943 or later, causing lower pension benefits than before. Employees born in 1958 or earlier will receive 66% of the pension base due to an individual guarantee. New regulation implies that accrual of pension rights will be regulated with the National Insurance Scheme's basic amount (G). Current pensions will be adjusted by the National Insurance Scheme's basic amount (G) less a fixed factor of 0.75 percentage points. 44 Statkraft annual report 2011 group financial statements Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report Pension scheme benefits are coordinated with the benefits provided by the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme. The majority of the companies also offer early retirement from the age of 62 under the Norwegian early retirement pension scheme. Employees who leave the company before pensionable age receive a deferred pension entitlement, provided they have been member of schemes in SPK for at least three years. In schemes that are part of SPK, participating companies are not responsible for these obligations. Deferred entitlements in the pension schemes will be continued as an obligation in the pension schemes. Companies with schemes in the SPK pay an annual premium and are responsible for the financing of the scheme. The SPK scheme is not asset-based, but management of the pension fund assets (fictitious assets) is simulated as though the assets were invested in 1-, 3-, 5or 10-year Norwegian government bonds or a combination of these. In this simulation it is assumed that the bonds are held to maturity. The pension assets are guaranteed by the Norwegian government and up to 35% of the pension fund assets can be invested in the Norwegian Government Pension Fund – Global, which is a real fund where yields are linked to the market situation. The investment choice principles have been set out in a separate investment strategy for the Statkraft Group's pension assets in SPK. The Group will not make any new investments in the Norwegian Government Pension Fund – Global. The pension schemes have placed the pension assets in a diversified portfolio of Norwegian and foreign interest-bearing securities, Norwegian and foreign shares, secured loans to members, hedge funds and properties through external asset managers. Definedbenefit schemes have been established for a limited number of employees in companies outside Norway. Defined-benefit schemes have been established for a limited number of employees in companies outside Norway. Unfunded defined benefit schemes In addition to the above, some Group companies in Norway have entered into pension agreements that provide all employees whose pensionable incomes exceed 12G with a retirement and disability pension equivalent to 66% of that portion of their pensionable income exceeding 12G. Due to new guidelines for companies owned by the Norwegian state, as stated by the Government 31 March 2011, the agreement is currently being revised. Employees who leave the company before pensionable age receive a deferred pension entitlement for the scheme above 12G, provided they have been member of schemes in SPK for at least three years. Actuarial calculations The present value of defined benefit pension liabilities and the current year’s accrued pension entitlements are calculated using the accrued benefits method. The net present value of pension benefits accrued at the balance sheet date adjusted for expected future salary increases until pensionable age is based on best estimate assumptions as of 31 December 2011. Calculations are based on staff numbers and salary data at the end of the year. Actuarial gains and losses in 2011 are mainly due to updated assumptions, staff numbers, actual salary increase and return on assets. Explanation of the background for selected assumptions/risk table as of 31 December 2011 The discount rate is set at 2.8% for Norwegian pension schemes and is calculated as a weighted average of the risk-free interest rate until the time when payments are expected to be made. Salary adjustments for Norwegian schemes are mainly calculated as the total of the expected nominal salary increase of 1.75%, inflation of 2.0% and career progression increase of 0.25%, with some minor adaptations. For the majority of the Norwegian schemes, adjustment of current pensions follows the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme's basic amount (G -0.75 percentage points). For demographic factors, the K2005, GAP07 and IR73 tariffs are used to establish mortality and disability risks. The stipulation of parameters which apply to foreign defined-benefit schemes is adapted to local conditions. Defined contribution schemes In companies outside of Norway, defined contribution schemes have been established in accordance with local statutes.

The reason for the impairment was improved knowledge about recently acquired facilities and therefore a better basis for estimating future cash flows. Property, plant and equipment include leased waterfall rights where power plants are owned and operated by the lessee. At the end of the lease agreement, Statkraft has mainly the right to acquire the plant facilities at a technical value. IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN 2011 Assets in gasand biomass power plants in Germany have been written down NOK 1087 millions due to impairment in 2011. New access to renewable energy in the market during 2011, a drop in power prices and increased gas prices have resulted in low margins for gas power plants in Germany. This, together with the fact that the German power market is in the middle of a significant and swift change, has driven the impairment. NOK million Carried value Value in use Impairment Landesbergen 447 77 370 Knapsack 4 895 4 309 586 Other 208 77 131 Total impairment 1 087 Impairment assessment In assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is calculated based on the value of the asset for the business. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Identification of an asset's cash-generating unit involves judgment by management at Statkraft. Statkraft annual report 2011 group financial statements 51 Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report The Knapsack power plant has two production plants, Knapsack I and Knapsack II, of which the latter is under construction. When Knapsack II is completed, the Knapsack plants will be operated as a single unit with common controlboard and common management. Under the development of Knapsack I in 2005, a major gas deal with Wingas was signed. When development of Knapsack II was decided in 2010, no major long-term gas contract was signed, partly because in the meantime, a liquid spot market for gas had developed in Germany. Due to changes in the market outlook, gas consumption in Knapsack I will be somewhat lower than expected in 2005, and Statkraft will from 2013 be able to optimize the original contract between the two production plants in the power plant. Moving production from one plant to another is associated with low costs. During periods of low demand, production will take place in the facility that can operate most cost effectively. Production stop for maintenance will also be optimized between the two plants. Thus, it is management's assessment that the cash inflows for the two plants at Knapsack are not independent of each other and that Knapsack is considered one single cash-generating unit. The power plant Landsbergen is a single plant and is considered to be a separate cash-generating unit. Other write-downs are related to small biomass plants. Basis of valuation The recoverable amount is based on value in use. Value in use is estimated using discounted future cash flows. Projected revenues are based on a combination of spotand capacity markets. In liquid periods, observable market prices are used, for subsequent periods, a combination of Statkraft's expectations for long-term spot prices and the expected market capacity are being used. Prices are linearly interpolated in the periods between 2015 and 2020, between 2020 and 2025 and between 2025 and 2035. Costs related to gas purchases are based on market prices for liquid periods and for subsequent periods; Statkraft’s long range price paths are used. Operating costs are based on fiscal year 2011 which is considered a representative year. Assets under construction are included in the value in use with accrued expenses at year end, and the remaining investment framework approved by Statkraft's management. For the power plants in operation, the anticipated maintenance expenditures are included. It is used a WACC before tax and which reflects specific risks relating to the relevant operating segment. Applied WACC is 10.2% before tax and 7.1% after tax. Evaluation of the assumptions used When calculating the expected value in use, assumptions regarding future revenues and costs are included. The estimated values are particularly sensitive to changes in future power prices and gas prices (spark spread), as well as WACC. Change in the discount rate by one percentage point (before tax) will affect the value in use with approximately NOK 300 million. A change in the spark spread with 10 percentage points will affect the value in use with approximately NOK 580 million. For plants under construction, any cost overruns which are not anticipated will also affect the estimated value in use. Changes in the mentioned assumptions going forward might change the conclusions drawn at 31 December 2011.

The share was recognised in the balance sheet with a carrying value of NOK 14 687 million at year-end 2010. The part of the change in value which can be attributed to currency changes and which is within corresponding currency change for loans in EUR is presented in the income statement under Unrealised changes in value financial items. The change in value in 2010 was NOK -5282 million, of which NOK -1193 million is due to lower exchange rate for EUR. In 2010, the E.ON AG shareholding has shown a lasting reduction in market value compared with the original cost price. This entailed a need for write-down of the shares by an amount that includes earlier changes in value recognised in comprehensive income. The change in share value in 2010 amounted to NOK -4088 million. Previous changes in value recognised in comprehensive income amounted to NOK 463 million as of 2009. As a result of a lasting reduction in value, the income statement has been charged with NOK -3625 million under unrealised changes in value financial items. 54 Statkraft annual report 2011 group financial statements Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report 21 INVENTORIES 2011 2010 Recognised Recognised NOK million value Cost price value Cost price Value at net realisable value: Green certificates 390 447 435 446 CO2 quotas 285 485 349 382 Total 675 932 784 828 Valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value: Spare parts 98 82 Other 200 147 Total inventories are values at the lower of cost and net realisable value 298 229 Total 973 1 013 22 RECEIVABLES NOK million 2011 2010 Accounts receivable 4 823 5 739 Accrued revenues etc. 1 937 1 190 Short-term loans to associates and JVs 3 069 1 527 Debt connected to cash collateral 396 171 Other receivables 1 785 2 121 Total 12 010 10 748 Of which interest-bearing 3 465 1 698 Maturity analysis of receivables Non-impaired receivables, overdue by 2011 Less than More than NOK million Not yet due 90 days 90 days Total Account receivable 4 516 232 74 4 823 Other receivables 7 187 7 187 Total 11 704 232 74 12 010 Recognised as loss for the year 26 Non-impaired receivables, overdue by 2010 Less than More than NOK million Not yet due 90 days 90 days Total Account receivable 5 280 269 190 5 739 Other receivables 5 007 1 1 5 009 Total 10 287 270 191 10 748 Recognised as loss for the year 9 23 SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS NOK million 2011 2010 Bonds 224 214 Money market fund 115 115 Shares and other investments 116 95 Total 455 424 24 Derivatives The table below shows derivatives with respective positive and negative market values allocated by portfolio.

See note 26. 29 USE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial instruments account for a significant part of Statkraft’s total balance sheet and are of material importance for the Group’s financial position and results. Most of the financial instruments can be categorised into the two main categories of financial activities and energy trading. In addition to the above, other financial instruments exist in the form of accounts receivable, accounts payable, cash, short-term financial investments and equity investments. Financial instruments in energy trading Within energy trading, financial instruments are used in the trading and origination activity. The trading and origination activity is managed independent from the Group's energy production. It's main objective is to achieve profit from changes in the market value of energyand energy related financial products, as well as profit from unstandardized contracts. Financial instruments are also used as part of the Group's financial hedging strategy for continuous optimisation of future revenues from the expected production volume. Financial instruments in energy trading mainly consist of financial and physical agreements relating to purchase and sale of power, gas, oil, coal and CO2 quotas. Derivatives recognised in the balance sheet are shown as separate items in the balance sheet and are evaluated at fair value with changes in value recognised in the income statement. As the Group's future own production of power does not qualify for recognition in the balance sheet under IAS 39, the effect of changes in value of financial energy derivatives may have major effects on the income statement without necessarily reflecting the underlying activities. Financial instruments in financial activities Financial instruments used in financial activities primarily consist of loans, interest rate swaps, combined interest rate and currency swaps and forward exchange contracts. Financial derivatives are used as hedging instruments in accordance with the Group's financial hedging strategy. The hedging objects will be assets in foreign currency, future cash flows or loan arrangements valued at amortised cost. For selected loan arrangements where the interest rate has been changed from fixed to floating (fair value hedging), some net investments in foreign units and cash flows, hedging is reflected in the accounts in accordance with IAS 39. Because not all financial hedging relationships are being reflected in the accounts, changes in value for financial instruments may result in volatility in the income statement without fully reflecting the financial reality. 30 HEDGE ACCOUNTING Fair-value hedging Three loan arrangements are treated as fair value hedges. Issued bond loans have been designated as hedging objects in the hedging relationships, and the associated interest rate swaps have been designated as hedging instruments. The hedging objects are issued fixed-interest bonds with a total nominal value of EUR 1200 million. The hedging instruments are interest rate swaps with a nominal value of EUR 1200 million, entered into with major banks as the counterparties. The agreements swap interest rate from fixed to floating 3-month and 6-month EURIBOR. The critical terms of the hedging object and hedging instrument are deemed to be approximately the same, and 90–110% hedging efficiency is assumed. The inefficiency is recognised in the income statement. Hedging of net investments in foreign operation EUR 1396 million of Statkraft AS' debt is designated as hedging of the net investment in Statkraft Treasury Centre. The currency effects on this debt are recognised in other comprehensive income. The effect recognised in 2011 was NOK -57 million. Cash flow hedging As a general rule, the Group does not hedge cash flows. However, cash flow hedges have been established in SN Power and its subsidiaries. This is related to cash flows in various currencies which have been hedged to SN Power's functional currency in USD. The hedge strategy relates to large investments, in total hedges for USD 402 million. Further, hedge accounting is practised for hedges of floating interest rates into fixed interest rates using interest rate swaps, for a total of USD 235 million. 58 Statkraft annual report 2011 group financial statements Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report Fair value of hedging instruments NOK million 2011 2010 Hedging instruments used in fair value hedging 1 426 1 220 Hedging instruments in cash flow hedging 1) -223 -19 Total fair value of hedging instruments 1 203 1 201 1) The value represents the fair value of financial instruments.

The fair value of other energy derivatives has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows. Below is a description of assumptions and parameters that have been applied in the determination of fair value. Electricity price Energy exchange contracts are valued at official closing rates on the balance sheet date. The closing rates are discounted. For other bilateral electricity contracts, the expected cash flow is stipulated on the basis of a market price curve on the balance sheet date. The market price curve for the next five years is stipulated on the basis of official closing rates on energy exchanges. For time horizons beyond five years, the price curve is adjusted for expected inflation. Prices in some contracts refer to area prices. These contracts are valued using the official closing rates on energy exchanges, where such exist. Separate models are used for regional prices without official closing prices. If the contracts extend beyond the horizon quoted on energy exchanges, the price is adjusted for the expected rate of inflation. Raw materials Statkraft has power and gas contracts where the references for the contract price include the price development of gas, coal and oil products. These are valued using forward prices from relevant commodity exchanges and major financial institutions. If quotes are not available for the entire time period, the commodity prices are adjusted for inflation based on the most recent quoted price in the market. CO2 CO2 contracts are priced based on the forward price of EUA quotas and CER quotas. For time horizons above 9 years, the prices are adjusted for expected inflation. Foreign currency Several energy contracts have prices in different currencies. Quoted foreign exchange rates from European Central Bank (ECB) are used in the valuation of contracts denominated in foreign currency. If there are no quotes for the entire time period in question, the interest parity is used to calculate exchange rates. Interest rates The market interest rate curve (swap interest rate) is used as a basis for discounting derivatives. The market interest rates are stipulated on the basis of the publicised swap interest rate from major financial institutions. Credit surcharge is added to the market interest rate curve in cases where the credit risk is relevant. This applies to all external bilateral contracts classified as assets and liabilities. Fair value of currency and interest rate derivatives The fair value of interest rate swaps and combined interestand currency swaps is determined by discounting expected future cash flows to current value through use of observed market interest rates and quoted exchange rates from ECB. The valuation of forward currency exchange contracts is based on quoted exchange rates, from which the forward exchange rate is extrapolated. Estimated present value is subjected to a test of reasonableness against calculations made by the counterparties to the contracts. Fair value of financial investments Certificates and bonds Certificates and bonds are valued at quoted prices. Shares and shareholdings Shares and shareholdings are valued at quoted prices where such are available and the securities are liquid. Other securities are valued by discounting expected future cash flows. Fair value of equity investments in the CO2 fund Equity investments in CO2 funds are valued by discounting expected future cash flows. Assumptions concerning the number of quotas that will be distributed by the fund are a discretionary estimate. The price assumption is described under CO2 above. Fair value of long-term liabilities, first year’s instalment on long-term liabilities and certificate loans The fair value is calculated on the basis of valuation techniques where expected future cash flows are discounted to present value. Expected cash flows are calculated and discounted using observed market interest rates and exchange rates for the various currencies (swap interest rate curve) adjusted upwards for credit risk.

Level 2: Other data than the quoted prices included in Level 1, which are observable for assets or liabilities either directly, i.e. as prices, or indirectly, i.e. derived from prices.

Statkraft annual report 2011 group financial statements 61 Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report 32 MARKET RISK IN THE GROUP RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY Statkraft has a unified approach to the Group's market risks. Statkraft is engaged in activities that entail risk in many areas. Risk management is not about removing risk, but assuming the right risk based on the Group's ability and willingness to take risks, expertise, solidity and development plans. The purpose of the risk management is to identify threats and opportunities for the Group, and to manage the risk towards an acceptable level to provide reasonable surety for achieving the Group's objectives. Market risk is the risk that a financial instrument’s fair value or future cash flows will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices. In Statkraft, market risk will primarily relate to electricity price risk, CO2 prices, gas price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The following section contains a more detailed account of the various types of market risk, and how these are managed. DESCRIPTION OF RISK MANAGEMENT IN ENERGY TRADING Risk management in energy trading in Statkraft focuses on whole contract portfolios rather than specific contracts in accordance with IAS 39. Internal guidelines for market exposure have been established for all portfolios. Responsibility for continual monitoring of granted mandates and frameworks lies with independent organisational units. The frameworks for trading in both financial and physical contracts are continually monitored and regularly reported. A description of the energy portfolios in Statkraft can be found below: Nordic hydropower The Nordic hydropower portfolio is intended to cover hydropower production in the Nordic region and its associated risk. Nordic hydropower is exposed to both price and volume risk, as both future prices and water inflow are unknown. Mandates are based on annual volume thresholds and available production. The objective of the portfolio management is to optimise portfolio revenues and in addition reduce the portfolio risk. The risk is quantified using simulations of various scenarios for relevant risk factors. Net exposure in this portfolio is derived from continually updated production forecasts, physical purchase and sale contracts, as well as contracts traded via energy exchanges and bilateral financial contracts. The financial contracts are both contracts traded via energy exchanges and bilateral contracts. These generally have terms of less than five years, though some financial contracts run until 2020. Some of the perpetual concessionary power agreements have been renegotiated to financial settlement for shorter terms. The physical sales commitments include statutory-priced industrial contracts, long-term sales contracts, concessionary power obligations, as well as miscellaneous free power and compensation power contracts. The majority of the statutory-priced industrial contracts expired in July 2011. The long-term contracts have varying terms, but the longest runs until 2030. The concessionary power contacts are perpetual. For certain of these sales obligations, the price is indexed to other market risks such as metals and foreign currency (embedded derivatives). Financial contracts and embedded derivatives in physical contracts are recognised at fair value, other contracts do not qualify for recognition in the balance sheet and are recognised in the income statement as part of normal purchase and sale. Continental assets The purpose of the portfolio is to manage energy production in continental Europe, including the gas-fired power plant at Kårstø, as well as associated risks. The market risk in the portfolio is derived from the future market prices for electricity, CO2, gas, coal and oil products. Mandates are based on annual volume thresholds and available production. The objective of the portfolio management is to optimise portfolio revenues and in addition reduce the portfolio risk. The risk is quantified using simulations of various scenarios for relevant risk factors. The assets in this portfolio are Baltic Cable AB, the gas power plants, financial and physical energy contracts and other continental assets. Statkraft engages in trading in accordance with the applicable mandates by locking in earnings when electricity prices are attractive relative to gas prices plus CO2 costs. In addition, Statkraft also engages in financial trading to maximise the revenues from Baltic Cable. The contract portfolio consists of financial and physical contracts relating to these assets. All financial contracts as well as several physical contracts are recognised at fair value. The Group has shareholdings in five gas-fired power plants, four in Germany and one in Norway, and has in this connection entered into long-term supply contracts for natural gas. The purchase price for these contracts is indexed to coal and oil. The duration of the agreements differ. The gas agreements are recognised at fair value in accordance with IAS 39. The financial contracts in the portfolio are forward contracts for electricity, CO2, oil products, gas and coal. The price development in the spot market for electricity, gas, the underlying commodities that are included in the indexing of the gas contracts and CO2 therefore affect the earnings of the gas-fired power plants. 62 Statkraft annual report 2011 group financial statements Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report Trading and Origination Statkraft has various portfolios for trading and origination that are managed independently of the Group’s expected electricity production. Trading teams have been established in Oslo, Trondheim, Stockholm, Amsterdam and Düsseldorf. The portfolios act in the market with the aim to realize gains on changes in the market value of energy and energy-related products, as well as gains on non-standardised contracts. Statkraft has allocated risk capital for the trading and origination business. Clear guidelines have been established for the types of products that are allowed to be traded. The mandates for trading and origination activities are adhered to through specified limits for Value-at-Risk and Profit-at-Risk. Both methods calculate the maximum potential loss a portfolio can incur, with a given probability factor over a given period of time. Credit risk and operational risk are also quantified in connection with the allocated risk capital. All trading and origination contracts are recognised at fair value in accordance with IAS 39.5 and 39.6. The trading activities The trading activities involve buying and selling standardised and traded products. Electricity and CO2 products, as well as green certificates, gas and oil products are traded. The contracts in the trading portfolio have durations ranging from 0 to 5 years. Origination activities Origination activities include buying and selling both standardised products and structured contracts. Structured products may be energy contracts with a special duration, long-term contracts or energy contracts in different currencies. The trading with transport capacity over borders and virtual power plant contracts are also included in the activities. Quoted, traded contracts such as system price, regional prices and foreign currency are generally used to reduce the risk involved in trading in structured products and contracts. The majority of the contracts in the portfolio have duration of up to five years, though some contracts run until 2028. Other industrial power contracts All of SN Power’s power contracts are part of Other industrial power contracts. The exposure within these power contracts is mostly related to future price changes in the Brazilian market. Development of price paths are performed in cooperation between Statkraft's market department, local analysts and consultants, and the calculations are updated quarterly. FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK Statkraft is exposed to two main types of risk as regards the financial activities in the Group; foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. Statkraft uses interest rate and foreign currency instruments in its management of the company’s interest rate and foreign exchange exposure. Interest rate and currency swaps and forward exchange rate contracts are used to achieve the desired currency and interest rate structure for the company’s loan portfolio. Forward exchange rate contracts are also used to hedge cash flows denominated in foreign currency. Statkraft’s methods for managing these risks are described below. Foreign exchange risk Statkraft incurs currency risk in the form of transaction risk mainly in connection with energy sales revenues, investments and dividend from subsidiaries and associates in foreign currency. Balance sheet risk is related to shareholdings in foreign subsidiaries in Belgium, the UK, Sweden, Turkey and Germany as well as in SN Power which uses USD as its functional currency. There is also balance sheet risk in connection with investment in some associates. The operational currency for Statkraft's trading on energy exchanges is EUR, which means that all contracts that are entered into via energy exchanges are denoted in EUR and are thus exposed to EUR. A corresponding currency exposure is incurred in connection with energy trading on other exchanges in other currencies than EUR. Statkraft hedges its currency exposure related to cash flows from energy sales of physical contracts and financial trading on energy exchanges, investments, dividends and other currency exposures in accordance with the company's financial strategy. Exposure hedging is achieved by using financial derivatives and loans in foreign currencies as hedging instruments. Few of the hedging relationships fulfil the requirements of hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39. Compliance with the limit for currency risk is followed up continuously by the independent middle-office function. Responsibility for entering into and following up positions is subject to divisions of responsibility and is allocated to separate organisational units. The currency exposure in relation to established frameworks in the finance strategy is regularly reported to corporate management via the CFO. Interest rate risk Most of Statkraft’s interest rate risk exposure relates to the loan portfolio. An interest rate management framework has been established based on a mix between fixed and floating interest rates. The objective is to ensure that most of the loan portfolio is exposed to floating interest rates, but that up to 50% of the loan portfolio can be exposed to fixed interest rates. As a rule fixed interest rates shall apply for a period of more than five years. The strategy for managing interest rate risk has been established based on an objective of achieving the most cost-efficient financing, coupled with the aim of a certain stability and predictability in finance costs. A management framework has also been established to limit the interest rate exposure in currencies other than NOK. The currency positions that are to be entered into are assessed on an ongoing basis, given the market conditions observed for the currency and the overall exposure that exists for that currency. Compliance with the limit for currency risk is followed up continuously by the independent middle-office function. Responsibility for entering into and following up positions has been separated and is allocated to separate organisational units. The interest rate exposure per currency in relation to established frameworks in the finance strategy is regularly reported to corporate management via the CFO. Statkraft annual report 2011 group financial statements 63 Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report 33 ANALYSIS OF MARKET RISK Statkraft’s main activities are the generation and trading of electrical power. In a market in which hydropower plays an important role, and where the supply of water varies a great deal from year to year, price and generating capacity will also vary considerably. Statkraft makes considerable use of forward contracts and other financial instruments to optimise its revenues. Market risk connected with energy optimisation thus covers volume risk, electricity price risk in the spot market and risk connected with positions in financial instruments. Market positions are also taken in connection with the Trading and Origination portfolios. Statkraft is also exposed to market risk relating to interest rate and currency positions, district heating and end-user activities, as well as risk related to grid operations through the revenues being related to the interest market. The Group quantifies risk as deviations from expected post-tax results with a given confidence level. Market risk is included in these calculations, which are used both in the follow-up of the business areas/portfolios and at Group level as part of reporting to corporate management and the Board. Statkraft’s targets for market risk shall have a 95% probability of covering all potential losses (deviations from expected results) connected with the market risk of positions at the balance sheet date during the course of a year. Uncertainty in the underlying instruments/prices and their interrelatedness are calculated using statistical methods. The time period for the calculations is one year. For contracts with exposure of more than one year, only the uncertainty relating to the current year is reflected in the calculations. The exposure can take the form of actual exposure or an expected maximum utilisation of frameworks. The model also takes into account correlation, both within the individual areas and between the areas. Total market risk as of 31 December 2011 was calculated at NOK 1210 million. Total market risk before diversification effects is close to unchanged from 2010. The reason for this is primarily that the increase in Trading and Origination is offset by a similar decrease in the risk in energy optimisation, interest rates, currency and distribution grid revenues. The diversification effect emerges as the difference between total market risk in the specified areas and total market risk, where the correlation between e.g. energy prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates is taken into account. There is a minor increase in diversification effects measured both in NOK and as a percentage.

CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of a party to a financial instrument inflicting a financial loss on the other party by not fulfilling its obligations. Statkraft assumes counterparty risk in connection with energy trading and physical sales, when placing surplus liquidity and when trading in financial instruments. It is assumed that no counterparty risk exists for financial energy contracts which are settled through an energy exchange. For all other energy contracts entered into, the limits are stipulated for the individual counterparty using an internal credit rating. The counterparties are allocated to different categories. The internal credit rating is based on financial key figures. Bilateral contracts are subject to limits for each counterparty with regards to volume, amount and duration. Statkraft also has a separate category for counterparties with which the Group will not engage for ethical reasons. In order to reduce credit risk, bank guarantees are used in some cases when entering into agreements. The bank which issues the guarantee must be an internationally rated commercial bank. Parent company guarantees are also used. In such cases, the parent company is assessed and classified in the normal way. Subsidiaries will naturally never be rated higher than the parent company. In connection with bank guarantees and parent company guarantees, the counterparty will be classified in the same category as the issuer of the guarantee. Statkraft has netting agreements with several of its energy trading counterparties. In the event of default, the netting agreements give a right to a final settlement where all future contract positions are netted and settled. Placement of surplus liquidity is mainly divided among institutions rated Aor better. For financial instruments, loss exposure is calculated in the event of breach of contract by the counterparty. Statkraft has entered into agreements relating to interim cash settlement of the market value of financial derivatives with its counterparties (cash collateral), significantly reducing counterparty exposure in connection with these agreements. Statkraft has good follow-up routines for ensuring that outstanding receivables are paid as agreed. Customer lists sorted by age are followed up continuously. If a contractual counterparty experiences payment problems, special procedures are applied. The risk of counterparties not being able to meet their obligations is considered to be limited. Historically, Statkraft's losses on receivables have been limited. The individual counterparty exposure limits are monitored continuously and reported regularly. In addition, the counterparty risk is quantified by combining exposure with the probability of the individual counterparty defaulting. The overall counterparty risk is calculated and reported for all relevant units, in addition to being consolidated at the Group level and included in the Group risk management. Statkraft's gross credit risk exposure corresponds to the recognised value of financial assets, which are found in the various notes to the balance sheet. Statkraft has provided parent company guarantees for subsidiaries and associates (Note 39). The maximum credit risk exposure does not exceed the already recognised value of financial assets. Gross exposure to credit risk in financial assets is partly reduced through collateral. To the extent that relevant and substantial collateral has been provided, this has been presented below. NOK million Note 2011 2010 Gross exposure credit risk: Other non-current financial assets 20 11 046 15 247 Derivatives 24 9 538 9 487 Receivables 22 12 010 10 748 Short-term financial investments 23 455 424 Cash and cash equivalents 25 8 282 20 052 Total 41 331 55 958 Exposure reduced by security (guarantees, cash collateral etc.): Derivatives 27 -1 330 -1 080 Net exposure credit risk 40 001 54 878 In the case of financial derivatives, the credit risk for most counterparties and derivatives is reduced by the provision of security in the form of cash collateral. Cash collateral is settled on a weekly basis and will therefore not always be settled on 31 December. There could therefore be an outstanding credit risk at the year-end. Frameworks for exposure to individual counterparties have been adopted in the case of short-term financial investments. All cash and cash equivalents are receivables due from banks. LIQUIDITY RISK Statkraft assumes a liquidity risk because the term of its financial obligations is not matched to the cash flows generated by its assets, and because of variations in security requirements linked to both financial contracts in the forward market (energy exchanges) and cash collateral requirements. Statkraft has good borrowing opportunities from the Norwegian and international money markets and in the banking market. Drawdown facilities have been established to secure access to short-term financing. A guarantee framework has been established to cope with significant fluctuations in the collateral required for financial contracts in the forward market required by Nord Pool. Statkraft has a KPI for liquidity capacity, and it shows Statkraft's ability to cover its future obligations. The liquidity capacity target should be between 1.5 and 4.0. Liquidity capacity in this context is defined as cash and cash equivalents, plus committed drawdown facilities, overdrafts and projected receipts for the next six months divided by projected payments for the next six months. Statkraft annual report 2011 group financial statements 65 Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report The finance department prepares the liquidity forecasts, which are important for daily liquidity management and for planning future financing requirements. The liquidity reserve is a tool for the finance department’s risk management and functions as a buffer in relation to the liquidity forecast. The liquidity reserve consists of the company’s cash and cash equivalents, committed drawdown facilities and overdraft facilities. Cash and cash equivalents are intended to cover normal fluctuations in the company’s cash flow. Committed drawdown facilities will be Statkraft’s buffer against unforeseen events with significant cash flow consequences. An individual target figure for short-term liquidity capacity, which reflects Statkraft’s ability to cover its future obligations, is included in the Group’s balanced scorecard.

Tools for long-term management of capital structure are primarily comprised by the draw-down and repayment of long-term liabilities and payments of share capital from/to the owner. The Group endeavours to obtain external financing from various capital markets. The Group is not subject to any external requirements with regard to the management of capital structure other than those relating to the market’s expectations and the owner’s dividend requirements. There were no changes in the Group’s targets and guidelines governing the management of capital structure in 2011. The most important target figure for the Group’s management of capital structure is long-term credit rating. Statkraft AS has a long-term credit rating of A(stable outlook) from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 (stable outlook) from Moody’s. Statkraft's goal is to maintain its current rating, and BBB+/Baa1 as a minimum.

THE STATEMENT REGARDING SALARIES AND OTHER REMUNERATIONS TO SENIOR EXECUTIVES The board of Statkraft has established a separate subcommittee which considers issues relating to compensation. The mandate of the committee is as follows: • Once a year prepare the Board’s treatment regarding salaries and other remunerations for the CEO • Prepare the Board’s treatment of all the fundamental issues related to salary, bonus systems, pension, and employment agreements and similar for the executive management in Statkraft. • Deal with specific issues relating to compensation for employees in the Statkraft Group to the extent that the Committee finds that these concern matters of particular importance for the Group's reputation, and competitiveness and its attractiveness as an employer. In addition to this, the CEO should consult the Compensation Committee regarding his recommendations regarding the salaries for the corporate executives before they are decided upon. Statkraft has a policy that we must have competitive terms, but we will not be a wage leader. Upon deciding salaries and other remunerations in Statkraft, an external position assessment system that ranks jobs according to a recognized and widely used methodology is utilised. A survey is then conducted, evaluating how similar ranking positions in the Norwegian labour market are compensated. This information, together with internal reward practices in Statkraft forms the basis for determining compensation. REPORT ON EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION POLICY The CEO is only compensated with a fixed salary – and vice presidents shall receive both a fixed salary and a variable payment. Fixed salary The fixed salary is determined based on a joband a market assessment – and also assessed against Statkraft’s policy to offer competitive terms, but not be leading. When deciding the annual wage regulation, the average wage increases of other employees are also considered. Variable salary In addition to the fixed salary, the Group has a bonus scheme for the executive directors. The annual bonus has a maximum payout of NOK 500 000. The agreed targets are financial, operational and individual. Other variable elements Further variable elements include arrangements with a company car, newspapers, phone and coverage of broadband communication in accordance with established standards. Statkraft annual report 2011 group financial statements 67 Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report Pension plans Statkraft has for wholly owned Norwegian subsidiaries established pension schemes in the Government Pension Fund (SPK). In addition, Statkraft has entered into pension agreements that provide all employees, including the CEO and executive vice presidents. The CEO, Christian Rynning-Tønnesen, has a retirement age of 67 years, and will receive a pension of 66% of the yearly salary, provided that he has been part of SPK during the entire 30 year vesting period. The other executives have a retirement age of 65 years at the earliest, with the right to 66% of the yearly salary, provided that they have been part of SPK during the entire 30 year vesting period. Statkraft is currently evaluating alternative arrangements, as the pension scheme for income above 12 G is not longer in accordance with the new Guidelines for managers in state-owned companies. Position Change Agreements The CEO and certain executive directors have agreements regarding change of position after the age of 62. These are agreements where, at any time after the employee has reached 62 years of age, there is a mutual right and duty, if the executive ask for, or is requested to resign from his executive position without further justification. If any of the parties execute this right, the executive should be offered another position with a salary of 75% of the executive’s pay – and a working time of 50% until agreed upon retirement age. The policy regarding executive remuneration has been changed, and any new such agreements will not be made. Severance arrangements Mutual period of notice for the CEO is agreed to 6 months. For executive directors, there is a mutual notice period of 3 months. If more than 2 years of employment, the employer’s period of notice is 6 months. For the CEO and certain executive directors, agreements have been made where a special severance pay from the employer should be paid, if notice has been given from the employer with a shorter deadline than mentioned above. The agreement waives the employee's rights in the Work Environment Act (Arbeidsmiljøloven) for protection against dismissal. If the employer uses this right of termination, the employee is entitled to a severance payment of up to 12 months' salary in excess of agreed notice period. The amount shall be paid monthly. Severance pay shall be reduced according to established rules if the employee receives other income within the payment period. These agreements are entered into in accordance with the Guidelines for the employment conditions of managers in state owned enterprises and companies of 28 June 2004. The policy regarding executive remuneration has been changed, and any new such agreements will not be made. Terms CEO Fixed salary to the Chief Executive for 2012 is NOK 4 250 000. The CEO's retirement age is 67 years, with pension and other terms as set out in this Statement. Statement on salaries and other compensation for 2012 The Board intends to apply the main principles and practices described in this document as a basis for both fixed salary as other allowances provided the group's senior management the current year. 37 FEES PAID TO EXTERNAL AUDITORS Deloitte AS is the Statkraft Group’s auditor.

If the invoiced amount is lower than the revenue ceiling, this results in surplus income, while if the invoiced amount is higher this generates a revenue shortfall. Revenue surpluses/shortfalls will even out over time as actual invoicing is adjusted. Revenues are recognised in the accounts based on actual invoicing. Accumulated excess/shortfall of revenue as shown in the table below will be recognised in future periods.

Statkraft årsrapport 2010 statkraft as financial statements 75 Income Statement Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Notes Auditor's Report 04 PENSIONS Group pension schemes The company is obliged to operate an occupational pension scheme under the Norwegian Act on Mandatory Occupational Pension Schemes. Statkraft AS operates an occupational scheme for its employees through the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund (SPK) which meets these requirements. The benefits are retirement, disability, surviving spouse and child’s pensions. For individuals qualifying for the full entitlement, the scheme provides retirement and disability pension benefits amounting to 66% of pensionable income, up to a maximum of 12 times the National Insurance Scheme’s basic amount (G). The company’s employees are also entitled to retire early under the early retirement (AFP) scheme from the age of 62. Pension benefits from the SPK are guaranteed by the Norwegian state (Section 1 of the Pension Act). Statkraft pays an annual premium to the SPK and is responsible for the financing of the scheme. The SPK scheme is, however, not asset-based. Management of the pension fund assets (fictitious assets) is therefore simulated as though the assets were invested in long-term government bonds. In this simulation it is assumed that the bonds are held to maturity. Unfunded pension liabilities Statkraft has in addition to the above schemes entered into agreements that provide employees whose pensionable income exceeds 12G with a retirement and disability pension equivalent to 66% of that portion of their pensionable income exceeding 12G. These pensions are funded out of the company’s operations. Due to new guidelines for companies owned by the Norwegian state, as stated by the Government 31 March 2011, the agreement is currently being revised.

Fair value is calculated on the basis of relevant market prices and forward curves, since the bulk of the derivatives are not traded on organised markets. Interest rate derivatives, including the interest portion of combined interest rate and currency swaps, are used to manage the company’s interest rate risk and are recognised as hedging instruments or at the lowest value principle, depending on whether the requirements for hedge accounting have been achieved. The fair value of interest rate derivatives classified as hedging (value hedging) is NOK -15 million as of 31 December 2011, while interest rate derivatives valued at the lowest value principle amount to NOK -660 million. The hedges expire during the period 2012–2022. Fair value of derivatives in cash flow hedging is not recognised in the balance sheet, and amounts to NOK -21 million. The currency component of combined interest rate and currency swaps is recognised at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. The change in value recognised in the income statement is offset by a comparable change in value of underlying loans in the same currency.

The GHG-protocol (from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and World Resources Institute) divides greenhouse gas emissions into three types. Type 1 emissions are direct emissions from own activities. Type 2 emissions are indirect emissions from purchased electricity and district heating, while Type 3 emissions are other emissions. All the emissions in the table above are Type 1, except for business travel, which falls under Type 3. The electricity consumption in Statkraft is guaranteed renewable, resulting in zero Type 2 emissions. For 2011, the Group's Type 1 emissions totalled 1 158 900 tonnes, while the Type 3 emissions totalled 3000 tonnes.

Sustainable and responsible behaviour wherever we are present is a report 2011 cornerstone of our activity. This section of the annual report documents our actions and results within areas such as business ethics, environment, health and safety and HR. Corporate Corporate Responsibility is a line responsibility in Statkraft. This means responsibility that each business unit in Statkraft has an independent responsibility for handling and following up corporate responsibility in connection with its in Statkraft own activities. Statkraft’s code of conduct describes the fundamental principle for corporate responsibility and ethical conduct in Statkraft. Statkraft strives to demonstrate thorough corporate citizenship in all activities. This means that the Group’s activities must be conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, in line with Statkraft’s internal rules and sound international standards in areas such as health and safety, environment, human rights, business ethics and anti-corruption. Statkraft is growing internationally, and some of the growth takes place in areas where the standards for sustainable conduct differ from the standards in our domestic market. This is challenging and sets high standards for employees, contractors and partners. Statkraft’s fundamental ethical principles are described in Statkraft’s Code of conduct. The Code applies to all companies and employees in the Statkraft Group. We also expect our business partners to have corresponding standards. In 2011, Statkraft further developed its ethical guidelines aimed especially at the Group’s suppliers. We see both risks and opportunities in connection with corporate responsibility. The risk perspective helps us identify weaknesses and implement measures. We also believe that high standards in this area create trust and new business opportunities. We therefore develop sound systems for project and risk management and develop the necessary expertise reflecting the challenges we face. Corporate responsibility is a line responsibility and an integrated part of our day-to-day business operations. Climate and environment Statkraft mainly produces renewable energy without emissions of greenhouse gases and thereby contributes to prevent climate change. However, renewable power generation also affects the environment. We consider the environmental impact of relevant business activities and work systematically to find the most environment-friendly solutions. Health and safety Health and safety must always be priority number one in Statkraft. Our goal is zero workrelated accidents. In addition to applicable laws and regulations, Statkraft complies with international health and safety standards. Combined with Statkraft’s own high expectations to health and safety, these form the basis for expectations and requirements directed at our employees, partners and contractors. Clear requirements and close follow-up in all operations and project phases are decisive to achieve safe and sound workplaces. Safeguarding of people and assets Growth in international markets present new and complex security challenges for Statkraft. We have a multi-disciplinary approach to these challenges and continue developing our systems for security and emergency preparedness. We are committed to adhering to international good practice. The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights set out important and fudamental principles in this area. MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 103 Anti-corruption and business ethics The emphasis on anti-corruption has increased considerably in recent years. Statkraft works systematically to prevent corruption and to promote sound business ethics throughout the Group, across geographical and organisational boundaries. Human rights Statkraft supports and respects, within its sphere of influence, internationally recognised human rights. We develop guidelines and routines to ensure that respect for human rights is implemented in both operations and projects. Managing Statkraft’s follow-up of corporate responsibility is based on national corporate legislation and internationally recognised principles and guidelines. Our internal guidelines emphasise that the company’s activities must responsibility be carried out in a sustainable manner. Guiding principles Statkraft operates in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in all countries where we have activities and we adhere to internationally recognised standards and guidelines. We focus our work towards creating a work culture in accordance with our principles and which promotes good business practice. Statkraft’s Code of conduct Statkraft’s basic ethical principles are described in Statkraft’s Code of conduct, which sets requirements for both our own employees and our business partners. The Code represents our basic commitment to act in a sustainable, ethical and socially responsible manner – and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations – wherever we have activities. We want to meet the world’s expectations in the best possible manner through clear requirements and practical implementation. International standards Statkraft is a member of the UN’s Global Compact and is committed to following up this initiative and its ten principles. In development projects, Statkraft emphasises the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) standards for sustainable behaviour. The requirements of these standards include preparation of impact analyses as regards the environment and social conditions. Statkraft also adheres to the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises, which present recommendations from governments to multinational companies as regards responsible business conduct. Our management Corporate responsibility is a line responsibility in Statkraft, and the systems handling and follow-up of corporate responsibility is an integrated part of all processes through the entire value chain. Statkraft’s Code of conduct describes the fundamental principles for corporate responsibility and ethical conduct in Statkraft. Corporate responsibility in the Statkraft Group Each business unit in Statkraft has an independent responsibility for ensuring that its activities are conducted in a sustainable and responsible manner. This means that handling, measuring and follow-up of areas such as health and safety, corruption, human rights and the environment must be incorporated in relevant business processes with each business area. MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 104 In addition, a corporate staff function has been established to follow up corporate responsibility. The staff has an advisory role vis-à-vis the business units and will ensure that the Group’s management systems safeguard corporate responsibility. Corporate responsibility in the management system The Group’s basic ethical principles are described in Statkraft’s Code of conduct and set requirements for both our own employees and our business partners. Strategic priorities for the Group’s corporate responsibility are presented in the strategic platform. More detailed descriptions of how Statkraft’s corporate responsibility will be handled throughout the entire value chain can be found in the Group principles and guidelines for the areas of environment, health and safety, HR and business ethics. Corporate responsibility in projects In 2011, Statkraft has further developed a decision-making model for the execution of major development projects. The model presents a system of common terms and concepts and ensures a uniform approach from the early phase and through stepwise decision processes in the Group. The model’s basic principle is that each main decision must be accompanied by structured and documented information on a number of topics, including corporate responsibility, as part of the basis for decisions. The model will be further developed in 2012 with focus on training. Health and safety management system Statkraft has a group-wide management system for health and safety based on OHSAS 18001. Common guidelines are prepared for a number of topics and situations, including reporting and investigation of incidents, handling of specific working operations and emergency preparedness plans. In 2011, there has been particular focus on investigation of serious incidents, and the relevant guidelines have been updated. Environmental management system The Group’s environmental management system is designed in accordance with the requirements in ISO 14001:2004, and parts of the activities have been certified in accordance with this standard. Statkraft has Group-wide guidelines for environmental management. The guidelines include requirements for mapping environmental impact and risks. Expertise development Sound and relevant expertise throughout the value chain is an important success factor for Statkraft in discharging our corporate responsibility in an appropriate manner. Relevant topics in connection with corporate responsibility have therefore been incorporated in programmes for new employees, manager development and in project manager courses. Projects place a special emphasis on health and safety training. In 2011, Statkraft has developed several types of web-based courses that are available, and to some extent also mandatory, for both employees and contractors. Anti-corruption is another area that has received high priority. In order to raise awareness of potential challenges and how to handle them, all employees in Statkraft received an anti-corruption handbook in 2011 which enabled them to practice challenging scenarios through e-learning and seminars. Emergency preparedness Emergency preparedness plans have been prepared for all operating units in the Group and regular emergency drills are held to ensure efficient handling of serious situations. Both emergency preparedness plans and drills are arranged so that relevant topics pertaining to corporate responsibility are included. MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 105 Performance follow-up A Group-wide solution for handling of nonconformities and improvement opportunities, Emendo, was established in 2010-2011. Nonconformities and improvement proposals in connection with the environment and health and safety are recorded in Emendo, and then followed up in a uniform manner. The system facilitates for proposals for corrective measures to be implemented in accordance with an established schedule. The Group audit have considered different aspects of how the Group’s corporate responsibility was discharged in relations to a number of its audits in 2011. No serious nonconformities were identified in connection with corporate responsibility. KPIs have been established in the Group scorecard and the scorecards for the various business areas, reflecting the operational performance for the areas environment and health and safety. The results are presented monthly to the corporate management and board of directors. Supplier follow-up Statkraft’s acquisition guidelines aim to ensure equal treatment of suppliers and contain clear requirements as regards business ethics, the environment and health and safety. Statkraft’s supplier Code of conduct In 2011, Statkraft further developed its ethical guidelines aimed at the Group’s suppliers and adopted the document “Statkraft’s supplier Code of conduct”. This document clearly describes our requirements to suppliers as regards the environment, human rights, labour rights and working life standards, health and safety and anti-corruption. Statkraft’s suppliers are informed of the Code and other relevant guidelines during the tender processes and contract signing. Requirements for and follow-up of suppliers Statkraft primarily uses suppliers that have been approved in Sellihca (the Nordic energy industry’s common qualification scheme with about 2000 approved suppliers). All suppliers are treated equally, in accordance with the requirements for public-sector procurement and our own ethical guidelines. Particularly important and vulnerable deliveries are subject to more rigorous follow-up through several supplier links in the form of company visits and unannounced inspections. Statkraft has initiated a project to further improve the integration of corporate responsibility in the procurement process. A comprehensive systematic approach will ensure that the correct requirements are applied to Statkraft’s suppliers in all phases of the procurement process, from pre-qualification to follow-up and supervision. Stakeholder We communicate openly and regularly with our stakeholders. The owner, management democratically elected representatives on all levels, employees, business partners, suppliers, local and regional authorities, NGOs and the media are key dialogue partners. This communication is necessary to create good conditions for cooperation and optimal project results, and to influence the premises for development of renewable energy in the right direction. Meetings with local communities and authorities where we operate Statkraft aims to have regular meetings with all local authorities where we have activities. This will be a special focus area in Norway in 2012. The topics in these meetings include information about the individual production plant and how it is operated, special challenges that must be taken into consideration, cooperation projects and ongoing or scheduled projects. MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 106 Transparent information regarding development projects Statkraft holds consultation processes and meetings with the general public in line with applicable standards and good international practice in all development projects. The topics in such meetings will often be expropriation, compensation, relocation of affected persons, job opportunities and environmental impact. In 2011, such meetings were held amongst other places in Albania (the Devoll project, hydropower), Germany (the Knapsack II project, gas power) and in Turkey (the Cetin project, hydropower). As part of Energy Norway’s multi-year Energy and Development project, Statkraft issued an invitation in 2011 for a field excursion to the THXP development project in Laos, where Statkraft has a 20% interest. The project group, where Statkraft participated, was composed of participants from industry and commerce, the authorities and NGOs – including WWF, Norwegian Church Aid and FIVAS. The purpose of the visit was to study and discuss the challenges inherent in such a project, and look at how they are handled in the THXP development project. Dialogue with premise providers Maintaining a dialogue with premise providers is necessary to highlight key challenges and discuss the desired development. One example of such dialogue in 2011 was the visit of the Standing Committee on Business and Industry from the Storting to the Sheringham Shoal offshore wind farm off the coast of the UK. The members of the Storting toured the wind farm and were thorougly informed on the challenges and opportunities of the project. Statkraft is an active participant in several forums, both national and international, in order to discuss and influence energy policy. These forums include Energy Norway, Eurelectric, World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the International Hydropower Association (IHA). Statkraft’s corporate Statkraft’s information concerning corporate responsibility and responsibility reporting sustainability must provide a correct and balanced account of the Group’s activities and results in these areas. The Group’s corporate responsibility reporting is based on the recommendations of the Global Reporting Initiative. Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting is based on GRI’s recommendations for voluntary sustainability reporting, including GRI’s ten reporting principles. The principles describe a process to identify significant topics and outline the premises for the reporting. Statkraft has guidelines that describe the Group’s reporting on corporate responsibility. The guidelines describe the actual reporting process and identify the indicators that will be reported. The guidelines cover important sustainability aspects in the Group and take into account requirements and expectations from our stakeholders. With the reporting practice established in Statkraft, we believe that the reporting principles in AA1000 Accountability Principles Standard (2008 version) have been complied with. These principles deal with whether the reporting meets the requirements relating to materiality, completeness and stakeholder involvement. Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting describes the most important topics and performance on the Group level. More detailed information about individual projects and local issues and activities can be found on our website. MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 107 Verification of information Statkraft’s external auditor verifies the Group’s corporate responsibility reporting, including the management systems and processes that form the basis for the reporting. The auditor’s work is based on the assurance standards ISAE 3000 and the AA1000 Assurance Standard (2008 version), where the latter has been especially developed for assurance reporting on corporate responsibility and sustainability. The standard does not just focus on the report itself, but also includes an analysis of the company’s management systems and processes for handling of corporate responsibility issues. The auditor’s conclusion can be found in the auditor’s statement. In addition, the auditor makes comments and recommendations regarding Statkraft’s status and further reporting work on corporate responsibility. Corporate responsibility Statkraft is engaged in substantial development projects, most of them in development projects outside of Norway. Our goal is that all projects should contribute to create value and be implemented in a socially and environmentally responsible and sustainable manner. Follow-up of corporate responsibility All project development in Statkraft is based on internationally recognised guidelines and standards, of which the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) standards for sustainable behaviour play a key role. Statkraft works to develop a standardised methodology to secure a systematic evaluation of corporate responsibility throughout the project process. Below are presentations of two selected development projects with associated challenges and results relating to corporate responsibility. THEUN-HINBOUN EXPANSION PROJECT – HYDROPOWER IN LAOS ππ Ownership: Statkraft 20%, Electricité du Laos 60%, GMS Lao Company 20% ππ Capacity: 280 MW (220 MW for export and 60 MW to local grids) – a total of 500 MW with the existing plant ππ Development phase: Under construction, scheduled to start operation in January 2013 Key corporate responsibility challenges The construction of the Nam Gnouang dam and flooding of 103 km2 of land have resulted in 12 villages totalling 4000 people having to move to new areas. In addition, large areas downstream will be affected by changes to the waterflow, causing the relocation of more than 3000 people. From the beginning of the project, a policy was established to the effect that everyone who has to move due to the power plant development, will have a better standard of living and a sustainable livelihood. The policy sets detailed requirements with regards to: ππ Access to and size of acreage for growing fruit and vegetables ππ Access to and size of rice-growing acreage ππ Access to grazing lands and fishing opportunities ππ Access to schools and health services ππ Access to year-round road connection to local markets As regards environment, the main challenges have been to remove as much biomass as possible from the dammed area to avoid anaerobe conditions in the reservoir and to reduce erosion along the river bank. In addition, a new area will be established north of the reservoir where an extensive tree-planting programme and rehabilitation efforts will be conducted for five years in cooperation with local authorities and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). As part of our work to follow up social issues and the environment, comprehensive surveys of the standard of living, health, nutrition, school services, crops, fish stocks, MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 108 water quality, erosion, etc. are taking place. The surveys and follow-up will continue until the set project goals have been achieved, e.g. also after the power station is in operation. The construction work has had a strong focus on health and safety issues. Examples of sustainability indicators in the project Social issues and the environment ππ Percentage of households with access to potable water all year: 16-47% (target: >50%) ππ Percentage of households with reliable access to food: 59-85% (target: >80%) ππ Percentage of children attending the appropriate school level: 24-49% (target: 40%) ππ Percentage of households with access to health services: 31-60% (target: >80%) Health and safety (2011) ππ Number of fatal accidents: 3 ππ Number of lost-time injuries: 15 CETIN – HYDROPOWER IN TURKEY ππ Ownership: Statkraft 100% ππ Capacity: 517 MW (from two power plants) ππ Development phase: Under construction, scheduled to start operating in January 2015 Key corporate responsibility challenges A voluntary village relocation is being planned as part of the project. The village is presently prone to landslides, and the risk potential of slides can increase with the filling of the reservoir. In addition, some people will be affected by the project through loss of arable land and orchards. In order to minimise these effects the lower Cetin dam has been moved approximately two kilometres during the planning phase. This optimalisation will have insignificant affects on production. As regards environment, the main challenges will be to remove as much biomass as possible from the dammed area to avoid anaerobe conditions in the reservoir and to reduce erosion along the river bank. Examples of sustainability indicators in the project Health and safety (2011) ππ Number of fatal accidents: 0 ππ Number of lost-time injuries: 1 Indicators for environment and social issues are under development and will be completed in 2012. Role in society Statkraft creates major values for Norwegian society. In 2011, Statkraft contributed slightly more than NOK 4 billion to the state coffers through dividend, while total taxes paid to the state and local authorities in Norway amounted to almost NOK 5 billion. Innovation is an important priority, and Statkraft has three own R&D programmes closely associated with the Group’s strategic focus areas hydropower, wind power and bio-energy. The Group supports various causes, teams and events in sports and culture through national and regional sponsorship agreements. Approximately NOK 27 million was spent on sponsorship agreements in 2011. In addition, a fund annually awarding up to NOK 5 million to causes that benefit society as a whole has been established. MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 109 Corporate responsibility Statkraft creates major values for society. Below is a presentation of the in development projects Group’s total value creation in the form of tax contributions, dividend to the state, total investments and goods and services purchased. Economic value creation Economic value creation: NOK 8841 million Dividend to the state: NOK 4288 million Taxes and fees to the state and local authorities in Norway: NOK 4987 million Taxes paid to Norwegian local authorities Taxes paid to Norwegian local authorities: NOK 1411 million Taxes paid to the ten municipalities that received the most: NOK 673 million (48%) Five largest local authority tax recipients: ππ Vinje – NOK 96 million ππ Hemnes – NOK 90 million ππ Suldal – NOK 83 million ππ Rana NOK 76 million ππ Odda 64 million NOK Investments Total investments: NOK 8269 million ππ Of which in Norway: NOK 3641 million ππ Of which abroad: NOK 4628 million Goods and services purchased Total: NOK 6200 million Total number of suppliers: 8000 Employment Total per 31 December 2011: 3358 full-time equivalents ππ Of which in Norway: 2232 full-time equivalents ππ Of which abroad: 1126 full-time equivalents Innovation The Group’s innovation activities shall contribute to increased competitiveness and the realisation of commercial goals. Technology analysis, continuous operational improvements, R&D programmes and longterm projects are key factors in Statkraft’s innovation drive. Focused innovation efforts Statkraft’s innovation strategy is based on the Group’s business strategy and closely linked to the Group’s core business. By focusing the innovation work towards projects that provide more knowledge and reflect the Group’s main focus areas, Statkraft will generate long-term value for itself and society in general. Through our focused R&D programmes we develop competitive advantages and new business models in cooperation with national and international R&D environments. Statkraft has three own R&D programmes closely linked to the Group’s strategic focus areas, hydropower, wind power and bio-energy: ππ The hydropower programme Future Hydro Power covers Statkraft’s work on flexible power production in Northwestern Europe and hydropower in emerging markets. The objective is to develop methods, systems and technology to improve project development, development, operations, market operations and expertise in connection with hydropower. ππ The wind power programme Competitive Wind Power covers onshore and offshore wind power. The objective is to increase the company’s ability to exploit existing expertise and technology and to make Statkraft one of the most cost-effective wind power players. MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 110 ππ The bio programme Cost-efficient bio-energy has emerged from Statkraft’s district heating investments. The objective is to reduce the risk and fuel costs in the district heating activities, to increase the share of renewable energy in district heating production, and to increase Statkraft’s ability to participate in power and/or heat production based on bio-energy. Osmotic power Osmotic power is an example of long-term innovation work in Statkraft. With ten years of experience, Statkraft is a world leader in the development of osmotic power. Osmotic power is a renewable and emission-free energy source that could make a significant contribution to renewable energy production. The concept involves producing electricity by exploiting the energy that is generated when fresh water and salt water meet. Statkraft aims to make an investment decision on whether to build an osmotic power pilot over the course of 2013. Partnerships and Statkraft cooperates with several interest groups. The most important are sponsorships WWF, Friends of the Earth Norway and Bellona. The purpose of these partnerships is to contribute to exchange of experience and increased expertise for all parties. Sponsorship agreements In addition to partnerships with interest groups, Statkraft supports a number of activities within culture and sports. The Group spent about NOK 27 million on sponsorship agreements in 2011. They largest agreements are with: ππ The Norwegian Biathlon Union ππ Det Norske Teatret ππ Oslo Jazzfestival ππ The Nobel Peace Prize concert ππ Hardanger Musikkfest In addition to the sponsorship agreements, Statkraft supports sports and culture in the local communities where we are present. In 2011, Statkraft also supported the exhibition of Edvard Munch’s works at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Building reputation and brand Statkraft regularly measures its reputation both in the general population and among professionals. In 2011, 89% of professionals and 54% of the general population had a very good or quite good impression of Statkraft. The Statkraft fund In 2011, the Statkraft Fund was awarded to Norwegian Church Aid, Renewable World, Norwegian People’s Aid, Grane Næringsutvikling, The Inland Norway Energy Agency and the New Ålesund Symposium. What is the Statkraft Fund? The Statkraft Fund has been established to support causes that benefit the greater community. The Fund disburses up to NOK 5 million annually to volunteer organisations, foundations or similar upon application from the recipient or initiative from Statkraft’s management. The application announcement for 2011 emphasised that projects should have a clear connection with Statkraft’s activities and primarily be directed towards developing countries. Focus on energy, climate and sustainable development In line with the Statkraft Fund’s guidelines, the fund awarded money to organisations that focus on connections between energy, climate and sustainable development in different ways in 2011. The recipients were: MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 111 Norwegian Church Aid received NOK 1.5 million in total for two projects. One focuses on introduction and operation of small-scale hydropower in Laos. The other offers Vietnamese farmers clean energy, better sanitary installations and efficient handling of agricultural waste through development of biogas plants. Renewable World received NOK 1 million for development of biogas plants for use smallscale agriculture in Nepal. The organisation is based in the UK and cooperates with RenewableUK, where Statkraft is a member, and the European Wind Energy Association. Norwegian People’s Aid received NOK 1 million for the organisation’s water programme in Somalia. The program ensures clean potable water by securing water sources and developing a stable distribution system. Grane Industrial development received NOK 375 000 for facilitation of publicly accessible fishing spots in Grane and Hattfjelldal municipalities in Nordland County. The main purpose of the project is to strengthen tourism and culture-based industry in the region. The Innlandet Energy Council received NOK 125 000 million for the work to increase interest in climate and environmental issues among young people. One of the activities carried out in 2011 was an environment conference for young people in Hedmark and Oppland Counties. The New Ålesund Symposium received NOK 1 million, in line with a decision made earlier. The symposium annually gathers researchers, politicians and business leaders from all over the world to discuss climate and environmental issues under the Arctic skies of Svalbard. Business ethics Ethical and responsible behaviour is a cornerstone in Statkraft. We have established regulations, management structures and training which aim to ensure ethical conduct in all aspects of our activities. Statkraft’s code of conduct Statkraft’s fundamental ethical principles are described in Statkraft’s Code of conduct, which is supported by more detailed guidelines. The Code of conduct applies to all companies and employees in the Statkraft Group, and our business partners are expected to have standards that are consistent with Statkraft’s Code of conduct. In 201, Statkraft further developed its ethical guidelines aimed at the Group’s suppliers. Training Training forms an important component of the ethics work in Statkraft. In 2011 several units in the Group carried out dilemma training in connection with their anti-corruption work. A handbook and a supplementary, interactive training programme were launched in 2011 to further support the anti-corruption work. The handbook contains an overview of relevant legislation and internal guidelines, as well as specific examples and dilemmas. Notification Statkraft encourages employees to report questionable matters. If an employee suspects that a decision or action may violate Statkraft’s legal or ethical commitments, the employee has a right and a duty to raise the issue. Employees in this situation should contact their superior immediately. If this is difficult or impossible, the employee should contact the head of Corporate Audit, which is the independent whistleblowing channel. The Corporate Audit was not notified of any whistleblowing cases in 2011. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 112 Environmental Statkraft secures a sufficient and predictable power supply for our impact customers based on sustainable solutions for power production. All plants will be built and operated on the basis of good environmental management reducing the potential negative environmental impact as much as possible. Leading international practice is the yardstick against which the Group’s environmental work is measured. European leader within With a portfolio consisting primarily of renewable energy sources, with renewable energy hydro and wind as the main focus areas, Statkraft delivers power solutions that also contribute positively with regards to the global climate challenge. In 2011, about 91% of Statkraft’s energy production was based on renewable energy sources. Power generation and district heating Production of environmentally Lost-time friendly and total recordable energy injurie (Statkraft’s share) rates for employees and suppliers In 2011, 87.8% of Statkraft’s power production came from hydropower. Hydropower TWh 75 is very efficient, 20 has a long lifetime and a range of other technological benefits. The technology is also flexible, an increasingly important characteristic as several renewable 15 50 technologies are being combined. When developing and operating hydropower plants, it is also possible to facilitate combined water use, for example in connection with flood 10 mitigation, irrigation, potable water, transport and recreation. 25 5 The Group’s non-renewable energy production includes a limited amount of gas 0 power and 0a small part of the district heating production.

Internationally recognised standards are used as a basis for planning, implementation, measurement and reporting of the Group’s environmental work. Most important environmental challenges Statkraft’s core business areas are hydro and wind power. None of these technologies cause significant emissions or discharges, but both cause major interventions in nature, both for eco-systems and the landscape. Areas used for hydro and wind power production are often habitats for animals and plants, and are also often used for agriculture and recreation. However, it is usually possible to facilitate multi-purpose use of these areas through careful interventions adapted to local conditions. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 113 Gas power causes CO2 and NOx emissions, and often discharge of cooling water as well, while the operation of district heating plants generates SOx and NOx emissions. Cooling water can influence biodiversity in neighbouring river systems, while SOx and NOx contribute to acidification and over-fertilisation of river systems. Water management In order to achieve sustainable water management in the development of hydropower projects, geographical and local conditions are taken into account. Rivers and river systems usually have an important function both regionally and locally, for example for biological diversity and recreation and as potable water and a source of irrigation. Statkraft works to achieve optimal and sustainable water management. In Norway, this primarily takes place through close follow-up of the licence terms and some additional improvement measures. The EUs water framework directive is a set of regulations aimed at securing unified and ecosystem-based management of all water in Europe. Statkraft works closely with the authorities to ensure that all surface water achieves a ”good environmental status” in accordance with the directive. Wind power and the environment Statkraft’s wind power work is encountering new environment challenges, both onshore and offshore. Birds are a recurring topic, both due to the risk of birds colliding with the rotating turbine blades, and because wind farms can drive certain bird species away from their natural habitats or form barriers on important migration routes. Wind power’s impact on bird populations is, however, considered a relatively minor problem. This emerged from the IPCC’s assessment of the environmental footprint of wind farms, presented in 2011. Offshore, the impact on the marine environment is a particularly challenging topic, partly as there is yet little knowledge about the consequences for sea mammals, fish and benthic fauna. There are a lot of indications that negative effects are often temporary and that offshore wind farms can also benefit the environment in the longer term. A wind farm resting on the seabed can e.g. provide shelter and create good growth areas for fish and other organisms. In connection with the development of Sheringham Shoal and the planning of the Doggerbank development, Statkraft has devoted significant resources to monitoring programmes, studies and investigation of all types of effects on the environment. Concern for the environment in all processes Concern for the environment has been integrated into relevant activities in the Group, from strategic choices and project planning to choice of partners and operation of the plants. The key elements of the environmental work are identification of environmental risk, implementation of measures, securing the necessary expertise as well as registration, follow-up and learning from all incidents. The paramount objective is to avoid negative environmental effects. Where this not is possible, mitigating and compensatory measures to reduce negative environmental effects are implemented. Statkraft’s achievement with regards to the environment depends on how the Group’s contractors show their concern for the environment. Therefore, environmental requirements have been incorporated in all relevant contracts. The Group’s international development projects are planned and implemented in line with good international practice. This entails impact analyses as regards environmental impact and follow-up of environmental aspects throughout the project process. In 2010, the International Hydropower Association (IHA) launched a new version of its evaluation tool for hydropower projects (IHA Sustainability Assessment Protocol, SAP) as regards sustainability. Several NGOs, companies, banks and national and international institutions have participated in the development work, including Statkraft. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 114 Climate The demand for energy is growing fast all over the world. Climate change and global warming as a consequence of carbon-intensive energy consumption represents an increasingly large challenge. IPCC points to renewable energy as the single most important measure against climate change. If the world increases its renewables percentage from the current 12.9 to almost 80, this alone would be enough to stop the temperature rise at two degrees. In this context, Statkraft’s activities, production and development of renewable energy is part of the solution to the climate challenges. The Group’s own emissions of greenhouse gases are very low compared with other industries and come principally from our gas power plants. Climate strategy and climate adaptation Climate change will result in more precipitation in the Nordic region, while dry parts of the world will probably become even drier. Climate research indicates that both precipitation and wind can become more intense and extreme episodes may occur more often looking forward to 2050. The world’s energy consumption and a strong global increase in demand for energy have resulted in climate policy now being the most important driving force in global energy policy. Climate change affects Statkraft in many ways. Meteorological variations can challenge future production and create an unstable environment. The climate and energy policy changes the framework conditions of the energy industry. The EU’s renewables directive, the water framework directive and carbon quota trading are examples of this. In 2011, Statkraft dedicated resources with the aim of coordinating and developing the company’s climate efforts. An important topic is the causes of climate change and how they are handled politically. Energy production has a long time horizon and power plants have long lifetimes. It is therefore important to understand the implications of the climate changes for Statkraft in the time to come, and to look at what solutions we can contribute with. The Group’s greenhouse gas emissions Most of Statkraft’s portfolio is practically emission-free hydro and wind power production. This means that our greenhouse gas emissions are relatively small. In 2011, the Group’s total emissions were 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents. The Group’s relative emissions of CO2 equivalents in 2011 were 34 kg/MWh. The Group buys ordinary CO2 quotas in the international CO2 quota market to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions from that part of the business that is not subject to mandatory quota schemes. This applies to fuel consumption, business travel and some accidental emissions of the greenhouse gases halon, SF6, and amounted to 12 000 tonnes of CO2 equivalents in 2011. In 2011, about 92% (1.1 million tonnes) of the Group’s emissions of CO2-equivalents was generated by the German gas power plants Knapsack, Emden and Robert Frank. The CO2 emissions from the district heating activities amounted to about 7% (0.08 million tonnes) and came from the non-renewable share of the waste and some oil. Greenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse gases Full-time from equivalents in Statkraft water reservoirs Percentage of women in Statkraft Mill tonnes CO2 equivalents 2.0 The decomposition 4 000 of biomass can, under certain conditions, cause emissions 25% of the greenhouse gas methane from hydropower reservoirs. Statkraft has conducted research 20% 1.5 into emissions3 of 000greenhouse gases from hydropower reservoirs since 2003, both in cold Nordic reservoirs and in subtropical reservoirs in Laos. From 2007, the 15% International 1.0 2 000 Hydropower Association (IHA) and UNESCO have lead a process to look into what part of 10% the emissions are due to nature’s own processes and what part is due to the manmade 0.5 1 000 reservoir (net emissions1). In 2010, IHA/UNESCO prepared guidelines for data 5% collection 0 to make measurements 0 from reservoirs in different climate zones comparable. 0% In 2010, 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2008 2009 2010 2011 Norway Nordic Rest of the International Energy Agency (IEA) started a similar process.

In 2010 and 2011, Statkraft conducted a study in Laos in cooperation with Theun Hinboun Power Company (THPC), Sintef and EDF. Two older reservoirs, a recently established reservoir (Nam Theun II) and a new, planned reservoir were studied. The surprising conclusion was that older reservoirs in climates as warm as in Laos actively bound CO2 through the day, and that they were only a minor source of greenhouse gas emissions. The results have been published and have also been mentioned in IPCC’s new report on renewable energy (2011). Statkraft plans a follow-up study in 2012, when the new THXP reservoir starts operations. Research results so far indicate that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs generally represent a smaller problem than previously assumed. Emission quota and green energy trading Statkraft is engaged in trading with all types of carbon certificates permitted in the European quota trading system (EU ETS). We trade in EUAs (European Union Allowances), CERs (Certified Emission Reductions) and ERUs (Emission Reduction Units). Furthermore, we participate in projects under the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism and JI (Joint Implementation), and buy emission permits directly from such projects. One of our core activities relating to emissions trading is designing products enabling our customers to reduce costs of complying with CO2 requirements. Statkraft also offers guarantees of origin, i.e. documents that guarantee what source a given amount of power has been produced from. Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Three of SN Power’s hydropower projects were CDM registered in 2011: La Confluencia (Chile), Ambuklao (the Philippines) and Binga (the Philippines). Biodiversity Statkraft aims to ensure that the Group’s activities work in conjunction with ecosystems and the landscape. We are continuously implementing measures to limit our ecological footprint and have a particular focus on special responsibility species, i.e. species which Norway has an international responsibility to conserve. Impact on biodiversity Statkraft has developed a method to map and limit the activities’ impact on biodiversity in Norwegian water regulation areas. The method was developed through a pilot project in the Nore water regulation area. Mapping of another four water regulation areas has started and will be completed in 2012. The mapping method aims to identify potential ecological conflicts. The data basis is obtained from public databases and covers protected areas, species and nature types. This method development is a ground-breaking effort in the power industry and the results will provide a better basis for assessing how the operation of plants can be adapted to such potential ecological conflicts. Sustainable fish stocks Statkraft’s environmental activities relating to river systems and fish include environmentally adapted operation of the power plants, laying down suitable spawning and smolt growth substrate, fish restocking, egg planting, construction of fish ladders and improvement of thresholds and migration barriers. The goal is to achieve sustainable and self-regulating fish stocks. In addition to measures imposed by the licenses, Statkraft also implements voluntary measures, often in cooperation with local interests and authorities. A specific example of this is Statkraft’s involvement to contribute to secure the eel population, which is vulnerable to turbine injuries when migrating from regulated rivers. In Sweden, the eels are moved downstream of the power plants, while turbine control systems have been developed in Germany to improve eel survival rates. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 116 Statkraft operates nine fish cultivation facilities and is a large producer of stocking fish and fish eggs in Norway and Sweden. We also carry out comprehensive freshwater biology studies and operate two of Norway’s three salmon gene banks. White-tailed Eagle The R&D activities at Smøla in connection with white-tailed eagles and Smøla grouse continued in 2011, also after the conclusion of the major BirdWind R&D programme in 2010. The primary purpose was to ensure continuity in the collection of data while awaiting the start of a new R&D project focusing on the development of methods to reduce the risk of bird collisions. In addition, a pilot project was initiated to test a video monitoring system for bird activity near the most exposed turbines. If it works, this system will be used to record the effect of the anti-collision measures. The preliminary results of ongoing population studies of white-tailed eagles in the Smøla area indicate that most of the pairs which earlier bred in the wind farm area have now found new territories away from the wind farm, and that the white-tailed eagle population is stabile. Wild reindeer Statkraft participates in several research projects to safeguard the wild reindeer, one of the species for which Norway has a special responsibility. The background for participation is that several of Statkraft’s power plants are located in Norwegian wild reindeer areas (Setesdalsheiene, Hardangervidda, Nordfjella and the Dovre region). The projects’ goal is to strengthen the knowledge basis for the wild reindeer management by studying how the reindeer use the areas and their behaviour. To Statkraft, it is particularly important to obtain more knowledge of how physical disruptions to the landscape, traffic and other activities affect the reindeers’ area use, and to consider the possibility and effect of mitigating measures. Energy consumption In 2011, electricity consumption in Statkraft was 1150 GWh, of which 77% was used for pumped-storage hydropower. All electricity used to operate plants and offices has been certified as renewable in accordance with RECS. Statkraft saves energy A major energy efficiency project was initiated at Statkraft’s Norwegian hydropower plants in 2010. The objective is a 35% reduction of internal energy consumption, and this will primarily be achieved through installation of control systems for pumps, ventilation, heating and lighting. The initial phase of the project included the Nore, Rana and Aura power plant groups, and this phase was completed in 2011 with good results. The project will be continued in more power plant groups in 2012, and the measures are scheduled to be introduced in all power plant groups by 2015. Local pollution and Statkraft’s operation of hydro, wind and gas power plants entails no waste management significant waste production, emissions or discharges compared with other industry. Local pollution Statkraft faces only limited challenges as regards local pollution. The greatest environmental risk is associated with oil spills from vehicles, construction equipment and production equipment. Several incidents involving minor oil spills were recorded in 2011, but none of these affected the local environment to any significant degree. Noise, dust and smell in connection with transport, construction and operation of plants can also be a challenge locally. HEALTH AND SAFETY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 117 Operation of gas power plants entails emissions of NOX, as well as discharge of cooling water. District heating plants entail emissions of NOX and SOx. Such emissions can cause over-fertilisation and acidification. The environmental impact will depend on the vulnerability of adjacent areas. Waste handling The Group aims to separate as much as possible of its waste at source. All hazardous waste is processed in accordance with applicable regulations. The operations generated about 96 700 tonnes of hazardous waste in 2011. More than 99 per cent came from the Group’s biomass plant in Germany and the district heating plant in Trondheim. In addition, 7700 tonnes of other waste was generated. In 2011, the operations in Norway have focused on mapping the existence of contaminated (heavy metals, PAH) sandblasting sand at the company’s pipe trenches and identifying locations where this may cause an environmental or health-related risk. SN Power (Peru) has initiated an effort to replace equipment and oils containing PCB. Both efforts will continue in 2012. Environmental incidents Environmental incidents are recorded systematically for the entire Group and reported every month to the corporate management and board. No serious environmental incidents have been recorded since 2008, but 185 minor environmental incidents with little or no impact on the environment were reported in 2011. Most of the environmental incidents were short-term breaches of the river regulation provisions, minor oil spills and non-conformities in connection with waste management. Health and safety Statkraft has a clear goal of zero work accidents with serious consequences and zero breaches of the requirements relating to physical safety measures in connection with the Group’s activities. Clear requirements and close follow-up of all operations and projects are decisive to achieve safe and sound workplaces and good results. In 2011, five fatal accidents took place in connection with Statkraft’s activities. Three contractors lost their lives during work on the THXP expansion project in Laos, one contractor died in the Kargi development project in Turkey and one employee died in a work related accident in the Istad Group in Norway. 141 lost-time injuries were recorded among the Group’s employees and contractors in 2011. The TRI rate was 4.5 for employees and 3.4 for contractors. Health and safety Statkraft works actively and systematically to achieve a working work in statkraft environment which promotes good health and is free of injuries. Our goal is zero injuries, and we maintain the fundamental approach of identifying health and safety risks before starting any activity. In 2011, there has been particular focus on sound reporting and follow-up of undesirable incidents and a more systematic approach in accident investigation. HEALTH AND SAFETY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 118 Safety culture based on transparency Statkraft wants to nurture a safety culture based on transparency and continuous improvement. All accidents, near-misses and hazardous conditions are therefore recorded and followed up in a consistent manner, and sharing of experiences across the organisation is encouraged. In 2011, SN Power has had a special focus on registration of undesirable incidents, through close follow-up of registered incidents and audits. The number of registered near-misses and hazardous conditions in the Statkraft Group has increased in recent years. This is a positive development as regards achieving transparency in relation to the health and safety work, transfer of experience across the Group and continuous improvement. Health and safety expertise Sound expertise with regards to desired health and safety behaviour is a key precondition if Statkraft is to achieve its zero injuries objective. Information and training in connection with these topics will therefore be given systematically on all levels in the organisation: ππ Health and safety has been included as a regular topic in the introduction programme for new employees and in all management programmes in the Group. ππ An online basic course in health and safety is available to all employees. ππ An online health and safety course focusing on operations was completed in 2011. The course is mandatory for all employees and contractors in Statkraft’s operations unit who work at the company’s plants, regardless of location. The course is also available for employees and contractors in other parts of the activities, both nationally and internationally. ππ All safety delegates and members of the Working Environment Committee (AMU) attend 40-hour health and safety course. Health and safety in projects Furthermore, Statkraft has prepared checklists and procedures to ensure systematic attention to health and safety in all project phases, from planning and tender work to construction and operations. Health and safety assessments form part of the supporting documentation in all main decisions. Statkraft offers a special training programme for project managers. In 2012, work will focus especially on expanding and updating the health and safety module in this programme. A special health and safety manual will also be prepared. Accident investigation All fatal accidents, serious injuries, near-misses with serious damage or injury potential and serious environmental incidents with significant damage to the environment are subject to independent investigation in Statkraft. The investigation is presented in an investigation report describing the course of events, causes and corrective measures. The investigation report is submitted to and followed up by the respective boards. A brief summary of each investigation report is also made available for the entire organisation in order to learn from serious incidents. In 2011, 81 investigations were conducted, of which 48 in the Group’s project activities. In 2011, Statkraft and SN Power, in cooperation with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, held a course in accident investigation as part of the effort to raise the companies’ expertise in this area. Absence due to illness Absence due to illness in Statkraft was 3.4% in 2011. Statkraft’s goal is to achieve a sickness absence rate of less than 3.5%. All Norwegian companies in the Group have entered into Inclusive workplace (IA) agreements, with active follow-up of absence and close cooperation with the company health service. HEALTH AND SAFETY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 119 Traffic safety in SN Power SN Power conducted a traffic safety campaign in 2011.The campaign was aimed at employees and their families and used a number of measures, including seminars, monthly updates and a family outing. Everyday safety in the production unit In the first quarter of 2012, Statkraft’s production unit conducted a health and safety campaign concerning better everyday safety. The campaign is aimed especially at reducing the number of eye injuries. Accidents Five fatal accidents were registered in connection with the Group’s activities in 2011, of which one in consolidated activities (Kargi, Turkey). Three contractors lost their lives in the Theun Hinboun expansion project in Laos, one contractor died in the development project Kargi in Turkey and one employee died in the Istad Group in Norway. 141 lost-time injuries and 281 injuries overall were recorded among the Group’s employees and contractors in 2011. This yields an injury frequency (TRI) of 10.6 for the Group’s employees and 6.2 for the Group’s contractors. Development of new power and Power generation and distri Fatalities Fatal accidents district heating (Statkraft’s share) (Statkraft’s share) Number 10 In 2011, four contractors 1 200 and one employee died in the Statkraft Group.

In addition to police investigations, all fatal accidents have been subject to investigation immediately following the incidents. The investigation reports, including improvement measures, are then presented to and followed up in the relevant boards. Several measures have been implemented following the accidents, for example increased focus on applicable guidelines for working at heights and correct use of safety equipment. In June, the corporate management held a meeting with the main contractor for THXP to further emphasise the seriousness of the unfortunate accident statistics and discuss possible corrective measures. In general, all projects greatly emphasise sound health and safety expertise among own employees and basic safety training of all contractors and subcontractors. There were no fatal accidents in SN Power in 2011. This is a gratifying development and the result of a systematic health and safety effort in all projects. Expertise is given special attention in all project phases and on all organisational levels. Following a large number of traffic accidents in previous years, a traffic safety campaign was also launched in 2011. Injuries The LTI rate (number of lost-time injuries per million working hours) was 4.5 (3.4 in 2010) among employees, while LTI among the Group’s contractors was 3.4 (13.6 in 2010). HEALTH AND SAFETY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 120 Lost-time and total recordable injurie Correspondingly, the TRI rate (number of injuries per million working hours) among rates for employees and suppliers employees was 10.0 (6.8 in 2010) and 6.2 among contractors (16.4 in 2010). In total, 20 280 injuries (81 in 2010) were recorded, of which 141 (52 in 2010) were lost-time injuries, among the Group’s employees and contractors. The total number of injuries has 15 risen significantly in 2011, primarily due to the fact that all activities where Statkraft’s shareholding exceeds 20% as of 2011 have now been included. Previously, the figures 10 only included businesses where Statkraft’s shareholding exceeded 50%. Two of the injury 5 accidents in 2011 were categorised as serious, or with a serious injury potential, and have been subject to an independent investigation. 0 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 The operations have seen a positive development in recent years, with the TRI injury ■ LTI-employees ■ TRI-employees frequency for employees dropping from 15.9 in 2006 to 6.8 in 2010. In 2011, this value ■ LTI-contractors ■ TRI-contractors rose to 10.6, but much of the increase can be explained by a larger share of the activities (shareholdings exceeding 20%) being included. At the same time, it must be noted that the number of accidents without serious consequence is on the increase. Follow-up of less serious incidents has therefore been intensified and Statkraft’s operating unit will conduct a health and the safety campaign in the first quarter of 2012. The latter is aimed especially at reducing the number of eye injuries. The company’s development projects show significantly improved health and safety performance in 2011 compared with 2010. The TRI injury frequency among contractors has dropped from 16.4 to 6.2, and the lost-time injury frequency has dropped from 13.6 to 3.4. The decline is assumed to be the result of both good injury-preventive work and a safer and more complete registration of the number of working hours. No serious accidents involving third parties were recorded in 2011. Unsafe conditions and near-misses Systematic registration and follow-up of hazardous conditions and near-misses are important parts of the transparency culture and 6125 hazardous conditions (4853 in 2010) and 365 near-misses (114 in 2010) were recorded in 2011. 38% of the incidents took place in the project activities. Safeguarding people All buildings, plants and infrastructure in Statkraft are secured against and assets unauthorised access. Statkraft is now active in areas with political instability, increasing the need for security personnel. Securing of plants All Statkraft buildings, plants and infrastructure are secured against unauthorised access. The purpose of this is both to secure the Group’s assets against extreme threats and vandalism, but also to protect third parties against safety risks in connection with the Group’s installations. Security Statkraft is now involved in development activities in countries and areas with political instability. This raises a need to secure people and assets, using measures including deployment of security personnel who, if so warranted by the risk picture, may be armed. The Group’s guidelines for how security for people and assets should be secured in operational and project-related activities were prepared and adopted in 2011. The guidelines apply to all employees and contractors and are based on internationally recognized good practice, including: ππ The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights ππ The UN Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials ππ The UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials EMPLOYEES AND ORGANISATION CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 121 Security assessments The security situation, as regards e.g. political instability, terrorism and kidnapping, is followed up continuously in the areas where Statkraft is active. If the situation so requires, measures such as travel restrictions will be implemented. Employees and Current and future Statkraft employees are the company’s most organisation important resource, and we want Statkraft to be an attractive employer which facilitates development. The correct expertise is a decisive factor if Statkraft is to achieve its growth and profitability goals. Attractive workplace Statkraft has worked systematically over time on employer branding, and this has yielded results. Statkraft remains a popular employer, both among students and the working population. Employer branding work Statkraft has worked on employer branding in a focused manner since 2001. In order to ensure future growth and profitability, it is important for Statkraft to recruit the necessary expertise. The employer branding work is aimed at both students and experienced professionals. The Universum Student Survey is Norway’s largest career, working life and future expectations survey among students. Over the course of the past ten years, Statkraft has made steady progress in the ranking of attractive employers. In the 2011 survey, engineering students ranked Statkraft seventh (fifth in 2010), while economics students ranked Statkraft as the 30th most attractive employer (17th in 2010). Statkraft also achieved good results in the Universum Professionals Survey, which measures the popularity of companies among professionals with an average 5.5 years of work experience. Among engineers, Statkraft was ranked sixth in 2011 (ninth in 2010), while economists rank Statkraft as Norway’s 12th best workplace (14th in 2010). Summer project Statkraft’s summer project took place for the eight time in 2011. The summer project gives a group of students from different studies the opportunity to get to know the energy industry and Statkraft. To Statkraft, the summer project is a great PR opportunity. The 2011 project focused on the South American gas markets, and the project result was presented to the corporate management in August. Trainees and apprentices Statkraft has a two-year trainee programme which is very popular among graduate students. In 2011, a total of 22 trainees were working in different parts of the Group, both in Norway and abroad. The trainee programme has become more international in recent years in time with Statkraft’s development. Several of the trainees have been assigned to Statkraft’s development projects abroad during their trainee period, and 2011 was the first year that SN Power participated in the programme. For Statkraft, ensuring good recruitment is important for the operation of our plants. Trainee positions have therefore been established in all parts of the Group for different types of apprenticeship certificates. In 2011, 79 apprentices were working for Statkraft. EMPLOYEES AND ORGANISATION CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 122 Organisation and March 2011 saw the launch of Statkraft’s revised management platform. The management platform sets clear requirements for managers in the Group. 2011 also saw a new employee survey in the Group, following a one-year hiatus. New management platform Statkraft’s management platform was revised in 2011. The platform is a clearer and more focused edition of the Group’s former management requirements and emphasises three main areas – the ability to inspire others, the ability to develop own employees and the company’s expertise and the ability to organise the work and deliver results as regards the Group’s strategies. All managers will be evaluated against the requirements in the management platform. Statkraft has special Group programmes for manager development. Leadership in Statkraft (LIS) is a basic course, while NEXT is aimed at managers with some experience. A programme for more experienced managers has also been developed, and will be starting up in January 2012. In 2011, 72 managers participated in the Group’s management programmes, 56 in LIS and 16 in NEXT. The programmes are undergoing continuous development and are adapted to new challenges, including those that result from international growth. Statkraft also has its own training programme for project managers, and 38 employees participated in these programmes in 2011. Employee survey Statkraft regularly conducts surveys to evaluate the organisation and management of the parent company and the subsidiaries. The 2011 survey was new (no survey in 2010) and especially important following two years of changes both as regards corporate management, organisation and strategy. The same survey was conducted in the parent company, Skagerak Energi and SN Power. The surveys covered topics such as leadership, cooperation, working conditions, ethics and corporate responsibility and personal development. The purpose of the survey was to compare ourselves with other companies in the industry and make Statkraft a better place to work. The results of the survey were generally good. For several areas, including job satisfaction and loyalty, Statkraft’s scores are significantly better than the industry average. The survey is an important tool for assessing Statkraft as a workplace, and the results are followed up both by the corporate management and by the individual department. Statkraft European Work Council In 2010, Statkraft entered into an agreement with the European Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU) concerning the establishment of a European works council (Statkraft European Works Council, SEWC) in the Group. The agreement is based on applicable EU Directives and national tariff agreements. Statkraft’s works council was established in 2011 with employee representatives from Norway, Sweden, Germany and the UK. SEWC aims to ensure a good flow of information about decisions that affect the organisation in different ways, and provides employee representatives from different countries with a formal and accepted venue where they can meet the corporate management.

We develop guidelines and routines that will ensure the implementation of respect for the human rights both in operations and projects. Business and human rights The UN’s and ILO’s human rights declarations make up a set of obligations directed at sovereign states, not companies. However, it has now become generally recognised that companies have a major responsibility to safeguard the human rights. Statkraft monitors and partakes in the international development in this area, particularly through the implementation of the UN’s principles on business and human rights. These principles were recognised by the UN’s Human Rights Council in 2011 and are already incorporated in e.i. the OECD’s guidelines for multinational companies. Statkraft and human rights Within its sphere of influence, Statkraft supports and respects internationally recognised human rights, employee rights, including freedom of association and recognition of the right to collective bargaining, abolition of all forms of forced labour and child labour and abolishment of discrimination as regards employment and professions. Statkraft is a member of the UN’s Global Compact and is committed to following up the initiative and its ten principles relating to human rights, labour, environment and anticorruption. Statkraft’s commitment to contribute to respect for and promotion of human rights is described in Statkraft’s Code of conduct and Statkraft’s Code of conduct for suppliers. Ensuring respect for human rights has been included as a requirement in Statkraft’s GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE (GRI) CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 124 contracts. Statkraft continues to work to further improve follow-up of human rights through the entire project process and will in 2012 focus especially on development and implementation of a more standardised evaluation of aspects relating to the respect for the human rights as part of the Group’s project management system, in line with recommendations given in the UN guidelines. Global reporting Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a voluntary organisation that, over the initiative (GRI) past 15 years, has worked to establish a standard for corporate reporting of corporate responsibility and sustainable development. Since 2002, Statkraft has issued systematic information about strategy and performance in connection with corporate responsibility. From 2004, the reporting has been based on GRI’s guidelines and from 2010 based on GRI’s guidelines prepared especially for the energy industry. About GRI GRI develops industry-adapted guidelines for sustainability reporting. The guidelines define essential reporting principles and a number of indicators for all sustainability areas. GRI develops tools for sustainability reporting Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an independent organisation which, since being established in 1997, has worked to create a more standardised format for corporate responsibility and sustainability reporting. The most recent main version of GRI’s guidelines (G3) for sustainability reporting was issued in the autumn of 2006. In 2009, guidelines specially prepared for the energy industry (Electric Utilities Sector Supplement) were approved. GRI defines ten reporting principles. Four of these deal with establishing the scope and content of the report, while the other six address the quality of the information presented. Furthermore, GRI defines a number of both general and industry-specific indicators, distributed between core and additional indicators, for enterprise profile, economy, environment, working conditions, human rights, corporate citizenship and product responsibility. Description of follow-up and management mechanisms must also be provided for all areas. Different reporting levels GRI facilitates reporting at different levels – A, B and C – where A is the highest level. In addition, the reporting level is marked with a ”+” if the reporting has been verified by an external third party. THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 125 The UN Global Statkraft is a member of the UN Global Compact. Global Compact is a UN Compact initiative encouraging businesses to commit to sustainable development. The UN Global Compact aims to encourage business and industry to support About the UN Global and promote universal goals established by the UN, including the Compact millennium goals. Global Compact includes ten fundamental principles for employee rights, human rights, protection of the environment and combating corruption. Companies that endorse Global Compact commit themselves to support and respect the ten principles and report their performance in the various areas annually. In 2011, Global Compact introduced a scheme where all members are classified in three categories; Learning Platform, Active level and Advanced level. Global Compact is now the world’s largest initiative to promote corporate responsibility and has more than 10 000 members, where of approximately 7000 companies from 135 countries. By adapting strategies and activities to Global Compacts ten principles, businesses can contribute to markets, trading, technology and financial schemes developing in a manner which benefits all economies and communities. Global Compact’s network of both companies and other players is an important forum for sharing experience, and Global Compact has become an established tool for sound business management.
