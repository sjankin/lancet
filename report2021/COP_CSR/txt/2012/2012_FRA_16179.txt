Achieving this goal requires the early use of the restrictions put in place by REACH starting with the design of new products. For example, plasticizers used for the formulation of ﬂexible PVC are subject to demanding restrictions starting with the design of products that include this material. As a result, none of the many phthalates included among the 73 substances currently listed by REACH is used by Legrand for its European production. Consequently, no substitutions will be made in the scope of application of European regulations. 52 2011 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT LEGRAND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 05 Environment: 2011 policies and results To strengthen and sustain this proactive policy, a REACH expert By offering all of these environmental data in a single document, committee consisting of Group material and process experts and the PEP provides the economic chain with serious and reliable supported by the purchasing organization was created in 2011. information that allows a technical choice to be made with a Its role is, upon the publication of lists of candidate substances, stronger environmental dimension. to focus on promoting alternative product design solutions and The PEP and PEP Ecopassport program have been recognized deﬁning their manufacturing process. by the Grenelle Environment Forum in France and are becoming In addition, as it has done for the RoHS Directive, the Group has more widely available and used internationally. established a process for reference identiﬁcation of some of the Legrand already has more than 500 PEPs available on its brands’ products that contain REACH “candidate list” substances.

This is a free translation into English of the original report issued in the French language and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers. Further to your request and in our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Legrand, we have performed a review with the aim of providing limited assurance on the environmental, social and prevention indicators (1) selected by Legrand and identiﬁed by the sign ✓ in the part 5 of the Registration Document of Legrand for the ﬁnancial year 2011 (the “Indicators”). These indicators have been prepared under the responsibility of Legrand’s Senior Management in accordance with the internal reporting criteria that include all procedures related to the reporting of: 05 ■ environmental indicators, ■ social indicators, ■ health and safety indicators. These procedures are available for consultation at the Sustainable Development & Strategic Group Process department and summarized in the part 5 of the Registration Document (hereinafter the “Reporting Criteria”). It is our responsibility to express a conclusion on the selected Indicators based on our review. ■ NATURE AND SCOPE OF OUR WORK We conducted our work in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We conducted the following procedures in order to provide limited assurance that the selected Indicators identiﬁed by the sign ✓ did not contain any material anomalies for the selected entities (2). A higher level of assurance would have required more extensive work. For the selected Indicators, we have: ■ assessed the Reporting Criteria with respect to their relevance, reliability, objectivity, clarity and completeness; ■ carried out interviews with the people responsible for the application of the Reporting Criteria in the Sustainable Development & Strategic Group Process department; ■ performed consistency checks on the application of the internal Reporting Criteria in the selected entities, veriﬁed the submission of the selected Indicators by these entities at the various consolidation levels and tested calculations on a sampling basis. We were assisted in our work by experts in environment and sustainable development under the responsibility of Mr. Eric Dugelay for Deloitte & Associés and Mr. Thierry Raes for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit.

Without prejudice to the conclusion of our review, as expressed above, we draw your attention to the following points detailed in pages 57 and 58 of the Registration Document: ■ two Brazilian sites (Itu and Manaus) reported neither waste data nor data relative to water consumption for 2011, due to the lack of maturity and stability in the information collection process. ■ the Wuxi site in China did not report waste data for 2011 by lack of maturity in information collection process. The reporting process of the sites belonging to the Russian entity Kontaktor is not yet stabilized and could affect the quality of their data. Nevertheless, these points do not have any material impact on the selected consolidated Indicators.

Gilles Schnepp, Olivier Bazil and François Grappotte, Directors of Legrand France S.A. and/or Legrand Netherlands B.V. and/or any subsidiaries which may become parties to the agreement in future. ■ AGREEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY THE SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETING Agreements and commitments authorized in previous years and having continuing effect during the year Pursuant to Article R. 225-30 of the French Commercial Code, we have been advised that the following agreements and commitments authorized in previous years have had continuing effect during the year. Tax consolidation agreement The Company has opted for the tax consolidation regime. The scope of the consolidated tax group headed by the Company was amended to retroactively incorporate as from January 1, 2003 Legrand France and the companies in the scope of Legrand France’s consolidated tax group prior to the acquisition of over 95% of Legrand France’s capital by Legrand. These companies include: Chessy, Distrasa, Legrand SNC, Pammelec, Planet Wattohm, Sarlam, Ura and Groupe Arnould. In addition, Châteaudun Développement 3 and ICM Group – which were acquired in 2005 – joined the consolidated tax group in 2006, as well as Alpes Technologies and Prefatech in 2009. Tax savings made by the group through the use of tax losses of loss-making members of the consolidated tax group are not paid back to the companies concerned by Legrand when they return to proﬁt. Facility Agreement BNP Paribas, Crédit Mutuel – CIC, Natexis Banque Populaire, the Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Société Générale, acting as lenders, entered into a Facility Agreement for the beneﬁt of Legrand France, Van Geel Legrand B.V. and Legrand, acting as borrowers, with BNP Paribas acting as Facility Agent and Swingline Agent and the Company as party to the Agreement in the capacity of Guarantor. 09 Pursuant to this agreement, the lenders provided Legrand France, Van Geel Legrand B.V. and Legrand, acting as borrowers, with a maximum borrowing facility of €2,200,000,000. The Facility Agreement borrowing costs totaled €3.4 million in respect of the ﬁscal year ended December 31, 2011. In October 2011, the Company had repaid and cancelled Tranche B of the 2006 agreement as part of the new Facility Agreement approved on July 27, 2011. Factoring Agreement with BNP Paribas Factor This Factoring Agreement authorized by your Company and entered into by Legrand SNC, an indirect subsidiary of the Company, involves the periodic transfer of receivables without recourse to the ﬁnancial institution BNP Paribas Factor. The fees and commissions relating to this Agreement amounted to €0.6 million for Legrand SNC with respect to ﬁscal year 2011, and the balance of receivables transferred as at December 31, 2011 stood at €10.4 million. Agreement with Mr. Olivier Bazil, Director of the Company This agreement sets the methods for calculating supplementary pension beneﬁts payable to Mr. Olivier Bazil, as well as to all other eligible members of the Executive Committee. These beneﬁts act as a top-up to statutory pension entitlements and apply to Executive Committee members who have at least ten years’ service within the Company and are at least 60 years of age when they retire. Under the supplementary plan, beneﬁts are calculated with a view to providing eligible members with an overall pension (including statutory 2011 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT LEGRAND 149 09 SHARE OWNERSHIP Statutory Auditors’ special report on related party agreements and commitments beneﬁts) representing 50% of the average of their highest two years’ compensation (including bonuses and indemnities) out of the three years preceding their departure from the Company. The plan also provides for the spouse to be paid a reversionary pension in the event of a plan member’s death, representing 60% of the total beneﬁts. Mr. Olivier Bazil claimed his retirement entitlements as from May 31, 2011, which caused the agreement to take effect. Accordingly, Mr. Olivier Bazil received a supplementary pension totaling €224,272. Agreements and commitments authorized in previous years but not enforced during the year We have been advised that the following agreements and commitments already authorized in previous years by the Shareholders’ Meeting have had continuing effect but were not enforced during the year. Amendment to the employment contract of Mr. Olivier Bazil’s, Director of the Company The lump-sum compensation payable on termination and under the non-competition clause, which had been incorporated into Mr. Olivier Bazil’s employment contract pursuant to the Board of Directors’ decision of November 13, 2001 has been withdrawn. The standard non-competition clause corresponding to the terms and conditions deﬁned in the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Metallurgy Industry, which had been incorporated into Mr. Olivier Bazil’s employment contract at the end of 2003, at the same time as the other Executive Committee members’ contracts, has been maintained. This clause entitles the Company, at its sole initiative, to impose on the individuals concerned an obligation not to compete for a period of one to two years from the date they leave the Company, in return for compensation set at 50% of their base salaries (ﬁxed and variable). As Mr. Olivier Bazil claimed his retirement entitlements as from May 31, 2011, date on which his duties as an employee ended, the Board of Directors decided, on May 26, 2011, to release Mr. Olivier Bazil from all his obligations under the non-competition clause, without consideration or compensation. Agreement with Mr. Gilles Schnepp, CEO of the Company This agreement sets the methods for calculating supplementary pension beneﬁts payable to Mr. Gilles Schnepp, as well as to all other eligible members of the Executive Committee. These beneﬁts act as a top-up to statutory pension entitlements and apply to Executive Committee members who have at least ten years’ service within the Company and are at least 60 years of age when they retire. Under the supplementary plan, beneﬁts are calculated with a view to providing eligible members with an overall pension (including statutory beneﬁts) representing 50% of the average of their highest two years’ compensation (including bonuses and indemnities) out of the three years preceding their departure from the Company. The plan also provides for the spouse to be paid a reversionary pension in the event of a plan member’s death, representing 60% of the total beneﬁts. Non-competition clause attached to the corporate office of Mr. Gilles Schnepp, Chairman and CEO of the Company This two-year non-competition clause may solely be enforced at the Company’s initiative. As a consideration for this obligation, should the Company decide to enforce it, Mr. Gilles Schnepp would receive a monthly compensation equivalent to 50% of the average monthly ﬁxed and variable remuneration he received over his last twelve months of service within the Company.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. Legrand SA Société anonyme 128, avenue du Maréchal de Lattre de Tassigny 87000 Limoges To the Shareholders In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Annual General Meetings, we hereby report to you for the year ended December 31, 2011 on: ■ the audit of the accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Legrand; ■ the justiﬁcation of our assessments; ■ the speciﬁc veriﬁcation required by law. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated ﬁnancial statements based on our audit. ■ I OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, using sample testing techniques or other selection methods, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and signiﬁcant estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall ﬁnancial statement presentation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the ﬁnancial position of the Group as at December 31, 2011 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. 206 2011 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT LEGRAND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH IFRS STANDARDS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010 10 Statutory Auditors’ Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS for the year ended December 31, 2011 ■ II JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS In accordance with the requirements of Article L.823-9 of French Company Law (Code de commerce) relating to the justiﬁcation of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: Goodwill and intangible assets represent respectively €2.403,5 million and €1.767,4 million of the total consolidated assets of your Company and have been recorded as a result of the acquisition of Legrand France in 2002 and of other subsidiaries since 2005. As mentioned in Notes 1.G and 1.H of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, your Company performs, each year, an impairment test of the value of goodwill and intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful lives; and assesses whether changes or circumstances relating to long term assets, which could lead to an impairment loss, have occurred during the year. We have reviewed the methods by which the impairment tests are performed as well as the projected cash ﬂow and assumptions used for these impairment tests and veriﬁed that information disclosed in Notes 2 and 3 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements is appropriate. These assessments were made as part of our audit approach of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the ﬁrst part of this report. ■ III SPECIFIC VERIFICATION As required by law, we also veriﬁed the information presented in the Group management report in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We have no matters to report regarding its fair presentation and consistency with the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

This report should be read in conjunction and construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.

These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, using sample testing techniques or other selection methods, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and signiﬁcant estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall ﬁnancial statement presentation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the Company’s ﬁnancial position and its assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2011 and the results of its operations for the period then ended in accordance with accounting rules and principles applicable in France. ■ II – JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS In accordance with the requirements of Article L. 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) relating to the justiﬁcation of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matter: Note 1.3 to the ﬁnancial statements sets forth the accounting policies related to the valuation of investments in participating interests. As part of our assessment of the accounting policies implemented by your Company, we have veriﬁed the appropriateness of the abovementioned accounting methods. These assessments were made as part of our audit approach for the ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the formation of the opinion expressed in the ﬁrst part of this report. 260 2011 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT LEGRAND APPENDIX A Appendix 3 ■ III – SPECIFIC VERIFICATIONS AND DISCLOSURES We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the speciﬁc veriﬁcations required by French law.
