Lantmännen is a solid company and in the current situation our broad range of operations is a buffer against sharp profitability swings. Pulled by Swecon, the Machinery Sector posted excellent earnings. The Agriculture Sector, which is undergoing major changes, performed well despite increasingly tough competition. Although food is a stable market, the Food Sector saw major challenges in 2011. The gap between grain and ethanol prices depressed profits in our energy operation. Despite this we see many opportunities in Agroetanol, whose different parts can work together and grow the business. The contribution-based operations in the Agriculture and Machinery Sectors posted positive results and the Board has decided to pay a 1 percent refund and final price adjustment in both areas. At the same time the Board wishes to highlight owner value and proposes a 5 percent contribution dividend and a contribution issue totaling MSEK 152. 2011 was a year marked by abrupt shifts between drought and rain. A dry spring led to the extremely early harvest in eastern Sweden, while rain made fall planting difficult, with uncombined areas in western and northern Sweden. Quality issues also came into focus. We saw very high quality – but low volume – in some areas and downgrading of grain due to rainfall and increased occurrence of mycotoxins in other areas. This year we again grappled with the challenge of knowing when, how and how much grain to sell. Happily, we can conclude that the pool price provided a pretty good dividend. While prices for dairy farmers remained fairly stable the, to say the least, turbulent situation in the dairy market and uncertainty about the impact of the restructuring changes have dampened both job satisfaction and willingness to invest. Nor, unfortunately, did we see any “ significant improvement in the challenging beef and pork markets. For me it is Shrinking livestock numbers are deeply unfortunate for both farmers and Lantmännen. In several contexts, including when we have had viewpoints on the Federation of Swedish Farmers (LFR)’s Food natural that we Strategy and the EU’s agricultural policy, Lantmännen pointed out that increasing crop and livestock production volumes is fundamental for take advantage creating profitability and competitiveness in Swedish agriculture. An important area for a company that operates from field to fork of the business is long-term sustainability issues. The fact that Lantmännen was one of the first companies in the world to purchase certified soy is just one example. The further fact that Arla, the dairy co-op, has also development decided to use only certified soy by 2015 shows that when we join forces farmers can influence development. For me it is natural that potential we take advantage of our business development potential and utilize our expertise throughout the chain! 8 Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2011 Chairman’s comments Another important factor in development, profitability and competitiveness is investment in R&D, research and development. During the year the Board actively worked on establishing a joint research foundation. Basically an amalgamation of our three foundations, the VL Foundation, the SL-Foundation and the Cerealia Foundation, the merger will provide us with a powerful foundation with both the expertise and capacity to develop our businesses. Owner influence was safeguarded by elected members of working groups and close interaction with the Board. During the year the Board met with all districts for a vote on important corporate governance issues including return requirements, dividend policy and the owner organization. These informal meetings provided a good picture of the mood in Lantmännen. During the year we also had a Future Group of young farmers meet to capture their views and wishes concerning Lantmännen. One of their messages was – clear and simple communication – an advice as good as any! It was also gratifying to note the group’s awareness of the importance of developing the farmer-owned companies. The year has also shown the importance of nurturing farmerowned businesses so that they are strong enough to be able to follow their strategies and retain their decision-making powers. Only strong companies can fulfill their duties towards their owners. To this end, Per Strömberg launched an important process of continuous improvement, mainly in production, supply chain and capital management. Per Strömberg chose to leave us in the autumn, but the direction and our strategies remain on track and give us a good basis for meeting the future. I want to give credit to all employees for their part in helping us post a decent profit despite the harsh conditions that prevailed in many of our markets in 2011. I would also like to extend a warm thank-you to Per Olof Nyman for shouldering the responsibility as Acting President and CEO. I am proud that the Group can handle major changes and that there are many qualified people who quickly and with great dedication take on new, challenging tasks. I summed up Lantmännen’s first ten years at the 2011 Annual General Meeting. The goal was to reduce our costs, strengthen the chain from field to fork, vertically integrate forward in the food chain, increase the owner benefits of owning industries and create new business opportunities for Swedish farmers. In retrospect, I see the field to fork vision as very strategic – it provides the conditions for both production and increased owner value. When I hand over the chairmanship of Lantmännen at the General Meeting I do it with great pride and confidence that we are on the right track. We jointly own a company that is of great benefit to us and which also has the power to help shape the development of Swedish agriculture!

A stronger brand benefits all operations A stronger position for Lantmännen in food means that Lantmännen will become more known for its unique values.

The more we communicate and elucidate our values, the more attractive we also become as an employer. A strong brand strengthens the original business From an ownership perspective the benefit of a strong brand is increased consumer demand for products containing grain, the base of our business. A strong brand also means that the agriculture, machinery and energy operations are strengthened by Lantmännen’s visibility as a partner that stands for predictability, sustainability, and reliability. By extension, this generates owner value through increased returns on contributed capital, which means owners share the value increase.

The products are marketed under well-known names such as Nötfor, Piggfor, Pullfor, Protect and the SW and Krafft brands. The Sector accounts for 29 percent of Lantmännen’s sales. Operations The Agriculture Sector consists of Lantmännen Lantbruk, Lantmännen Bygglant and Lantmännen Krafft. Lantmännen Lantbruk is also part-owner of the German company HaGe Kiel and Scandinavian Farmers. Based in Sweden, the Sector is also active in the international market, primarily in Germany, Poland, Holland and the Baltic region. The Sector has a total of 1,154 employees. In 2011 the Agriculture Sector’s management team added several new employees. In addition, new CEOs were recruited for Lantmännen Bygglant and for Lantmännen Krafft. The Agriculture Sector’s profit grew during the year. Business Environment and Market Due to deregulation and international trade agricultural markets are heavily dependent on the world economy, which has made the market volatile. 2011 opened with high grain prices, which rose further during the spring due to unfavorable weather. When grain availability increased from several major countries on the world market, prices fell back. During the fall, prices remained low, partly as a result of growing financial turmoil and tumbling stock markets. Swedish agriculture is characterized by increased market adaptation. The area under cultivation, intensity and choice of crops are adjusted according to profitability, which has led to more varied and unpredictable demand for feed and crop inputs. Meanwhile, competition has become greater as a number of new competitors have entered the market and the traditional players have expanded their range and geographic area “ or boosted their sales organization. 2011 had a positive impact on Swedish crop production. In the Agriculture Sector we concentrate activities that develop The Swedish Board of Agriculture estimated the grain acreand offer products and services that contribute to strong and competitive age to be 993,000 hectares, an increase of 3 percent over the agriculture.

Earnings improved in parallel with extensive internal work. Some important events during the year were: New freight agreements were signed, which, along with new shipping practices, will result in lower freight costs and streamline operations. Kimstad feed plant was commended and tied for silver in the Swedish Lean Prize competition for its LEAD work. Spring work went well as did grain deliveries to elevators despite fewer grain elevators. Several successful campaigns were conducted for offerings including the new wheat starch Lojal and triticale Empero, both developed in Lantmännen Lantbruk’s own breeding program. The organizational changes, which took effect December 1, and the decision to co-locate many salaried employees in Malmö, are key elements in the effort to strengthen our competitiveness. Operations of Lantmännen SW Seed were integrated with Lantmännen Lantbruk, further strengthening the Seed Grain & Garden Seed product segment. Financial performance in the contribution-based part of the Agriculture Sector Net sales for the year amounted to MSEK 10,544 (10,110), an increase of 4 percent. The increase in sales was primarily the result of higher prices for grain, fertilizer and feed, and higher volumes of seed grain and parts of the finished feed product range. Operating income for the year amounted to MSEK 57 (–49).

Sales of seed grain and garden seed for the spring planting season were good and export sales of garden seed increased significantly. However, the large amounts of precipitation caused sales for fall seeding to be lower than expected. Attractive products and services are a must in a competitive market The later seeding led to a sharp international increase in demand for hybrid varieties. Before the end of 2012 the availability of the hybrid rape variety Marquis will be secured for the German market, making the product portfolio more complete.

Crop protection performed well, although a lower need for herbicides and glyphosate along with decreased fall seeding affected sales. Fertilizer sales got off to a good start in the summer but declined afterwards due to a cautious market. The fertilizer market was marked by variable prices, more suppliers and increased competition, leading to changes in buying patterns. Animal feed Lantmännen Lantbruk offers a comprehensive range of feeds for livestock production under names such as Nötfor, Piggfor, Pullfor and Protect. Sales of Nötfor developed well during the year. Swedish milk production stabilized and investments were made in increasing capacity. At the same time the dairy market was hit by the general economic turmoil that characterized the second half. Swedish pork production had a difficult year with low settlement prices.

The company offers everything from small deliveries of materials to turnkey contracting of entire construction projects and energy installations. Building production inquiries during the year almost exclusively concerned milking parlors and sheds. Interest in new investments in pork production was very weak due to poor profitability in the industry. Sales of heating boilers took an upward turn. The first half saw strong interest in farm-based biogas plants, but without the Swedish Energy Agency’s support for biogas the anticipated increase in demand did not materialize. Lantmännen Bygglant’s first biogas plant opened for operation during the year and work on another plant commenced.

Focusing on people, the environment and machinery, Aspen has evolved to become the market leader in much of Europe and Canada. Alkylate petrol is an eco-friendly petroleum product primarily used in small engines such as lawn mowers, chainsaws and boats. Customers hail from forestry, park and property management, agriculture, horticulture, marine and motor sports. In 2011, a lowering of the alkylate tax in Finland led to higher sales. The marine segment in Sweden is performing well and Aspen believes the building of marinas that sell Aspen alkylate petrol from the pump will continue and is seeing an increased interest in alkylate from engine manufacturers. In 2012, the effort to reach out to new customer groups, particularly individuals in the Nordic countries, will continue. In the non-Nordic countries, the professional user is our main target.

The Sector’s sales amounted to MSEK 14,708 in 2011, with Sweden accounting for 31 percent of sales, Europe 65 percent and the rest of the world 4 percent.

Business Environment and Market 2011 was characterized by weak consumer demand and continued stiff competition in the food area. Due to prevailing economic conditions and high uncertainty, consumer behavior can be described as cautious and restrained, with a weak market as a result. Price is a central issue and is even more relevant in the current economic situation. In 2011, the grocery trade in Sweden placed bigger bets on private labels than before. Parallel to this, value added factors relating to health, quality, the environment and sustainability interest more and more consumers. Efficiency for enhanced competitiveness In the past year, efforts to streamline operations continued. It is necessary to continuously reduce costs to ensure competitiveness in the market.

Here are some examples of aspects that have been in responsibility focus during the year. The processing chain from growing grain to the finished product is complex. Specifications for grain vary depending on the Cadmium market and purpose, and are made backward in the chain by Cadmium is a heavy metal that occurs naturally in soil and can be partially absorbed by the crops that grow on the field. Because grain-based products are one of the sources of cadmium intake, low levels in commodity grains are important. For many years, Lantmännen has monitored the precise levels of cadmium in commodity grains to ensure low levels well below the apGrain requirements are specified by plicable legal requirements. The legislative level for cadmium in the end customer grain is 0.20 mg/kg and the typical value in our analyses ranges Lantmännen’s Lantmännen’s from 0.01 to 0.06 mg/kg. In other words, the amounts are 20 to brands business customers 4 times lower than the current legislation. Based on a new risk (Bread, breakfast, pasta, (Food, feed, paper starch, assessment by the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, there mixes, pet food) ethanol, glucose syrup) are now signs that a low intake of cadmium is becoming increasingly important for public health. Lantmännen has long worked strategically on the issue and is well prepared should more stringent legal requirements be imposed. Lantmännen safeguards its responsibility Fertilizer Food processing (mills, bakeries, kitchens) Feed processing The geological conditions of the cultivation site and natural soil Ethanol processing content are the key factors behind cadmium uptake by crops, over which we have no power. Efforts to control and manage cadmium uptake in crops must therefore concentrate on other factors.

These sources include fertilizers along with airborne deposition and erosion. Fertilizer is one of the factors that can be affected and is therefore important to work on actively.

Applying the GRI Food Processing sector supplement ensures relevant and clear disclosure of sustainability work. For this seventh sustainability report, Lantmännen has chosen to report according to GRI Level B according to its own judgment and integrate it into the annual report. The ambition is to develop future reports to the A+ level. The Sustainability Report also meets the requirements laid down in the Global Compact’s “Communication on Progress” (COP), i.e. reporting on the work of implementing the Global Compact’s principles for corporate social responsibility. Lantmännen signed the Global Compact in 2009 and has thus committed itself to publishing a COP. Additional reporting information • The report pertains to 2011, unless stated otherwise. • The report is annual, and the previous one was completed in February 2011. • The contact person for the report is Claes Johansson, Head of Sustainable Development. claes.johansson@lantmannen.com • The report refers primarily to the Lantmännen Group, including its Sectors. Associated companies and joint ventures are not included. • Disclosures are regarded as significant for Lantmännen and its stakeholders. The contents of this report were compiled in a process in which the Lantmännen Department for Sustainable Development and internal specialists in various areas determined the content together. Last year’s sustainability report was sent out to a substantial number of external stakeholders, including industry representatives, customers, authorities, policymakers, the trade press, et al., to give them the opportunity to voice their views and make comments.
