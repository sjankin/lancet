In January, the Supervisory Board appointed Morten Hübbe as CEO after Stine Bosse resigned. Morten Hübbe assumed the leadership of Tryg following a 2010 that had been characterised by extraordinary events and declining profitability. A major part of Morten Hübbe’s task was therefore to improve profitability in the insurance business during a period of difficult conditions on the investment markets. At the beginning of 2011, the Supervisory Board and the Executive Management set a target of achieving a medium-term return on equity of 20%, corresponding to a combined ratio of 90. The target underlines the Supervisory Board’s focus on profitability, ahead of growth, as the fundamental strategy for the coming years. The Supervisory Board is pleased to announce that, in 2011, Tryg made a significant step towards achieving this target. The financial result for 2011 therefore supports the view that At the beginning of 2011, the Supervisory the target is ambitious yet realistic.

Compared to the section The Tryg share on page 65. current specification of the capital requirement in the standard model, Tryg had excess cover of DKK 1,865m as of 31 December 2011. If this calibration of the capital requirements is maintained through to Solvency II, it is considered that many companies will need to strengthen their capital base in order to comply with the new capital requirements. Based on the internal capital model, the capital requirement for Tryg will be somewhat lower than that according to the standard model. Composition of partial capital model Solvency II gives scope to use internal models either fully or partially. Tryg’s approach is to use the existing internal model for areas where the risk is different from that determined using the standard model. Within the area of insurance risk, the belief is that Tryg will be able to model its own risk more accurately. For example, the standard model does not take into account geographic diversification between the Nordic countries, which is a significant aspect of Tryg’s Nordic exposure. On the other hand, the existing internal model’s treatStandard model Partial model Internal model ment of investment risks is very similar to that of the standard model, which must be viewed in the light of the homogenous Insurance risk Operational risk Credit risk TAC Market risk investment risk, which is generally secured across national borders by effective financial markets.

Risk takers are included under ’Senior employees’. The following assumptions were applied in calculating the market value of outstanding share options at the time of allocation: The expected volatility is based on the average volatility of Tryg shares. The expected maturity is 4 years, corresponding to the average of the exercise period of 3 to 5 years. The risk-free interest rate is based on a bullet loan with the same term as the expected term of the options at the time of allocation. The calculation is based on the strike price as set out in the option agreement and the average share price at the time of allocation. The dividend payout ratio is not included in the calculation as the strike price is reduced by dividends paid in order to prevent option holders from being placed at a disadvantage in connection with the company’s dividend payments. The assumptions for calculating the market value at the end of the period are based on the same principles as for the market value at the time of allocation. 100 | Annual report 2011 | Tryg A/S Notes 6 Matching shares 2011 TOTAL NUMBERS FAIR VALUE Average per Total fair Average per matching value per matching Total fair Group share at option at share at Value at Excecutive Riskgrant date grant date 31 Dec. 31 Dec.

The shares are reported at market value and are accrued over the four year maturation period. In 2011, the reported fair value of matching shares for the Group amounted to DKK 1m.

Assumptions for impairment test: The Value-in-use method is used Return Assumed requireannual growth ment 2011 > 5 years before tax Moderna Försäkringar 2.0% 12.7% MF Bilsport & MC Specialförsäkringar 2.0% 12.7% 2010 Moderna Försäkringar 2.5% 14.9% MF Bilsport & MC Specialförsäkringar 2.5% 14.9% Insurance activities in Sweden In 2009, Tryg acquired Moderna Försäkringar Sak AB, Modern Re S.A., Netviq AB and MF Bilsport & MC specialfösäkringar. The insurance activities were incorporated into the Tryg Group’s business structure in 2009 and are reported under Sweden. In 2010, the companies, excluding Modern Re S.A., were merged into Tryg Forsikring A/S as a branch of Moderna Försäkringar, branch of Tryg Forsikring A/S. Modern Re S.A. was discontinued in 2011. The activities in Modern Re have not affected the statement of the original goodwill, which is why the discontinuation of the company does not affect remaining goodwill. The assumed growth during the terminal period has been estimated based on expectations for general economic growth. The return requirement is based on an assessment of the risk profile for the tested business activities. Higher return requirements or lower growth would entail a lower value of the activities, whereas lower return requirements or higher growth expectations would entail a higher value. Trademarks and customer relations The impairment test performed for trademarks and customer relations did not indicate any impairment. Software The impairment charges are recognised in the income statement in total insurance operating expenses In the impairment test, the carrying amount is compared with the estimated present value of future cash flows.
