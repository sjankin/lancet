The framework is based upon our 5-point strategy that aims to integrate sustainability in our organization at levels starting with our employees and going up all the way to inspire our customers. In 2011, we have integrated sustainability as a key element in our organizational structure. Our sustainability management now runs under the operations function and works closely with all other functions to embed sustainability into all aspects of our operations, from Marketing to Human Resources Management to Finance. In 2011, we have created a cross-functional/cross-company sustainability steering committee. This committee is tasked with facilitating the implementation of sustainability management, each member in his/her respective function/company. Our sustainability management framework (page 7) has been developed to address what we recognize as the elements of sustainable growth for Nuqul Group, based on which a five point sustainability strategy (page 8) has been created. In 2011, we developed a three year action plan for sustainability deployment in Nuqul Group; the action plan was built upon our 5 point strategy with actions correlating to each point; we have conducted capacity building exercises for our employees in order to establish an understanding on the concepts of sustainability, we have established a sustainability dashboard for all business units to report on sustainability indicators related to their operations, the business units report their performance against the indicators on a monthly basis and are asked to correct any anomalies that affect their sustainability. As we have established the baseline for sustainability performance in Nuqul Group, we are looking forwards towards achieving effective improvements not only for the best interest and continuity of our business, but also for the tremendous added value such would have for our external and internal stakeholders. 5 Nuqul Tissue Egypt Fine KSA Nuqul Group Sustainability Week In 2011 we held the Nuqul Group Nuqul Group Sustainability Week in all our Sustainability Week business units, between the 13th and the Events in the 17th of November, and we encouraged all our Business Units business units to conduct awareness sessions aiming to promote employee knowledge of sustainability concept specific to the operations of each business unit. Fine Jordan Fine Jordan 6 Our Sustainability Framework is built around the key elements of our sustainable growth, through which we identified priority areas we address through our various management systems from quality assurance to governance to environmental impact. The framework has been built after numerous engagements with our stakeholders and our employees at all levels in order to provide for effective sustainability impact management for all concerned stakeholders achieving maximum sustainability and added value. We have built our Sustainability Strategy (Page 8) in order to deploy this framework at the group level and accelerate the uptake of sustainability across all our businesses.

We undertake a proactive and comprehensive approach in risk assessment to determine the potential impacts of our products on the environment and on the health and safety of both our employees and customers and endeavor to mitigate these risks with innovation. In 2011, we commissioned the first Product Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to be conducted in the MENA region; the results of this study will be finalized in 2012, based on which we will identify key areas of improvements within our tissue and diaper products. Furthermore, a LCA tool will be implemented across all of our Business Units on all of our products to ensure the integration of life cycle thinking into our product development processes. 9 Product Life Cycle Phase Nuqul Group Activities Sourcing raw materials We use Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Program for Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) certified products and sources in order to promote sustainable forest management. Sustainable Sourcing We ensure that all of our non-certified pulp comes from sources that apply renewable forestry management practices and we black list any supplier that is publicly known to violate such practices. Our FSC/PEFC certified pulp Manufacturing Our 3D core diaper products reduce waste by 20% compared to regular diapers. Nuqul Tissue products feature the WetPro® process, which allows tissues to dissolve in water; making the product bio purchases decreased from degradable. Water used in the production at Nuqul Tissue is treated for reuse in irrigation. 30% in 2010 to 7% in 2011. Water consumption per ton tissue is set at around 50% of the global best practice. This decrease can be attributed Most of the waste generated during production is sold for recycling.

Disposal We place the Recycle Logo unto our tissue packaging reminding consumers to “please throw the outer packaging into a recycling bin”. At Nuqul Group, we recognize our responsibility in our communication with customers regarding our products, and we continuously strive to build transparent and accessible channels of communication with all our customers. In 2011, Fine Dubai implemented a 360 degree campaign to support the launch of the new look of our Fine tissue products; the launch was supported by an extensive awareness campaign using press, outdoor, in-store and online media to ensure maximum outreach with our customers. Fine New Look Launch Event In 2011, we conducted a workshop on sustainable product design for staff members from departments that contribute to the process of product development including Marketing, Research and Development, Supply Chain Management and Operations. The workshop introduced concepts related to sustainable product design including Life Cycle Assessment, Sustainable Supply Chain Management, Eco-Labeling and Sustainable Product Design Strategies among others. The workshop provided for a platform 10 that encouraged the participating employees to innovate and create product modifications that would allow for an improved sustainability performance for our products In 2011, we adopted a new diaper strategy, our diapers have become thinner, and also the count of diapers per bag for each size has been reduced. Accordingly, the dimensions of inner bags and outer bales for most of the brands were changed for better appearance. Moreover, we will be moving to straight cut diaper in 2012, which will lead to a reduction in raw materials used per diaper. Therefore there is a reduction of nonwoven width and quantities of adhesive as well.

We realize that as we grow, our demand for natural resources will increase, yet we take it upon ourselves to commit to preserve natural resources, not only for the present but also for future generations. Our Group Standard Manuals (GSM) integrate a full array of management aspects, including quality performance, environment and health and safety, moreover our Group policies come to confirm our compliance with internationally accepted environmental standards, treaties and conventions as well as local environmental laws and regulations. Our Integrated Management System (IMS) sets procedures for the identification of key environmental risks and aspects of our operations across all business units, identifying objectives, setting controls and monitoring performance towards improving our environmental impact. Each business unit is requested to develop its own list of environmental aspects and an action plan to mitigate environmental impacts. Additionally, a steering committee headed by the General Manager or Chief Area Officer at each Business Unit is mandated to monitor environmental performance through regular management review meetings.

To achieve this reduction 1,102,840 1,100,000 we have taken measures to improve the water efficiency of Nuqul Tissue by gradually 2010 1,050,000 2011 reducing water intake per ton tissue. At this point our tissue paper consumes Water Consumption in Nuqul Tissue Operations almost 50% less water than the recognized global industry practice (Cubic Meter) without compromising the quality of the tissue. In 2011, our total Electricity consumption in our operations was 300,000 241,133 250,000 220,870 200,584 increased by 9% from our 2010 levels. this increase is due to an increase in our 200,000 2009 production levels as represented by a boost in sales volume for diapers by 14% and for 150,000 100,000 2010 tissue by 9%. The larger portion of our electricity consumption goes to our Nuqul Tissue 50,000 operations which observed an increase in production. However, we are constantly 2011 0 seeking to reduce our electricity per product unit on an annual basis, and we set annual Total Electricity Consumption reduction targets so as to mandate energy efficiency for all our business units.

Our financial performance is monitored and controlled through practices of prudent and diligent financial management of our revenues and resources, and our profitability is translated through our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system into stakeholder value. In this section we highlight our financial performance across the past three years in basic financial terms, since our business is a family owned one. We realize that recruiting local workers not only influences the economic growth of the individual, but also extends to the local community through the active economic participation of our employees, yet as an equal opportunity employer, preference to locals for recruitment cannot be provided unless the potential local employee meets our recruitment requirements. As for our supply chain management, our internal purchasing systems encourage the exploration for partnership opportunities with local suppliers who can fulfill the requested quality, performance and price requirements. 660 652 6 640 4.9 5 620 21 602 600 4 3.7 3.6 580 2009 2009 3 560 549 2010 2010 540 2011 2 2011 520 1 500 480 0 Revenues (Million USD) Payments to Governments (Million USD) Our revenues increased in 2011 by 8% from 2010, this can be attributed to the growth of the industry itself across the markets were we operate and an increase in our market share in some of our existing markets. The increase in revenues translated into an increase in taxes paid to governments. However, the increase in payments to government is also partially due to the increase in the tax rates across the region. 2012 Targets and Commitments Key Performance 2011 Target 2011 Justification 2012 Target Indicator based on 2010 achievement based on 2011 levels levels Water consumption -5% -4% Due to reduction in water consumption per ton tissue at our Nuqul Tissue -4% facilities Electricity -5% +9% Due to increase in production in represented by an increase in sales volume for -4% Consumption diapers by 14% and for tissue by 9% Operational Fuel -5% -47% Due to a shut down in a major gas turbine in our Nuqul Tissue operations in Egypt -4% (from 2010 Consumption which caused a decrease in natural gas consumption levels) Vehicle Fuel -5% +13% Due to increase in distribution activities which was driven by an increase in sales -4% Consumption volume for diapers by 14% and for tissue by 9% GHG emissions -5% -29% Due to a shut down in a major gas turbine in our Nuqul Tissue operations in Egypt -4% (from 2010 which caused a decrease in natural gas consumption levels) Waste Generation -20% -50% Due to improved quality control measures -30% Turnover rate -5% -11% Due to our efforts to maintain our benefit package in times of financial hardship -4% Female participation +5% -15% Increase in headcount accompanied by a decrease in the total number of female +4% in workforce employees 22 AFR and ASR Reduce to zero AFR -32%, Accidents occurred mostly due to issues of negligence, however both measures Reduce to zero ASR -50% have improved significantly compared to 2010 levels Employee Improve to 75% NA` The organizational health survey will be conducted in 2013, since we have started Improve to 75% Satisfaction a culture change program for all our employees which we believe might affect the results of the survey that should have been conducted it in 2012 Proportion of FSC +5% -76% Our purchases of FSC/PEFC certified pulp are solely dependent on market +4% /PEFC certified pulp demand Reporting Scope, Data Sources and Calculation Assumptions Indicator Scope Source(s) Calculation assumptions Employee headcount Nuqul Tissue Jordan, Nuqul Tissue Human Resources (HR) Department Number of employees at end of year Egypt, Fine Jordan, Fine Egypt, Fine at the Head Office KSA, Fine UAE and the Head Office for Nuqul Group Employee turnover rate Nuqul Group collective Human Resources Department at *100 the Head Office Percentage of female employees of total Nuqul Tissue Jordan, Nuqul Tissue Directly for HR department at *100 workforce Egypt, Fine Jordan, Fine Egypt, Fine Business Units KSA, Fine UAE and the Head Office for Nuqul Group Percentage of female employees in Nuqul Tissue Jordan, Nuqul Tissue Directly for HR department at *100 management positions Egypt, Fine Jordan, Fine Egypt, Fine Business Units KSA, Fine UAE and the Head Office for Nuqul Group Average number of training hours per Nuqul Group collective Human Resources Department at employee the Head Office Accident frequency ratio (AFR) Nuqul Tissue Jordan, Nuqul Tissue Directly for health and safety ∗ Egypt, Fine Jordan, Fine Egypt, Fine department at Business Units KSA, Fine UAE Accident severity ratio Nuqul Tissue Jordan, Nuqul Tissue Directly for health and safety ∗ 23 Egypt, Fine Jordan, Fine Egypt, Fine department at Business Units KSA, Fine UAE Number of customer complaints Fine Jordan, Fine Egypt, Fine KSA, Directly from business excellence Number of customer complaints at year end Fine UAE departments at business units Average lead time to resolve customer Fine Jordan, Fine Egypt, Fine KSA, Directly from business excellence ∑( ) /number of months complaints Fine UAE departments at business units Community contributions Nuqul Group Collective From PR department Total community contributions at year end Electricity consumption, Water Nuqul Tissue Jordan, Nuqul Tissue Directly from business excellence Actual consumption data consumption, fossil fuel consumption Egypt, Fine Jordan, Fine Egypt, Fine departments at business units and waste generated KSA, Fine UAE Material consumption Nuqul Tissue Jordan, Nuqul Tissue Directly from business excellence Actual consumption data Egypt departments at business units GHG emissions Nuqul Tissue Jordan, Nuqul Tissue Calculated from energy consumption data based on the GHG protocol formula and the IPCC guidelines and emission factors.
