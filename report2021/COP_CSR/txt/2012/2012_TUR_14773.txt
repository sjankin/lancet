An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Group’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Opinion 4. In our opinion the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aksa Akrilik Kimya Sanayii A.Ş. as of 31 December 2010, and their financial performance and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the financial reporting standards issued by the CMB (Note 2). Paragraph related with the restatement of prior year financial statements 5. We have also audited the adjustments described in Note 2.5 that were applied to restate the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2009 and for the year then ended. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. 6. The financial reporting standards issued by the CMB, as described in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, differ from International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board with respect to the application of inflation accounting for the period between 1 January 31 December 2005. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements are not intended to present the consolidated financial position, the consolidated financial performance and the consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with IFRS.

These subsidiaries have been classified and accounted for as financial investments in the consolidated financial statements with a carrying value of their initial acquisition costs less impairment, if any. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the control is transferred to the Group and are deconsolidated from the date that the control ceases. Where necessary, accounting policies for subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. Carrying values of the subsidiaries’ shares held by the Company are eliminated against the related equity of subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances between Aksa and its Subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation. Dividends arising from shares held by the Company in its subsidiaries are eliminated from income for the period and equity, respectively. c) The minority shareholders’ share in the net assets and results of Subsidiaries for the period are separately classified as non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income. 2.2 Changes in Accounting Policies, Accounting Estimates and Errors Significant changes in accounting policies or significant errors are corrected, retrospectively; by restating the prior period consolidated financial statements (Note 2.5). The effect of changes in accounting estimates affecting the current period is recognised in the current period; the effect of changes in accounting estimates affecting current and future periods is recognised in the current and future periods. 2.3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and at banks and short-term highly liquid investments whose risk of value change is not material including time deposits generally having original maturities of three months or less (Note 4). 53 CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş.

Financial Assets Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 “Financial instruments: Recognition and measurements” are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, reevaluates this designation at each financial year end. All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in the market place. As of 31 December 2010 and 2009 the Group does not have any financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Loans and Receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. After initial measurement loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for-sale or that are not classified in any of the three categories (a) loans and receivables, (b) held-to-maturity investments and (c) assets at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on an available for-sale financial asset after initial recognition shall be recognized directly in equity, through the statement of changes in equity, except for impairment losses, dividend and interest gains, until the financial asset is derecognized, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity shall be recognized in profit or loss. If a fair value loss on an available-for-sale asset has been recognized directly in equity, and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that has been recognized directly in equity should be recycled into profit or loss even though the financial asset has not been sold. Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Available-for-sale financial assets that are quoted in active markets are measured based on current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active the fair value is determined by using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing model (Note 5). For investments as subsidiaries that are excluded from the scope of consolidation on the grounds of materiality where there is no quoted market price and where a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be determined since other methods are inappropriate and unworkable, they are carried at cost less any impairment in value (Note5). 54 AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) Trade receivables Trade receivables have a maturity range of 30-120 days and are recognized at original invoice amount and carried at amortized cost less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful debt is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. A credit risk provision for trade receivables is established if there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. The allowance is an estimated amount which is difference between existing receivable and collectible amount. Collectible amount is the discounted value of trade receivables, all cash flows including collections from guarantees by using original effective interest rate. Bad debts are written off when identified (Note 7). Trade payables Trade payables have average maturities changing between 60-90 days and consist of the amounts invoiced or not invoiced related with the realized material or service purchases, and are carried at amortized cost (Note 7). Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value less costs to sell. Cost of inventories comprises the purchase cost and the cost of bringing inventories into their present location and condition. Cost is determined by the monthly moving weighted average method. The cost of borrowings is not included in the costs of inventories. Net realisable value less costs to sell is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale (Note 9). Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. When assets are sold or retired, their costs and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss resulting from their disposal is included in the income statement. The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis (Note 10). Useful life and the depreciation method are constantly reviewed, and accordingly, parallels are sought between the depreciation method and the period and the useful life to be derived from the related asset. The depreciation periods for property, plant and equipment, which approximate the economic useful lives of such assets, are as follows: Years Land improvements 2-50 Buildings 5-50 Machinery and equipment 3-40 Motor vehicles 4-8 Furniture and fixtures 2-20 The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In the event of circumstances indicating that an impairment has occurred in the tangible assets, an inspection is performed for the purpose of determining a possible impairment, and if the registered value of the tangible asset is higher than its recoverable value, the registered value is reduced to its recoverable value by reserving a provision. The recoverable value is considered either the net cash flow to be caused by the current use of the respective tangible assets or the nest sales price, whichever is higher. 55 CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) Gains or losses on disposals of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing proceeds with their restated carrying amounts and are included in the related income and expense accounts, as appropriate (Note 20). Repairs and maintenance are charged to consolidated statement of comprehensive income during the financial period in which they are incurred. The cost of major renovations is included in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset. Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are capitalized at cost. Intangible assets, created within the business are not capitalized and expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which it is incurred.They are initially recognised at acquisition cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The depreciation period for the intangibles capitalized in relation with the new models will be started after the production of these models is started. The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable (Note 11). Amortisation period of intangible assets is 3-5 years. Research and development expenses Expenditures for research and development are expensed in the period incurred.Except with the following criteria for project expenditures are recorded as expense in the period incurred as well: The product or process is clearly defined and costs are separately identified and measured reliably, The technical feasibility of the product is demonstrated, The product or process will be sold or used in-house, A potential market exists for the product or its usefulness in case of internal use is demonstrated, and Adequate technical, financial and other resources required for completion of the project are available. The costs related to the development projects are capitalized when the criteria above are met and amortized by straight-line basis over the useful lives of related projects (Note 11). Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenues are stated net of discounts, value added and sales taxes. Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Net sales are invoiced amounts of delivered goods excluding sales returns. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate until maturity and considering the effective interest rate. When the arrangement effectively constitutes a financing transaction, the fair value of the consideration is determined by discounting all future receipts using an imputed rate of interest. The difference between the fair value and the nominal amount of the consideration is recognized on an accrual basis as financial income. Dividend income is recognized when the Group has the right to receive the dividend payment. Rent income is recognized in the financial statements when the Groups right to receive the monthly rent income is established. Commission income is recognized when the intermediary goods have been billed by the seller. 56 AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) Bank borrowings All bank borrowings are initially recognized at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue cost associated with the borrowing. After initial recognition, bank borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective yield method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue cost and any discount or premium on settlement (Note 6). Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset in the period in which the asset is prepared for its intended use or sale. As of 31 December 2010 amount of TL6.555 borrowing costs related with coal plant investment has been capitalised on property, plant and equipment, as of 31 December 2009 amount of TL2.707 borrowing costs related with both coal plant investment and carbon fiber investment has been capitalized on property, plant and equipment (Note 10). Fair value of financial instruments Fair (market) value is the amount for which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation, and is best evidenced by a quoted market price, if one exists. The fair values of the financial instruments are determined in accordance with the following methods and assumptions as follows: Financial assets Monetary assets for which fair value approximates carrying value are carried at cost in the financial statements and consists of cash and cash equivalents, their interest accruals, and other financial assets; and considered to approximate their respective carrying values due to their short-term nature and negligible credit losses. The carrying value of accounts receivable along with the related allowance for unearned income and uncollectibility are estimated to be their fair values. Financial liabilities Monetary liabilities for which fair value approximates carrying value including accounts payable, short-term bank borrowings and other monetary liabilities are considered approximate their respective carrying values due to their short-term nature. The bank borrowings are stated at their amortized costs and transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of bank borrowings. The fair value of bank borrowings are considered to state their respective carrying values since the interest rate applied to bank borrowings are updated periodically by the lender to reflect active market price quotations. The carrying value of accounts payable along with the related allowance for unrealized cost is estimated to be their fair values. 57 CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) Employee benefits Under the Turkish Labour Law, the Company is required to pay termination benefits to each employee who has completed one year of service and whose employment is terminated without due cause, or who is called up for military service, dies or retires after completing 25 years of service (20 years for women) and achieves the retirement age (58 for women and 60 for men). As of 23 May 2002 since the related legislation was changed, some transition pre-retirement articles has been removed. Under the Turkish Labour Law, the provision has been calculated by estimating the present value of the future probable obligation of the Company arising from the retirement of the employees (Note 14). The Group has an employee benefit plan called “Seniority Incentive Bonus” (“Bonus”) which is paid to employees with a certain level of seniority. The Group accounts for this Bonus according to IAS 19, “Employee Benefits”. Seniority incentive bonus provision which is disclosed within the employee termination benefit represents the present value of the estimated total reserve of the probable future obligations. Current and deferred income tax Tax expense or income is the aggregate of current income tax and deferred taxes which are based on the gains and losses for the period. Deferred income tax is determined, using the liability method and tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax is provided in full, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized.The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Deferred taxes arising from income and expenses accounted under equity are recorded under equity, accordingly. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed by the Group at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized (Note 23). Earnings per share Earnings per share disclosed in the statement of consolidated comprehensive income are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares that have been outstanding during the related period concerned. In Turkey, companies can increase their share capital by making a pro-rata distribution of shares (“bonus shares”) to existing shareholders from retained earnings. For the purpose of earnings per share computations, the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year has been adjusted in respect of bonus shares issued without a corresponding change in resources by giving them retroactive effect for the year in which they were issued and for each earlier period. (Note 24). Events after the balance sheet date The Group adjusts the amounts recognised in its financial statements to reflect the adjusting events after the balance sheet date. If non-adjusting events after the balance sheet date have material influence on the economic decisions of users of the financial statements, they are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 58 AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate (Note 13). Contingent assets and liabilities Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the financial statements, but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. A contingent asset is not recognized in the financial statements, but disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Offsetting If the essence of the transaction and events requires offsetting, presentation of these transactions and events at their net values or following up of the assets at their amounts after the deduction of impairment, is not evaluated as a breach of the non-deductibility rule. Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates announced by Turkish Republic Central Bank at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated financial statement as interest, fee, commission and similar income by the Group companies operating in the finance sector and as financial income or expense by the Group companies operating in non-finance sectors. Goodwill Acquisition value on the acquisition date, the acquired investment/subsidiary of the Group’s share in excess of the fair value of net identifiable assets is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated provision for impairment, recognised in balance sheet. For the purpose of impairment testing , the goodwill amount is distrubuted to cash-generating units. The distribution of goodwill, work consists of cash-generating units expected to benefit groups or cash-generating unit is done. Group performs goodwill impairment tests at 31 December. Goodwill impairment losses can not be canceled. Gains and losses arising from the sale of a business includes the recognized goodwill of the sold business. Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. For an operating segment to be identified as a reportable segment, its reported revenue, including both sales to external customers and intersegment sales or transfers, is 10 per cent or more of the combined revenue, internal and external, of all operating segments; the absolute amount of its reported profit or loss is 10 per cent or more of the combined profit or loss or its assets are 10 per cent or more of the combined assets of all operating segments. Operating segments that do not meet any of the quantitative thresholds may be considered reportable, and separately disclosed, if the management believes that information about the segment would be useful to users of the financial statements. 59 CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) For the Group the reportable segments are industrial segments. Reportable segment, its reported revenue, including both sales to external customers and intersegment sales or transfers, is 10 per cent or more of the combined revenue, internal and external, of all operating segments; the absolute amount of its reported profit or loss is 10 per cent or more of the combined profit or loss or its assets are 10 per cent or more of the combined assets of all operating segments. The Group assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation, “EBITDA”. The Group’s reportable business segments are “fibers”, “energy” and the remained operations are reported as “other”. The subsidiaries Ak-pa and Ak-tops are reported under “other” segment (Note 3). The supportive functions of industrial segments Financial Affairs, Human Resources and Management Systems, Purchasing and New Business Development, Research and Development, Head Office Expenses and other general administrative and operating expenses are classified into unallocated corporate expenses. Unallocated corporate expenses are monitored at the Group level by management as the expenses are incurred to ensure the integrity of operations. Derivative financial instruments The derivative instruments of the Group mainly consist of foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swap instruments. These derivative transactions, even though providing effective economic hedges under the Group risk management position, do not generally qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules and are therefore treated as derivatives held for trading (IAS 39). The Group shows its profits and losses relating to the hedging transaction under equities as “hedging fund”. All derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative (Note 16). 60 AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) Related parties Parties are considered related to the Group if; a) Directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, the party: i) controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Company (this includes parents, subsidiaries and fellow subsidiaries); ii) has an interest in the Group that gives it significant influence over the Group; or iii) has joint control over the Group; b) The party is an associate of the Group; c) The party is a joint venture in which the Group is a venture; d) The party is member of the key management personnel of the Group or its parent; e) The party is a close member of the family of any individual referred to in (a) or (d); f) The party is an entity that is controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by, or for which significant voting power in such entity resides with, directly or indirectly, any individual referred to In (d) or (e); or g) The party has a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of the Group, or of an entity that is a related party of the Group. Related party transactions are transfer of resources or obligations between related parties, regardless of whether a price is charged A number of transactions are entered into with related parties in the normal course of business (Note 25). Cash flow Cash flows during the period are classified and reported by operating, investing and financing activities in the cash flow statements. Cash flows from operating activities represent the cash flows of the Group generated from retailing activities. Cash flows related to investing activities represent the cash flows that are used in or provided from the investing activities of the Group (fixed investments and financial investments). Cash flows arising from financing activities represent the cash proceeds from the financing activities of the Group and the repayments of these funds. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and bank deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with maturities equal or less than 3 months (Note 4). 61 CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) Government grants Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the group will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants relating to costs are recognised in the income statement by deducting from research and development expenses. Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are included in non-current liabilities as deferred government grants and are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected lives of the related assets. 2.4 Critical Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of consolidated financial statements according to CMB Financial Reporting Standards, necessitates the use of estimates and assumptions that affect asset and liability amounts reported as of the balance sheet date, explanations of contingent liabilities and assets; and income and expense amounts reported for the accounting period. Although these estimates and assumptions are based on all management information related to the events and transactions, actual results may differ from them. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for the next reporting period are outlined below: a) Goodwill impairment test Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. The Group tests annually whether goodwill has been impaired, in accordance with the accounting policy. The recoverable amount of cash-generating unit has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These value-in-use calculations include the discounted after tax cash flow projections, and these projections are based on USD financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period. The USD fair value is converted into TL by using the related foreign exchange rate on the date of the balance sheet. Therefore, the value in use calculations is affected by the fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. The discount rate used in the value in use calculations is 9,49% and the risk premium is 3%. The discount rates used are after tax and reflect specific risks relating to the company. As of 31 December 2010, the Group did not determine any impairment in the amount of the goodwill as a result of the impairment test performed by using the aforementioned assumptions. The sensivity analysis with 2 points higher rate on the goodwill impairment testing does not reveal any impairment charge on the goodwill balance. b) Net realizable value Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value as discussed in Note:2.3. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale (Note 9). 62 AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) c) Tangible and intangible assets useful lives Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss as discussed in Note 2.3. They are initially recognised at acquisition cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Useful lives of property, plant and equipment, rely on best estimates of management, these estimates are reviewed balance sheet dates and if necessary adjustments are made necessary (Note 10). d) Provision for doubtful receivable In the event there is a situation which makes impossible for the Group to collect the amounts due payable, a provision for loss is created for the trade receivables.The amount of the provision is determined with the assessment of the payment performance of the customer and trade receivable aging. Provision for doubtful receivables is the accounting estimation that is based on the past payment performance and financial situations of the customers (Note 7). e) Provisions As discussed in Note 2.3, provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and when reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation (Note 13). 2.5 Comparative informations and restatement of prior year financial statements In order to allow for the determination of the financial situation and performance trends, the Group’s consolidated financial statements have been presented comparatively with the preceding financial period. The Group presented the consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 2010 comparatively with the consolidated balance sheet prepared as of 31 December 2009 and presented the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for the year ended 31 December 2010 comparatively with such financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009. Where necessary, comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to changes in presentation in the current period. 63 CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) The Group has detected errors in the previous year’s consolidated financial statements and corrected them retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”. In accordance with IAS 1 (Revised) “Presentation of Financial Statements”, when the financial statements are subject to a restatement of prior year financial statements, an entity should present three statements of financial position. Accordingly, the Group presented the consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 2010 comparatively with the restated consolidated balance sheets prepared as of 31 December 2009 and 2008. At 31 December 2010, the effect of these corrections on the retained earnings, hedging reserve, net income for the period and total comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are as follows: Net income Total Retained Hedging for the comprehensive earnings reserve period income 31 December 2009 (as previously reported) 272.268 53.048 53.048 Effect of restatement of capitalised borrowing costs (a) (10.797) Effect of restatement of government grants (b) (4.717) (10.705) (10.705) Effect of restatement of derivative financial instruments (c) (3.029) 719 31 December 2009 (restated) 256.754 (3.029) 42.343 43.062 a) Restatement of capitalised borrowing costs: The Group has detected errors in previous year’s consolidated financial statements regarding the capitalization of borrowing costs for qualified assets in accordance with IAS 23 “Borrowing Costs”. The error was due to disregarding the interest expense ceiling test, limiting the capitalised amount of foreign exchange losses of foreign currency denominated bank borrowings to the total interest expense to be incurred if the borrowing was made in functional currency. The Group accounted for the correction related to these errors retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8. The effect of this restatement was to decrease retained earnings as of 1 January 2009 by TL10.797 (decrease in property, plant and equipment by TL13.496 and deferred tax liability by TL2.699). The effect of the restatement on the comprehensive income has not been calculated in 2009 on the grounds of materiality. The effect of this restatement on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 and 2009 are as follows: Effect of restatement Effect on consolidated balance sheets at 31 December 2008 and 2009: Decrease in property, plant and equipment (13.496) Decrease in deferred tax liabilities 2.699 Decrease in equity, net (10.797) 64 AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) b) Restatement of government grants: During the year 2010, the Group has detected error in the consolidated financial statements of prior years on the accounting of the incentives and donations received from The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (“TÜBİTAK”) and Undersecretariat of the Prime Ministry for Foreign Trade regarding the research and development projects. In accordance with IAS 20 “Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance”, incentives and donations shall be recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity recognised the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. The Group accounted for the correction related to these errors retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8. The effect of this restatement was to decrease the retained earnings as of 1 January 2009 TL4.716 (1 January 2010: TL15.421). As the Group recorded these grants in equity and will use them to increase capital in statutory financials as permitted by the Turkish Tax Legislation, this restatement has no impact on deferred taxes. The effect of this restatement on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 and 2009 are as follows: Effect of restatement Effect on the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2008: Increase in other short term liabilities (279) Increase in other long term liabilities (4.437) Decrease in equity, net (4.716) Effect of restatement Effect on consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2009: Increase in other short term liabilities (522) Increase in other long term liabilities (14.899) Decrease in equity, net (15.421) Effect on consolidated income statement 31 December 2009 Decrease in other operating income (10.705) Increase in net income for the period (10.705) 65 CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) c) Effect of restatement of derivative financial instruments: The Group made interest swap contracts in order to hedge its cash flow risk regarding the long-term floating interest rate bank borrowings in 2008. During the year ended 31 December 2010, errors in fair value measurement and accounting of these swap instruments have been detected.

Under the Turkish Labour Law, the Company is required to pay termination benefits to each employee who has completed one year of service and who reaches the retirement age (58 for women and 60 for men), whose employment is terminated without due cause, is called up for military service or passed away. Since the legislation was changed on 23 May 2002 there are certain transitional provisions relating to length of service prior to retirement. The amount payable consists of one month’s salary limited to a maximum of TL2.517 (2009: TL2.365) for each year of service at 31 December 2010. The liability is not funded as there is no funding requirement. The provision has been calculated by estimating the present value of the future probable obligation of the Company arising from the retirement of employees. 80 AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” require actuarial valuation methods to be developed to estimate the enterprise’s obligation under defined benefit plans. Accordingly the following actuarial assumptions have been used in the calculation of the total liability: 2010 2009 Discount rate (%) 4,66 5,92 Probability of retirement (%) 98,92 98,86 The principal assumption is that the maximum liability for each year of service will increase in line with inflation. Thus, the discount rate applied represents the expected real rate after adjusting for the anticipated effects of future inflation. As the maximum liability is revised once every six months, the maximum amount of TL2.623 effective from 1 January 2011 (1 January 2010: TL2.427) has been taken into consideration in calculating the reserve for employment termination benefit of the Group. Movements in the provision for employment termination benefits are as follows: 2010 2009 Balances at 1 January 11.520 9.354 Service cost 1.748 2.872 Interest cost 682 586 Paid compensation (1.568) (1.951) Actuarial losses 786 659 Balances at 31 December 13.168 11.520 NOTE 15-OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Other current assets: 2010 2009 VAT receivables (*) 41.244 31.928 VAT to be transferred 26.588 14.125 Purchase advances given 8.863 3.948 Personnel advances 1.719 1.294 Prepaid expenses 1.293 883 Prepaid taxes and funds 16 Job advances 216 97 79.923 52.291 (*) VAT receivables balance comprises of tax receivable due from export transactions of the Group. 81 CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş.

The derivative instruments of the Group mainly consist of foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap instruments. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Group designates certain derivatives as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (“fair value hedge”), or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or a firm commitment (“cash flow hedge”). These derivative transactions provide effective economic hedges under the Group risk management position and qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules and are therefore treated as derivatives held for hedging. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as being and qualify as cash flow hedges and are highly effective, are recognised in equity as “hedging reserve”. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, or when a committed or forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement.The realization of promised or probable future transactions are recorded in the income statement, if not realised,accumulated gains or losses are recognised as income or loss in the consolidated financial statements. At 31 December 2010, the fixed interest rates vary from 2.5% to 4.2% (2009: 2.5% to 4.2%), and the main floating rates are EURIBOR and LIBOR. Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity on interest rate swap contracts as of 31 December 2010 will be continuously released to the income statement within finance cost until the repayment of the bank borrowings (Note 6). 83 CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) Derivative instruments held for trading: The Group had foreign exchange forward contracts as of 31 December 2008 which were purchased from American knock out reverse repurchase markets. These derivative transactions, even though providing effective economic hedges under the Group risk management position, do not generally qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules and are therefore treated as derivatives held for trading and changes in fair value of these derivative transactions are accounted for in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

NOT 26-FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Financial risk factors The Groups principal financial instruments are cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and financial liabilities. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations. The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. The Group management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of the risks as summarized below. Interest Risk The Group is not exposed to interest risk arising from the ownership of assets’ and liabilities’ interest rate changes. These exposures are managed by using natural hedges that arise from offsetting interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Group attempts to control credit risk by monitoring credit exposures, limiting transactions with specific counterparties, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of the counterparties. It is the Group policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit monitoring procedures and the Group also obtains collaterals from customers when appropriate. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. Trade receivables are evaluated by management based on their past experiences and current economic condition, and are presented in financial statements net of provision for doubtful receivables (Note 7). 91 CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. The Company controls its capital using the net debt/total capital ratio. This ratio is calculated by dividing net debt by the total capital amount. Net debt is calculated as total liability amount (comprises of financial liabilities, trade payables and payables to related parties as presented in the balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents Total capital is calculated as equity plus the net debt amount as presented in the balance sheet. 99 CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) The ratio of net debt/equity at 31 December 2010 and 2009 is as follows: 2010 2009 Total liabilities 522.288 450.959 Less: cash and cash equivalents (Note 4) (64.499) (102.212) Net debt 457.789 348.747 Total shareholders equity 775.765 734.383 Total equity 1.233.554 1.083.130 Debt/equity ratio 37% 32% Fair value estimation Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation, and is best evidenced by a quoted market price, if one exists. The estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by the Group, using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, judgement is necessarily required to interpret market data to estimate the fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Group could realise in a current market exchange. The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments: Financial assets Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates. These balances are anticipated to approximate their book value. The carrying values of significant portion of cash and cash equivalents are assumed to approximate to their fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying values of trade receivables are assumed to approximate to their fair value. 100 AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. 2010 ANNUAL REPORT CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TURKISH (NOTE 2.6) AKSA AKRİLİK KİMYA SANAYİİ A.Ş. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira [“TL”] unless otherwise indicated.) NOTE 27-FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial liabilities The fair values of short term borrowings and trade payables are assumed to approximate to their carrying values due to their short-term nature. The estimated fair value of long term bank borrowings also approximates their carrying values as the interest rates are of floating nature. The estimated fair value of the long term bank borrowings is disclosed in related footnotes and determined by discounting the cash outflows per the agreement with the market interest rates (Note 6). Fair Value Estimation: Effective from 1 January 2010, the group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value, this requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following hierarchy: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that is not based on observable market data. 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Hedging derivative financial liabilities 5.000 Total liabilities 5.000 2009 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Hedging derivative financial liabilities 3.786 Total liabilities 3.786 The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required tofair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. Aksa Akrilik Kimya Sanayii A.Ş.
