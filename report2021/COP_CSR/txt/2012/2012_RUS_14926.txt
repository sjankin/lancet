Restoring biodiversity in the Northern Dvina River For the first time in the past 25 years, young pike reared at a fish hatchery were released into the Northern Dvina River. One million juveniles released into a bay of the Kego Island due to Archangelsknefteprodukt will soon replenish the fish population in the river delta. In 2007, Archangelsknefteprodukt carried out dredging works in the area in order to deepen the river channel to accommodate large tankers, and these activities could potentially affect the food base of the fish population. Therefore the company contracted the Northern Branch of the Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography (SevPINRO) to rear a large stock of young pike and financed the creation of a fish hatchery. According to statistical data, only one tenth of the released young survive into adulthood. SevPINRO researchers will monitor trends in the local pike population and the effectiveness of the biodiversity restoration measures financed by Archangelsknefteprodukt. 6 Detailed information about the Program is available in Rosneft Sustainability Report 2009. 46 47 R osneft Sustainabilit y Repor t 2010 Health, Safe t y, and Envir onment Fires Improving pipeline reliability Accident Prevention and Emergency During the period of summer forest fires, RosThe Company on annual basis has been implePreparedness neft’s operations were taking prevention meamenting measures within the framework of the sures, and, as a result, no case of fire spreadcorporate Pipeline Reliability Improvement Proing to a Company’s facility took place.
