Over the course of the previous year, Edinburgh International has fully integrated the 10 principles in to the inner workings of the Company and the mindset of its Staff. I fully endorse the Global Compact, as companies such as Edinburgh International can realise true benefits from being members. By aligning Edinburgh International with the Global Compact’s initiative and principles, it focuses our minds and the direction of the Company on the really important areas. Edinburgh International has always taken a strong ethical approach, but now through the correct implementation of the 10 principles it has demonstrable evidence to back this stance up. Edinburgh International is committed to sharing its communication on Progress with its Staff and stakeholders, which will be accessible through the Global Compact and Edinburgh International website. Simon Crane CEO, Edinburgh International © Edinburgh International 2012 Commercial in Confidence Page | 2 2012 Communication on Progress Human Rights 2 Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses 2.1 ASSESSMENT To help gain a better understanding of the potential impact of human rights, Edinburgh International (EI) Conducted a Human rights impact assessment (HRIA), which measured the impact of its policies and interventions on human rights. Due, to the sometimes fragile states that EI operates in and the nature of work, Human Rights is taken very seriously indeed. EI’s overarching Policy is our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (Code), which states: “All projects start with the foundation that respect for, and the protection of, human rights is a core principle of security provision in any society with which we interact. This includes the sometimes fragile states in which Edinburgh International operates and requires strict compliance with laws and regulations. Edinburgh International adheres to the following legislation and codes drawn up by sovereign governments and international agencies: • Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 • UK Human Rights Act 1998 • United Nations International Mine Action Standards, 2001 • Geneva Conventions of 1949 • Chemical Weapons Convention • Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment EI’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct is provided to all staff contractors, subcontractors and business partners, who are expected to comply with all the requirements. The Code has been translated and provided to all staff and subcontractors in their home language and © Edinburgh International 2012 Commercial in Confidence continuous training and monitoring is conducted to ensure compliance. 2.2 IMPLEMENTATION 2.2.1 Ethics Hotline EI established an ethics hotline and email address, which staff and third parties are encouraged to use to report suspected human rights violations. Page | 3 2012 Communication on Progress Human Rights 2.2.2 Human Rights Training EI conducts annual training for its staff in the areas of human rights and Rules for the Use of Force. Practical and classroom based training and guidance is provided in several languages to cater for all the staff requirements. 2.2.3 Minimum Wage EI commits to paying its staff above the minimum wage in each country of operation, whilst also ensuring that it conducts its business in a responsible manner. EI always pays substantially above the minimum wage but ensures that it is in line with other relevant government industries, e.g. the local police force, so as not to undermine their recruitment effort and/or create a false economy. 2.2.4 Public Policy Participation Throughout 2011 EI continued to support and participate in various public policy developments. EI continued its participation in the Security in Complex Environment Group (SCEG), which is the UK’s Government backed partner for the security industry, through attendance at quarterly meetings and engagement in policy decisions. EI staff also became Technical and Working Group Members on the ASIS Private Security Company Standards 1 and 2. Standard 1 has now been recognised as an American National Standard and will soon be used throughout the security industry to ensure compliance with human rights and other areas. Another initiative that EI have been involved in is the International Code of Conduct (ICoC), which is a Swiss/UK/US Government backed initiative to improve standards in the private security industry. 2.3 MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES Appropriate GRI EI’s Indicator 2010 2011 Acceptable 2012 Target Indicator Y/N HR4 Total number of incidents Ethics 5 complaints Yes Zero incidents Total number of of discrimination on any hotline received.

These countries do not have the same enforceable measures in place as the UK or other European countries do. Therefore, EI has implemented many policies to ensure that it applies UK standards and values to ensure that it treats its staff and the local population with the highest regard for human rights and labour standards. EI’s overarching Policy is our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (Code), which states: “Edinburgh International staff will respect the human rights of all persons they come into © Edinburgh International 2012 Commercial in Confidence contact with, including, the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly and against arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy or deprivation of property….Staff are expected to treat their peers, superiors, or subordinates, as well as clients, suppliers and others with whom Edinburgh International does business, with respect and to not engage in abusive, disrespectful, violent or insubordinate behaviour.” 2 Iraq’s minimum wage, according to minimum-wage.org, is 5,200 and 10,500 Dinar per day for an 2012 unskilled and skilled worker accordingly. Page | 5 Communication on Progress Environment 3.2 IMPLEMENTATION 3.2.1 Due Diligence To ensure EI recruit staff that are not complicit in human rights abuses a comprehensive due diligence and vetting system has been established for all staff that work for EI. The process includes criminal records and background checks and local and governmental authorities when recruiting in Afghanistan and Iraq. As part of the due diligence check, all ages are collaborated so as not to employ anyone under the age of 18 to carry out security service work and no child labour is used. 3.2.2 Locally Hired Managers EI values it local work force from wherever it recruits. It provides staff with contracts in their own language and, only when it is absolutely necessary due to qualifications required, does EI recruit staff from abroad. EI also invests time and money, to train up its local work force for managerial positions. 3.3 MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES Acceptable 2012 Appropriate GRI Indicator EI’s Indicator 2010 2011 Y/N Target HR 2 Percentage of all armed 50% 70% Yes 100% Percentage of significant contractors that underwent suppliers and contractors that due diligence and underwent screening on screening on human rights human rights and actions taken HR6 Number of child labour 0 0 Yes 0 Operations identified as abuses reported to EI having significant risk for incidents of child labour and measures to contribute to eliminate child labour EC7 Percentage of host country 15% 19% Yes 20% Procedures for local hiring and nationals in a management proportion of senior role in Iraq management hired from the local community at significant locations of operations © Edinburgh International 2012 Commercial in Confidence 4 Environment Principle 7: Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: Encourage the development and effective diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Page | 6 2012 Communication on Progress Environment 4.1 ASSESSMENT EI is committed to improving the environment and promoting greater environmental responsibility. To assess where EI could improve and have a positive effect on the environment a full environmental impact assessment was undertaken, which was put to good use by the procurement team. EI applies its strict environmental policies in all the locations where it operates, regardless of whether the country of operation enforces responsible environmental awareness. The following is an extract from EI’s Environmental Policy: “Edinburgh International recognises and accepts its responsibility to minimise, wherever possible, its impact on the environment and to comply with all statutory environmental requirements…It will seek to purchase from local or regional suppliers which will maximise Edinburgh International's input to the local community and minimise transport and carbon footprint.” 4.2 IMPLEMENTATION 4.2.1 Vehicle Fleet EI, in order to carry out its services, maintain and use a large vehicle fleet. After an environmental impact assessment was conducted in 2010, EI took the decision that over the course of the next 5 years it would replace its entire fleet from petrol to diesel. EI estimate that this will reduce carbon emissions by an average of 21% per vehicle. It is EI’s intention that, where possible, it will source all vehicles locally either through hiring or purchasing them. This will limit the need to ship vehicles long distance to where they are required, therefore reducing the impact on the environment. 4.3 MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES Appropriate GRI Acceptable 2012 EI’s Indicator 2010 2011 Indicator Y/N Target EN 18 Reduce greenhouse 55% Diesel 80% Yes 90% Initiatives to reduce gasses by switching the Diesel Diesel greenhouse gas vehicle fleet from petrol emissions and to diesel. © Edinburgh International 2012 Commercial in Confidence reductions achieved EN 29 Number of vehicles 12% of 20% of Yes 30% Significant environmental sourced locally against vehicles vehicles impacts of transporting the number being sourced sourced products and other shipped in from abroad? locally, the locally, the goods and materials remainder remainder used for the were shipped were shipped organisation’s operations in from abroad in from abroad and transporting members of the workforce EN 28 Monetary value of all £0 £0 Yes £0 Monetary value of fines received by EI Page | 7 2012 Communication on Progress Anti-Corruption Appropriate GRI Acceptable 2012 EI’s Indicator 2010 2011 Indicator Y/N Target significant fines and total Number of non0 0 Yes 0 number of non-monetary monetary sanctions for sanctions for nonnon-compliance with compliance with environmental laws and environmental laws and regulations regulations 5 Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Business should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. 5.1 ASSESSMENT Due to the sector and locations that EI works in, the bribery risks that EI face are assessed to be high. To counter these potential bribery and corruption threats, EI use Transparency International’s Adequate Procedure Checklist and have implemented an anti-corruption risk assessment. These documents help guide and focus EI’s attention on the business areas and personnel that are deemed to be most at risk to corruption. Additional training is then conducted using EI’s Anti-Bribery Workshop. The following extract has been taken from EI’s Anti-Bribery Policy concerning EI’s commitment to training and educating its staff. “Staff training and the sharing of best practice will take place in Anti-Bribery Workshops. The training will be organised by the manager convening the workshop and will be tailored specific to their business operations covering likely problems that they may encounter. All training which is conducted is to be recorded on the TRACKS.” 5.2 IMPLEMENTATION 5.2.1 All Staff In 2011 EI introduced an Anti-Bribery Policy, which applies to all staff, contractors, sub© Edinburgh International 2012 Commercial in Confidence contractors and any organisation that it does business with. This Policy is to be read by all staff on joining the Company and again on an annual basis. This measure was implemented last year and is due to gain full traction in 2012. 5.2.2 Business Areas Deemed at Risk The business areas deemed at risk due to the functions they perform are the; Business Development, Financial and Operations Departments. These areas receive additional training and this measure was implemented in 2011 and is due to gain full traction in 2012. Page | 8 2012 Communication on Progress Anti-Corruption 5.2.3 Incidents of Bribery EI established an ethics hotline and email address, which staff and third parties are encouraged to use to report suspected bribery and corruption concerns. 5.2.4 Auditing of Financial Books EI’s financial books are externally audited by Ernst and Young on an annual basis. To date no financial irregularities have been identified during these audits. 5.3 MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES Appropriate GRI Acceptable EI’s Indicator 2010 2011 2012 Target Indicator Y/N SO 3 Percentage of staff who 0% 15% NO 80% Percentage of employees received anti-bribery trained in organisations training anti-corruption policies and procedures SO 2 The business areas that None Business Yes Business Percentage and total received additional antiDevelopment, Development, number of business units bribery training courses Financial Financial, analysed for risks related Operations, to corruption Number of irregularities 0 0 Yes 0 identified by external auditors of EI’s financial books SO 4 Number of reported 0 0 Yes 0 Actions taken in incidents involving response to incidents of corruption corruption © Edinburgh International 2012 Commercial in Confidence Page | 9 2012
