GLOBE STAGE: Goals & Tasks Policy Establishment of a global profit and growth structure FY2013 Gross profit margin: 39 %; Operating income margin: 9 %; ROE: 11%; Goals Net sales: approx. ¥700 billion; Operating income: approx. ¥63 billion (Assumed exchange rates: 1US$ = ¥78; 1EUR = ¥104) 1. Reinforcement of Industrial Automation (IA) business (IAB & EMC) 2. Sales expansion in emerging markets Tasks 3. Focus on environmental solutions business (unchanged) 4. Profit structure reform 5. Strengthening global human resources fiscal 2011. We also established Automation Centers in Japan, China, and Europe to strengthen our customer support network. Through these centers, we will provide manufacturers around the world with products and services that optimally meet their needs. One of the key strengths of Omron lies in the utilization of its vast expertise in relation to production lines. This strength enables the Company to offer customers solutions that not only employ its own prodYoshihito Yamada ucts, but also effectively combine these products with those of other companies, allowing the Company to provide President and CEO customers with optimal value. Omron will further accelerate the development of Automation Centers around the world, in emerging countries as well as in the United States and other developed nations. I am certain that the strategies defined by VG2020, such as sales expansion in emerging markets and the reinforcement of the IA Business, will lead the Company in the right direction. Q1 The new long-term vision, VG2020, was announced in July 2011. Later, in April 2012, you revised your targets for the “GLOBE STAGE” (FY2011–2013), the first phase of this vision, to reflect the drastic changes in the market environment. In what GLOBE STAGE Road Map FY2013 targets: Gross profit margin: 39%; specific ways were the targets revised? Operating income margin: 9%, while making necessary strategic investments (Billions of yen) GLOBE STAGE EARTH STAGE Drastic changes in the market environment, such as the strong yen and the instability of financial systems in Europe, More than forced us to revise our targets for the “GLOBE STAGE” of VG2020. Regardless, I saw no need to adjust the five basic 1,000.0 tasks: (1) reinforcement of the Industrial Automation (IA) Business (IAB & EMC), (2) sales expansion in emerging markets, (3) focus on the environmental solutions business, (4) profit structure reform, and (5) strengthening global human 10,000 750.0 resources. Of these tasks, I feel the reinforcement of the IA Business, one of Omron’s clear areas of strength, and Initial Plan Around 700.0 8,000 655.0 sales expansion in emerging markets are the most important. Net Sales 619.5 650.0 This is because of the rising demand for factory automation in manufacturing industries in emerging markets. 6,000 In China, for example, soaring personnel expenses, or in other words, fixed costs, are becoming a burden for management, which has subsequently become a serious issue. For these reasons, it is growing increasingly difficult to conduct Gross Profit Margin 36.8% 37.5% 39.0% 4,000 successful production operations simply by employing a large number of employees. This situation is boosting the 100.0 demand for factory automation and is also creating a highly favorable environment for Omron’s business. Aiming to Over 150.0 2,000 Operating Income 55.0 Around take advantage of this environment, we increased the number of sales bases in China from approximately 30 to 50 in (Operating Income Margin) 63.0 40.1 46.0 0 (6.5%) (7.1%) (9.0%) (15.0%) 2011 2012 2013 2020 (FY) 14 Omron Corporation Integrated Report 2012 15 To Our Stakeholders Profile Business Strategies Segment Information Corporate Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information Interview with the President Special Feature 1: Global Vertical-Horizontal Matrix Management Special Feature 2: Omron’s Supply Responsibility and Business Continuity CONTENTS Interview with the President Forging stronger team relations among business lines (vertical) and between corporate headquarters and business divisions (horizontal) will allow us to fully demonstrate the power of the Omron Group. Q2 Are there any other changes undergone by markets that you view as opportunities? P.74 in China, 75% in India, and 30% in other emerging markets. We will utilize the unique strengths of each business and conduct management with the aim of further cementing the positions these businesses have already established. The SSB is also an important business to us, and we will strengthen it by promoting coordination between this The changes in the environmental solutions business, one of the key businesses in VG2020, are particularly beneficial. business and the Environmental Solutions Business HQ and IAB. The goal of these initiatives will be to create new After the Great East Japan Earthquake, serious electricity shortages occurred, and their persistence has become a environmental solutions businesses for factories and public facilities. I believe this will enable us to generate business social issue that must be urgently addressed. The ongoing limited electricity supplies are forcing companies and synergies that are characteristic of Omron into the future. individuals to think of ways to conserve electricity and reduce usage during peak hours. Also, we will forge stronger vertical team relations down business lines and horizontal relations between them and One of the responses to this issue has been the rapid expansion in the usage of solar power. In July 2012, the create new value through the strategic allocation of management resources, including products, Government of Japan launched a system for purchasing electricity generated using renewable energy sources, which is technologies, human resources, and capital. This is an important management strategy that will enable us to fully utilize anticipated to greatly stimulate the growth of the solar power market. We are already witnessing the benefits of growth the power of the Omron Group. in this market, as solar power conditioners, which are used to convert power from solar cells from DC to AC, have experienced a substantial increase in sales, rising 20% year on year in fiscal 2011. We are also developing a wide range of solar powerrelated businesses, including the provision of an integrated system for monitoring the operation of solar power systems and managing Q4 You mentioned forging stronger vertical and horizontal team relations. Specifically, what initiatives are being implemented? P.20 on-site maintenance by utilizing remote monitoring. One example is our efforts to expand operations in emerging countries. Omron established regional headquarters in Further, in order to effectively utilize limited electricity supplies, there Japan, the United States, the Netherlands, China, and Singapore to develop a unique global network and services is a rising need for a means to control maximum electricity demand systems closely linked to each geographical area. through the usage of energy consumption monitoring Recently, we have identified India as a key emerging country in growth strategies and for the reinforcement of the systems. The Omron Group has introduced such systems IA business. To enable business divisions in this country to better focus on business operations, we established a new and is already seeing impressive results. Also, several regional headquarters in India in fiscal 2011. In addition, we established a regional headquarters in Brazil in fiscal 2012. Now, customers have introduced these systems and are experiwith seven regional headquarters, we are ready for the full-fledged advancement of operations in emerging countries. In encing favorable results. These market changes represent Power conditioner for solar power accelerating our approach toward emerging countries, it will be vitally important to raise the recognition of the Omron brand. significant opportunities for Omron. generation system Q3 Focusing on the IA Business will be one of your key strategies. What are your plans for other business areas? That is a question often asked by people from both inside and outside the Company. Other businesses, too, are important to Omron. Currently, our Automotive Electronic Components Business (AEC), Social Systems, Solutions and Service Business (SSB), and Healthcare Business (HCB) are run as independent (spin-off) companies, each of which has established Omron brand billboard advertisement on a road its own unique position in its respective business domains. We believe it is important to target growth for these connecting to an airport in Sao Paulo, Brazil businesses that matches their individual characteristics. Faced with harsh market conditions, we implemented initiatives in these three businesses to accelerate business development through faster decision making. Targeting further acceleration, we delegated responsibility for these businesses in an appropriate manner to enable more-optimal business operation. The effects are beginning to appear in various areas. The previously unprofitable AEC saw significant improvements, and in fiscal 2011, it had an operating income margin of 3.2%, despite the impact of the severe flooding in Thailand. In fiscal 2012, we anticipate this business will become stronger and will record a margin of 5.3% (forecasts released on July 30, 2012), which is an exceptionally high level for the automotive industry. The HCB, meanwhile, will be operated in a manner prioritizing speed and close connections with the sites where our products are used. Through such management, we will work to meet our ambitious goals for fiscal 2012 of improving sales by approximately 15% Free blood pressure testing provided in Delhi, India Billboard advertisement for Omron’s blood pressure monitors in India 16 Omron Corporation Integrated Report 2012 17 To Our Stakeholders Profile Business Strategies Segment Information Corporate Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information Interview with the President Special Feature 1: Global Vertical-Horizontal Matrix Management Special Feature 2: Omron’s Supply Responsibility and Business Continuity CONTENTS Interview with the President In pursuing stronger growth, we will strengthen intergroup connections under the mantra of “Team Omron.” The HCB currently operates in more than 110 countries. The business-to-consumer (B2C) business is playing an integral in the future. Currently, Omron has defined 167 core positions, 59 of which are based overseas. Forty of these positions role in raising awareness of the Omron brand. To make Omron known, people must first see our products and underare currently filled with Japanese people, with only 19 held by people from other countries.

It has been said, that if brand recognition* among consumers exceeds 40%, it will represent a significant advantage for expanding operations in these countries. By targeting this goal of 40%, we have succeeded in raising brand recognition in India from 24% in fiscal 2011 to 45% today. Enhanced brand recognition has proven to be incredibly beneficial in accelerating the development of our various businesses in the Indian Q6 Lastly, how do you plan to demonstrate your own strengths into Omron’s future management initiatives?

A startling number of opinions were raised and discussions were grueling but very fruitful. Together, we undertook many challenges, including expansion into the Russian market, and we were able to succeed thanks to our strong sense of unity. These experiences help me in promoting team building Q5 How about human resources strategies? What specific measures are you considering? today. Developing a mutual understanding between all members is of the utmost importance in raising team spirit. This requires substantial discussion. In this practice, I am always sure to thoroughly listen to others. Drawing on my own strengths, I will actively gather information from both internal and external sources, be decisive, and work to make VG2020 defines developing human resources as an important Omron’s management more ever dynamic. management strategy for ensuring future growth. If we are able We are working to strengthen intergroup bonds of “Team Omron,” with the aim of guaranteeing even firmer growth to develop a strong team of superior personnel, the growth of into the future. The management team are leading these efforts as a core part of Team Omron. our business will become even stronger. We therefore aim to At the same time, each business division has their own version of Team Omron. Team Omron holds open discussions grow our human resources in conjunction with our business without fear of opposition, and all members work hard together to accomplish the same shared goal. I compare this growth. In other words, we want to provide new and challenging type of team work to a shinkansen bullet train. A shinkansen cannot head toward its goal at full speed if all its cars are not opportunities for employees who do exemplary work, and we securely connected. Likewise, it is not sufficient for the organization to only be connected within divisions, and this is want to grow as a company that can continue to provide such why we place such a strong emphasis on promoting connections between business divisions and corporate headquarters opportunities. For us to grow as such a company, it is important divisions. Going forward, Team Omron will keep running at full speed, heading toward the achievement of the goals to emphasize the development of human resources in manageoutlined in VG2020. ment, and for this reason we have defined the task of strengthening global human resources in VG2020. At the same time, it is important for all employees to establish their own visions for their future career path. I do not doubt we will have to compete on the global stage in the future. For this reason, I hope every employee will have a clear picture of what work they wish to do in what part of the world. One specific human resources strategy we have developed is the Global Core Position Strategy, which was born out of our desire to actively provide opportunities to non-Japanese employees by allowing them to participate in management. We have defined management positions critical to advancing the VG2020 strategies as “core positions.” We intend to discover, promote, and educate human resources that can take over these positions P.24 18 Omron Corporation Integrated Report 2012 19 To Our Stakeholders Profile Business Strategies Segment Information Corporate Governance, CSR, and Others Financial Information Corporate Information Interview with the President Special Feature 1: Global Vertical-Horizontal Matrix Management Special Feature 2: Omron’s Supply Responsibility and Business Continuity CONTENTS Global Vertical-Horizontal Matrix Management Special 01 Feature Striving to Create New Value through Linkages down Business Lines (Vertical) and between Corporate Headquarters and —— To bolster your engineering and strengthen Business Divisions (Horizontal) your ability to provide higher added-value proposals, do you intend to continue pursuing a strategy of increasing the number of SEs and acquiring companies in China?
