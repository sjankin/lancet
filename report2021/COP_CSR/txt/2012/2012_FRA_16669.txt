CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 6.1.2. Governance principles 6.1.2. GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES PSA Peugeot Citroën’s corporate governance is based on joint-stock companies with a Supervisory Board and Managing compliance with recommended corporate governance practices and Board. The consolidated version of the Code, issued in April 2010, on the Code of Ethics described in section 6.3 below. may be viewed at Peugeot S.A.’s head office or on the MEDEF website at www.medef.com. The table below summarises those Code recommendations that the APPLICATION OF THE AFEP/MEDEF CORPORATE Company has elected not to apply due to the specific features of its GOVERNANCE CODE legal structure, its operating procedures and the automotive industry in general. On 16 December 2008, the Supervisory Board decided to adopt the AFEP/MEDEF corporate governance Code, as applicable to French RECOMMENDATION EXPLANATION Independence of the Supervisory Board members The Supervisory Board applies all of the independence criteria recommended in the AFEP/ MEDEF Code, with the following two exceptions: • not being a director or Supervisory Board member of the corporation for more than twelve years. Because auto manufacturing requires a medium and long-term approach, the Supervisory Board considers that the automotive experience acquired by its members through long service with the Board is extremely valuable. This is particularly the case in fulfilling one of the Board’s key responsibilities, which is to discuss the Group’s strategic growth vision; • not holding a directorship or equivalent position in another Group company in the past five years. The Board considers that the fact of having even recently been a director of another Group company does not give rise to any risk of the type of conflict of interest that the independence rules are designed to avoid. In addition, no member of the Supervisory Board exercises any senior executive responsibilities or is a salaried employee of a Group company. Consequently Jean-Louis Silvant is considered to be independent, even though he sits on the Board of Directors of Peugeot Suisse, a company whose operations only represent a small proportion of the Group’s automotive business. Based on these criteria, the Supervisory Board considers that the following members may be qualified as independent: • Pamela Knapp; • Jean-Paul Parayre; • Henri Philippe Reichstul; • Geoffroy Roux de Bézieux; • Ernest-Antoine Seillière; • Jean-Louis Silvant; • Joseph F. Toot Jr. These independent members represent seven of the 12 members, or 58%, which means that, based on these independence criteria, Peugeot S.A. more than complies with the AFEP/ MEDEF recommendation that in controlled companies at least one third of Board members should be independent. Representative proportion of independent members • Instead of the two-thirds recommended by the Code, 40% of the members of the Finance and Audit on the Finance and Audit Committee Committee are independent, reflecting the presence on the Board of representatives of the Peugeot family, the Company’s majority shareholder. Term of office of Supervisory Board members Current Supervisory Board members serve for six-year terms rather than four as recommended in the AFEP/ MEDEF Code. However, it should be noted that: • a supervisory and oversight body needs a stable membership to be able to effectively perform its duties; • the term of office for Managing Board members is four years; • the terms of office of the current Supervisory Board members are due to expire at dates staggered between 2012 and 2017; • at the 25 April 2012 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, shareholders will be asked to approve a reduction, to four years, in the term of office of two new nominees to the Board. Having a variable component of attendance fees based Introducing a variable component of attendance fees based on actual attendance does not seem warranted, on actual attendance. given that: • the attendance rate at Supervisory Board Meetings was 97% in 2011; • attendance rates at the various Committee meetings was close to 100% in 2011; • the Chairman of the Supervisory Board frequently consults Board members on issues outside of scheduled meetings, and likewise, Board members regularly take the initiative of informing the Chairman of their opinions and recommendations. Actual attendance is not a relevant criterion for judging the members’ involvement and engagement. 174 PSA PEUGEOT CITROËN CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY STRATEGIC GUIDELINES, COMMITMENTS AND INDICATORS FINANCIAL YEAR 2011 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND ETHICAL PRACTICES 6.1.

These indicators relate to the 2011 period and are presented in the sections “Environment” and “Social” of the report “Corporate Social Responsibility, Strategic Guidelines, Commitments and Indicators 2011” and are identified by: | the symbol P for the environmental indicators of the sites of the Group (including Faurecia) and the social indicators of the sites of the Group (except Faurecia), whose processes were the focus of our procedures; | the symbol D for the environmental indicators of the sites of the scope PCA and the social indicators of the Automobile Division the data of which were the focus of our procedures. These processes as well as the indicators mentioned above were established under the responsibility of the Executive management, according to the applicable 2011 Reporting Guides within the Group. Information regarding these guides is available with the delegation on the sustainable development within the Group at the following address: contact: sustainability@mpsa.com. We will express a conclusion on the processes for establishing these indicators and the selection of data as mentioned above. NATURE AND EXTENT OF OUR WORK We have conducted our procedures in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000, “Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Information,” issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. In terms of independence, we have followed the Independence Code of Ethics as prescribed by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). We have performed the procedures explained below to offer moderate assurance on the fact that the processes have been established and the selected data supplied in conformity with the environmental and social indicators mentioned above does not contain any significant anomalies. Providing assurance at a greater level would have required additional procedures. Our procedures included the following: | we have examined the reporting procedures applied by different entities within the group for environmental and social indicators, their relevance, their robustness, their objectivity and their overall characteristics; | we have selected a sample of sites and entities as presented below. The selection was performed based upon qualitative and quantitative criteria applied to the data (such as the relative weight, the geographic zone or the industry). Based upon the results, procedures were performed on the previous period. For the sites and entities selected, we verified through inquiry with the individuals responsible for preparing the data, that they had a good understanding and correctly applied the procedures put into place. In regards to the data selected, tests of details were performed on a sample basis to verify the calculations and reconcile the data with supporting documentation. 196 PSA PEUGEOT CITROËN CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY STRATEGIC GUIDELINES, COMMITMENTS AND INDICATORS FINANCIAL YEAR 2011 EXTERNAL AUDITOR’S REPORT 7 SELECTED SAMPLE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS OF THE SITES: Peugeot Citroën Automobiles Aulnay, Charleville, Mulhouse, Rennes, Madrid (Spain) and Buenos Aires (Argentina) Brands AP / AC Subsidiaries Peugeot: Mulhouse-Illzach, Rennes Subsidiaries Citroën: Aulnay-sous-Bois, Charleville GEFCO Subsidiaries GEFCO Spain and GEFCO Argentina Faurecia Sites of Crévin, Bains sur Oust, Vigo (Spain) SELECTED SAMPLE FOR THE SOCIAL INDICATORS: Peugeot Citroën Automobiles Industriel Sites of Sochaux, Mulhouse, Rennes, Buenos Aires, Madrid GEFCO Subsidiaries GEFCO Spain and GEFCO Argentina The contribution of the sites within the scope of PCA or for the Automobile Division was subject to our verification procedures of the data as follows: | for the environmental indicators, on average 48% of energy consumption, 40% of direct emission of greenhouse gases, 70% of the emissions of sulfur dioxide, 44% of the emissions of nitrogen dioxide, 40% of the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 42% of the water consumption of the scope PCA; | for the social indicators, 37% of the hours worked by the Automobile Division was used to calculate the rates of frequency and rate of gravity: z for the environmental indicators of sites, we prepared and sent questionnaires with the intent of identifying the correct application of reporting procedures and the effective implementation of internal controls to a sample of the sites and subsidiaries as follows: } 18 sites of Faurecia (among 9 countries), } 5 subsidiaries of GEFCO in 5 countries, } 5 subsidiaries of Peugeot (AP) and Citroën (AC) brands in 5 countries, z for the social indicators, we also prepared and sent questionnaires similarly to as previously mentioned above to 6 subsidiaries of the Peugeot (AP) and Citroën (AC) brands, z at the Group level, we performed analytical procedures and verified, on a sample basis, the data consolidation processes.

Note that this document does not necessarily contain all of because the reporting status reflects information disclosed in other PSA Peugeot Citroën’s response to a given indicator, even though media, such as the PSA Peugeot Citroën sustainable development its reporting status shows that it is partially or fully reported. This is website (www.sustainability.psa-peugeot-citroen.com). Notes: (1) For defining report content, material issues have been studied thanks to the stakeholders’ feedback and thanks to our own assessment of our main impacts at every step of the life cycle of the products. Main challenges and results are also reported in the 2011 Sustainable Development and Annual Report. This process complies with the GRI’s ‘Guidance on Defining Report Content’. (2) The governance of PSA Peugeot Citroën is based on an Executive Board and a Supervisory Board. (3) The Group has responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project questionnaire (CDP). Financial implications and other risks and opportunities for the organisation’s activities due to climate change are indicated in the Group’s answers to this questionnaire. Risk factors are described in 2011 Registration Document, section 4. (4) Not available. Indirect economic impact is difficult to assess by company. The ratio in industry between direct employment and ancillary employment can be estimated at 3 to 4. Other impact types are covered in certain studies, but it is still difficult to make reliable economic assessments. (5) The use of renewable materials is monitored internally. The key focus is on recyclability and the effective recycling of vehicles. (6) Not available. The Group consumes outsourced electricity and steam. No detail on all suppliers’ primary sources is available at this moment in the year, for all countries and all suppliers. (7) The energy challenges of the automotive industry concerning its products are closely linked to the greenhouse effect. Cf. EN18. (8) Not available. The energy consumption of suppliers of automotive parts for Peugeot and Citroën vehicles is neither compiled nor estimated. PSA Peugeot Citroën encourages its suppliers to make progress through its purchasing requirements. (9) Not relevant. PSA Peugeot Citroën’s sites are not located in areas with water withdrawal restrictions, so have no significant impact on the water source. (10) Not available. Optimising water consumption at PCA automotive sites is factored in from the design phase of the new site and is one of the objectives of the Environmental Management System. Water recycling and other processes to limit water consumption are encouraged. Open circuit cooling is forbidden at all new facilities. PSA Peugeot Citroën prefers to monitor its water consumption (cf. water consumption indicator) rather than measure the quantity of water recycled at each site. (11) The Group strictly applies the requirements of the 1987 Montreal Protocol and the related regional laws. In particular, the Group has ceased using all substances covered by the Protocol in its main automobile manufacturing applications. These include first generation refrigerants (CFCs) in vehicle air conditioning systems, trichloroethane for degreasing in certain mechanical component operations and Halon in fire extinguishers. Because replacements for these substances have been used for many years now, indicator EN19 is no longer applicable. The only meaningful remaining uses of substances covered by the Montreal Protocol concern HCFC refrigerants in certain industrial or domestic air conditioning systems, which do not fall within the scope of EN19. (12) Not available. Only R&D expenses dedicated to environmental issues are estimated and published. This indicator is not consolidated. As of today, no methodology exists to assess this cost within a reliable bracket for all industrial activities. The Group monitors trends in these costs on a case-by-case basis, notably investments in this area, and has started internal discussions on the subject in parallel with the development of a possible international standard. 204 PSA PEUGEOT CITROËN CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY STRATEGIC GUIDELINES, COMMITMENTS AND INDICATORS FINANCIAL YEAR 2011 GRI STATEMENT AND CROSS REFERENCE TABLES CORRESPONDANCE BETWEEN GLOBAL COMPACT AND GRI INDICATORS AREAS PRINCIPLE GRI G3 INDICATORS 1.
