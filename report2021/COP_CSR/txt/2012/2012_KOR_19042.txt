Think-Tank Research Meeting Achievement of Budget Reduction through Expansion of Tasks for Railway Facilities KR has further enhanced safety of railway through systematic improvement and maintenance, which reflect the age of facilities and urgency for improvement. In particular, KR’s capacity has been expanded through expansion of areas of KR’s own improvement and management. Plus, as for areas commissioned to KORAIL, KR succeeded in budget reduction through thorough verification. Expansion of Profits through Active Asset Development and Management KR has increased profit from use fees compared to the previous year, through various ideas and active asset development and management. In detail, profits were created and budget was saved through rent from unused land and trains, compensations for illegal occupation, rates of ads in KR’s facility assets, fees for use of utility poles, sales of unused goods, export of discarded railway ties, and recycling of discarded pebbles. In particular, for resolution of inveterate arrears and intentional default on bonds, KR launched a system for recovery of outstanding bonds, which includes electronic seizure of deposit and preliminary testing. KR has also been nurturing the expertise of personnel in charge of this sector, through various on-line and off-line education programs on issues such as asset management and bond recovery. Good examples are spread at result briefings held twice every quarter and know-how about asset management is shared at the think-tank research group. Economic Responsibility Achievement of Soundness Enhancement of Profitability Pursuit of Growth Best Practice: Going Global Beyond Korea Creation of New Profits through Diversification of Development Projects Project of Development of KR established a realistic mid-and-long-term development plan for diversification of asset development projects. the Gyeongchun Line For implementation of the projects, an MOU is signed with local governments for the establishment of the working-level committee. Then, supervisors are recruited to form SPC (Special Purpose Company) to collect occupation fees.

For the project, KR established a mutual investment company with a private business and Chuncheon-si(city) in 2011. When the project is completed in 2013, 28.3 billion won of new profit will be created for the next three years and the local economy is expected to be revitalized. KR is also considering a launch of development projects for discarded railways of the Jungang, Donghae-Nambu, and Yeongdong lines. Project for the development of the Gwangmyeong Station had been sluggish since its start in 2007 because of difficulties in funding but, KR pushed forward with the project after coming up with ways for normalization, through consultation with experts in May, 2011. In addition, despite economic slowdown, KR succeeded in the selection of supervisors of projects to develop areas near Seogang Station and Gongdeok Station. If these projects succeed, KR is expected to secure 163.1 billion won of profit for the next 30 years. Efforts for Financial Efficiency KR secures financial soundness along with expansion of profit, through budget reduction. Budget reduction consists of the planning phase, design phase, and construction phase. It also creates various financial effects through activities such as optimization of the size of facilities, design VE, improvement of construction methods, 6-sigma innovation, and CoP (Community of Practice) for each phase. Optimization of Size without Excessive Facilities KR reviewed railway construction projects under planning or construction, to go beyond conventional planning and establish passenger-oriented railways. As to the Seohae line, the basic plan was reviewed and as a result, the size of stations and width of bridges and cross-sectional area inside tunnels were reduced according to the demand and number of passing trains. For the Suin-line, wiring at stations was reduced based on the analysis of freight train operation in the future and the size of facilities of stations and car depots were adjusted, reflecting the station operation plan and train introduction plan. Through the reasonable adjustment of excessive facilities, 514.2 billion won of business cost was reduced and the reduced amount will be invested in the expansion of railway facilities. Korea Rail Network Authority 2012 Sustainability Report 28 29 Carrying Out Economical Design through Advancement of Design VE Awarded for Excellent Design VE KR has been raising its status as an institution specializing in design, based on design VE (Value Engineering).

Appendix Participation in the UN Global Compact Statement of Verification by a Third Party GRI Index System for Implementation of Sustainable Management External Participation and External Participation & Recognition of External Assessments APPENDIX Statement of Verification by a Third Party Messrs. Stakeholder of Korea Rail Network Authority Korea Productivity Center (the “Verifier” below here) submits its opinion of verification, at the request of a third-party verification of “2012 Sustainability Report” (the “Report” below), by Korea Rail Network Authority. Responsibility and The responsibility of the information and opinion written in the Report wholly lies to Korea Rail Network Authority. The Verifier is responIndependence sible for opinion of verification on the Report and as an independent verification agency, the Verifier was not engaged in writing this Report and does not have any interest with Korea Rail Network Authority, which can undermine independence of verification. Standards of The verification was conducted with AA100AS(2008) verification standard, based on Type 1 verification type and Moderate verification Verification level and appropriateness to inclusivity, materiality, and responsiveness principles was checked, following AA1000 APS (2008) verification principle. Limitation For this verification, results in 2011 were verified according to the verification principle above and verification of credibility of some data including financial results, environmental data such as greenhouse gas emission, and web-site-related information is not included here. In addition, a limited on-site examination at the Daejeon headquarters was conducted and if additional verification is conducted in the future, the result of verification could be different. Method of For this verification, a verification process in the following methods was conducted. Verification 1. Compliance with content and quality of report was checked based on GRI G3. 1 Guideline. 2. Satisfaction of GRI Application level A requirements were checked through examination of reporting rate and writing method on indicators of GRI G3. 1 Guideline. 3. Appropriateness of selection of major issues dealt with and the content in the report was examined through media research and benchmarking analysis. 4. Appropriateness and errors in expression of the content in the report was examined through methods such as comparison and analysis against other sources of information. 5. Ground for major data and information was checked through on-site examination at the Daejeon main headquarters and internal process and system were checked as well. Result of The Verifier confirmed that this Report is sincerely and fairly reflecting the activities and results of Korea Rail Authority (KR)’s sustainable Verification management. In addition, through this verification, it was confirmed that KR satisfies the self-declared GRI Application Level A standards. 1. Inclusivity: Participation of Stakeholders KR categorizes and manages its stakeholders into “value influencing customer”, “value creating customer”, “value conveying customer”, and “value purchasing customer”, according to trends of value of railways, and is listening to their opinions through various communication channels customized to different group of stakeholders. KR is strengthening communication with employees based on improvement of the labor-management relation and difficulties treatment system. KR is also immediately responding to difficulties of affiliate companies through its SME support center and shared growth web-site. In addition, KR is smoothly exchanging information with different groups of customers, through the four major VOC collection system including Sorisam, customer suggestion, and customer complaint management system. As such, it was confirmed that KR is continuously communicating with different groups of stakeholders, through off-line channels such as public hearing, discussion, and council, and on-line channels including blog and web-site. In particular, KR’s attempt to prevent and swiftly resolve social conflicts, which frequently occur because of the characteristics of the railway construction project, through formation and operation of the conflict management committee is evaluated to be an active effort for response to and resolution of business-related issues. In addition, KR built a cooperative network with environmental organizations including NGOs, for resolution of environmental conflicts surrounding Mt. Cheonseong in the Gyeongbu high speed railway area, which is one of the major issues of sustainable management written in the Report. KR formed the green railway consultation council and actively reflected opinions of environmental organizations to KR’s environmental policies, which is an exemplary case of communication. It is recommendable for KR to disclose interview of different stakeholders including railway experts, government agencies, KORAIL, and NGO, to supplement content of communication with stakeholders. In that way, an opportunity will be offered to examine the current level and standards of KR’s sustainable management from outside perspective. Plus, I recommend you to manage different on-line and off-line communication channels for more systematic management of the opinions of stakeholder in and out of the company, which are collected through various channels. Korea Rail Network Authority 2012 Sustainability Report 68 69 2. Materiality: Selection and Report of Major Issues It is confirmed that KR is continuously identifying sustainable management issues relevant to KR, through a variety of methods such as media survey and survey on stakeholders. In particular, KR is making efforts to examine the satisfaction levels of different issues such as economic, environmental, and employee responsibilities, through surveys and to identify issues related to sustainable management, through finding out positive or negative issues covered by the media, through media research. In addition, the issues drawn out by the survey come under a materiality evaluation and given priorities, to draw out core issues. It is confirmed that most of the major issues are reported in this Report in a balanced way. In particular, KR is reporting the process and plan for eco-friendly construction of railways which takes the whole life cycle of railway into account, as a response to issue of “realization of eco and green railway for green growth”. It also reports its social contribution activities based on operation of social contribution system and support for local communities by experts, as a response to the issue of “public interest project for contribution to society and expansion of contribution”. Those are good examples of implementation of sustainable management that utilizes the characteristics of business. However, the issue of “spread of eco-friendly awareness” is focusing only on PR of KR’s environmental activities such as environmental campaign and education, thus, reporting of this issue needs improvement and the reporting of “realization of eco and green railway” needs more detailed information of results of carbon emission reduction in the whole process. I recommend you to add more detailed and diverse issues related to the railway industry to the issue pool and to more actively respond to major issues through providing more detailed information of actual cases and plans of major issues. 3. Responsiveness: Organization’s Response to Issues KR established 2020 Global Management Strategy in December 2011 and set 18 strategic tasks under four strategic goals. KR also designated implementation tasks and core result indicators for each strategic tasks and the achievement level of the result indicators are examined every year, to be evaluated in connection to internal assessment of department performances. The core result indicators are also connected to major result indicators of sustainable management so, KR’s case is a good example of joint implementation of sustainable management and organizational strategies. In particular, ethical management activities can be monitored through the ethical management system, four major sectors -management, disaster, conflict, and PRcan be monitored through the risk management system, mileage of social contribution of each department and individual employee can be checked in real time through the social contribution system. Such system for different fields is an excellent example of company-wide management of results of sustainable management. KR is an institution with excellent record of sustainable management, where strategies of sustainable management is carried out with actual management strategies, and has clear long term goals such as “0.05% or lower accident rate by 2020” and “3.6 trillion won of profit from new projects”. I recommend you to add detailed roadmap and mid-and-long-term goals for result indicators of sustainable management to the Report in the future, to help stakeholder better understand KR’s mid-and-long-term strategies for sustainable management. Recommendation The Verifier highly evaluates KR’s efforts for and achievement of enhancement of sustainability and recommends KR as the following, for publication of Reports in the future and raised standard of its sustainable management. 1. I recommend KR to establish a systematic channel of management of stakeholders, for more integrated management of participation channels of stakeholders. That will enable improvement of stakeholders’ participation in connection with KR’s sustainable management. 2. I recommend KR to report plans and results of some issues that are currently under planning, including assessment of railway greenhouse gas emissions, use of new and renewable energy, and systematic resources management in the whole process. 3. I recommend KR to establish mid-and-long-term plans and goals for more detailed implementation of sustainable management in the fields of economy, environment, and society, and report this in the future, as core result of KR’s sustainable management. 4. You can enhance the standard of sustainable management through managing various indicators of result of sustainable management in connection to financial results. 000-81 June 2012, Chairman & CEO of KPC, Hong Jin Dong-su Kim, Executive Director Jeong-seok Seo, Division Chief Ju-mi Park, Expert Member Sustainable Management Center of Korea Productivity Center is a verification agency which was officially certified by Accountability, an institution that established AA1000, an international standard of stakeholder participation and verification.
