Emporiki Bank, in a difficult business environment, that inevitably affected its economic dynamics, operated with caution in relation to its objectives and with consistence in relation to corporate principles. In particular, Emporiki Bank strengthened its capital adequacy, while loan portfolio remained nearly stable. Modern tools of risk assessment were used. Emporiki contributed to the maintenance of healthy competition. We financed our clients by providing fair and competitively designed products that meet real needs. We responded with flexibility to the need of our customers for debt settlement. Also, credit assessment procedures have been improved, further enhancing the quality of the new loan portfolio of Emporiki Bank. The network of branches has been restructured and our customers’ service has been improved. We reduced operating expenses. Tax and insurance contributions were timely paid. Emporiki Bank has done the best to maintain jobs, permanent training, and employees’ development and to improve the internal communication. We cared for social cohesion and continued contributing to the promotion of culture. Emporiki Bank operated with environmental responsibility, improving eco-efficiency indicators and incorporating environmental criteria in credit policy. Having in mind that Greece disposes significant sources and potential for economic growth, creative businesses and skilled human resources, we expect the reorientation of the country’s economic policy to put its course on better foundations. However, we know that the stabilization and recovery of the Greek economy takes time. During this course we want Emporiki Bank to be a trusty partner for our customers, a good employer and a stable partner of the local community. 02 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2010 Emporiki is investing in the future aiming to a collective quality of life. Our priority is to serve small and large businesses, individuals and households, offering competitive solutions that respond to modern needs. We rely on confidence, a strong relationship we continuously develop with our customers as well as on the dedication and professionalism of our employees. We honor the trust of all people. In a changing world, we adapt to the changing situations and we lead Emporiki Bank with principles. We want now and in the future all to be proud for Emporiki Bank. The Global Compact principles are inspiring and binding for us. The BoD and we personally guide and direct the Corporate Social Responsibility of Emporiki Bank. We lay this Report before you and we hope to have answered your questions and to have met your expectations.

After a thorough review of its past course and tomorrow’s opportunities, Crédit Agricole, with the active involvement of its people, looks ahead and determines its future, based on its identity, values and principles and sharing with all its people around the world its ambition “to become the European leader in customer-centric universal banking”. Emporiki is part of this future, as a member of the Crédit Agricole family. The strategic plan of Crédit Agricole reconfirms the commitment of our parent group to Emporiki Bank as well as its strong expectations for the Bank’s full recovery and longterm sustainable growth. Our vision to become a better Bank through our people and for our customers lies within the global vision of Crédit Agricole....

Credit Agricole SA Human Rights Charter, http://www. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2010 19 Crédit Agricole S.A. Human Rights Charter Our parent company Credit Agricole SA adopted the “Human Rights Charter” which is binding for all Group companies. Using the acronym RESPECT (Recognition, Equality, Safety, Participation, Equity, Consistency, and Territory), the companies of the Group Credit Agricole are committed to the following: “ • Recognition: Conducting a human resources policy that respects individuality, strives to promote plurality of talents and skills and values diversity. • Equality: Developing actions to ensure equal opportunity and equal treatment for all and to prevent discrimination in human resources management policy, whether in hiring, training, promotion, compensation, job security or working conditions. • Safety: Ensuring that the workplace meets national health and safety standards in the countries where the Group operates, prohibiting the use of non-compliant safety systems and banning any type of forced or compulsive labor, including child labor. • Participation: Developing actions to promote the freedom to create associations and/or trade unions, employee representation and collective bargaining rights. • Equity: Offering compensation and benefits with fair conditions that provide suitable standard of living and fair living conditions for employees and their families, which are consistent with risk management goals. • Consistency: Carrying out due diligence vis-à-vis customers, suppliers and service providers to ensure that the Group does not unwittingly participate in human rights violations, whether directly or indirectly. • Territory: Helping to promote health, education, culture and respect for human rights in the regions “ where the Group operates. 20 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2010 Commitment for Equal Treatment Policy. http://www.emporiki.gr/cbg/gr/career&research/career&research_story.jsp?docpath=/gr/Career/static/equal_ opportunities “ At Emporiki Bank we recognize gender equality as a common value and its implementation in our daily life as a collective responsibility. We commit to ensuring that each dimension in the management of human resources – hiring, placements, promotions, undertaking positions of responsibility, compensation, transfers, training and education, dismissals – is governed by the principle of equal treatment. We commit to undertaking our banking activities with respect for cultural differences and our employees’ dignity. Keeping in mind our values of transparency and meritocracy, we anticipate: • That the composition of our human resources reflects the composition of our society • That the composition of our management reflects the composition of our human resources • That education and training program opportunities are made available in practice to all employees • That welfare programs aim at supporting employees and their families and at reconciling family life and professional obligations For Emporiki Bank, equality is not just either a matter of numerical equilibrium or implementing the required legislation. We recognize that applying the principle of equality as a value in the Bank's daily operation is a responsibility for us all and is affected by mainstream social patterns and stereotypes. We recognize that true gender equality is also connected to changing those mentalities and stereotypes, which entrap companies, men and women and restrict or even hamper creativity. “ We commit to work systematically so as together to achieve the goal of equality.
