Postbank has always been guided by this principle in everything it has done, working intensively again in 2011 to advance its business model in accordance with the meaning of such sustainable economic activity. Because our entrepreneurial selfimage entails that we, as Germany’s major retail bank, have a special responsibility – vis-à-vis our customers, employees and shareholders as well as vis-à-vis the social environment in which we are active. It is our aspiration to meet this responsibility and create sustainable value for all stakeholders of Postbank. How true and critical for success the basic idea of sustainable economic activity is has never been as clear as it is today. 2011 was again marked by the global economic, financial and sovereign debt crisis, which has extended into 2012 with the so-called euro crisis and the request for financial support on the part of various nations. This development is accompanied by a new protest culture and a broad discussion over the role of the banks in society. All this underscores the necessity that a company has to earn acceptance time and again through responsible action. Only this way can trust emerge; and trust is the most important foundation for economic success. While the environment of banks – like society as a whole – is going through a period of transformation, the accompanying changes also offer opportunities: to maintain what is good and possibly make it even better, to review critically what is less good and act at the same time in a forward-looking way. We have documented the measures, objectives and findings this attitude generates in our 2011 Sustainability Report, which I am presenting here. From social responsibility to environmental and climate protection: Postbank took a broad range of measures again in various fields this year in order to contribute to the goal ­ of responsible economic activity. We present you with a small section of them in this report on our commitment to sustainability – the third edition up to now. I’m looking forward to your suggestions and feedback. So, in this spirit, I hope you enjoy reading our 2011 Sustainability Report. Sincerely yours, Frank Strauß CEO Deutsche Postbank AG 8 Contents Contents Postbank’s history (September 2010 – December 2011) .............................................. 3 Preface

the principles of sustainability: Our aim is to secure our future. Here the focus is on • Supporting social aspects • Protecting the environment • Contributing to a robust economic ­environment. We see it as our task to make an active contribution to climate protection and to our social environment, so sustainability is an important element of our company strategy. By this means we want to secure our company’s long-term success and to convey the model of sustainability to every one of our employees. In our selfimage, sustainability should be a way of life and not just something to think about. We undertake to provide our employees with attractive and secure employment conditions and to protect natural resources. We as a company are an integral part of the society in which we operate. Our goal is therefore to create added value for our stakeholders. As the biggest private customer bank in Germany we see ourselves as obliged to conform to our model.

It developed its standard core banking software in 2003 with SAP and has constantly improved it since then. The hardware in its central computer centre is constantly upgraded. In 2004 Postbank launched its new transaction banking division which it offers as a service provider to financial service companies. It offers them services such as ­financial transaction processing and account maintenance as well as loan processing. Postbank’s subsidiary Betriebs-Center für Banken AG (BCB) provides financial transaction services for banks such as Deutsche Bank, HypoVereinsbank and HSH Nordbank.

Introduction 15 Sustainability management | Sustainability is highly prized at Postbank. This can also be clearly seen from the organisational affiliations in the Corporate Development and the opportunity for reporting directly to the Chairman of the Executive Board. Organisation of sustainability Sustainability belongs to the area of Corporate Development and hence in the Group ­Management department. The operational implementation and management of sustainability issues is performed by the Sustainability Officer, who is appointed by the Executive Board. The Sustainability Officer of the Postbank Group is the interface for all sustainability issues, whose implementation he coordinates or progresses himself. e. g.: • Central point of contact in the Postbank Group with regard to all matters relevant to sustainability • Management of the Competence Center “Sustainability and Climate Protection” • Enquiries from CR rating agencies The success of our sustainability management is based mainly on teamwork.

Stakeholder groups Postbank’s stakeholders are very important to it. Here we include in particular shareholders, customers, employees, society, non-governmental organisations and public institutions. To get to know their different interests and concerns, Postbank conducts stakeholder dialogues.

Employees highlight potential areas for improvement by means of our group-wide ideas management. In 2011, over 3,000 suggestions were collected and evaluated in this way. For more information see the “Social commitment” section. 20 Social sustainability Social sustainability Social sustainability 21 Employees | In recent years Postbank’s employees have contributed greatly to the success of Postbank with their know-how and great commitment. They are crucially jointly responsible for the strength of the operating clientele and the innovative nature of our products and processes. The attractiveness of Postbank as an employer over many ­years can be demonstrated. Here staff management ensures a balance between employees’ needs and commercial requirements. Staff management Headcount As at the end of 2011 the Postbank Group employed 19,232 full time equivalent staff, about 32 % of which were office staff. Whereas about 98% of the employees of the Postbank Group are resident in Germany, the other employees are spread between the sites in the USA, Great Britain, Italy and Luxembourg. About 1,120 staff work at the Postbank Group’s Bonn office. The other employees are spread widely throughout the network of branches covering the whole of Germany and the subsidiaries. Thus for instance about 4,320 employees work for Deutsche Postbank AG whilst most of the other 14,912 employees are distributed over the subsidiaries in Germany but also abroad. The ratio of the number of female emploAt the end of 2011, the ratio of part-time Winners of the 2011 Postbank Cup: yees versus male ones has not changed in employees was about 25 %.

Thus for instance in August 2011 employees celebrated precisely 97 full-time and part-time service anniversaries – there were 22 employees completing their 40th years of service alone. To continue to keep Postbank ready to face the future, supporting successors is also of great importance. We were able to maintain our moderate average age of 42.8 years again in 2011. This effect was achieved by maintaining a stable number of trainees. As at 31.12.2011 there were 929 junior staff members in the Postbank The PBC Pearls at the 2011 Group.

In September 2011 all the employees of the Postbank Group had an opportunity to assess their superiors and the management in the context of a employee survey on key issues. Postbank scored ­particularly well in the area of “Managing employees and teams and making them successful.” Almost three quarters are of the opinion that their superiors convey clearly and understandably what performance they expect from them. Two thirds are confident that their talents, skills and specialist knowledge are well used in their day-to-day work and that they are appreciated by their superiors. The 2011 employee survey of key issues was evaluated internally and the main results were communicated to all employees via “bankpost”. Top managers were provided with a workshop format that will inform their staff of the results of the survey and pick up on the critical points. So managers and their teams have an opportunity to develop specific improvement measures for their own units. The following content is envisaged for the workshop, which will take about 3 hours: • Presentation of the results • Discussion of the relevant points • Formulation of areas for action and measures to be taken • Agreement of an action plan for the implementation of the measures. Social sustainability 25 The development of successors in line with requirements is a major concern for Postbank.

These target groups will be provided with an appropriate tool to permit modern processing of learning content. Back in 2006 Postbank concluded a cooperation contract with the Education Authority of the city of Bonn for the free provision of IT equipment. There are also agreements with a non-profit-making organisation and with kindergartens. Under these agreements, pupils in need are also provided with such equipment and children of pre-school age are introduced to schooling with appropriating learning programmes. The equipment provided includes laptops, PCs, monitors, printers and scanners. Since the start of this cooperation arrangement in 2006, Postbank has given away over 2,500 devices including about 390 in 2010 and about 340 in 2011. 58 Social sustainability For Postbank, intelligent business conduct means exploiting and supporting the potential provided to us by the diversity of people and their cultures.

Social sustainability 59 Reading without light Oliver Bindseil works in Postbank’s telephone exchange in Hanover. In his leisure time he rows and he is active as a target shooter. By the way, this man is blind. In Oliver Bindseil’s office you hear beeps. All the time, in fact. When the 43-year-old picks up the telephone, the beeping stops. “Hello, this is Postbank Hanover, Operator Bindseil. How can I help you?” he says, listens for a moment and then presses a few keys. Then he puts his headset aside and beams at his visitors: “It’s great that I can show you my job.” None of the customers that ring the Postbank’s switchboard in Hanover could tell that the man with the pleasant voice is blind. Oliver Bindseil finds names and numbers in the address book in his computer just as quickly as a sighted person, perhaps even quicker. His 16 years of professional experience as a telephonist and a little aid that answers to the name of Jaws make this possible. Jaws is a piece of software that translates all the text on Bindseil’s screen into a row of Braille under the keyboard. You will look in vain for a mouse on his desk. Instead he has a small green device that looks like a mini-typewriter with six keys. “I can type brief notes on the Braille steno device,” he explains. If you write something, the device spits out a little strip of paper with Braille dots embossed on it. “I used to need that more often,” says the telephonist. “I started in the Postgiroamt (Post Giro Office) in 1988 – that’s what it was called then – and worked in Investigations and Complaint Processing.” He used to type callers’ concerns on the steno machine as he listened and then transcribed the Braille with a normal typewriter to memos that he issued to the departments. Today, his job and that of his colleague, who is also blind, is ­restricted to a pure telephone operator role. They answer 30 to 70 calls a day. “There’s no such thing as a typical concern,” explains Bindseil. “It might be about passbooks, account stateweek on the Mittelland Canal and plays the keyboard in an oldies ments or about their pension that hasn’t been credited yet.

Dr. Mario Daberkow: Once the project plan had been produced, we started a search for a suitable recipient for the presents. A crucial factor in the implementation was a partner who operates all over Germany, like ourselves. This was also an advantage as regards the effort of organisation. The sustainability team looked into various charity recipients and analysed them by specified criteria. This process was relatively long-winded since we were conscious of the fact that the decision would be for the long term and therefore demanded thorough study. The decisive points in favour of Die Arche were that it Postbank colleagues received a warm welcome from Bernd Siggelkow (l.) looked after children all over Germany and the underlying concept.

(Christian Children’s and Young People’s Charity) Every day in its establishments Die Arche offers children a nutritious hot meal, help with homework, meaningful leisure time pursuits with sport and music and above all a lot of attention. Die Arche has also set itself the task of publicising defects in the our society so that children are once more increasingly the focus. The management of Die Arche is also seeking dialogue with the worlds of business and politics and contributing its experience gained from its work to this.

Demographic change In 1973 BHW Bausparkasse had a new purpose-built building suitable for children constructed in Hamelin that is now operated by the German Red Cross as a kindergarten. An agreement stated that 100 places would be provided in 4 groups, of which 70% were originally reserved for BHW employees. As a result of demographic change, the situation has also changed in childcare. Today there are four groups with a total of 83 children, only 21 of whom have parents who work for BHW or Postbank. « Ernst-August Solle, Environment Officer, Hamelin site “Ageing is on the move” series of lectures Almost 1,000 customers attended the The attendees also included 27 members “Ageing is on the move” series of lectures of the Customer Advisory Committee that Postbank arranged in 2010 and 2011 who supported the series of lectures.

That is the result of a machine test that the Self-Service Banking and Target Group Management departments conducted in collaboration with the Customer Advisory Committee. 18 test subjects from the group of customers aged 50+ displayed their account balances and made transfers manually and with document scanners. Standing orders were also amended and account statements printed out, so all the functions of the terminals were tested.

The environmental management system based on this defines the responsibility that managers and staff bear for this.

Following this initial certification audit, in spring 2009 Postbank was granted certification to ISO 14001 for the first time. Since then, the recurring audit meetings have become important elements in the annual cycle of Postbank’s environmental management system. For one thing, the internal audits serve the purpose of timely identification of weak points and potential for improvement in dealing with sustainability themes and the preparation by the people responsible for the meetings with TÜV. A corresponding internal audit is conducted for every external audit with some symmetry and corresponding timetable.

In the course of the internal audits in January 2012, almost two dozen audits were conducted locally at the head office and at the major sites in Berlin, Bonn, Dortmund, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hamelin and Munich. The TÜV Rheinland auditors used the meetings in the course of the 2011 “monitoring audit” not only to carry out the obligatory inspection of records but also to gain a deeper insight into the environmental management system and to gather findings as the basis for a decision. If one includes the concluding meeting and a meeting with Mr. Stemmer, the Resources Director, 16 audit meetings were held at the head office and site audits were held in Berlin, Bonn, Dortmund and Munich before the certificate was awarded in May 2011. 82 Ecological sustainability Postbank sets itself goals that contribute to the improvement of its impact on the environment.

Site reports For example, below we present a brief summary of the measures and successes of Postbank’s Hamburg and Frankfurt sites, in particular in the area of ecology. Frankfurt On 15.11.2010 the Frankfurt site held an Environment Day. Here the employees could find out about subjects relevant to the environment and sustainability from seven different information stands: •E nergy management at the site At the site, the firm of Hochtief presented the changes within the company relating to energy management.

In addition to the ecological aspects, Postbank Hamburg has for many years been involved in social sustainability measures. In collaboration with the German Red Cross, Postbank offers an opportunity, for instance, to give blood on its premises. In 2011, 110 colleagues used this opportunity to secure the blood supply. Around the stairwells on the first floor there is a gallery that is used for art exhibitions. First of all, talented employees displayed photos and pictures. But now there are several artists in the region and at the Art Academy who are happy to use the opportunity for an exhibition. 4 exhibitions were held during the reporting period. Ecological sustainability 93 Report from the Hamburg site on the Christmas Tree Wishlist campaign Report from the Hamburg site on the Christmas Tree Wishlist campaign Postbank employees in Hamburg support Die Arche Hamburg Jenfeld with great enthusiasm. One employee has written up her memories of the campaign. When the campaign was brought from Bonn to the sites for the first time in 2010, everyone involved was of the same opinion: “That’s a great idea!” And in 2011, by the summer the question was: “Are we doing it again?” Before the first Sunday of Advent, Christmas trees were put up at the main entrance and in the canteen and decorated by the trainees with home-made wishlists. The first wishlists didn’t make it as far as the trees in either year since they were practically torn out of the hands of our astonished trainees. There was then pressure on production to make sure that there were some wishlists on the trees. On the next day the big question was: “What happened? Were the Christmas elves on the job? All the wishlists had gone again!” The trainees waited excitedly for the first presents on the first handover day. Employees beaming with joy came to the present table with their lovingly packed presents. Again and again one heard things like: • “I can give something and I know it will arrive!” • “This is much more personal than when I see a deduction from my account and I don‘t know how much really gets to the intended people or whether it even gets to them at all” • “This helps children in our city.” • “These kids aren‘t asking for much. I can help with that.” As a result, in 2010 and 2011 there were an incredible number of about 380 presents collected each time! They were then taken to the Die Arche location in Hamburg Jenfeld. The Die Arche staff beamed and were delighted since they hadn’t counted on this volume of presents. This campaign was great fun for all those involved and gave them all wonderful moments. Employees at the giving out of the presents Our trainees with the presents donated 94 Ecological sustainability Ecological products and services | Postbank’s particular concern is not only to meet its customers’ requirements for ecologically-based alternatives but to actively give a positive environmental sign by the design of its range of sustainable products and services.

With these we secure our long-term profitability and manage the indirect effects of our business activities on society and the environment. Risk management In order to meet the challenge of the increasing demands of risk management, in March 2011 Postbank merged the risk entities into the new “Chief Risk Office” management department. In this way Postbank has organised risk management under unified control so as to be able to recognise the risks arising from its business activities in good time and to analyse, monitor and manage them. Risk management is constantly being reviewed in the light of current developments in the risk profile and the regulatory environment and where necessary revised. Under business risks, for instance, consideration is given to operational risks and by implication risks to reputation from which the bank might suffer a loss of confidence by its business partners or customers as a result of the incorrect conduct of individuals or groups. Postbank has recognised that the identificaAs the Environment Officer of the Chief Risk Office department I strive tion and analysis of environmental risks to continue to establish and expand the Postbank environmental mamust form a part of the normal risk assessnagement system and the idea of sustainability within the department ment and risk management procedure. following the reorganisation.

A comprehensive system for the measurement and monitoring of risk positions and for the analysis of associated potential gains or losses guarantees that Postbank is well armed against risks and ensures a long-term increase in the company’s value. Postbank does not run its own investment banking. With regard to the environment and society, a major bank has an influence over the possible effects through its financial investment in the capital market. With financial investment, for instance, companies with an exemplary record on ecological and ethical matters are deliberately selected. With financial investment, the company endeavours to ensure as far as possible that the bank’s assets are invested on ecological and ethical principles. 122 Annex Annex Annex 123 Scope of the report | The 2011 Sustainability Report is based on the major parameters set out below.
