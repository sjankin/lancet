ARGE believes that society’s well being can be increased only if management quality of government, private sector, and civil society is improved. The role of a business is to make sustainable improvements in the quality of life in the community . ARGE Consulting, not only helps its clients create value for their own shareholders, customers, and stakeholders but ARGE is also a catalyst to promote appropriate behaviour for responsible entrepreneurship, thereby helping improve the quality of life. In 2011, we commemorated our 20th anniversary and 20 years of leadership in CSR through our voluntary activities, such as serving on the boards of numerous NGOs; managing and providing guidance for the evaluators of award processes of OSGD and Citibank –Micro Credit; wrote and shared articles to introduce new management ideas and concepts to our society. We have also been active in numerous international organizations such as the Global Corporate Governance Forum and representing the business world in governance matters at the OECD to improve the quality of governance throughout the world; as well as publishing a published a new book titled “Keys to Governance”. Also in 2011, we continued to lead the Global Compact activities by assuming the role of National Representative of UN Global Compact. Since our aim is to increase the impact of voluntary activities, and feeling great responsibility by being the Representative, we have been trying to increase the number of signatories and the effectiveness of the Network. The Sectorial Approach, which was designed and implemented first by Turkish Network, has been defined as an important milestone in Global Compact Activities. We try to improve and share knowledge about good governance with society by our volunteer activities. With this report, we share our corporate social responsibility activities for the period of the year 2011. This year, we prefer to use “Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership” model in our Communication on Progress Report of 2011 period. Dr.Yılmaz Argüden Chairman March 2012 “Helping you succeed.. .” Communication on Progress-2011 Corporate Social Responsibility Approach at ARGE Consulting Corporate Social Responsibility has been at the core of ARGE’s philosophy ever since its inception and is a core value of its governance perspective. As the first Turkish signatory, ARGE supports the Global Compact and integrates the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact in its operations. About ARGE Consulting • At the crossroads between Europe and Asia, Turkey is not only experiencing the highest GNP growth rates among OECD countries, but is also realizing the benefits of her privileged ties to European, Middle Eastern, and Central Asian countries. As a matter of fact, Turkey is rated as one of the leading emerging markets in the world. • Realizing the growth potential for international business in the Turkish and related markets, ARGE was founded in 1991 to provide advisory services in the areas of business strategy development and implementation, business excellence methodologies, evaluation and development of investment projects, development of organizational infrastructure, change management. • ARGE‘s consultants are recruited based on several factors some of which are unconventional for such firms. For example, ARGE prefers employees who are either current members of NGOs or who wish to undertake such social commitments outside of work to ensure that its employees are in tune with the social environment, as well as the business environment. • ARGE has been a pioneer in setting a benchmark for corporate volunteerism by asking consultants to devote a full day of each working week for voluntary work in NGOs. This practice then has become a part of the performance evaluation of ARGE consultants, who were asked to report once every two weeks on how they allocated their time to volunteer activities. This practice is in line with ARGE’s use of the Balanced Scorecard methodology to ensure that its strategies are applied throughout the organization. With this methodology, all of the employees’ actions are observed with scorecards and timetables. Also, each ARGE consultant receives one month of training per year to keep abreast of the latest developments in his/her field of specialization. “Helping you succeed.. .” Communication on Progress-2011 ARGE is committed  To add value to the business of its clients,  To provide the right team of experts for each project,  To provide solutions that differentiate its clients in the marketplace, with special emphasis on implementation under local conditions,  To retain its objectivity and independence of its views, and to protect client confidentiality.  Industry expertise in areas such as energy, financial services, textiles, automotives, FMCG, manufacturing, distribution and construction is the fundamental strength of the company.

During the strategy implementation phase, we help companies through our experience in proven Balanced Scorecard Applications. Business Excellence “Doing the Business Right” for determined business targets provides methodologies for efficient and effective use of resources for organizations. Competition parameters in different characteristics in different sectors made efficiency an indispensable working principle. This understanding, demonstrated the importance of process oriented point of view and made holistic view a necessity in the management of organizations. “Helping you succeed.. .” Communication on Progress-2011 As ARGE, our well rounded experience in various sectors, generates value for organizations in process re-engineering and in management quality.

Institution Building The main purpose of our institution building services is to achieve a sustainable organizational structure and culture “to ensure continuity.” We help institutions build sustainable governance systems involving the stakeholders, the board and the top management for public companies as well as family businesses. Our methodologies help implementation of effective use of human resources by development of human resource management systems and development of intellectual capital of organizations with appropriate measurement methods. Shaping the Future Shaping the future requires an approach that is based on common values and principles, regardless of whether it involves the future of an individual, a company, a NGO, a government, or even humanity. Also, we need to realize that the people are the basis of all institutions and we all have multiple roles. Therefore, adhering to these common values and principles enables us to behave consistently in different roles. This understanding requires us to create a positive return for each resource we utilize, regardless of the ownership of that resource; to be fair in sharing the returns; and to continuously improve the management quality in all institutions we are involved with. The basis of this understanding can be found at the intersection of western analytic thinking and eastern spiritual and holistic outlook. It involves the tradition of tolerance prominent in Anatolia, the crossroads of civilizations; creation of value and sharing it with an attitude of “Regard the other, as you regard yourself;” and assuming responsibility for the future. In short, having a meaning in life is making meaningful contributions to others. The basic principles of shaping the future could be summarized as follows: First, those who wish to shape the future have to have a dream about the future and develop thoughts and content “Helping you succeed.. .” Communication on Progress-2011 for the desired future. Real results are achieved not by solving problems, but by catching the opportunities. “Luck favors the prepared mind.” This is the essence of shaping the future. Shaping the future is preparing the mind, the behaviour, and the attitude for the future. Second, the desired future has to create a value. Value creating activities, that utilize the resources effectively, tend to have a higher success rate. Innovation is the engine of development and value creation. Therefore, shaping the future requires innovative thinking and vision. Third, those who wish to shape the future has to have a realistic assessment of the resource needs and how to gain access to them. In particular, one has to realize that resources are not solely, or even mainly, within the organization but rather outside the organization. Therefore, an open mind for cooperation, a commitment to meritocracy, development of the best, and fairness in sharing are the keys to mobilization of adequate resources. Those who focus only within the organization, as it is the familiar territory, are likely to have a limited vision and will be unable to achieve a broad acceptance of the vision and mobilization of resources. Fourth, shaping the future requires a broad understanding of the environment, which in turn can only be achieved by those who have a passion for learning and continuous improvement. Those who are keen observers of the world, of the technological developments, of the resources, and their team are more likely to identify the important steps needed to shape the future. Fifth, shaping the future requires creating trust and effective communication of the vision in order to win the hearts and minds of the decision makers regarding the required resources and those who are subjects of the change initiative. Sixth, we have to realize that shaping the future starts with changing our own current behaviour. Achieving a consistency in thought, values, and behaviour is the best way to gain trust. Assuming responsibility for the future and utilizing all the resources solely for the stated vision is the surest way of mobilizing others’ resources for the vision. Last but not the least, shaping the future requires a long term focus and discipline. It requires practising for a marathon, not for a 100m sprint. Positive attitude and living a balanced life increases longevity and strength to realize the vision. We, at ARGE share our professional experience with seminars, conferences, and strive to put theory into practice by contributing to numerous NGOS. “Helping you succeed.. .” Communication on Progress-2011 We prefer to use “Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership” model in our Communication on Progress Report of 2011 period Implementing the Ten Principles into Taking Action Strategies and in Support of Operations Broader UN Goals and Issues Engaging with the UN Global Compact “Helping you succeed.. .” Communication on Progress-2011 UN GLOBAL INDICATORS for SUSTAINABILITY ARGE APPROACH & PRACTICES COMPACT PRINCIPLES Principle 1: ARGE maintains a favorable working The first six principles compose environment and culture by the most important criteria for us Business should support respecting the right to health care, in terms of selecting our and respect the protection right to work on equal conditions, customers. of internationally right to equality, right to freedom of proclaimed human rights expression, right to liberty and ARGE aims to be a role model security.

We also should add that ARGE sees each project as a new opportunity not only to make business better but also to open new windows, widen directors and managers’ perspectives about environmental and social issues.

We demonstrate our corporate social responsibility, by encouraging all our consultants to devote a full day of each week for voluntary work in NGOs to improve the quality of life in our community with a local, national, and global perspective. ARGE – Partner to the Global Compact and Caring For Climate Initiatives UN Global Compact Principles are accepted as minimum norms at ARGE. The UN Global Compact Principles compose a fundamental part of ARGE’s vision, since ARGE is founded with the vision to strengthen corporate social responsibility. Beyond ARGE’s alignment with the ten UN Global Compact Principles, ARGE’s activities are intended to promote and develop the Corporate Social Responsibility concept and corporate governance principles in companies and NGOs, throughout Turkey. For this purpose, we have some keys for success; • For Value Creation – Utilize skills and/or systems developed to improve management quality by establishing focus in line with corporate values and mission. • For Impact – Cooperate with NGOs and develop their institutional capabilities for better acceptance and mobilization of larger resources. Projects conducted vis-à-vis NGOs are widely accepted rather than just being individual company actions. • For Sustainability – Apply good governance principles to CSR projects and NGOs. • Being creative and proactive in thinking. • Working with the parties that implement the Global Compact. • Working on a project or with a party if there is a potential to add value. • Improve Recognition of Best Practices. One of ARGE’s major tools to promote corporate social responsibility is its partnership with several NGOs that are very effective in their areas of operation in Turkey. As a result of its vast amount of experience in the area of management consultancy, ARGE supports the operations of NGOs in the areas of institution building, strategy formation, and total quality management. In this respect, in line with its mission and vision, ARGE aims to promote corporate social responsibility among other organisations and integrate its management consultancy experience within its projects in partnership with its network of clients and other NGOs. “Helping you succeed.. .” Communication on Progress-2011 CSR Impact ARGE Consultants look for getting big impact too in their volunteer activities. To do so, they take leadership role in volunteer associations such as GC Turkey Network, Corporate Volunteer Associations; developing environmental impact model, micro loan entrepreneur award models; write articles, books to contribute society, give lectures, attend panels. All of these activities had positive impact on tens of thousands of people’s lives. Bringing Management Quality to Turkey Promoting Volunteerism in Corporate Sector ARGE Leading the UN Global Compact Developing a world class Corporate Governance Methodology Six main areas which ARGE has impact on Community 1. Bringing Management Quality to Turkey; ARGE has been instrumental in initiating the National Quality Movement and preparing its clients’ management systems that led Turkish companies to consistently be among the top two European Quality Award winners (EFQM) 2. Promoting Volunteerism in Corporate Sector: It is our policy to encourage our employees to spend one day a week on a pro –bono basis for improving the effectiveness of non – profit organizations. ARGE has been recognized for the impact on the society of its CSR activities: a. At the European Parliament by Generation Europe to be among the top three firms to “Shaping the Future” b. By the European Commission to be the only Turkish company featured in “Responsible Entrepreneurship” publication “Helping you succeed.. .” Communication on Progress-2011 c. As a CSR case study by the Bosphorus University and d. Taken as a “Best Practice CSR’ by CSR4U of Ireland ARGE has also been instrumental in encouraging major firms operating in Turkey to improve their own volunteer efforts by helping establish the Corporate Volunteers Association and developing and running a Volunteer Awards Scheme under the aegis of CVA 3. Leading the UN Global Compact: ARGE has been the first Turkish company to sign the UN Global Compact, and last year our Chairman has assumed the role of National Representative of UN Global Compact. We are currently developing an innovative sectorial approach to increase the number of signatories of the UNGC Local Network. This methodology will be presented at the GC Leaders Summit in New York. 4. Developing a world class Corporate Governance methodology: ARGE values the sustainability of institutions highly and helps them with their governance implementations. Over the last year we have developed a methodology to measure effectiveness of corporate governance and published three books on governance one of which is in English namely, “Boardroom Secrets” that has been widely acknowledged by Davos participants. Also, our Chairman was selected by the Global Corporate Governance Forum to its Private Sector Advisory Group. 5. Developing the Competitiveness Award for increasing the competitiveness level of Turkish Corporations: ARGE consultants took active part in the development, preparation and launch of the Competitiveness Award in Turkey, run by SEDEFED and REF. The award was announced, and will be given in the yearly competitiveness congresses which were supported by ARGE partners since its initiation. This award will be highly instrumental in encouraging and increasing the competitiveness levels of Turkish Companies. “Helping you succeed.. .” Communication on Progress-2011 The reason for our high impact is the approach we take ; 1. First we focus on developing a conceptual framework for the issue at hand 2. Then, we develop content, examples, and case studies to help our network understand the issue well. At this stage we write articles, books, give speeches, and identify and recruit key players who are likely to walk the talk about the issue at hand and act as role models. 3. At this stage we help establish a specific NGO whose sole goal is to promote the issue at hand and gather support to the idea rather than promoting our own efforts or interests. Issue comes before interests of any player. 4. We also focus on the proper governance of the NGO to sustain intellectual and financial support to the issue by a broad group of institutions. Generally, one ARGE consultant serves on the board of the relevant NGO to ensure appropriate guidance and oversight. 5. In order to promote the right kind of behaviour around the issue, we establish a credible award scheme that is judged independently but according to a specific criteria (generally developed by ARGE). Providing feedback to both the winners and losers is a key element of improving future performance. Also a condition for winning the award is to behave as a role model for the issue and allocate resources to promote the issue for at least a year. 6. We measure progress and improve the methodology and our reach through successful implementers to continue to promote the right kind of behaviours and achieves significant development throughout the community Regardless of the content of the issue (Quality, volunteerism, CSR, governance) this methodology helps mobilize the community around desired behaviours and achieves significant development throughout the community. “Helping you succeed.. .” Communication on Progress-2011 ARGE CSR Yearbook 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 NGO Supported Speech about Chariman of ARGE Signed the statement for Leader of GC Türkiye Leader of GC Leader of GC Signed the management – BUMED – CSR in Turkey in has been selected as “Caring for Climate” Network Türkiye Network Türkiye Network ✓ Leader of GC Türkiye Network Member of the Bosphorus Barcelona at one of the “100 Steering Committee Steering Global Compactthe boardof University the Global Global Leaders of activites Committee ✓ Steering Committee activites management of Alumni Compact Tomorrow” by the New approaches for first signatory TEGV (also had Association Summit World Economic expanding network activites from Turkey taken role in its for its Forum for his participation Sectoral Approach establishment in application commitment to (Automobile, 1995) to the improve the Pharma) National management quality Quality throughout the Award community Initiated the ARGE Actively BUMED won NGO management – Corporate Volunteer Corporate Volunteer Corporate Corporate National ‘Developing Civil worked for the National Member of the Awards –initiated and Awards –initiated Volunteer Awards – Volunteer Awards ✓ Corporate Volunteer Awards Society’ project CVA and Quality Award board of contributed to the and contributed to Third Award Quality – case Study at BUMED management of development of the the development of Ceremony –Fourth Award –Fifth Award Ceremony Movement at Ceremony Bogazici TESEV awarding procedure – the awarding Actively worked for Kalder University rewarding best CSR procedure – CVA Performance (Turkish activities rewarding best CSR indicators and Quality Actively worked for CVA activities reporting system Association) Actively worked for designed in 1998.

The Network undertakes any activities considered necessary to promote and support the principles of the Global Compact. The Steering Committee is a multi-stakeholder advisory body that meets minimum twice annually to provide ongoing strategic and policy advice for the implementation of the activities of the Global Compact National Network in Turkey.

Governance is much more than just the structure, processes, and rules of decisionmaking and controls. Good governance is a culture and a climate of Consistency (predictability), Responsibility, Accountability, Fairness, Transparency, and Effectiveness that is Deployed (subsidiarity1) throughout the organization (the ‘CRAFTED’ principles of governance.) With both meanings of the word subsidiarity: (i) As a principle of social doctrine that all social bodies exist for the sake of the “Keys to Governance” 2011 individual and therefore social institutions should not take over what individuals can do by themselves, and (ii) In political “Boardroom Secrets” 2009 systems, the principle of devolving decisions to the lowest practical level, empowerment. “Benchmarking” 2009 Good governance starts with the individual and is applicable in all types of organizations, starting from the family and “Data Mining” 2008 extending throughout the community, company, nongovernmental organizations, governments at all levels, all the “ARGE Corporate Governance way to global institutions. Model”2007 This book elaborates the keys to good governance. What is interesting is that these principles, despite different forms of “Management of Voluntary application, are common regardless of the size, complexity, Organisations”2006 and jurisdiction of an organization. Furthermore, it requires an understanding of “regarding the others, as you regard “Intellectual Capital”2005 yourself” to become prevalent. This understanding transcends the individual’s interests and requires considering not only “Change Management”2004 interests of others that we share our planet with, but also interests of future generations. Good governance is the key to “Strategic View” 2003 effective utilization of our limited resources and not only improves the quality of life, but also ensures sustainability of “Reputation Management”2003 life on our planet. The essence of good governance is ensuring trustworthy “Corporate Social relations between the institution and its stakeholders. Trust Responsibility”2002 is the foundation of sustainable development. Good governance is the key to establish common expectations, to “Value Management”2001 devise effective policies and processes in order to achieve desired performance levels in a sustainable fashion. “Balanced Scorecard”2000 Governance involves the rights and processes of decision making and exercising controls in an organization to achieve mutual goals. In short, governance is about performance. In the new millennium, societies demonstrate and experience highly creative and efficient forms of governance and they learn lessons from them. In this context, a new type of citizenship consciousness emerges. This new citizenship consciousness symbolizes a new identity that acknowledges its own problems, demands higher standards but at the same time plays an active role in the formation and realization of these “Helping you succeed.. .” standards, that creates solutions from within and that forms the necessary structures for this purpose: in short, this new identity has a determination to shape its own future. To establish these structures, consistency is necessary at a global scale. Global consistency requires a convergence on implementing common values in all aspects of life. The solution has to start at grassroots: if transformation and change can be inspired at all levels of society, the process to shape the future begins. The role of those who do not take part in the process will be limited in a future shaped by others. Thus, for sustainability of our institutions we need to consider new ways of involving all stakeholders in governance mechanisms. The basic element of any community or organization, is the individual. Therefore, the domain of governance starts from the individual and extends all the way to all of humanity, global governance. Good governance takes place at four levels in societal life: 1) Individual, 2) Corporate, 3) NGO, and 4) Public Sector, which in turn has three layers: i) Local, ii) National, and iii) Global. At all these levels, if the stakeholders are driven by common values of having an open mind for continuous learning (curiosity); an open heart for sharing (responsibility); a quest for effective utilization of resources for value creation; and accountability, consistency, transparency, and fairness for building trust, then the fundamentals are in place for establishing the rules of engagement for good governance, paving the path for shaping their own future. This book argues that good governance is key to sustainable development of quality of life, the values and behaviors that drive good governance are similar for all types of insititutions, and if we are to shape our own future, we need to start from the individual and our education systems. It is my sincere wish that this book will be useful in the development of good governance culture, throughout the world and contribute to the establishment of trustworthy relationships between all types of organizations and their stakeholders, thereby ensuring effective, sustainable, and equitable resource utilization to improve the quality of life throughout the globe. http://www.amazon.com/Keys-Governance-Strategic-Leadership-Quality/dp/0230278140 “Helping you succeed.. .” International Certification of Capabilities All ARGE partners and managers are qualified quality assessors and certified management consultants (by ICMCI). “The assurance of our future is our passion for learning.” Opportunity of individual development for employees We believe that the more knowledge employees get the more effective ARGE will be in devising solutions to the problems of her clients.

The project aims to develop mechanisms to make civil society able to affect decision making processes. The project has been implemented in 6 pilot cities. Urged the integration of the quality concept in good governance principles and practices. The ongoing project is a good example of developing and maintaining anti-corrupt, transparent, accountable, efficient, sustainable practices in public governance – with a continuous will of generating good quality services KALDER – Turkish Quality Association Chairman of ARGE, started the National Quality Movement in Turkey in 1998 while he served as the Chairman of the Turkish Quality Association (KalDer). National Quality Movement aimed to improve the management effectiveness of private, public, and civil society institutions throughout Turkey by promoting TQM philosophy. The National Quality Movement is probably one of the most effective national programs to extend the use of the EFQM model and could provide an interesting example for other countries as well. This project extended the implementation of the EFQM Excellence Model to all walks of life, from industry to service sectors; from large institutions to very small organizations; from private sector to public sector and even the NGOs. Also, a new award category for NGO’s, has been established for the first time in Europe to promote utilization of good governance principles in the NGOs.
