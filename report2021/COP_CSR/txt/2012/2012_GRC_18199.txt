As of April 2012, the cement business (which includes LAVA) has been brought together with the aggregates and concrete businesses of Lafarge in Greece to operate as one business. This is an organizational change that is taking place throughout the Lafarge Group globally; the legal structure is unchanged. In the light of this and to assist our stakeholders follow our progress through the transition to one business, we have included in this report where possible information about the activities and sustainability performance of the aggregates and concrete business during 2011. Graphs and tables, while continuing to show the performance of the cement business (up to and including 2011 and including progress against targets), also include where possible data for the aggregates and concrete business for 2011 (denoted by A&C). This assists us and our stakeholders in establishing the baseline for consolidated reporting in the future, encompassing what is now one business in Greece. 4 Sustainability Report | 2011 | HERACLES Introduction from the CEO Thank you for taking the time to look at our 2011 Sustainability Report. This is the fourth annual report on sustainability that we have produced and is intended, like the previous ones, to help our stakeholders consider and comment on our actions and progress. Since the last report, there has been no change in our commitment to sustainability. But there has been a further worsening in the economic circumstances in Greece and this naturally affects us all. Two things in particular concern me. Poor morale and worries about personal circumstances can have an adverse affect on concentration at work increasing risks of accidents. Second, economic stress can put pressure on values and ethics. I am absolutely determined that, whatever the circumstances, the values and principles that underpin this business shall be upheld. This report is being published as “One Lafarge” reflecting our new organization. This new organization will improve the offer we make to our customers, make better use of our expertise and reveal opportunities that we may have missed in the past. Specifically in Greece, with a market of much reduced size, it is even more important that we reshape our business appropriately and respond to the reality of circumstances, while continuing to manage our employees fairly and with respect. Looking more specifically at our sustainability program, in most areas we are on track but in some we face difficulties. Often this is where progress is not only dependent on our actions. For instance, we brought on stream the new cement grinding process at Halkis (see page 25) but have not sustained earlier progress in reducing CO2 emissions overall. In large part this is a function of market demand for different types of product but we would also make more progress if we were able to make more beneficial use of alternative fuels, as happens in other EU countries. As for A&C I remain very positive about the scope for value-added products in the future; our aggregates and concrete division have already made very good progress and I look forward to some flagship projects in 2012. It was a small but nevertheless significant step to move to new headquarters in 2011. Their modern and efficient style symbolizes the future of this business. And the opportunity to make our art collection available to the public was an additional benefit which I hope stakeholders will appreciate. We continue to welcome comments on these and other aspects of our sustainability program and I look forward to another year of progress in 2012.

The Risk and Audit Committee continued to meet every four months throughout 2011; the risk assessment process, led by the internal audit manager and involving the senior managers of the business, was especially focused on fraud and internal control. Sustainability There has been no change in leadership, in 2011 or subsequently, and the Chief Executive continues to provide overall direction with the backing of the Board and the Lafarge Group.

In cement, the declining domestic market obliged us to rely more on exporting cement to supply overseas markets, such as those in North Africa. However, international markets were also limited and our exports were 27% lower than in 2010. We continue to believe that Greece has in the medium-term a stable domestic market for cement and that we can best thrive in that market by increasing productivity and efﬁciency, optimizing production costs, and produce cement products that are lower CEMENT in CO2 emissions than our competitors’.

Local communities – our role Local communities are a very special category of stakeholder, not least because they are where our employees and many of our customers and supplier live, and because our operations tend to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the communities where they are based. This is especially when, as is often the case, our operation is in a remote area where its contribution to the local community is particularly important. We maintain the view that to be a constructive inﬂuence, we should be focused. So we continue to concentrate our efforts on the three chosen topics: health and safety, education and the environment, and local infrastructure. Alongside these community contributions, employment and secondary business activity generated by our operations and the payment of license fees also form a signiﬁcant part of our socio-economic footprint. 22 Sustainability Report | 2011 | HERACLES consultation LOCAL CONSULTATION Community investment COMMITEES MAIN TOPICS IN 2011 (Source of support, in thousands of Euros, 2011) ...cement manufacturing process and impacts during the 346 / 63.3% 42 / 7.8% production stage ...how the monitoring of emissions and of compliance with limits is done ...the socioeconomic impact of the plant ...corporate social policy ...the strategy and priorities of the plant ...the management of quarries and their impact on biodiversity ...water management 158 / 28.9% The above were topics proposed TOTAL 546 th. euros by the communities for discussion and presented in detail by Corporate, LAVA A&C Cement plants & terminals the plant management teams.

We tackle climate Climate change by making our processes more energy efficient and developing lower-CO2 products. Alternative fuels offer potential but require support from local authorities and communities. change Cement and climate change To understand our strategy it is important to note that CO2 is emitted from limestone when it is thermally processed to make clinker (the raw material for cement) and from fossil fuels used to fuel that process. Hence we can reduce emissions per unit of production by optimizing the process, by substituting for fossil fuels with alternatives and by substituting for clinker with lower-CO2 materials.

Usage was 14.5% (and about three-quarters of this was recovered materials) compared to 10.2% in 2010; given the impact of the ﬁnancial crisis on production levels in industry, this is a satisfactory outcome.

The explanation lies in the balance of domestic and 3,382 export sales. In 2011, as in 2010 but to an even 2,997 greater extent, domestic sales declined and the demand for lower-CO2 products declined within that 2,129 market. We were therefore obliged to rely more heavily on exports which are dominated by clinker and clinker-based, high CO2 products. This market-dependent effect has outweighed the beneﬁts of improved operational performance, which has 1990 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 reduced energy consumption per unit of cement produced by 2% compared to 2010.

The project has been very successful. Fugitive dust emissions from the stockpiles are almost entirely eliminated; these emissions are estimated to be reduced by 100 metric tons per year. Because trucks and loaders are no longer used, noise has been reduced and our people no longer have to work outside in all weathers. All these beneﬁts are good for the business. But as importantly, there has been a marked reduction in the nuisance caused, as reported by neighboring homeowners and businesses.

Industrial ecology applies this principle to human activity, making the most efﬁcient use possible of by products and waste. Progress in 2011 We ran a “Clean and Tidy” campaign at all our cement sites. This was targeted at employees, contractors and others; we aimed to raise awareness of best-practice in waste handling and demonstrate how a clean and tidy site beneﬁts everyone.

HERACLES | 2011 | Sustainability Report 35 REPORTING AND PERFORMANCE Our business is shaped by the needs of our customers. In 2011 we enhanced the choices that we offer our customers to ensure we meet those needs in difficult economic circumstances. These enhancements are also part of our tranCustomers sition to a single country organization. We continued to engage with customers to improve safety for their and our people in the course of our work. Products – for the future We know that to thrive in the future, in circumstances which will be very different from those we have inherited, we must be more focused on the enduser of our products; cement is no longer just a commodity business. To complete our bagged products range of grey (Athlos, Basis) and white cements, ‘’HERACLESTM IV32.5R’’ grey in 25 and 50kg bags was launched in 2011 as a cement for general applications. This was welcomed and achieved high market penetration. At the same time, householders in Greece face difﬁcult economic circumstances and the DIY market, though small at present, is set to grow. Adapting to the needs of this market has been challenging for us, despite the small scale. Developing the right product required us to address customers’ needs such as size of bag, ease of handling, etc. and retailers’ requirements for bar-coding and in-store handling. Our packaging is also a differentiating factor in this market; the paper packaging we have chosen is recyclable and sourced from sustainable forests. Closer to our customers We continued to host customer visits to our sites during the year; such visits are an opportunity on both sides to exchange views and they complement the information that we obtained through our 2011 market survey of ready-mix customers.
