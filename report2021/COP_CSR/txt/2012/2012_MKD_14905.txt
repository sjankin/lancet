Visit of Minister of Economy in Makpetrol’s biofuel plant In 2009, Minister of Economy, Fatmir Besimi visited one of the factories of Makpetrol, for the production of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport. Production and use of biofuels is a global trend to replace the consumption of liquid fossil fuels. This trend is growing fast, because it reduces dependence on fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gases and make the rural areas that produce raw materials (rape, wheat, etc.) more useful. This is of great and strategic importance for our country, especially the fact that Macedonia dosent has its own source of crude oil and natural gas, but there are unexploited opportunities in agriculture. Following the European Directive 2003/30, to promote use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport, Makpetrol AD Skopje is positioned as the first manufacturer and distributor of biodiesel mixture of biodiesel and fossil diesel in Macedonia. The first bioplant was build with production capacity of 30,000 tones of biodiesel per year biodiesel with witch was done the only possible vertical integration in the core activity of raw material to fuels. With investment from own sources for realization of the plant to produce biodiesel Makpetrol AD enters the field and other biofuels, while in the area directed towards wider application of renewable energy sources. These business efforts to “Makpetrol” are twofold in terms of encouraging domestic production of agricultural raw materials, and simultaneously export the same. Thus is set the basis for engagement in the next decade. Conclusion We continue our commitment to communication and partnership with all stakeholders in an open, systematic and transparent way. We believe that the community began to recognize our efforts and pleased that during the year received a number of prestigious awards and it is from our stakeholders. Shield our environment by supporting and contributing to the welfare of our employees, local communities and society in general.
