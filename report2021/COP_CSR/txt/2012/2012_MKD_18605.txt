Global Contract-communication and progress Page 5 / 16 Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect protection of international proclaimed human's rights. Principle 2: To provide their not collaboration in violating of human's rights Principles: 1 and 2 that is human's rights protection are implemented in Business plan for 2011 and 2012 where are anticipated resources and systems for instruction and specialization of employees. Practical action I The elements stated previously are contained in the annual report for 2011 through the letter to shareholders for estimation for 2011; Report by the Supervisory; report by the independent auditors; balanced state; statement of income; consolidated balance sheet; consolidated statement of income; parameters of profitability; sale of ready mix product and etc. LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS Estimation of operation in 2011 Wished for a better 2011 than the difficult 2010. That was realized, but more on paper than real, taking into account the fact that the crisis in the world, region and in the country has deepened and continued with more fiercely pace, especially in the part of the liquidity of the company. What were our plans and what we realized Realization and profit • The plan was realized at domestic market by 21% more than 2010 and foreign market with 5% more than 2010. • Total sales of domestic and foreign market was 4.490.062-€ and is larger for 12% in comparison with 2010. • The domestic market participated with 46 %, and foreign with 54% of total sale • The tax profit is 476.201 -€ or 9,93% while for 2010 was 2, 8 % or 127.967 € Realization in 2011 according 2010 was greater in countries: Macedonia, Serbia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Albania, Iran. The plan for 2011 was exceeded in Macedonia, Serbia and Russia, while in all other countries we have a lower realization than planned. Global Contract-communication and progress Page 6 / 16 We have finished the Project Western Europe Western China in Kazakhstan in 2011. We've built our hopes on improving the liquidity , but because of payments problems which are still not resolved, that did not happen. We had problems with collection in almost all countries and they exist until now and become deeper , except Kosovo. Collection and in debt ness • Increased distribution in 2011 compared to 2010 in terms of high illiquidity at domestic and also at foreign market has additionally worsen the present difficult collection in the construction industry • Insolvency оn market endangering the company's operations in 2011. That caused many drastically increased financial expenses for bank credits and loans, delay the payments to suppliers as a result of increased interests, rate variations and commissions. The barter has returned on domestic market as substitute for cash payment, which we thought was in the past. Investments independently of difficult year, ADING continues to invest: • For technological lines in the factory in Skopje 154.166 € Salaries and incentives • Crisis measures continued in 2011 with reduced salary for 10-15%, but they were regularly settled. All employees have got the hot mill, transportation and annual recourse. Organizational and personnel changes The most significant changes in organizational and personnel structure was made in IVEST A company. The manager was changed and number of employees halved due to bad financial results, after which nine employees left the company contractually. The company was reorganized and it was been appointed new manager. Better results have already been observed, but still there are many inherited problems from the previous composition, such as: outstanding claims and unsettled obligations towards subcontractors and suppliers In BCA a young economist commercialist was employed and one architect engineer on the position Head of Sales, and other displacement of employees of the business system. In Biro Proekt there were three new employees. Two employees was transferred from Biro Proekt to the BCA. Global Contract-communication and progress Page 7 / 16 In Ading were employed three new young engineers − technologists in the Technical department and Institute, 4 employees contractually left the firm, and Lead Engineer-Manager, Goce Petrusevski from Quality Department has passed away. Shares and movement of the same In 2011, stock market was dormant or was reduced to a minimum. Stocks listed on the Macedonian Stock Market and their prices moved from 300 to 400 MKD per share.

How we started in 2012 The year started with bad results. Half of January and the whole February has not been operative, that which is something could not memorized in history of Ading. Reason was force majeure i.e unfavorable winter conditions in the region and in Russia. Combining with high illiquidity, business additionally has been complicated and sales has drop more on the foreign market. The drop of sales was also influenced by tighten sales of final products to distributors and customers which debts to Ading, as well as unrealized deliveries to Kazakhstan, and increased sanctions towards Iran, where last year joint venture of Ading and partners from Iran has successfully started to work the new factory. That has slowed down the growth of sales there with many additional financial problems which should be solved this year. Hard year is expected, and hope that the global economic crisis and recession will loose and will return to more peaceful and more stable situation, which will enable us to continue the company's upward dynamic. We believe that young engineering team with our experience will do that Ading is, will be and remain ingredient of each construction in Macedonia, the region and around the world where we are present.
