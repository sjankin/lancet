Bording A/S Communication On Progress 2012 Brief description of nature of business F.E. Bording A/S The F.E. Bording Group is a Scandinavian service business with origin in the graphical business. The transformation from primarily being a printing house to becoming a service business has been a necessary part of being able to innovate, develop and survive on the fast developing global market. Today our focus and competences are on developing new intelligent graphic and digital communication solutions to our customers. COMPANY DETAILS F.E. Bording A/S CVR-nr.: 16229415 Global Compact contact person: Turbinevej 4-6 Established: April 12, 1918 Ina Willumsen 2730 Herlev Domicile: Gladsaxe Communications Assistant Phone.: +45 7011 5011 Number of employees: 256 iwi@bording.dk www.febording.dk Sector: Graphic and digital communication Member of Global Compact since: info@bording.dk September 9, 2009 Side 3 af 12 F.E. Bording A/S Communication On Progress 2012 Statement of support Different focus increases the relevance As a Scandinavian Group with our division in Bangladesh, Bording vista Ltd. and our Lithotech-Bording division, selling election materials to third world countries, the attention on human rights, labor rights, environment and anti-corruption differ. In Denmark, Sweden and Norway it is first and foremost the environment that is prioritized and found relevant, whereas in Bording Vista Ltd. and Lithotech-Bording it is important to send clear signals on humanand labour rights as well as anti-corruption. In the year to come we will continue to back the 10 principles of Global Compact and commit ourselves to making a difference in human rights, labor rights, environment and anti-corruption whenever we have an opportunity. Slum School Project in Bangladesh – an investment in the global future In our work with CSR in 2012 we have continued our support to the project for children in Bangladesh. We believe in the importance of education and we believe that learning is a key factor in strengthening an individual’s capabilities as well as the economic growth of the third world countries. In many European countries we take education for granted, but for so many children around the world an education is out of reach. Bording believes that a step towards investing in the future is investing in children through education. Doing business in Bangladesh has made it even more evident to Bording that a large proportion of the population survives in poverty and that lack of education and unemployment reproduce poverty, hunger and disease. To help break this curve of poverty Bording has been part of two Slum School Projects in Bangladesh in collaboration between The Copenhagen Post, Rotary International, Bording Vista and F.E. Bording. The first project made it possible to distribute teaching material to a local Slum School in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Studies show that knowledge of language in both reading and writing helps to ensure a strong cultural self-understanding. Furthermore, the English language helps to support children in the long term to succeed in international context. We have learned that teaching material is in short supply in many places and therefore the material can be downloaded for free on our website with the help from local Rotary Clubs. (To read more please visit: http://www.febording.dk/fe-bording/download-free-education-material) The second project arose in the light of the fact that many of the children in the local school were forced to drop out of school in order to provide food for themselves. In order to keep the children in school, the school must give the children a school dinner. The Bording Group and Rotary Copenhagen raised EUR 10,800 to support the school dinner project. This amount will cover school dinners for 800 children for three months.

Side 4 af 12 F.E. Bording A/S Communication On Progress 2012 Bording’s view on Corporate Social Responsibility Bording believes that responsibility means taking on responsibility for making a difference when we have an opportunity to do so. Responsibility also means that we and our suppliers are responsible for each other, for our customers and the environment. Bording and the principles With a history as primarily a printing house, Bording has thought environmental concerns and opportunities in to our working procedures for a long time. Our long focus on the environment means that we have a unique basis for suggesting and to some extent demanding improvements to our suppliers. The Bording Group realizes that we can not change the whole world, but by looking at Global Compact as a strategic framework for our work with social, ethical and environmental responsibility, we believe that we take an important step in the right direction. In Bording we continue to see CSR and our support to Global Compact as an opportunity to work constructively with the challenges that we come across in our business operations. The strength of the UN’s Global Compact is that the 10 principles are built upon internationally recognized conventions. The principles help us match expectations when we do business across national and cultural borders. Furthermore, it gives us a strategic tool when it comes to sending our customers a clear signal on responsibility and our non-tolerance towards corruption. To a division such as Lithotech-Bording, who serves as a supplier of election material in third world countries, where corruption is a part of the everyday life, we believe it is important to send this clear signal.

Bording A/S Communication On Progress 2012 Bording’s CSR hierarchy Since we joined Global Compact, we have worked on getting an overview of our current achievements. In this context we have drawn up a CSR hierarchy, which can be seen below. The ethical guidelines of Bording As a Scandinavian Group we see globalisation as an opportunity to expand our market and to participate in international projects. But associated with these opportunities are the risks and challenges of doing business across different legal and cultural traditions. Bording has acknowledged the risk and challenges, which together with the increasing demands from the world for guidelines have lead to a process of making our own set of ethical guidelines. We have combined UN’s 10 principles about human rights, labour rights, environment and anti-corruption with setting a good example, honesty and trustworthiness and have come up with a set of ethical guidelines, which have become an integrated part of our daily operations. Bording’s Code of Conduct (ethical guidelines) is meant as a guide to our management, employees, customers, suppliers and other cooperative partners about our behavior and values in the Bording Group. Bording has the goal always to follow the highest ethical standards and to reduce the impact our business has on the surrounding environment as much as possible. At the same time we value trustworthiness and honesty more than short-term earnings. Side 6 af 12 F.E.
