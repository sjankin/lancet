In the 1960s we mapped all the hydro-energy resources in Minas Gerais, radically changing the paradigms regarding the construction of plants in the country. In the following decades, we expanded our frontiers and today we have a presence in 22 states in Brazil, in the Distrito Federal and in Chile. We have achieved the position of the largest electric energy distributor in the country, the second largest transmission company and the third largest in terms of generation. We have shareholders in 44 countries and have built a solid group, consisting of 114 companies and 15 consortia. We have grown with consistent financial management, committed to the well-being of society and investing in clean energies. And the world has given us something back: we have been listed in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 12 straight years. But, as we have been innovators from the very beginning, the only things we hold onto from the past are experience and pride. We are moved by the things that come next. They are the cities of the future, with their smart energy grids. They are nonpolluting electric cars. They are renewable matrices, conscientious consumption, environmental actions that go beyond simple compensation. For innovators like us, what matters is thinking ahead and doing it for the world. 2.8 Market Share três Marias in the Brazil: 12% in electric energy distribution. 7% in electric energy generation. 2011 Highlights 13% in electric energy transmission. 25% of free consumers.

Conceived in partnership with the Fundação Centro de Pesquisas e Desenvolvimento em Telecomunicações – CPqD (Telecommunications Research and Development Center Foundation) and the Fundação para Inovações Tecnológicas – FITec (Foundation for Technological Innovations), it is one of the most ambitious Smart Grid architecture research and development projects in Latin America and will support the analysis of the feasibility of implementing it throughout its concession area. Smart Grids are based on the intense use of sensors in the network that allow, for example, for automatic reconfiguration, the automatic reestablishment of electric energy following an interruption and greater client participation in the management of the energy they consume, thus contributing towards a reduction in losses and increased energy efficiency. The city of Sete Lagoas was chosen as the location for the 2011 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT pilot project. The evaluations made there will help the development of smart grid models that will support the strategic decisions regarding the large scale implementation in coming years.

Tariffs Cemig Distribuição As it operates in a regulated market, Cemig Distribuição S.A. (Cemig D) has its tariffs regulated and monitored by the ANEEL. In addition to the definition of the tariffs, the Agency also determines the costs associated with each type of consumer, and these costs are utilized to calculate the different tariffs for the different voltages consumed. During this process of establishing the tariffs, Cemig D works in defense of the Company together with ANEEL in order to recognize the costs and investments necessary in order to render quality services with ample availability. The revenues to be collected through the tariffs contemplate two types of costs: manageable and nonmanageable costs. The manageable costs correspond to the operational costs of distribution, remuneration and the invested capital reintegration rate. The nonmanageable costs are those costs that the distribution company only transfers to other agents in the sector, such as energy purchases and transportation (transmission) and sector charges. Other factors that also have a direct bearing on the calculation of the tariff are the size of the distribution company and the average consumption by its clients. Cemig has a large concession area (578,400 km2) and the longest network in South America (over 460,000 km), which is a result of the large size of the State of Minas Gerais. This translates into a need for an increase in the volume of investments and high operation and maintenance costs for the distribution lines and networks. In addition, the average monthly consumption of Cemig’s residential clients is very low at around 115 kWh. The tariff is also used as a social and economic incentive instrument, since some consumer classes benefit from subsidies and thus pay an energy tariff that is below cost. This is the case with low income consumers. For low income residential consumers with consumption of up to 30 kWh per month, the benefit results in a discount of 59 approximately 65%; for consumption between 31 kWh and TRANSMISSION LINES – IRAPÉ 100 kWh the discount is 40%; for monthly consumption non-manageable cost readjustment index is the IGPM of between 101 kWh and 220 kWh the discount is 10%; (General Index of Market Prices), but an “X” factor is eCONOMIC dIMENSION above 220 kWh of consumption there is no discount. deducted from this to capture productivity, in accordance In addition to the low income segment, the following with the logic of the price cap regulatory model. consumers also benefit from discounted tariffs: rural consumers, those that use energy for irrigation; water, In April of 2011 a readjustment of 6.61% was sewage and sanitation companies and free consumers authorized for residential consumers and for the other that purchase energy through incentive programs. medium and high voltage consumers the readjustment was 9.02%. Generally speaking, the average impact Cemig D had more than two million consumers classified for all consumer classes was 7.24%. as low income residential in 2010 that benefitted from the subsidized tariff for this class, which results in a The factors that most heavily impacted the higher tariff for the other low voltage consumers.

The concession contracts include three modalities of tariff adjustment: In accordance with the Federal Constitution, Cemig is obligated to collect taxes directly on the consumers’ bills Ordinary Tariff Adjustment and transfer these funds to the competent authorities. This occurs every five years, when the economicThe PIS/PASEP (Social Integration Program/Public Servant financial balance of the utility company is Asset Development Program) and COFINS (Contribution investigated.

Since the towards maintaining the federal government’s social signing of the concession contract, Cemig has programs, along with those aimed at workers. undergone two revisions with the next one scheduled for 2013. The ICMS (Tax on the Circulation of Goods and Services) is a state tax and is levied directly on the consumers’ Extraordinary Tariff Revision bills and transferred wholly to the state government.

Special Project Highlight: Go Away, Golden mussel! Since 2004, Cemig has endeavored to publicize information on the golden mussel and the ways it proliferates in the communities where the Company operates. The goal is to undertake actions to monitor, control and prevent the spread of the golden mussel and create a sanitary barrier to stop or minimize the impacts caused by infestations of this invasive species on its generating units, on the environment and on the population. Monitoring, prevention, control and research activities have been undertaken by the Company by means of the projects funded by Aneel, about R$ 6 million will be invested in four years of research. Further information about the Golden Mussel and others aquatic species, please access: http:// www.cemig.com.br/sites/en/Sustainability/Programs/EnvironmentalPrograms/Biodiversity/Pages/ AquaticSpecies.aspx In 2011 Cemig ran the “Go Away, golden mussel!” campaign for about a thousand primary school students from schools neighboring the São Simão Power Plant, on the border between Minas Gerais and Goiás states. The objective of the campaign was to teach people about the main problems the golden mussel causes for the population and the environment, as well as to disseminate ways of preventing this invasive aquatic species from spreading, informing them of how the mussel colonies block up the water supply catchment system. Apart from the students who attended, the campaign involved the riverside community living downstream from the São Simão Power Plant. Experts from Cemig spoke to fishermen about the importance of disinfecting their boats and the fishing gear.
