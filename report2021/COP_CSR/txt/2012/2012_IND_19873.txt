Human Rights Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed Human Rights CWC as a business organization, all the way, supports and respects the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights also which are more or 6 less akin to the principles of fundamental rights enunciated in the Constitution of India. Principle 2 Make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses In businesses, due to various errors & omissions, one is always amenable to any type of administrative/economic grievance. Such employees have full and free access to the CEO or the concerned in-house authority for solution. For redressal of grievances, a well-established grievance handling mechanism is also in function, under the control of Director of Public Grievances. In such processes, the employee is given full opportunity to protect himself, by following the laid down investigation mechanism, as per the need of natural justice. Besides this the grievances of employees which are uploaded online in the website www.pgportal.gov.in of Govt. of India and also the grievances forwarded by the Administrative Ministry/Deptt. of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARFPG) are also taken care of. A large number of warehousing services/operations are carried out manually and are out-sourced. The CWC, while protecting interests of its own employees, also emphasizes protection of legitimate rights of such work-force as a Principal Employer, under Contract Labour (Abolition & Regulation Act) 1970 and Rules 1971 made thereunder. The Contractor makes the payment of wages to the Contract Labour in the presence of an authorized representative of the Principal Employer. The very objective is to ensure payment of minimum wages without fail. In addition, the labourers have the facility of canteen, safe drinking water, rest room, first aid, etc. The Constitution of India and the other laws of land ensure noncomplicity to all the human right abuses. CWC is no exception to it. 7 Businesses in Other Action/Activities undertaken during 2011 for internalizing GCP principles • Under the Farmers Extension Service Scheme, which is being operated since 1978-79 as a part of its wider social responsibility, trained technical experts in scientific storage of foodgrains visit the villages and educate the farmers to save their hard earned produce from various enemies in storage by adopting simple and scientific methods for which practical inputs are given, addressing the principle of “Promotion of Education/Technology”. • During the year, through 290 Rural Based Warehouses, 5396 villages were visited by technical experts and 2.26 lakh farmers were contacted/ educated on safe storage of foodgrains at farm level and post harvest loss minimization. • The scheme for providing rebate of 30% towards storage charges was introduced to the farmers for keeping their stocks in Warehouses, in keeping with the principle of “Promotion of Education/ Technology”. • Warehousing (Development & Regulations) Act, 2007 (WDR Act, 2007) The new Act “Warehousing (Development & Regulations) Act, 2007” (WDR Act, 2007) has been notified in the Official Gazette of the Government of India which provides that the Warehouse Receipt issued by a registered warehouse will enjoy status of a fully negotiable instrument and will increase liquidity in rural areas.
