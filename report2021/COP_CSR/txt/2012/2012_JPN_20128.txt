This is the question we ask ourselves every day at Konica Minolta. Our determination to answer it well drives us to pursue original ideas… and to find ways to give shape to them that society recognizes as valuable innovations. This is not only how we create and deliver outstanding products and services, but also the inspiration for everything else we do as a company. “Giving Shape to Ideas” is the essence of what the Konica Minolta does—it is who we are, and it is our commitment to the world. As always, we will continue to create innovative solutions in all of our wide-ranging businesses as we strive to ensure a future of true prosperity for all of our stakeholders. 2650*(40563;(*:99,769;  Message from the President Creating Valuable Innovations and Growing Together with Stakeholders “Giving Shape to Ideas” to Keep Growing with a Changing Society In recent years, the world in which we all live and work has undergone drastic changes, including sweeping changes in the global environment and economy. As it turned out, the first year of our Medium Term Business Plan, “G Plan 2013,” fiscal 2011, was a year of trial and tribulation. Immense natural disasters such as the Great East Japan Earthquake and ensuing tsunami and the floods in Thailand threatened the very core of people’s way of life. They also caused interruptions in the supply chain which brought various industries to a halt. Many unpredictable situations remain, not the least of which are the European debt crisis and the dramatically high yen. We are determined to remain essential to society and stay worthy of its support in these hard times. We recognize this requires very fine attunement to the unceasing change the world is going through. We must correctly identify what tomorrow’s society will need and how we can provide unique value to meet that need. In September 2011, we announced our new brand communication message to the world: “Giving Shape to Ideas.” The message articulates our commitment to taking on the challenges faced by our customers and the broader society and giving shape to the ideas that will lead to solutions. This is the commitment shared by every person at Konica Minolta; it is our promise to stakeholders, and we pledge to make it a reality. We hope that this message will better communicate our vision to stakeholders and help make their ideas real and bring their hopes within reach. We are certain that our effort will create new value that inspires both the businesses and lives of people around the world. Building Businesses which Provide Unique Value to the World The best opportunity for Konica Minolta to put into practice the concept of “Giving Shape to Ideas” is by developing and delivering valuable products, services, and solutions. To ensure our business is truly valuable to the world, we are determined to understand the problems our customers have and propose uniquely effective solutions for them. At the same time, we will expand the technologies we have  2650*(40563;(*:99,769; developed over the years in order to create innovative to do the same. Our approach to “CSR procurement” insists products that make a direct contribution to the broader on respect for human rights and workplace health and issues the whole world faces. safety, aiming for constant improvement throughout the To accelerate this process, Konica Minolta undertook a supply chain. major structural reorganization in April 2012. First, our We recognize that, in addressing these issues from a business in TAC film for LCD polarizers was merged with our global perspective and with flexible approaches, it is new businesses in organic light emitting diode (OLED) important to have a diverse workforce including a wide lighting and functional film (barrier or heat insulation film), range of nationalities and both women and men. This is why establishing a new company called Konica Minolta we have established an HR system that is focused on making Advanced Layers, Inc. We also consolidated our industrial the most of our global workforce. sensing business with our optics business (including pickup To facilitate our efforts to implement these goals, in lenses for optical disks), calling the new firm Konica Minolta April 2012 we consolidated the CSR Promotion Group and Optics, Inc. The goal of these organizational changes was to the Corporate Communications & Branding Group in a new leverage technological synergies and optimize sales efforts organization that reports directly to me. This organizational to strengthen our business potential to create new value. change reflects how Konica Minolta sees social responsibility—as We constantly strive to improve our customer an integral part of corporate management. Under the new relationship management, aiming to increase customer organization, we will further integrate our business and CSR satisfaction and maintain the strong relationships we have activities, while also enhancing communication so that our built with customers, and pursuing further growth by stakeholders can better understand our approach. building even deeper bonds. We are working not only to deliver the “essential quality” that everyone naturally expects, but also to offer “appealing quality” that goes Continuing to Provide Truly Valuable beyond customer expectations. Every company in the Innovations for Customers and Society Group is implementing its own specific steps to achieve these goals. We believe that the key to our growth is focusing on providing products and services that are truly valuable to customers and society. Traditional product development Addressing CSR Issues as a theory may have emphasized “first in the world” or “best in Global Corporation the world,” but if the results are not considered valuable innovations by customers and society, we have missed When we talk about “Giving Shape to Ideas,” we are not just the point. talking about our business activities: we apply the concept Our goals are to solve the problems faced by customers to every effort we make to fulfill our social responsibilities. As and society and to provide value that exceeds expectations. a global corporation, Konica Minolta sees it as the Group’s “Giving Shape to Ideas” is the message that calls each responsibility to help solve the various problems people face member of the worldwide Konica Minolta team to live up to around the world. these goals. I request your support as we strive to reach our One example is our Eco Vision 2050, a set of long-term goal of becoming a global company that is truly supported goals that includes helping to stop global warming, by and considered vital to the entire world. promoting resource circulation, and preserving biodiversity. The cornerstone to achieving these goals is our Green Products Certification System. This system drives our efforts to create and offer environmentally responsible products and reduce their environmental impact throughout the entire product life cycle from development, to production, Masatoshi Matsuzaki sales, and recycling. Konica Minolta not only holds itself to President and CEO these high standards, but also expects its business partners Konica Minolta Holdings, Inc. 2650*(40563;(*:99,769;  We want to print no more than the needed number of materials at any given time. Integrated Digital Printing Management System Expands the Potential of On-Demand Printing Stanford University in the U.S. was grappling with the problem of how to efficiently supply educational materials. Konica Minolta provided a comprehensive solution that included a digital printing system, the Printgroove application that allows consolidated printing management and 24-hour service via the web, and its proprietary security system. By linking to the Stanford Intellectual Property Exchange, a system developed by the university that allows the transfer of research papers and other files while protecting copyrights and patents, students are now able to purchase the educational materials they require on demand at low cost in the form of printed materials or digital files. Highlight in 2011 Giving Shape to Ideas, Bringing Innovation for the Future Konica Minolta continues to give shape to a wide variety of new ideas designed to provide solutions to the challenges its customers and the broader society face. *The term “Konica Minolta” is used in this section in place of the names of individual business companies or related companies. Remote Image g Diagnosis Via Data Sharing Service I wish I could get a medical exam from a Konica Minolta Aomori Prefectural specialist at my local clinic. Data Center Central Hospital Hospital A Advanced Solutions for Networking among Regional Medical Institutions Networking Hospital B Collaboration The northern part of Aomori prefecture in Japan faces a shortage Box of physicians with specialist knowledge about brain disorders. Konica Minolta helped the Neurocerebral Center at Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital to build a network of 10 hospitals in the Hospital C Remote area, which are now using the network for remote image diagnosis. Image Diagnosis The system was made possible by Konica Minolta’s Infomity Collaboration Box Service, a networking solution designed to enable medical institutions to share medical exam data. It allows diagnostic images of patients suffering from strokes and head injuries to be sent to and interpreted by specialists, making it possible to quickly decide if the patient needs to be transported to a hospital equipped to perform the necessary surgery.  2650*(40563;(*:99,769; We need to manage worldwide document output more efficiently. Optimized Print Services Help Solve Problems for Global Corporations Global corporations are pursuing ways to address the cost and security issues of the office equipment used in their offices around the world. To help them achieve these goals, Konica Minolta provides Optimized Print Services (OPS) that fully manage office equipment operations, optimize equipment setups and improve operating efficiency. These services are employed by the German automobile manufacturer BMW, for example, to efficiently operate and manage a total of 6,800 bizhub systems of multi-functional peripherals at offices and production sites all over Europe, helping the company to improve efficiency and information security in running office equipment on a large scale. I sure wish there was a quieter printer. New Technology Has Made MFP Sound d More “Pleasant,” Providing for a More Comfortable Office Environment Konica Minolta has been working hard to create quieter MFPs. Since 2007, the company has been involved in joint research with Kyushu University in Japan aimed not only at reducing absolute noise level, but also at cutting the particular kinds of noise that people find uncomfortable to make the sound emitted by MFPs more pleasant. The research analyzes the noise emitted when MFPs are in operation using techniques borrowed from the study the train noise, and then identifies the specific materials and structures that cause the objectionable noise to enable specific improvements to control it. Based on user reports that the MFP noise was less bothersome,* the company included its improvements in all MFP models to be launched in fiscal 2012 and beyond. *Konica Minolta internal survey KONICA MINOLTA CSR REPORT 2012 6 Highlight in 2011 Giving Shape to Ideas, Bringing Innovation for the Future I wish we could dye beautiful fabric more quickly. Inkjet Textile Printing Enables High Productivity, High Quality Prints In inkjet textile printing, the designs are created on computers and sent to a printer, making textile printing plates used in conventional printing unnecessary and significantly reducing the time it takes to deliver product. By spraying only a few picoliters of printing ink accurately on the fabric, inkjet textile printing can easily create high-quality prints and achieve effects such as color gradation, fine lines, and overlaid patterns that were very difficult to do using conventional printing methods. The Nassenger PRO 1000 printer, launched in 2011, boasts extremely high productivity with the ability to print 1,000 m² of fabric per hour when operating at maximum capacity. With its low environmental impact, high quality, and high productivity, demand is high in fashion and fabric centers around the world such as Italy, Turkey, and India. I wish I could experience cultural treasures without traveling so far. Cultural Treasure Archives Projected on Domed Screens Just Like the Real Thing Digital archives storing the images of cultural treasures such as art works and structures help preserve the originals while allowing more people to enjoy them. Konica Minolta used the imaging technology it has developed in its planetarium business to create dome-screen-projection versions of 3D digital image content created by Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. on domed screens. These high-definition images of cultural treasures are displayed on the entirety of huge dome screens, surrounding the viewer and giving a life-like impression. Konica Minolta continues to help create new kinds of entertainment and education.

Advanced LED Lighting Uses Flat Surface Light Emitting Technology LED lighting that consumes low power, lasts longer and emits less heat is in great demand because it has a low environmental impact and is economical. Konica Minolta has developed flat surface light sources by applying its optics and film technology to guide and diffuse the light of LED point light sources. The lineup includes two types of lighting: a flat lighting device that takes up less space and a high-potential lighting device that can be used for light designing. These new types of lighting devices are perfect for a wide variety of lighting situations. OLED Panels with the World’s Highest Level of Light Emission Efficiency Organic light emitting diode (OLED) lighting takes advantage of the light-emitting properties certain organic materials have when electrified. It is a promising new technology because it has a high degree of light-emission efficiency and can illuminate from an entire surface. Konica Minolta used its own blue phosphorescent light emitting material to develop an OLED panel product with a light-emission efficiency of 45 lm/W, the world’s highest level for a mass-produced OLED panel product. In October 2011, it was made available in the form of sample kits, and it promises to create a new age of next-generation lighting. We want to reuse rare earth elements. Rare Earth Recycling Technology Enables Limited Resources to be Reused at Low Cost There are only a few supplier countries of rare earth materials worldwide, and there is concern that limited supply will lead to higher costs. Clearly, rare elements must be used efficiently if we are to realize a sustainable society. Konica Minolta has been working on developing a recycling technology for cerium oxide, a rare earth element used as a polishing material for glass substrates for HDDs. Using the materials technology gained from the development of film, Konica Minolta has successfully developed a way to separate and remove the glass particles from the waste liquid produced during the polishing process using a chemical agent. The system does not require large machinery, allowing recycling to be done quickly and at low cost. 2650*(40563;(*:99,769;  Overview of the Konica Minolta Group Business Companies Group Formation KONICA MINOLTA Holding Company BUSINESS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

To this end, each business company is preparing goals and measures to proactively meet the diverse customer needs across the company’s business segments. These measures are scheduled to be fully implemented as of fiscal 2012. The following is a look at the initiatives in the Sensing Business that have been in place for many years at Konica Minolta Optics, Inc. Clients Need “Measurable Trust” Since the introduction of the TV Color Analyzer in 1968, Konica Minolta Optics has provided a wide array of industrial sensors to various industries for use in fields such as R&D and quality assurance. Sensors must be extremely reliable as customers depend upon them to ensure the quality of their products. In addition to ensuring reliability, the company is constantly working to ensure customer satisfaction above and beyond the value of its products. One way it does this is by having close communication with customers to identify ways to solve problems faced by different Display Color Analyzer “CA-310” industries. This has resulted in the manufacture and usage of This sensor adjusts the white balance on displays. Together with products that are widely considered industry-standard. previous models, it boasts an 80% share of the market.

In fact, there are cases where there are no standards yet available for the evaluation of new technologies. Konica Minolta Optics is utilizing the technologies it has developed over many years to create new sensing technologies and standards. For example, the company manufactures sensors that can handle the specific light-emitting properties of LED lighting fixtures, which create uneven wavelength distribution and thus typically make accurate measurement very difficult. In the field of solar batteries, for which there are no mandatory international performance evaluation standards, the company is working with Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) both to develop standardized Cooperating rating with Business Pa Partners solar cells that can be accurately and safely measured and to create international standards.

His comments are presented below. We will use this feedback to improve our future CSR activities and the CSR report next year. 1. CSR Management System Restructured In April 2012, the Konica Minolta integrated the CSR Promotion Section and the Corporate Communications & Brand Promotion Section in a new organization that reports directly to the CEO. This move marked a great stride for the Group’s CSR Management System in shifting toward an environmentally and socially responsible business model. The Group has embraced an advanced CSR management policy and implemented the Green Factory Certification System and other initiatives to ensure that its entire manufacturing system contributes to the shift toward a more sustainable world. This idea, which is articulated in the Group’s message “Giving Shape to Ideas,” is furthermore literally reflected in the Group’s organizational structure. I highly value the Group’s constant commitment to identifying and delivering its own unique forms of corporate value; this is precisely why the Group continues to be selected for inclusion in socially Yoshinao Kozuma responsible investment (SRI) indexes such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes and the Professor FTSE4Good. Faculty of Economics Sophia University 2. Strengthening Supply Chain Initiatives Konica Minolta has strengthened its CSR management throughout the supply chain. It has implemented three-year CSR surveys of its business partners since 2009, and in fiscal 2011, the Group requested all companies that received a rank C assessment to improve their CSR management. The commitment to enhancing CSR management even beyond its own business is clear. This is an outstanding initiative, as it looks at the impact of business activities from the perspective of their footprint, and it is an effective method of identifying hidden issues in the Group’s value-creation process. I am also very impressed by the Group’s new policy on conflict minerals. In the future I would like to see the Group focus on making public the Group’s initiatives in the later stages of the value chain, such as its customer satisfaction surveys. 3. Improving Public Disclosure of Information Improvements are being made in areas identified as problems in fiscal 2010. One of these improvements was the public release of engagement channels for each stakeholder. Another was the fact that, although until fiscal 2010 the only items that were described for initiatives in areas other than the environment were qualitative targets and major items implemented, in fiscal 2011 quantitative targets were published in part along with 2011 achievements and self-assessments as well as targets for fiscal 2012. As a result, the Group’s plan-do-check-act (PDCA) process is far easier to understand. However, the newly released fiscal 2012 targets are almost all descriptive and seem to have a lower disclosure standard compared to the fiscal 2011 quantitative targets. Target management using key performance indicators is essential to the successful promotion of CSR management. Thus, I recommend that the Group review the disclosure method in order to ensure it can disclose annual quantitative targets in advance and their results next year, with a view to solid self-assessment.  2650*(40563;(*:99,769; External Assurance Konica Minolta engaged KPMG AZSA Sustainability Co., Ltd. to provide assurance on whether its CO2 emissions, energy use, petroleum-based resource usage, waste discharged externally from manufacturing, petroleum-based resource waste, final disposal, packaging materials usage, atmospheric emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and water consumption have been measured, gathered and disclosed in accordance with the criteria set by the Group, and on whether the Group’s statement of its GRI application level in the report is compliant with the reporting guidelines of the GRI.
