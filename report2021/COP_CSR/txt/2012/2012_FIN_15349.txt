ANNUAL REPORT 2011 contents 18 CASE P EOPL E DEVELOP MENT U P M ener gy Energy market operations are at the core of UPM Energy’s activities UPM builds new competencies for the changing energy markets New team is a platform for UPM’s goal to grow in lowemission energy Portfolio Managers Juha Kortessalmi (left) and Timo Javanainen closely watch monitors at UPM’s energy trading desk in Helsinki. UPM Energy diversifies its competencies The UPM Energy business area has been actively developing its competencies and has recruited energy experts from many fields. Just in the past year, some 20 new energy experts, e.g. energy market analysts, traders, portfolio managers and biomass procurement experts have joined the UPM Energy team. Over the past few years, the former support function has been converted into a completely new market-based business requiring high level of knowledge. Mathematicians, economists and electrical and power plant engineers are working towards a common target – to get the best out of UPM’s power production assets and help paper mills to procure their energy the best way possible. On-the-job learning is an important part of the competence development. The focus is on cross-team task forces and empowerment. “In 2011, we completed a People plan for UPM Energy. The plan supports the business strategy by defining the most important competence development areas and relevant developmental actions for the organisation. This plan is then cascaded to every individual in the form of a personal development plan via the performance management process,” says Anne Särkilahti, Director of Physical Portfolio Management at UPM Energy. An active player in the energy market UPM is in the same position as any other big electricity producer in Finland, selling electricity to the wholesale market. UPM Energy is currently trading power, gas, coal and emission allowances on Nord Pool Spot, NASDAQ OMX, EEX, ECX and OTC markets. UPM was one of the first companies to start trading spot electricity on the Nordic power exchange Nord Pool in 1998. The operating team is primarily based in Helsinki and Tampere in Finland and in Augsburg in Germany.

The NGP Project responds to a growing need to better understand the role that plantations can play in future societies. Working with WWF for future plantations WWF’s New Generation Plantations Project (NGPP) identifies and promotes new-generation plantation practices. New generation plantations are forest plantations that maintain ecosystem integrity, protect the high conservation values and are developed through effective stakeholder participation, while contributing to economic growth and employment. UPM has been one of the key members of the NGPP since it began 2008. The NGPP responds to a growing need for a better understanding of the role that well-managed and appropriately located plantations can play in future societies. The target is to promote key features of healthy, diverse and multi-functional forest landscapes, compatible with biodiversity conservation and human needs. “Plantations that do not replace natural habitats, but help recover over-grazed and degraded land, can help build a greener future economy. Such plantations could help supply the world’s future demand for timber, fibre and bioenergy without further depletion of its natural capital. They just have to be done right,” says Rodney Taylor, WWF International’s Forest Director. Taylor continues: “The project gives WWF a much deeper understanding of what is possible and the challenges faced by the participating companies. There are certainly lots of examples of new-generation practices. If we put them all together, we might have a new-generation plantation.” In 2011, UPM hosted a conference in London to launch the publication of the NGPP report on how this concept applies to bioenergy and carbon storage. The report included two UPM case studies on sustainable plantation management in the UK. “We are happy to provide even more transparency to our operations to all relevant stakeholders by sharing our case studies,” confirms Vice President Javier Solari, who is responsible for UPM plantations in the southern hemisphere.

Significant energy savings in mechanical pulping In paper production, a remarkable share of energy is consumed in the production of mechanical pulp, one of the main ingredients in magazine paper. The aim of UPM’s strategic research programme concerning energy saving in mechanical pulping, carried out during 2009–2011, was to develop and implement new, energy efficient production technologies. To reach the target of 30% reduction in electricity consumption, a reassessment of the traditional pulp manufacturing principles in co-operation with mills and research was required. Savings with process development In 2011, new energy efficient pulp production concepts were implemented at several mills. The process improvements were made by updating production lines with new technology and by simplifying processes. For example, the grinding technology was modernised at the Plattling mill in Germany and Madison in the USA. In addition, energy efficient solutions were implemented in thermo-mechanical pulping processes at the Kaipola and Rauma mills in Finland and Steyrermühl in Austria. The research that has been done over the years to find energy efficient solutions was put into practice in the successful co-operation between UPM’s R&D and its paper mills. “The results have, in many ways, been even better than anticipated, with energy savings of 10-30% in mill applications. Several million euro savings at the mills encourage to continue the development at other UPM mills,” says Vuokko Pietarila, Programme Manager. ANNUAL REPORT 2011 contents 40 CASE WAT ER U PM paper The aim of UPM’s water programme is to use water responsibly in all of its operations UPM is investigating the management and the material efficiency of water use at several of its mills The target is to reduce waste water volumes and chemical oxygen demand (COD) by 15% between 2008 and 2020 Process engineer Samppa Kutvonen participates in the pilot water management system project at the UPM Hürth paper mill. UPM makes its water use more efficient Water is an essential raw material in the pulp and paper production process. UPM also uses water as a power source and 20% of the company’s electricity is produced using emission-free hydropower. In 2011, UPM carried out several projects aimed at improving water management. The water footprint study performed at the German Nordland paper mill in 2010 was extended to include a water use sustainability assessment. Other water footprint studies are ongoing in UPM’s plywood and wood plastic composite businesses. ”By working with the Water Footprint Network, UPM has taken a leading role in reviewing sustainable water use in the paper industry. UPM’s pilot study shows that when forests are managed sustainably, paper products will have little contribution for the growing concerns about water scarcity,” says Executive Director Ruth Mathews from the Water Footprint Network. At the end of the year, UPM started to pilot a water management system at the UPM Hürth mill in Germany, in co-operation with the Alliance of Water Stewardship (AWS). UPM investigates the scarcity of water resources The scarcity of water resources is one of the environmental concerns of the immediate future. UPM examined the scarcity of its water resources utilising the Water Scarcity Index tool. According to the results, UPM mills are situated in areas where water is abundant and scarcity is not a problem. In 2011, a material efficiency programme was launched at all UPM paper mills. The objectives of the programme are to decrease the amount of suspended matter in waste water and the use of process water consumption. These objectives are being pursued by investments and sharing best practices between mills. In the beginning of 2011, UPM started a three-year research programme concerning efficient water use in the future pulp mills. Trial runs have been carried out at UPM’s Fray Bentos pulp mill in Uruguay. Read more about UPM’s responsible water use at www.upm.com/responsibility.

RafCycle recycles labelstock by-products The processes of UPM Raflatac’s labelstock factories, UPM Raflatac’s label-printing customers as well as the end users who label their products produce valuable industrial labelstock by-products. The RafCycle waste management concept ensures that these by-products are given a new life as the raw material of UPM ProFi wood plastic composite products, an energy source at UPM paper mills or a raw material in paper production. Maximising the reuse of raw materials and recycling go hand in hand with UPM’s Biofore thinking. The by-products from self-adhesive labelstock production are the principal raw material for UPM ProFi wood plastic composite products. The by-products can also be used as fuel in UPM’s combined heat and power plants. Siliconised release paper can be recycled into pulp and further back into UPM paper products by de-siliconising. Previously, these by-products were incinerated or taken to landfills because recycling products that contain paper, plastic film, adhesive and silicone has been challenging. In 2011, RafCycle enabled recycling by-products from UPM Raflatac’s customers and end users in addition to the by-products produced at UPM Raflatac’s own factories. In addition to being beneficial for the environment, RafCycle benefits UPM Raflatac’s customers and end users financially as well. ”With the help of the RafCycle concept, UPM strives to find solutions and uses for the by-products of the labelstock industry’s entire value chain. The interest towards the concept is growing constantly,” says Erkki Nyberg, Director of Business Development for the Engineered Materials Business Group at UPM.

ANNUAL REPORT 2011 contents 48 CASE SUSTAIN ABL E PRODU C T S U P M plywood Plywood is a technical material that has been refined in various ways in order to improve its properties, such as durability The new plywood products and services developed by UPM support the principles of ecodesign, starting from the design process Plywood is a true Biofore product by nature A house made by Danish architects from UPM’s spruce plywood provides a new model for sustainable building. Plywood research and development enables sustainable end products Plywood has many good properties, the most important being the excellent weight-tostrength-to-price ratio, which competing materials have not been able to attain. UPM has developed a new plywood floor solution for trailer chassis that makes it possible to save energy in transportation. The new technology, which has been developed in co-operation with UPM’s partners, allows the floor to be bonded to the trailer chassis, eliminating the need for screws. Bonding provides increased structural rigidity, which makes it possible to design lighter trailer chassis. In 2011, dozens of trailers using the WISA Bonded Floor solution were introduced in Europe. Durable and safe furniture in a more efficient way UPM Grada Plywood, the formable plywood based on UPM’s new composite technology, can be formed after manufacturing making production of form pressed products more efficient. It also enables furniture manufacturers to cut out liquid glues and a number of work phases requiring manual labour. The composite is extremely rigid, which enables thinner structures to be used that are still very durable. Another significant benefit is that the adhesive used in UPM Grada Plywood does not contain any formaldehyde. The plywood house with a small carbon footprint In 2011, UPM Plywood supported a pilot project by two Danish architects in which they built a house using WISA-Spruce plywood. The modules and components of the ‘Print a House’ concept were designed using computer simulation and manufactured using a CNC machine. The result was a family house that was easy to assemble on site. The house is ecological, healthy to live in and it has a small carbon footprint. No concrete was used in the construction.

UPM’s product range is expanding with new innovative materials The new biocomposite, UPM ForMi, and fibril cellulose provide excellent examples of new innovative products and materials that have a strong synergy with UPM’s current businesses. High-quality biocomposite material UPM ForMi is suitable for manufacturing both industrial goods and consumer products. “The new biocomposite has extensive opportunities, from electronic and automotive industries to furniture, tableware and other goods for everyday living,” says Stefan Fors, Director of New Businesses and Development. The biocomposite is made of virgin wood fibres and clean plastic polymers. The share of renewable material can reach up to 60%, meaning that the product is recyclable and can be burned for energy at the end of its lifecycle. Moreover, UPM ForMi’s carbon footprint is 30–60% lower than traditional plastics. Fibril cellulose can be used in a wide range of applications In 2011, UPM started pre-commercial production of fibril cellulose at Otaniemi, Espoo, Finland. The target is to commercialise the material by providing different types of fibril cellulose for extensive customer testing. In the first stage, products are used in paper and packaging materials, as well as in the concrete and paint industries. UPM’s fibril cellulose can be used to make products tougher, lighter or thinner. It can also be used in many industrial applications requiring a high stabilisation capacity and high viscosity. “UPM’s fibril cellulose provides new properties and design opportunities for traditional materials. For example, we have produced the first industrial-scale batch of speciality paper reinforced with fibril cellulose at the UPM Tervasaari mill,” describes Esa Laurinsilta, Director of New Businesses and Development.

UPM has long traditions in engaging with the community at most of its production locations. Co-operation with WWF and other environmental groups In 2011, UPM partnered with WWF both in Finland and internationally. In Finland, the UN’s “International year of Forests” brought together WWF and UPM to promote WWF’s global 2011 “Living Forests Campaign”. In the international arena, UPM continued working with WWF in the New Generation Plantations Project which brings together expertise in plantation design and management in order to further ensure social and environmental sustainability aspects of plantation operations (read more on page 25). Another successful project, clearly linked to UPM’s global biodiversity programme, is the collaboration with Environment Online (ENO) global virtual school’s Tree Planting day, which UPM supported in the UK, Uruguay and Finland. The annual event is important in building future generations’ relationship with nature and forests. In 2011, UPM collaborated closely with BirdLife Finland on managing important nesting and resting areas for bird species. For example, UPM and BirdLife Finland jointly restored peat land area for Red Grouse and other peat land species. Uruguay Foundation achieves positive results The UPM Foundation has been active in Uruguay since 2006, promoting development in rural areas through education, training and entrepreneurship, to foster a culture of safe and healthy living. In 2011, over 35,000 people in 45 communities benefited from the activities financed by the Foundation. In partnership with Bio Uruguay, a local NGO, UPM Foundation promoted sustainable farming practices in Sauce de Batovi, a small rural community of 1,000 people located in the country´s largest and poorest province and supported rural families whose livelihoods depend on the land they live in. “Thanks to UPM Foundation’s support, we were able to profoundly transform the community’s approach to farming, both technically and culturally,” said Alda Rodriguez, Bio Uruguay’s leader and project coordinator.

Safety first The health, safety and security of employees, visitors, subcontractors and all other people impacted by UPM’s operations are of paramount importance to UPM. Despite the hard work and long term positive development in UPM’s safety performance, the accident frequency (the number of lost-time work accidents per one million hours of work) has remained too high, at 15. As a result, UPM has launched a company-wide safety initiative called “Step change in safety 2012– 2014”. In 2011, UPM included safety in the company’s vision and revised its Safety rule, which forms the foundation of its safety work. In conjunction with the initiative, key company-wide performance indicators and incentives, as well as a new set of safety standards, will be introduced. Attention will also be paid on the resources. The UPM Occupational Health and Safety Award 2011 was given to the UPM Blandin paper mill in Minnesota, USA. The award, presented since 2007, is given as recognition for a determined commitment to improving health and safety matters in the workplace. Good local practices shared Blandin paper mill places a strong focus on safety management and has the best score in the Occupational Health and Safety audits. In 2011, the mill also introduced an ergonomics programme as part of its well-being and health management. “Blandin employees show their commitment through participation in safety activities such as training, conducting audits, identifying unsafe conditions, reporting near misses, following safety rules, serving on safety teams and more. We measure safety participation and know that there is a direct correlation between safety performance and participation,” says Joe Maher, General Manager of the mill. UPM Changshu paper mill in China holds the record for the most lost-time accident free days – more than two years without any accidents. The result has been reached by local safety programme and integrating safety systematically into the daily operations: communications, safety observations, preventative safety analysis, audit procedures and learnings from the best internal and external safety practices. In May 2011, the UPM Raflatac Changshu labelstock factory was the first labelstock factory to reach a lost time accident-free year. Near-miss reporting and safety observations are part of the factory’s continuous training programme. ANNUAL REPORT 2011 contents 64 CASE PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT U P M people UPM seeks to give young people opportunities to get acquainted with the developing Biofore company UPM needs new competencies and skills for current businesses and particularly for new developing businesses Future employees are an important stakeholder group for UPM In the summer of 2011, UPM offered some 160 young people aged 15–17 a different kind of summer job. They planted seedlings in 60 locations across Finland during a two-week period. Investing in future talent Out of approximately 14,000 summer job applications, UPM was able to provide summer jobs to over 1,000 young people in Finland. They were working at the production plants, at UPM Forest Finland, at the UPM Service Centre in Tampere and at the Group Head Office. In 2011, UPM Forest implemented a trainee programme in Finland. The 11 trainees, who are located in offices across Finland, are going through an 18-month training programme to become versatile professionals in forestry business. UPM also promoted the Youth Forum of the Finnish Paper Engineers’ Association by supporting the international exchange of future engineers. Ten students were awarded a scholarship at UPM’s paper mills and UPM Raflatac labelstock factories and R&D Centre across the world. Getting started during school years In the summer of 2011, UPM employed some 160 young people aged 15–17, who planted trees in 60 locations across Finland in UPM-owned and managed forests with the help of UPM Silvesta forest workers. Around half a million seedlings were planted during a two-week period and the trees will be ready for harvesting in 60 to 80 years. “The response from both the young people and the forest workers was positive, even though that the summer was quite hot and planting trees is hard work,” says Jukka Koivumäki, Managing Director at UPM Silvesta. In 2011, UPM was also involved in the Enterprise Village project for children aged between 11 and 13. This is an educational programme on the economy and working life, which includes lessons held at the students’ schools and a day in a miniature society.

Ecodesign introduces lifecycle thinking to product design Ecodesign means that environmental aspects are systematically integrated into product design at an early stage. UPM’s all businesses and R&D are adopting ecodesign in their product development processes. UPM’s Biofore thinking entails that each phase of the product lifecycle, including raw materials, production, distribution, use and disposal, is taken into consideration when assessing the environmental impacts of a product. Good design can significantly decrease the environmental impacts of a product as the majority of the final product’s environmental impacts are defined during product development. Making our own processes and the processes of our customers and suppliers more efficient and decreasing the environmental impacts of our products saves everyone’s costs throughout the value chain. Aiming at minimising the environmental impacts UPM aims at minimising the environmental impacts of its products throughout their lifecycle. For instance, the UPM developed manufacturing process for formable plywood improves the energy and material efficiency of the product and significantly decreases its environmental impacts due to the new, innovative composite technology. Environmental labels verified by third parties and certified management systems expressing the sustainability of production and products are an essential part of the ecodesign concept. Responsible sourcing is also a key element in ecodesign. UPM uses a Restricted Substances List, adopted in 2010, to ensure that it provides safe products. UPM and its suppliers have used the list during the development of several products and found substitutive raw materials that are in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. ANNUAL REPORT 2011 contents 72 CASE FOREST U P M e n v i ron m en t UPM aims to maximise the share of certified fibre and promotes best practices in sustainable forestry globally The share of eco-labelled products is 61% UPM is the frontrunner in forest certification Stakeholder dialogue is an essential part of the FSC process for sustainable forest management. UPM awarded FSC certificate for Finnish forests UPM is the first in Finland to be awarded a certificate to demonstrate compliance with the new FSC standard. The FSC certificate covers around half of UPM’s forests in Finland. UPM’s forests have previously been awarded a PEFC certificate. ”The FSC certification of Finnish forests further expands UPM’s portfolio of eco-labelled products. We already have the market’s most extensive selection of paper products with the EU eco-label. Forest certificates are a guarantee to our customers that our wood fibre comes from sustainably managed forests,” says Thomas Ehrnrooth, Vice President, Marketing and Communications, Paper Business Group. The first UPM products manufactured from FSC-certified Finnish fibre became available on the market in the autumn of 2011. Co-operation with environmental organisations Finland’s new FSC standard was approved in January 2011 and a certificate of compliance with the new standard has been available for Finnish forests since May. An agreement on the new Finnish FSC standard and its requirements was met in negotiations between environmental organisations and the forest industry. WWF and UPM have been working closely together for a long time. Liisa Rohweder, President of WWF Finland, is pleased that UPM is setting an example for other Finnish companies by obtaining FSC certification. ”We hope that more forest owners will start to adhere to the FSC standard,” says Rohweder. UPM will also start to offer FSC certification to private forest owners as a forestry service.
