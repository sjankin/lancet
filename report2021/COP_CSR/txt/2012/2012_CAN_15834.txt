Catalyst Paper 2011 Sustainability Report 17 Shared Interests with First Nations $1.8 million Dam replacement Working in a strategic alliance with the Hupacasath First Nation, Catalyst replaced the Robertson Creek Dam near our Port Alberni mill in 2011. This $1.8 million investment brought the structure into full compliance with recently strengthened provincial guidelines. Efforts continued at year-end to reach an arrangement to transfer ownership of the dam, which sits on property owned by a third party, to the Hupacasath. Their interest in it relates to fish habitat management and potential energy generation. Both the Hupacasath and the neighbouring Tseshaht First Nation endorsed our boiler upgrade project at Port Alberni, and we signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Sliammon First Nation in connection with increased green energy generation at Powell River. The MOU makes provision for a Sliammon-Catalyst Development Fund, and collaboration with potential business and employment benefits for the Sliammon. 18 Catalyst Paper 2011 Sustainability Report SERVING OUR...

Catalyst Paper 2011 Sustainability Report 29 Procuring Greener Products Sustainability is a routine part of Catalyst’s dialogue with suppliers, and a growing number are bringing new solutions $1 to the table. In 2011, a new enzyme-based cleaner was used in the starch-delivery system at Powell River, replacing a chemical-based product. Enzymes are naturally occurring proteins and are renewable, non-toxic and biodegradable. They’ve been found to both work better and cost less in this application. This change also reduced the likelihood of pH Billion in purchases variability in effluent, and the need for operators to handle from suppliers and partners in 2011 hazardous chemicals. While this application is small in scale, broader use of enzymes in cleaning and other contexts was being explored at year-end. Producing Greener Products In the same way that we seek lower impact products from our suppliers, so too are we committed to providing them to our customers. Our Sage designated products, available across nine specialty paper grades, continued to attract market interest in 2011. Like all Catalyst products, they provide quality, reliability and excellent press performance. This is combined with verified environmental attributes relating to sources of fibre supply, 9 Paper grades chain-of-custody management, and carbon neutrality and other available with sage designation aspects of the manufacturing process. For every tonne sold, we direct $1 to the work of GreenBlue (see page 10). 30 Catalyst Paper 2011 Sustainability Report ENVIRONMENTAL DATA TABLES Water Quality Performance Catalyst mills monitor the volume, temperature and quality of water discharges. Our Canadian mills participate in a federally mandated Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) program. In 2011, Crofton was authorized to move from a threeto a six-year cycle for EEM testing and evaluation, based on a demonstrated lack of impact in the local marine environment. Powell River already uses a six-year cycle. Both Crofton and Port Alberni also participate in multi-stakeholder watershed management planning forums. Groundwater monitoring at Snowflake identified two instances in 2011 when total dissolved solids exceeded permit alert levels (while remaining within compliance levels). One was traced to a leak in an effluent storage pond. It was bypassed and extensively repaired, and more frequent monitoring instituted to ensure the problem has been solved. The second was traced to a leak in an ash lagoon. Work began in late 2011 to prepare to bypass and drain that lagoon, and it will be repaired after sufficient drying of the ash.

Catalyst Paper 2011 Sustainability Report 31 Air Quality Performance New regulatory measures, finalization of which was pending at year-end, are likely to result in a need for significant pollution-control upgrades at two Catalyst operations. Proposed amendments to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Maximum Achievable Control Technology rules for industrial boilers would require reductions in various emissions at Snowflake, most notably particulates. Similarly, Environment Canada’s new Air Quality Management System may require reductions in sulphur oxide emissions associated with pulp production at Crofton. In both cases, requirements are expected to be finalized in 2012 with a compliance time frame of at least three years.

Performance compares to a provincial air-quality objective of 8 ug/m3. 2 Higher GHG intensity since 2008 reflects a calculation methodology change, as well as reduced power boiler efficiency after closure of a corrugated paperboard machine. Continued machine efficiency issues in 2011, and a changing product mix, also impacted intensity. The same factors have contributed to a similar water-use trend. 3 2010 figures updated to correct a calculation error. Elevated S02 levels in 2010 and 2011 reflect higher sulphur content in coal, as well as applicable emissions factors. Emissions factors are set annually based on test results obtained on a limited number of days and are, therefore, subject to variation due to factors such as operating conditions and fuel characteristics. adt – Air-dried tonnes of product ng – Nanogram PM – Particulate matter TEQ – Dioxin equivalent units ug – Microgram A complete glossary of terms and definitions is available at www.catalystpaper.com/products/glossary. 34 Catalyst Paper 2011 Sustainability Report Effluent (by mill) 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Crofton TSS kg/day 2,889 2,259 1,373 3,095 2,731 TSS kg/adt 1.6 1.4 0.9 1.6 1.3 BOD kg/day 1 1,726 831 530 1,012 864 BOD kg/adt 0.92 0.51 0.44 0.51 0.41 AOX kg/day 403 321 322 408 448 AOX kg/adt pulp 0.33 0.32 0.46 0.32 0.34 2378TCDD ppq n/d n/d n/d n/d n/d 2378TCDF ppq n/d n/d n/d n/d n/d Trout toxicity % compliance 89 100 100 100 100 Port Alberni TSS kg/day 412 414 380 352 389 TSS kg/adt 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 BOD kg/day 280 270 190 290 305 BOD kg/adt 0.33 0.31 0.23 0.39 0.38 Trout toxicity % compliance 100 100 100 100 100 Powell River TSS kg/day 1,885 1,718 1,483 1,330 1,991 TSS kg/adt 1.5 1.4 1.0 1.1 1.6 BOD kg/day 705 661 652 532 797 BOD kg/adt 0.57 0.52 0.44 0.42 0.63 Trout toxicity % compliance 94.3 98.0 98.1 100 96.6 Snowflake (all figures are for full year) TSS kg/day 2 3,983 2,941 1,256 4,009 2,893 TSS kg/adt 5.0 3.7 2.0 3.5 2.4 1 Increased BOD reflects in part the short-term impact of a caustic spill occurring early in the year (see page 39).

The investigation of possible causes remained underway, and a declining trend in BOD levels was observed as this report was prepared in early 2012. 2 Increased TSS was a result of the disturbance of settled fibre in an effluent storage pond, which needed to be drained to repair a leak (see page 31). adt – Air-dried tonnes of product n/d – Non-detectable (test result below two parts per quadrillion) 2378TCDD, 2378TCDF – Specific dioxin and furan substances A complete glossary of terms and definitions is available at www.catalystpaper.com/products/glossary.

A complete glossary of terms and definitions is available at www.catalystpaper.com/products/glossary. Snowflake Energy Use – Comparative Considerations Snowflake’s fuel energy intensity is high compared with most recycling mills, in large part because Snowflake self-generates almost all of the energy it uses. Its intensity measure, therefore, includes use and loss of energy at the generation stage, which are not included in the more typical scenario of a mill that buys energy generated elsewhere. Of total fuel energy use per tonne of production at Snowflake (25.92 GJ in 2011) only roughly 45 per cent is used for paper production. Snowflake’s energy self-sufficiency also affects its carbon intensity, as it results in much higher scope 1 or direct emissions and much lower scope 2 emissions (associated with purchased electricity). 36 Catalyst Paper 2011 Sustainability Report Total Key Materials Used as Tonnes 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Water 1 142,416,387 141,164,553 132,107,490 176,518,631 175,027,227 Wood chips and pulping logs 1,652,199 1,558,187 1,094,795 2,207,406 2,304,028 Hog fuel 680,023 682,279 606,871 541,421 759,933 Fossil fuels 2 407,176 407,749 337,250 368,684 127,928 Old newspapers and magazines 334,443 286,566 456,751 530,225 170,272 Precipitated Calcium Carbonate 123,651 122,468 119,825 117,288 116,391 Clay 75,307 64,692 60,129 77,035 81,057 Oxygen 57,832 62,432 46,282 92,869 103,684 Hydrogen Peroxide 17,911 18,143 21,928 29,198 28,155 Sodium Hydroxide 30,803 30,764 23,084 47,815 53,778 Sodium Chlorate 18,425 16,208 5,730 29,227 34,950 Sulphuric Acid 15,593 13,605 7,387 23,822 27,888 Silicate 11,217 11,599 16,562 18,973 16,301 Starch 10,566 9,826 10,137 13,409 13,714 Sulphur Dioxide 8,589 9,079 10,460 11,168 12,771 1 Water use figures in this table include treated effluent, as well as discharges of cooling and storm water; consistent with standard industry practice, water use as shown in the key facts and figures (and as used to calculate water-use intensity) includes only treated effluent. 2 Fossil fuels are typically reported as gigajoules of heating value (and are reported on this basis on page 21); however, weights – while not reflective of the true heat content of the fuels basket for each year – are recommended for inclusion as part of Global Reporting Initiative reporting.

This information is compiled by Environment Canada in the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI), and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), and is available via www.ec.gc.ca/inrp-npri and www.epa.gov/tri. The table above shows the combined total of all releases reported to the NPRI and TRI for all of Catalyst’s operations. Full-year releases from Snowflake are included for 2008 (see measures marked with an asterisk*), notwithstanding the acquisition date of April 10. Since releases are reported in the spring for the previous calendar year, 2011 data were not yet available when this report was prepared. Data are not included [ – ] in instances where reporting was not required by the regulator. Speciated PAHs, while reported individually to Environment Canada, are reflected in the table above as part of the “Sum of PAHs”. A complete glossary of terms and definitions is available at www.catalystpaper.com/products/glossary. 38 Catalyst Paper 2011 Sustainability Report Appendix 1 Crofton • A toxicity-related non-compliance resulting in introduction of chlorinated occurred in November.* The relevant water, and there were no further mortalities Non-compliances cooling water stream was diverted to the after this was corrected in November. • A spill of 54,000 gallons of caustic effluent treatment system and additional While the chlorine concentrations caused (50 per cent concentration) was testing and evaluation were pending at mortality under testing conditions, they contained within the effluent collection year-end. were less than concentrations in tap water system, but resulted in increased pH and are not believed to have deleteriously impacted the marine environment. levels and reduced secondary effluent Reportable events treatment efficiency over three days, with • Procedural errors led to two failures to • Removal of improperly operating light corresponding issues with toxicity* and collect effluent samples, resulting in four standards in late 2010 resulted in a BOD levels – see additional information administrative non-compliances (each reportable event recorded in 2011 due to below (constituted two non-compliances, non-collection period extended over the disturbance of osprey nests built on due to duration of incident). two days). the standards; Crofton has an approved • Bleach plant chlorine dioxide emissions plan to erect platforms designed for remained above a permit limit set in 2007 osprey nesting use in 2012.

Revised procedures are in place to deal with any recurrence. Reportable releases (>10 kg) of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) at Canadian mills totalled 21 kg in 2011, compared to 46 kg in 2010. Consistent tracking of ODS releases below the 10 kg threshold began at Canadian mills in 2011, in accordance with new greenhouse gas-related regulations. Snowflake had total ODS releases of 217 kg, compared to 373 kg in 2010, but none were reportable due to prompt mill responses. Port Alberni completed the phase-out of all equipment containing larger volumes of ODS in 2011, and phase-out continued at all other mills. The pending installation at Crofton of large non-ODS chilling units from the closed Elk Falls mill will accelerate the process there.
