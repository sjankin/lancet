Population growth, rising prosperity and rapid urbanisation will put increasing pressure on energy supplies over the next 40 years. More and cleaner energy will be needed from even more sources, against a backdrop of greater economic volatility and growing environmental pressures. During these uncertain times, Shell continues to invest in delivering more energy and helping to build a more sustainable energy future in which cleaner-burning natural gas increasingly replaces coal to generate power.

At the same time, CO2 emissions must be signiƂcantly reduced to avoid serious climate change. Shell is helping to meet this challenge by doing what we can today. We are producing more cleaner-burning natural gas, helping to develop technologies to capture and store CO2, producing low-carbon biofuel and working to improve our own energy efƂciency. We also support moves towards a strong, global policy framework to manage CO2 emissions. All energy sources will be needed to meet Carbon capture and storage future demand. This includes nuclear We are helping to advance carbon capture Ç CO2 from the Scotford Upgrader in Alberta, power and renewables, such as wind and and storage (CCS) technologies through Canada, will go to our proposed Quest CCS project. solar.

Shell Sustainability Report 2011 7 Our approach CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE Given that much of the world’s rising energy demand will continue to be met by fossil fuels, carbon capture and storage (CCS) could play a signiƂcant role in reducing CO2 emissions. CCS can capture CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial processes and store them deep underground. According to the International Energy Agency, CCS could reduce global CO2 emissions by 19% by 2050 – as long as it moves rapidly from the demonstration phase to widespread|use. There are challenges to the progress of CCS. Plans to store carbon deep underground onshore have faced opposition from local communities. Efforts are under way to develop CCS projects offshore. But government funding is needed to move CCS from demonstration to wider use by industry because CCS projects generate no revenue for companies. While the technologies needed for CCS have been used safely for many decades, further work is under way ÇRegular checks help maintain equipment at our Deer Park reƂnery in Texas, USA. to combine and advance them for use on a commercial scale.

Canada’s oil sands are one of the most signiƂcant energy resources remaining. They can play an important role in the energy mix, but they must be developed responsibly. Oil sands consist of bitumen – a heavy oil – mixed with sand, water and clay. Some of the oil sands lie close to the surface, where they can be mined. The rest lie too deep for mining and the bitumen is produced through conventional wells, often using steam injected into the reservoir to ease its ƃow.

We moved into the production of lowcarbon biofuels in 2011 for the Ƃrst time. With Cosan, we set up Raízen (Shell interest 50%), a joint venture that produces the lowest-carbon biofuel commercially available, ethanol from sugar cane in Brazil. This biofuel reduces CO2 emissions by around 70% compared to petrol, from cultivation of the sugar cane to using the ethanol as fuel. Raízen’s efforts to improve the efƂciency of its production process include burning plant waste for electricity. Sustainability challenges The environmental impacts of biofuels vary according to how and where they are produced. Some offer potential CO2 savings, depending on the raw materials used – whether palm oil, corn or sugar cane. Production and distribution methods can also make a difference. In some regions, high annual rainfall provides Shell Sustainability Report 2011 25 Our activities suppliers on sustainability. Under this policy, we work closely with suppliers to FUTURE FUELS develop more sustainable supply chains For the future, Shell is developing advanced biofuels from inedible plants and crop and review their progress on a regular waste.

Our regulations, such as the EU’s requirement biofuels research teams in India, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA work with that imported raw material for biofuels must leading biotechnology companies and academic institutions. Taking advanced biofuels meet minimum standards related to land-use from the laboratory to commercial scale takes time, however, and poses considerable change, emissions and supply chains. technical challenges.

One way we do this is through international certiƂcation schemes such as Bonsucro With Canadian Ƃrm Iogen Energy, we are developing technology that uses enzymes for biofuel from sugar cane, which is to break down the cellulose in, for example, wheat and barley straw.
