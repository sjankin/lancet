P. 22 | ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2010 SPIE Let’s create a new culture See the interview of safety. There are no magic solutions for safety risks. It’s a day-to-day challenge that involves an area in which it’s difficult to make an impact, namely assessing personal risk. When deciding whether they are faced with a potentially hazardous situation, employees cannot base their assessment solely on plans and procedures. They need to develop a responsible attitude with regard to dangers that may not be easy to recognise. That’s why at SPIE, we focus on re-examining habits and routines.

Two examples were the Energy Performance Day held in Marseille and the Salon des Maires et des Collectivités Locales, a public procurement trade show in Paris. At the latter event, the results of an energy audit for the town of Gaillac, near Toulouse, were presented. In 2009, Gaillac won a contest to receive a free efficiency audit of its public lighting system. The audit, which covered 2,000 light sources, showed that the town could reduce energy costs by around 12% while also improving the quality of its lighting system.

When Val-de-Reuil decided to renovate the town’s partially rundown public lighting systems, the goal was to respect its urban renovation plan and avoid any increase in debt. We suggested a public-private partnership that provided authorities with an innovative technical and financial package. The advantage of this arrangement is that work can begin immediately in order to rapidly achieve the 26% energy savings objective on the assets involved in the project. Installation and maintenance costs will then be reimbursed in quarterly instalments extending over 15 years. The idea was also to introduce a forward-looking solution that enabled authorities to deploy new constituent services that support urban policies.

The main challenge facing public transportation is the need to provide users with service quality that encourages them to make long-term choices about urban travel. To meet that challenge, we offer quality-focused solutions that enable tramways and buses to move about more easily, provide users with important information and generally make travel safer. Each solution is unique and must fit seamlessly into the urban environment.
