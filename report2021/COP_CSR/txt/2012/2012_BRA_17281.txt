We maintained our investment pace; we were strict in controlling costs to ensure being socially, environmentally and financially sustainable; and we aimed at meeting our commitments to social inclusion. GRI 1.1 We have persevered in providing universal water and sewage services in the area where we operate by 2018. Five new municipalities now have water supply, collected and treated sewage in all their urban areas, increasing to 146 total cities in the State of São Paulo under these privileged conditions. COOPERATE SO THAT SABESP CONTINUES TO BRING QUALITY OF LIFE TO THE MILLION OF people IT SERVES 6 146 363 CITIES WITH UNIVERSAL SERVICES CITIES SERVED At the same time, Sabesp continued to work and invest vigorously in its structuring programs, which are key to attain this goal. In 2011, our main sewage collection program – Tietê Project – gain decisive momentum. During the year, we initiated construction works in 13 of the 20 municipalities of the São Paulo metropolitan area (RMSP) that will benefit from the expansion of sewage collection systems and treatment facilities. We have completed important works to reduce water shortage in the São Paulo by expanding the Alto Tietê Production System, increasing water supply by 5.000 liters, and in another 14 projects. A major breakthrough was obtained in the fight against water losses. In 2011, we managed to reduce the water loss index to 25.6%, tapping water enough to supply 26,700 people without the need to source new watersheds. This initiative has also been supported by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica), which granted a new loan to Sabesp to continue to fund the program. On the coastal area, we practically completed the Onda Limpa (Clean Wave) interventions in the Baixada Santista, which had a positive effect on the increase of sewage collection and treatment, improving the beaches’ swimming conditions and the population’s health. Important projects, such as the construction of the Jurubatuba water treatment plant, in Guarujá, and the Mambú-Branco Production System, in Itanhaém, are heading toward their completion. We should mention the creation by the São Paulo State Government of two new programs for the low-income population that will allow expanding the State water and sewage systems and increase the efficiency of river and brook recovery actions, and water supply security. Our greatest challenge, however, is not only expanding our systems, staying innovative, competitive, and maintaining our sustainable growth. It is to provide services that have increasingly more quality and regularity. To do so, we redefined our strategic guidelines for 2011-2020, emphasizing excellence in customer service. We understand that our role in the Board of Directors is to cooperate so that Sabesp continues to bring quality of life to the 27.6 million people it serves. This is evidenced by the growing approval of our work by the population of São Paulo. Edson de Oliveira Giriboni Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sabesp 7 COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT MESSAGE FROM THE CEO It is not possible to speak of civilization without water and sewage. It is a fundamental right of the human beings and the necessary condition to avoid the depletion of the environment and our natural resources. This is why supplying water and collecting and treating sewage is an activity intrinsically linked to sustainability. One does not exist without the other. GRI 1.1 A company like Sabesp deals with sustainability on a daily basis, in all its dimensions. We are socially responsible for providing a service that has a direct and immediate impact on quality of life and health conditions of the customer. We are involved in the preservation of watersheds, the recovery of water resources, and the decontamination of rivers, brooks and the sea. We are committed to the financial soundness of a business with an inherently long maturing period and necessarily low costs. BASIC sanitation is the necessary condition for the preservation of the environment AND PROMOTING THE COMMON GOOD 8 “We have the privilege of helping, through 2 BILLION IN ANNUAL INVESTMENTS each of our actions, to improve the lives of the population, a healthier environment and an economically more developed and 27.6 MILLION socially more equitable society” PEOPLE SERVED Our dedication to the sustainability principles is already recognized by society. It is the fruit of a culture that day after day becomes part of our employees, the daily work of our service providers and our suppliers, from whom we demand increasing quality. More sustainability is not the destination. It is a path that is built as we trail it. It is the crossing toward a future necessarily better than the present. Therefore, we worry, also while we prepare this report, about expanding the limits of what is possible. We have increased the wealth of information disclosed, we try to improve the quality of the information already being published, we have recognized our weaknesses, and when and where such weaknesses are more noticeable. We have a firm commitment toward transparency, the common good, and the respect for our stakeholders. I understand that a mission like ours, to take water and sewage to more than 27.6 million people, can only be successful if supported by basic key principles: transparency, good management and technology. Sabesp have proved to be in a position to apply these principles in an efficient, sound, dynamic, innovative, and sustainable way, financially, environmentally and socially. Nothing translates better what sustainable development can be than a sewage treatment plant capable of operating efficiently during its 50-year useful life, at the lowest cost, with the largest service spectrum, maximum use of natural resources, and minimum impact on the environment. This is sustainability. We maintain our firm commitment to the provision of universal water and sewage services in the area were we regularly operate by the end of this decade. To do so, we plan to maintain the average investments made in recent years, i.e., roughly R$ 2 billion. It was founded on these principles that we obtained major results in water and sewage services expansion in 2011: in the first case, the number of new connections made was the second highest in the past 12 years; in the second case, it was the highest in the period. But we need more: by the end of this decade we plan to make another 1.6 million new water connections and 2.3 million sewage connections to ensure that we will provide universal services in the area where we operate. All the six performance goals set for our organization in 2011 were met. We consider it a satisfactory performance, without forgetting that even though the strategy for our business stayed on track, 2011 was a year of changes in our management, with the replacement of four of the six member of our executive committee. We have reached the conclusion that our new business area still falls short of what we have planned and aim; it is possible to make progress. The commitment to provide universal water supply and sewage collection services by the end of this decade is the one of noblest and most challenging commitments a company could have. We have the privilege of helping through each of our actions, from the smallest one to the largest, to improve the lives of the population, a healthier environment and an economically more developed and socially more equitable society.

Namely: Águas de Castilho S.A. and Águas de Andradina S.A., a partnership with CAB Ambiental; and Saneaqua Mairinque S.A., a partnership with Foz do Brasil. In Mogi Mirim, we, OHL Meio Ambiente and Etep are in charge of modernizing, implementing and managing a sewage treatment system, also through an SPE. We also provide consulting services on rational use of water, commercial and operational management in Panama and Honduras, as part of a consortium with Latin Consult.

We understand most of the demanded investments is already secured to comply with our investment plant. However, we have worked, constantly, in fund raising, especially at low costs, compatible with our water and VISION sewage services, to cover the investments necessary to its expantion. To be recognized by 2018 as the company that has universalized water In order to meet the universal services objective, throughout 2011, we revised our and sewage services, within its area strategic guidelines. Namely: sustainable economic and financial growth; socioof operation, in a sustainable and competitive way, with excellence in environmental sustainability; universal services and quality; proactivity in relationcostumer services ships; integration and innovation; and human capital as a strength. The new strategic planning time horizon is 2011-2020. Our commitment to sustainable and responsible water and sewage universal services in our operation area, by the end of this decade, is reflected in our financial strategy and social and environmental actions described throughout this Annual Sustainability Report. 11 PANEL OF INDICATORS Customer service operational Financial Environmental social 2006 / 2011 CUSTOMER SERVICE WATER SERVICE RATE

Water supply remains in a level we might consider as universal in our area of operation. New connections of this service follow the organic growth in the areas served by us and our business, reaching the second largest growth of the past 12 years in 2011. Sewage collection and treatment of collected sewage are still on track. Note that in 2011 we obtained the best performance of the past 12 years in number of new sewage connections made. As for the water loss rate, in 2011 it follows the trend set by us for the coming eight years. The goal, which should be adjusted during 2012, is set at 13% by 2019. The water saved in 2011, with the reduction of total losses to 25.6%, from 26%, is sufficient to supply 26,700 people without new sourcing watersheds or making additional investments in water storage and production. Note that this indicator has systematically dropped since 2004, when it was 34%. We also maintained a high rate of customer satisfaction, as evidenced by both the 92% satisfaction measured in opinion surveys with 5,860 users and the fact that since March 2010 we remained out of the ranking of companies with the largest number of complaints filed with Procon (customer protection agency).

In 2011, we conducted the second largest number of water connections and the largest expansion in sewage connections of the last 12 years. More five municipalities started to have universal water, sewage collection and treatment services. These actions are part of our structuring programs, aimed at ensuring water supply and promote the expansion of the sewage system and the recovery of rivers and brooks. We also generated good economic and financial results, with profit of R$ 1.22 billion for the year. UNIVERSAL WATER AND SEWAGe SERVICES IS A COMMITMENT FROM WHICH WE WILL NOT TURN AWAY “Bring treated water, sewage collection and treatment services to all urban households served by us by 2018” (1) (1) First public-private partnership entered into by us, it has allowed us to increase production by 5,000 liters per second in Taiaçupeba WTP, in Suzano.

This approach is particularly important considering the geographic, demographic and hydrographic conditions in which we operate. The State of São Paulo – our current base operation area – concentrates 22% of Brazil’s inhabitants. Its territory is 2.9% of Brazil’s and it generates 33% of national Goss Domestic Product (GDP). The 363 municipalities served by Sabesp concentrate 60% of the state’s urban population, many of who live in conurbations consisting of rapid and unorganized land occupation over the past decades. We face, in particular in the Alto Tietê basin, in the RMSP, a situation of POPULATION extreme water shortage. The region alone is unable to meet its populaNumber of inhabitants to total Brazil tion’s water needs. Currently, demand is equivalent to approximately the double of minimum availability, which is 39 m3/s. These constraints force us source water in watersheds increasingly more distant, such as the basin of the Piracicaba, Capivari and Jundiaí rivers. They also impose the need to 22% encourage the decrease of water losses in our operations and encourage the population to reduce consumption. An example of a successful initiative in our strategy to recover major watersheds through structuring actions was the recovery of the Paraíba do Sul river, in the Vale do Paraíba region. With the expansion of sewage EXTENSION collection and treatment works in densely populated cities such as São José dos Campos and Taubaté, totaling an investment of R$ 170 million through Territorial area to total Brazil 2010, the river water quality improved significantly. After the completion of the Taubaté/Tremembé STP, one of the most modern in Brazil, and the start of the Vidoca sewage pumping station operation, in São José, Cetesb (São Paulo Environmental Agency) tests showed a major 2.9% increase in the water oxygenation of the Paraíba do Sul, in 2011. Oxygen concentration increased to 5.2 milligrams per liter from 0.5 mg/l in 2009. As a result, previously rarely seen fish such as banded astyanax, mandi, neon tetra, catfish, wolf fish, curimbata and tilapia, returned to the region’s rivers.

It is, therefore, important to design new public policies and 192,000 NEW CONNECTIONS actions that help attaining our expansion goals, converge for the success of the structuring programs already in place, and meet the social inclusion principle. 76,800 IN THE RMSP As part of this strategy, in 2011, our effort toward universal water and sewage services in our State counted on institutional assistance, in the 30,000 IN THE BAIXADA SANTISTA form of two new governmental programs to which budget resources from the São Paulo State Government will be allocated. 5,600 IN CAMPINAS REGION In December, the State Legislature approved a bill from the Executive branch that creates the Pró-Conexão (Pro-connection) program. The 79,300 in other cities program is aimed at subsidizing works inside the homes of lower-income households, so that they may connected to the public sewage system. We Água é Vida estimate that this will increase the efficiency of the water and sewage programs performed by Sabesp: the resulting collection expansion will held social inclusion, the improvement of the population’s living conditions, the recovery of rivers and brooks and the preservation of watersheds. We estimate that 192,000 new connections will be made over eight years, to the benefit of around 800,000 people from lower-income households that earn up three minimum wages. The State Government will cover 80% of the program’s costs and we will cover the remaining 20%. Over the period, R$ 349.5 million will be invested. In November, we also created the program Água é Vida (Water is Life), Alto Paranapanema aimed at implementing water and sewage services in low-income comVale do Ribeira munities located in areas far from city centers in the São Paulo inlands.

This strategy is particularly important at this time, which coincides with the end of the first effectiveness cycle of tenths program contracts, entered into under a framework effective at the time Sabesp was founded, in the first half of the 70s. We have, therefore, made a great effort to renew contracts with concession grantors. In 2011, we signed 25 program contracts. In aggregate, so far we have renewed 225 program contracts in accordance with the Sanitation Act and another 39 contracts which comply with the previously effective legal framework – and which will expire between 2012 and 2033. Together, these municipalities account for 74% of our revenue. Under the program contracts, the cities set their own coverage and service level quality goals. The program contracts provide for intense social control, and the oversight and regulation, including of tariff regulation, by the São Paulo State Sanitation and Power Regulatory Agency (Arsesp). In addition, to face completion in the large clients segment, where several industrial and commercial consumers prefer to use artesian wells or tank truck for water supply, we adopted a flexible tariff to compete in the market, including firm demand contracts. Atibainha Dam Corporate Management 35 Rational Water Use Program NEW ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTION BUSINESSES AND PARTNERSHIPS Properties served by Pura We also seek to enter new markets and consolidate operations in each new industry. We have focused our actions to this regard in two major fronts. The first is the new business partnerships that include 2008 2009 2010 2011 TOTAL initiatives to operate in other states and other countries. The second 85 734 907 444 2.170 is the Sabesp Environmental Solution platform, aimed at expanding operations with large customers. In 2011, the highlights were the expansion of the Rational Water Use Program “Pura” and the initiatives Supply Savings in favor of reclaimed water production. Number of people that could be supplied with the savings obtained Rational water use (PURA) We have adopted a policy that stimulates rational water use, which entails the use of technology actions and cultural changes to build 23,000 PEOPLE / MONTH consumer awareness. Our main tool, Pura, is aimed at reducing the water consumption of large customers, in particular in the public sector. Under rules set out in contracts, participants can count on a Reclaimed water 25% tariff decrease, provided they comply with certain conditions – including reducing consumption by at least 10% as compared to the past twelve-month average consumption and having paid all their water bills. Currently, Pura is implemented in approximately 2,200 buildings of 319,000 M3/MONTH the São Paulo State Government and the city of São Paulo, as shown The capacity of reclaimed water in the table on the top left. In these buildings, we are responsible for from the treatment of sewage contracting the works and engineering services necessary to reduce for industrial use, equipment cooling, and non-potable purposes water consumption. These actions allowed us to save a monthly water volume sufficient Aquapolo Ambiental to supply around 23,000 people without the need to source new watersheds. The program also helps to postpone investments in water and The largest reclaimed water production plant in sewage systems. the Southern Hemisphere Also aimed at reducing water losses, we should highlight the innovative solutions implemented outside the Pura, such as contracts with performance clauses that we have adopted in Chácara Flora and Vila do Encontro, in the south of São Paulo city. This has allowed us 300,000 people supplied with the to develop more creative solutions, such as incentives for exceeded water savings goals. The result was 3.3 million m3/year of water saved. 36 sustainability report 2011 / sabesp Reclaimed water We have also steadily invested in expanding the generation of reclaimed water from the treatment of sewage for industrial use, equipment cooling and non-potable purposes. Currently we have the capacity to produce 319,000 m3/ month of reclaimed water in the ABC, Barueri, Parque Novo Mundo and São Miguel STPs. However, currently we only supply 160,000 m3/month, mainly because of distribution logistic problems, still developing new customer prospecting and the need to improve the production process, since the reclaimed water from our sewage treatment plants is appropriate only for certain uses and consumption. We have, however, sought to improve production and supply conditions and expand its market potential. Our largest project in this area has not started up – which should take place in 2012. We are building, together with Foz do Brasil, the largest reclaimed water production plant in the Southern Hemisphere: the Aquapolo Ambiental. The estimated final outflow is 1 m3/s, from the ABC STP to the Capuava Petrochemical Aquapolo Ambiental Complex, in the São Paulo metropolitan area . An equivalent volume of treated www.sabesp.com.br/rs2011/aquapolo water would be sufficient to supply 300,000 people. Even before going into service, Aquapolo has already been internationally recognized. In 2011, the project came second in the Global Water Awards, an award granted by Global Water Intelligence to highlight innovative water supply and sewage treatment initiatives worldwide. Other initiatives focused on environmental solutions include the loyalty contracts with large consumers, that guarantee us annual revenue of approximately R$ 233 million; and the treatment of industrial sewage from the manufacturing activities of our customers, corresponding to 26 million m3 collected and treated in 2011, generating revenue of R$ 181.8 million. Projects already implemented, related to individual water consumption metering in residential condominiums and telemetering (that allows us to monitor consumption in real time, via the internet), are being assessed and redesigned to allow them to evolve. We also operate in new markets through partnerships with private sector companies and special purpose entities to: (i) provide water supply and/or sewage collection and treatment services in four municipalities in the State of São Paulo: Andradina, Castilho, Mairinque and Mogi Mirim; (ii) build and operate an industrial sewage treatment and sludge conditioning plant located next to the Barueri STP, the construction of which should start in 2012, through a partnership with Estre Ambiental; (iii) provide consulting services on rational use of water and commercial and operational management in Panama and Honduras; and (iv) enter into partnerships with water and sewage concessionaires in Alagoas (Casal) and Espírito Santo (Cesan), both Brazilian states.

We are investing R$ 900,000 in system and our German partner is investing another R$ 5.1 million. In 2011, our investment in RD&I was R$ 3.2 million – note that the annual 49 CARS FUELED amount invested for this purposes in 2009 and 2010 was R$ 3.8 million. In 2012 with methane captured in the STP sludge biodigesters, a partnership with the Also in this front, we have a five-year cooperation agreement with German institute Fraunhofer the São Paulo State Research Support Foundation (Fapesp), effective until 2014.

In 2011, revenue from construction increased 4.4%. This increase is mainly due to a higher construction cost in 2011. The difference between 4.4% revenue growth and the 4.6% increase in construction cost is due to the change in the index used to calculate the construction margin, which decreased to 2.3% in 2011 from 2.6% in 2010. Costs and expenses added to construction costs, amounting to R$ 7.5 billion, increased 14% over 2010. EBITDA remained stable at R$ 3.2 billion for both fiscal years. The R$ 1.2 billion in profits in 2011 EBITDA margin reached 32.4% in 2011 against 34.9% in prior year. If we disregard the effects of construction revenue and cost, the EBITDA margin is 41.1% in 2011 (44.7% in 2010). If we also disregard the effects of the increase in actuarial liabilities of R$ 157.5 million for the G0 Plan, which is nonrecurring, and the effects of construction revenue and cost, the EBITDA margin for 2011 is 43.1%. In 2011, our profit was R$ 1.2 billion, a 25% decrease as compared to 2010, mainly due to foreign exchange differences arising on foreign borrowings and financing, totaling R$ 448.5 million, due to the 12.6% appreciation of the US dollar in 2011, against a 4.3% depreciation in 2010. EC1 Despite the size of the challenge to provide universal services, we believe that + 2.6% in water volume billed we are well positioned to reach our objective, with financial, environmental and social sustainability, and adding value to our shareholder. Our aggregate economic value in 2011 is presented in page 43. Approximately 75%, equivalent to R$ 6.5 billion, of the investment planned for 2009-2013 has already been made. We are continuously prioritizing low-cost funding, compatible with the water and sewage activity – including by extending capital market debt maturities, thus spreading out maturities and, as a result, minimizing pressures on cash. In 2011, our Economic and Financial and Investor Relations Division created the Tariff and Cost Division aimed at developing proposals and analyses to be used as inputs for our discussion with our different stakeholders and service cost definition, + 3.6% in sewage volume billed restructuring and tariff revision processes. The new tariff methodology proposed by Arsesp will increase tariff forecasting, which is key to meet the service coverage goals set in the investment plan and to ensure the provision of quality services. Also regarding tariff revision, the service agreement entered into with the City of São Paulo in June 2010 establishes that we will contribute 7.5% of gross revenue generated by services provided in municipality, less the Cofins and Pasep (federal taxes on revenue), to the Municipal Environmental Sanitation and Infrastructure Fund. We have been transferring this amount since the execution of the agreement, even without its offset in tariffs charged – since the 7.5% were not taken into account when the tariff increase calculation formula in effect was established. Arsesp is revising the second cycle tariff methodology, which schedule for August 2012 and which we expect will + 7.6% of gross operating revenue include these transfers and, as a result, generate revenue more adequate for us.

We set goals for the progressive implementation of the EMS, comprising geographic distribution of the operation basis and still seeking to cover diferent types of treatment process and sizes. IMPLEMENTED IN 65 STPs AND WTPs By December 2010, we had already reached 50 STPs certified under ISO 14001, or 77% of the target for the period. The EMS was implemented in 65 STPs and WTPs and involved the qualification of 300 employees, through 14,000 hours of training. In 2011, our challenge was to consolidate the EMS implantation and 300 TRAINED EMPLOYEES maintenance methodology. In addition, we underwent a recertification audit. In the coming years, we intend to continue the EMS implementation in our units. Our target is 302 STPs and WTPs by 2018, and certifying STPs that were considered of strategic interest, totaling 155 by 2018. 14,000 HOURS OF TRAINING Environmental licensing and water resource use concessions ISO 14001 CERTIFICATION In view of the need to maintain and regularize the environmental permits granted to our facilities, and the use right concessions, we have been im50 certiFIed WTPs proving our management tools.

Initially we intended to complete them also in 2011, but FLEET RENEWAL delays in the engagement of consulting services for this work prevented us from meeting this goal. Note that we have been focusing our efforts on emission-reducing initiatives. This includes the use of biogas generated from sewage sludge as fuel for our vehicle fleet, as we have started to do in our Franca STP in 2012. (For more details see section Research and Innovation.) One of our key actions to reduce GHG emissions was the replacement of our 1,563 vehicle fleet. In 2011, we replaced 1,563 light vehicles and 101 heavy vehicles for vehicles with flex fuel technology and the mandatory use of ethanol as light vehicles fuel, in the first case. The fleet renewal program includes the replacement, replaced in 2011 by 2014, of all light vehicles more than seven years old and heavy vehicles more than 20 years old – these, in turn, will use less pollutant P50 Diesel. By removing older vehicles from public streets, we estimate that we will reduce CO2 emissions by 3 tonnes per year and save 12%. Another initiative is carbon capture through the riverbank reforestation around watersheds. The main project – 1 Milhão de Árvores no Cantareira (1 Million Trees in Cantareira) – favors the permanent preservation areas on the margins of the Cantareira dam and the banks of its tributaries, and 101 also implementing ecological corridors connecting existing isolated forest patches. In 2011, the Instituto de Pesquisas Ecológicas (Ipê) planted 36,000 heavy VEHICLES seedlings in 20 hectares, and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) planted 27,000 replaced in 2011 seedlings in 14.2 hectares. Other companies are sponsoring the tree plantation, such as Dersa: that has 550 planted hectares offsetting the construction of the São Paulo ring road. During 2011, we reached some understandings with TNC for the creation of a Revolving Carbon Fund for the use of income from the sale of carbon credits generated by the new plantations in the Cachoeira watershed, in the Cantareira area. We intend to launch the fund in 2012, with the pos3 sibility of receiving donations from private sector companies and public and private bodies, and recover degraded areas in the same watershed, less tonnes of co2 especially those neighboring our land. per year as a result of vehicle replacement up to 2014 We have also conducted training in three schools of Nazaré Paulista, involving 250 students. This initiative, together with Ipê, highlighted the importance of having a plant coverage to maintain water quality and quantity, under the motto “Water does not grow on trees, but without trees there is no water.” The set of actions aim to contribut in the creation on of a new economy in the Bragança Paulista region, based on ecotourism and forest management. 60 sustainability report 2011 / sabesp adhesion to cdp Supply chain sabesp PEA Guidelines for more than 100 actions and projects Disclosed their 75% direct emissions 72 million Liters per month less in water consumption Disclosed their indirect emissions 70% from power consumption under the Pura 30,000 Children, aged 6 to 13, Disclosed the physical and/or members of the 60% regulatory risks related to climate Clubinho Sabesp change on their businesses Carbon disclosure project emissions; 70% disclosed their indirect emissions from energy consumption, and 60% disclosed the physical GRI 4.12 We are part of the Carbon Disclosure Project and/or regulatory risks related to climate change on (CDP) Investors for five years.

In 2011, we launched the campaign “The toilet is not a wastebasket”, with “good guys” and “bad guys” telling the children that they should not throw trash in to the toilet. This initiative results from the significant number of toys and food packages found in the railings of the sewage treatment plants, based on a study conducted in the ABC STP and presented during the 26th Brazilian Congress of Water and Waste and Environmental Engineering, promoted by Abes. 165,607 Participants of events and lectures in 2011 Environmental Management Conferences Every year, we hold the Cycle of Environmental Management Conferences as a corporate environmental management strategy and with the purpose of promoting the discussion, knowledge exchange and the dissemination of information on environmental issued being developed at Sabesp.

Ecopoints One of our main initiatives for materials recycling in 2011 was the creation of ecopoints to collect recyclable materials in the main company facilities in the middle of residential areas, in the form of standardized containers, made of “plastic wood”. The first ecopoint was opened in May, in our head office, as part of the celebrations of the Environment Week. Another five ecopoints, from a total of 50 (25 in the RMSP, 15 in inland cities and 10 in costal cities) to be implemented by 2012, have already been installed at the addresses below.

EC9 Our concern with social inclusion is present in the adoption of the socalled social tariff, by which lower-income households can pay lower bills for the services that we provide. This benefit is regulated by the Arsesp and is available to households with a monthly income of up to three minimum wages, in addition the to fulfilment of house size and energy consumption criteria. Currently, approximately 8,600 households are entitled to the benefit. Our 80% of the most social tariff is one of the lowest charged by state-owned water and sewage requested services companies and is 64% lower than the regular residential tariff – considering Served online beginning 2012 households with average water consumption of 15 m3 per month. 70 sustainability report 2011 / sabesp the sabesp social tariff covers 8,600 households with monthly income of up to three minimum wages We have also worked on regularizing connections, a key challenge of basic sanitation companies and that has significant result in terms of improvement of public health conditions and social inclusion. We rolled out, in the east end of the São Paulo metropolitan area, the Paritá project (Actions to Regularize, Integrate and Transform Irregular Areas). In 2011, we regularized around 1,300 water connections in 14 irregularly occupied areas; another 37 areas were regularized in 2008-2010. Based on the results obtained in the last four years, we reduced the number of households with irregular connections in the east side of the RMSP by 22.5%, comprising 20,000 inhabitants. It is worth 92% general noting that these actions have also allowed us to reduce losses by 2.3 million m3 of satisfaction index water per year. Measured in an opinion poll conducted with 5,860 users Also in lower-income areas, we developed a fire prevention pilot project in the Sônia Ribeiro housing settlement, in Jardim Aeroporto, São Paulo, by installing public fire hydrants in our water distribution system. The experience will result in an arrangement to be established into with the city of São Paulo for the installation of fire prevention equipment in 21 slums during 2012. PR5 We conduct a customer satisfaction survey since 2004/2005. In 2006 the survey became annual, using always the same methodology to allow comparing the different business units and the different periods surveyed. Our objective is to improve, based on the responses obtained, the services provided to our customers. In 2011, Sabesp’s general satisfaction index reached 92%. As compared to 2010, satisfaction increased by three percentage points. We believe that this good result is mainly due to the quality of our water and its regular supply: 92% of the respondents said they were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with our service. The survey results consider a margin of error of 1.3 percentage points, and confidence interval of 95%. 2.3 The survey interviewed 5,860 customers from all consumption categories and sizes, million of m3 Of water saved in 2011 in the region where we operate in the state of São Paulo. by regularizing connections Ombudsman Office The Ombudsman Office is a qualified customer service channel. It mediates conflicts between Sabesp and our customers, and follows up any complaints filed with the Arsesp. In 2011, the Ombudsman Office received 44,169 messages and complaints from customers, 99% of which were replied and/or solved. In order to ensure the swiftness and agility of solutions to the claims received, we adopt procedures and enter into settlements with Procon (a public body recieving consumers complaint) and the courts to find reconciliation alternatives. One of these experiments is the Digital Small Claims Courts (JEC), a partnership between Sabesp and the Small Claims Courts system. In 2011, we handled 354 claims, a 15% decrease in the number of customers that contacted this office as compared to 2010. The rate of early settlements and settlements during hearings remained at satisfactory levels, at about 72% of the claims made, which reinforces SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 71 99% R$ 211 of customer claims MILLION and complaints Saved by holding 2,000 Responded to and/or solved in 2011 electronic auctions in 2011 our commitment to have a balanced relationship with Award.

In 2011, this participation – taking into consideration only the contracts with waiver of price bidding and by invitation only – reached 40%. We disclosed our procurement plan as broadly as possible to the market in order to encourage competition among suppliers. Accordingly, we have designed our “Competition Guidelines for Public Procurement Processes”, available in our website (link on the right), in which we established the general guidelines to expand the portfolio of suppliers and encourage competition. In compliance with State Public Procurement Processes www.sabesp.com.br/rs2011/compras Decree 53.336/08, we also disclose our Public Sustainable Procurement Report, which lists our main socio-environmental actions and good practices applied to our supply chain. HR1 Our bidding notices and draft agreement also include socio-environmental provisions, such as: • Participation conditions: we do not accept any bids from companies interdicted for environmental crimes under Article 10 of Federal Law 9.605/98, which prescribes the penal and administrative sanctions for conducts and activities adversely affecting the environment; • Suppression of underage labor: we require from each bidder a declaration that it complies with all the Ministry of Labor regulations; HR6 Electronic Bidding Portal • A declaration that it does not use any form of labor similar to forced or compulsory www.sabesp.com.br/rs2011/fornecedores labor in its production chain; HR7 • Wood products and by-products: we require from each bidder a declaration that it will only use exotic or legally extracted native wood products and by-products in the performance of its works and engineering services, in accordance with State Decree 53.047/08; • Qualification Regulatory Guideline: we seek suppliers that are committed to the environment and their surrounding areas. We also require compliance with the local environmental law by obtaining installation and operation permits issued by the relevant environmental agencies. In addition, we assess the toxicological risks of suppliers’ products, to guarantee its safe use both in the treatment plants and for the end consumer. In 2011, in order to encourage competition, we implemented new procedures with strict rules on the approval of biddings when only one bidder participates in the auction, when there is only one valid bid or when we identify indications of lack of competitiveness. This measure incorporates the innovations already adopted in our processes, for example the system that successively extends the end of an auction for another five minutes whenever a new bid is made – and, by exhausting the bidding possibilities, prevents fraudsters from acting.

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 75 to maintain leadership, it is key to retain professionals who are competent and committed LA3 We maintain a benefit package that goes beyond those required by law, that seeks ensuring to our employees and their dependents that they maintain their health, social welfare, development, better quality of life, satisfaction and safety. The benefits are granted to all employees, regardless of their working hours or position, gender or ethnic background – except for apprentices, whose benefits are governed by specific legislation. Those employees with legal custody of children are granted a childcare allowance or can use our Daycare Center, for children from six months to less then six years old. We reimburse the expenses incurred by employees with physically or mentally disabled children on their treatment in specialized institutions equivalent to up to two times the amount of the childcare allowance, with no age limit. Employees on sick or accident leave paid whose salary is higher than the ceiling allowance by the public social welfare are automatically granted a salary supplement during up to six months. EC3 In addition to these benefits, we also subsidize healthcare and pension fund benefits for all employees, through Fundação Sabesp Sabesprev. In 2011, we contributed with 1.41% 1.41% of monthly payroll to the employees’ defined benefit pension plan. As the end of December 2011, we entered into an agreement with the entities OF PAYROLL Allocated by Sabesp representing the employees to make changes in their pension plan. The proposal to the pension plan provides for the increase in the incentives granted to those employees willing to migrate from the defined benefit pension plan (Basic Plan) to the defined contribution plan (Sabesprev Mais Plan). It also incorporates changes in the risk benefits. With the agreement, we expect to address the basic pension plan’s technical deficit issue, estimated at R$ 538.6 million. The solution still need to be approved by the State Government oversight bodies and will also be submitted to the approval of courts, due to the lawsuit that in November 2010 suspended migrations to the Sabesprev Mais plan. As regards the healthcare plan Sabesprev, in 2011 we created a joint committee to define proposals to improve plan coverage, at costs consistent with the market, comprising the performance analysis of the plans currently administered by Sabesprev in terms of the following: financial income and expenses, service, and service network available to active and retired employees. People management The adoption of a people management model consistent with market reality, agile and flexible is indispensable for good corporate performance. We understand that we need to review the bases of and create new scenarios for our human resources and outsourcing policy.

LA11 The qualification and training of our employees has always deserved a special attention. We are one of the pioneers in corporate education in Brazil with our Corporate University, created in 2001 to train our future leaders and employees from all levels. In 2011 the qualification process had 112,000 attendants, namely 4% managers, 17% college graduates, 28% operating staff, 42% technicians, 5% trainees and 4% apprentices, reaching an average of 46 hours/person. We should highlight remote education, with a syllabus of around 350 courses, totaling an annual average of 12,000 attendances. Piracaia Dam 78 sustainability report 2011 / sabesp 350 REMOTE LEARNING COURSES Totaling an annual average of 12,000 attendants The University’s investments in qualification totaled around R$ 9 million and favor courses focused mainly on sustainability, corporate governance, environment, social responsibility, quality, health and safety, and key competences for the business. HR3/HR8 In 2011, there was a strong investment in occupational hygiene, safety and R$ 9 MILLION medicine activities, including human rights aspects. We also dedicated efforts to the Invested in increase of our staff qualifications, by subsidizing post-graduation, MBA, technical and Corporate University professionalizing and language courses, through partnerships with renamed teaching institutions. In addition, our agreements with more than 150 teaching institutions granted discounts of up to 40% for our employees and their dependents in tuition fees of graduation, post-graduation, high school, elementary school, technical, preschool, language and adult education courses. Occupational safety and health Basic sanitation activities are, by their nature, exposed to occupational accidents. Thus, the objective of our occupational safety and health management is to ensure the implementation of actions that promote the development of a company wide prevention culture and the improvement of working conditions, bettering the quality of life of our employees and service providers. PR1/PR2 Our Occupational Safety and Health Management System is certified by the OHSAS 18001 standard and encompasses 100 locations within the scope of digging services and works, and work in confined spaces carried out in public ways. In 2011, Bureau Veritas Certification audited Sabesp to maintain the certification and we were re-certified. LA6 A quarter of our staff, including management and employee, take part in formal safety and health committees, and are involved in activities such as: systematization, monitoring and specific programs. We highlight, in particular, the dedication and commitment of our 3,650 Internal Accident Prevention Committee (Cipa) members, emergence brigade members and area professionals. The main drivers of our safety and health policy are as follows: (i) responsibility for occupational safety and health is everyone job; and (ii) occupational safety and health-related performance must be permanently monitored and improved. The programs developed for occupational safety and health have gradually resulted in a decrease in the frequency and severity of accidents. The most frequent are traffic accidents (26%) and falls (24%). The main causes relate to behavioral attitudes (66%). In 2011, we made an average investment of R$ 10 million in accident prevention. We have also created a specific communication channel for outside stakeholders, Occupational safety and health covering occupational safety and health issues, available on the link on the right. www.sabesp.com.br/rs2011/trabalhe SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 79 occupational safety and health indicators / by region LA7 SÃo Paulo Metropolitan Region 2009 2010 2011 Frequency rate 5.3 5.9 7.8 Severity rate 160 683 224 Occupational disease 49 38 5 Absenteeism (%) 4.7 3 3 Deaths 24 17 23 Work-related deaths 1 Inland and Shore 2009 2010 2011 Frequency rate 5.5 7.4 6.7 Severity rate 220 784 297 Occupational disease 27 33 7 Absenteeism (%) 6.1 3.1 2.4 Deaths 18 17 18 Work-related deaths 1 Total Sabesp 2009 2010 2011 Frequency rate 5.1 6.2 6.9 Severity rate 330 662 239 Occupational disease 76 71 12 Absenteeism (%) 5.3 3 3 Deaths 42 34 41 Work-related deaths 2 Definitions Frequency rate: Number of work-related last-time accidents resulting in injuries and leave of absence per million of hours/man worked, over a given period.

CREATED IN 1973 by Nabih Mitaini Trademark building The trademark was built from the association of the theme initials (s, b) so that visually the share of these initials could be added to the symbols (amphora and drop). The top right graphic element forms letter “C” (Company); there is a graphic connotation of s b (basic sanitation); the edge has letter “P”, which added to the “S” Amphora result in “SP” (São Paulo). The element researched to design the symbol in the shape and with the meaning of an ancient amphora, a vase used by the Greeks and Romans, and afterward by other peoples, to store and carry water and other liquids. It is true that the amphora shape was created by the ancient Egyptians, who used clay vases in the water aeration and sedimentation process. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT www.sabesp.com.br
