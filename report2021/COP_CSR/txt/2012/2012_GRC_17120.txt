During 2011, the country experienced further severe economic conditions that were felt by every household and company, including OTE and its people. More than ever, this requires from all of us great resilience, shared purpose and commitment to a sustainable future. In 2011, we made considerable progress on our CR priorities. This Report outlines our progress and achievements in detail and in accordance with the requirements of international CR standards, including the GRI guidelines and the United Nations Global Compact. Aligning our CR strategy and reporting with these standards reflects our conviction and commitment that both sustainability and responsibility remain the integral key elements of OTE strategy. This commitment is common among OTE Group subsidiaries in Greece and S.E. Europe, consolidating OTE’s dominant position in the region as a provider as well as a responsible social partner. We also made important progress in energy conservation initiatives and in formulating our Climate Change strategy. More significantly, through several initiatives the company maintained a consistent level of support for vulnerable groups in our society, especially children, students and people with disabilities. The long-standing Blood Donation programme and volunteering in large numbers in 2011 to support the Special Olympics World Games in Athens, along with participating in our Safer Internet education campaigns and partnerships, prove that OTE employees are closely involved in Corporate Responsibility. For 2012 and the near future, we remain focused on our strategy to build a strong and competitive company. In the context of the given environment this comes to show that at OTE we seriously regard business success and social responsibility as one. It is certain that in 2012 and ahead we will be challenged and tested yet again. Equal is our certainty that we will not falter in our path towards sustainable growth. Michael Tsamaz Chairman of the Board of Directors & Chier Executive Officer of OTE SA 5 Corporate Responsibility Report 2011 About this Report This 2011 Corporate Responsibility Report is the seventh annual report by Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation (OTE) about our economic, social and environmental performance. The Report covers the period 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011. Since 2005, OTE reports on CR on an annual basis. The most recent previous report was the 2010 annual CR Report, published in June 2011. As in previous years, the Report’s primary focus and boundary is OTE SA operations in Greece. In doing so it covers all divisions and operations of OTE SA throughout Greece. In addition, summary information is provided for OTE Group economic performance in Greece and South East Europe, and for the CR activities of OTE Group companies outside Greece. OTE Group’s mobile telephony business, COSMOTE, publishes a similarly detailed CR Report in parallel to this one. The Report’s content is defined by close analysis of the issues of most interest to our stakeholders, reflected in the four pillars of our CR framework, and by adherence to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3.1 Guidelines, the United Nations Global Compact principles and the AA 1000 AccountAbility principles. Index Tables for each of these standards are provided at the end of the Report. For the third successive year, the Report is subject to external assurance covering both GRI application level and the AA 1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard. As in 2010, this Report is presented as a summary Printed Report presented at the OTE Annual Assembly and an Online Report at a specific microsite http://www.ote.gr/cr2011/en available within the OTE website www.ote.gr. Our approach to reporting online and in print is as follows: The Printed and Online Reports provide the same concise summary of our CR strategy, main activities and achievements in 2011 and future goals. The Online Report provides additional detailed information and is the basis for the GRI Application Level Check and the External Assurance of the 2011 Report. The summary information on OTE Group subsidiaries is included in the Online Report. The Printed Report indicates the topics on which additional information is provided in the Online Report. The data in the Report comprises the following types: aggregated financial and personnel data which is provided by OTE financial and human resources systems; aggregate data on customer service and satisfaction which is provided by OTE customer divisions; summary data on regulatory issues which is based on OTE records; and environmental data calculated according to internationally accepted methods on the basis of information provided by OTE technology and operation divisions. In collecting and presenting data we have been guided by the definitions and parameters of the GRI Indicator Protocols. The Report contains no significant changes from previous reporting periods in the scope, boundary, or measurement methods applied in the report. Minor changes on measurement methods for key background information, especially for calculating environmental data, are discussed in the relevant parts of the report. In addition, in the Marketplace section, very minor restatement is reported on broadband penetration data of 2008-2010. Readers’ opinions and comments regarding the Report are welcomed.

Towards Digital Greece Since 2006 OTE invested In the past three years, the deepening economic and fiscal crisis in Greece has had significant negative effects on the sustainable growth potential of the economy and business performance and, of course, on society as a whole. Rising unemployment, 1,3 billion in broadband development. decreasing investments and plunging consumer spending are all clear and present impacts of the crisis. In such an environment, technological innovation, competitiveness arising from the ICT sector and large investments in new technologies can either become flattened by the crisis or become one of the key re-growth and competitiveness drivers and multipliers for the economy. It is not simply fate: policymakers and industry can make choices that influence what will happen. Meanwhile, the telecommunications sector has to strike a difficult balance between the very important factors of connectivity, competition, innovation/growth and social benefit. OECD analysis published in 2009 argues that efficient government spending on communications infrastructure can help to speed recovery from economic crises and lay the foundation for sustainable growth. As the OECD states, high-speed communications networks are a vital platform for 21st century commerce and industry. They enable innovation and boost productivity in all sectors through efficient communication and exchange platforms. Broadband networks increase the strength and the impact of private and public investments which depend on high speed telecommunications. Broadband is also crucial to “smart” energy-saving electricity grids, smart buildings and smart transport systems that will underpin a greener economy. In Greece’s case, broadband performance has improved significantly in the last five years. For example, in 2007, broadband penetration as a percentage of the national population was just over 9% and by the end of 2011 the same indicator was 21.8% of the population. The improvement in Greece’s performance arises from OTE’s considerable investment in broadband development totalling EUR 1.3 billion since 2006, alongside implementation of EU regulations and the ‘Broadband Action Plan’. According to the EU Digital Agenda Scoreboard 2011,1 the EU27 average broadband penetration rate is 27.2%. The EU Scoreboard also shows that business access to broadband in Greece is 80%, close to the EU 27 average of 84%. But, while more than 40% of people in Greece are regular Internet users, 53% have never used the Internet, compared to the EU-27 average of 24%. There are also regulatory barriers impeding Next Generation Access (NGA) broadband network development. For example, in early 2011, OTE initiated the deployment of its new optical access network (‘Fibre to the Cabinet – FTTC’ – using VDSL2 technology). The project was initially developed in a select number of urban centres to provide end users with Internet speeds up to 50 Mbps along with improved quality characteristics. This was a commercial pilot case aiming at testing the willingness of customers to take up new technologies potentially later implementing a wider roll-out plan. Shortly thereafter, the Greek National Regulatory Authority, the EETT, adopted interim measures prohibiting OTE from commercially offering these NGA services to its retail customers. The measures were set to apply for a six-month period starting from the date on which the EETT approved OTE’s wholesale prices. The continuing obligations imposed by the EETT as part of the regulation of Greek fibre optic markets make it difficult for OTE to exploit pilot NGA networks in Greece. Moreover, in 2011 the impact of the economic crisis was severe and it is continuing. According to the Greek Institute of Economic and Industrial Research, Greece’s economic general indicators are now well below the long-term indicators for 2000-2010, and in 2011 the Greek ICT sector economic activity indicators began to decrease as well. This is borne out by OTE’s experience of visible impact on household and business customers especially in the fixed line market. The challenge for policymakers and the ICT sector will be to find ways to build resilience into the ICT market so that Greece’s achievements of the past decade in building a more digital economy are not reversed – especially as this will be so crucial to the country’s long-term economic future. 1 The EU Digital Agenda Scoreboard 2011 was published in early 2011 and is available at http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/digital-agenda/ scoreboard/countries/el/index_en.htm 10 11 Introduction and Profile Introduction and Profile 2.

With Conn-x as its main retailer, OTE continues to be the primary organisation for the development of new technologies Regarding pricing, OTE follows a procedure of financial analysis, recommendation, decision and approval. If the product in the country and the number one choice of consumers for quality broadband services. is regulated, then EETT approval of price control levels is required. This is the case with the majority of wholesale services. The development of IPTV services by OTE has also contributed to the further broadband penetration.

Furthermore, via the satellite broadband internet service and the Hellas Sat satellite, broadband services are available even at the most remote locations in Greece. By the end of 2011, OTE has put in operation WiMAX systems in several regions of the country, including in Thessalonica, Agion Oros, Ammouliani and the Ouranoupoli and Ierissos region, several parts of Attica; and, through Rural Subscriber Radio networks, also in Samos Ikaria – Fourni, the Zagorohori region, Kithira, Rodopi, Fthiotida and Evia. We also continued expanding the OTE Next Generation Access (NGA) network with active cabins equipped with VDSL2 DSLAM in regions of Attica as well as in other towns of the periphery (Xanthi, Komotini, Serres and Alexandroupoli). These cabins will be able to provide high speeds (30-50Mbps), aiming at increasing broadband penetration and meet the demands of corporate/business as well as residential customer for higher speeds of broadband services. As explained in the Digital Greece section of this Report, in 2011 the Greek regulator EETT has impeded OTE’s expansion of this important new service. Public education about Broadband and new technologies OTE has adopted an array of actions and initiatives aimed at educating and familiarising the public with broadband services, seeking to bridge both the digital divide between urban centres and remote regions in Greece as well as between Greece and other EU countries. During 2011 OTE completed the Information Campaign about broadband targeted at consumers and hosted at 88 specially designated areas (Internet Corners) that operated within OTE retail stores, informing more than 7,000 citizens about broadband services. 36 37 Marketplace Marketplace 5.

Employee Satisfaction OTE aims to create transparent and effective internal communication channels for all employees to be able to express their feedback, needs and expectations on the company. One of the goals for 2011 was to have full operation of the HR-HELP DESK Service across Greece. This was not yet fully achieved since the HR-HELP DESK information system, which supV ports the operation of the Service in question, has not been installed yet. It is estimated that the installation of the aforementioned system, as well as the nationwide operation of the Service, will be possible by the end of October 2012. Nevertheless, the Service operates on a pilot basis for anyone familiar with it and who dials the four-digit number 1255, providing telephone services to all colleagues on human resources issues. The HR-HELP DESK Service also participated in other Company events and programmes, thus enhancing outward actions such as the CAREER DAYS programme, aimed at students and young people seeking employment. The employee satisfaction survey was not conducted as originally planned and was rescheduled for 2012.

In 2011, there were no any environmental awareness in all aspects of its operation. fines as well as non-monetary sanctions imposed for environmental issues. OTE recognizes its own responsibility for the protection of the environment and aims to actively contribute to the mitigation of the global environmental issues, such as climate change and natural resources conservation. In this context, a series of initiatives and actions are being developed, in line with international rules and practices, with qualitative and measurable quantitative goals. OTE aims at decreasing the impact of its operations on the environment, thus contributing to the enhancement of corporate environmental responsibility. To meet this objective, an integrated environmental policy and management scheme has been formulated with clearly defined annual improvement benchmarks set each year. At the same time we look for the design and development of products and services that enable our customers to reduce their environmental impacts. a. Environmental Policy The key elements of our environmental policy are full compliance with environmental legislation in all aspects of our operation as well as in products / services developed and provided, monitoring and reporting of our environmental footprint, and the formulation of appropriate measures for reducing our footprint. In that context, we analyze the environmental impacts associated with our operations, products and services taking into consideration: energy consumption, greenhouse and other gases emissions, raw materials use and waste management, water consumption, ozone layer and electromagnetic radiation. Aiming at the continuous improvement of our environmental performance, we: Analyze, monitor and strive to systematically improve the calculation of our environmental impact. Design and implement measures for reducing our environmental impact through: -R ational use of energy, water and raw materials. -P romotion and utilization of Renewable Energy Sources. -R eduction of greenhouse and other gases emissions. -R ecycling of raw materials and consumables. -M inimization of any potential impacts from electromagnetic radiation. -E nvironmental awareness Invest in relevant research & development through our participation in national / international research programs. Develop products and services that enable our customers to improve their environmental performance. Actively participate in the on-going, formal or informal, consultations and international initiatives regarding climate change mitigation and environmental protection. Raise environmental awareness of our employees and customers. Support actions and initiatives undertaken by environmental organizations. b. New Developments on Environmental Management OTE is in the process (since May 2011) of developing its integrated climate change strategy under the umbrella of the DT group climate change strategy. The overall context of the DT group strategy, as decided on August 2011, includes cost reduction, minimization of risks associated with political initiatives for climate change and addressing new business opportunities related to climate change. The strategy is being developed by taking into account the specific sectoral and national circumstances and its final outcome would be the definition of a GHG emissions target for 2020, with 2008 as the base year, accompanied with a set of measures to be implemented. It is expected that the climate change strategy will be announced during 2012. OTE has secured (from its electricity provider) Guarantees of renewable Origin GOs that cover by 100% our electricity consumption in 2011. According to these certificates for all of our electricity consumption the same amount of energy from renewable sources has been produced by PPC S.A. Internal discussions concerning the development of a centralized ISO 14001 environmental management system and of an environmental data collection and reporting scheme took place, with a view to formulate specific proposals for further actions. Waste management represents a key priority for OTE in the context of the environmental management of its activities. Utilization of authorized (per source stream) waste management entities for waste recycling / disposal 72 73 Environment Environment We acquired Guarantees 2. Measuring and Reporting our Environmental Impact of renewable Origin We report our Environmental impact in the dimensions discussed in brief hereafter. More details are presented in the online version of this report (http://www.ote.gr/cr2011/en). (GOs) covering 100% a. Energy consumption Energy consumption represents a major source of greenhouse gases (GHG) and other gases emissions contributing to both climate change and air pollution. OTE considers energy consumption (mainly fossil fuels consumption) as one of the enof our electricity vironmental aspects of its operation, and, therefore, launched in 2007 a program for monitoring its energy consumption on a national / regional level but also at individual buildings level. In 2011, the environmental data collecting system was expanded in order to cover discretely all the regional directorates of OTE. Energy consumption4 covers operating needs of telecommunication infrastructure, buildings and OTE owned vehicles. As consumption by the of 2011, the effect of collocation (concerning COSMOTE and wholesale providers) on the electricity consumption of OTE was quantified and calculated back to 2008. Therefore, a new time series of energy consumption has been developed. In 2011, total energy consumption of OTE (excluding collocation) amounted to 1,246 TJ. Energy consumption in 2011, increased by 3.0% compared to 2010 (from 1,211 TJ in 2010 to 1,246 TJ in 2011). More specifically, Electricity Provider. The declining trend of fuel consumption for space heating (heating diesel, natural gas and district heating) continued in 2011. Consumption for space heating decreased by 4.3% compared to 2010 mainly as a result of space consolidation despite the less favorable weather conditions prevailed in 2011 compared to 2010. Fuel consumption for OTE owned vehicle fleet decreased by 6.4% compared to 2010. Diesel oil consumption for stationary engines remained almost constant at 2010 levels. Electricity consumption5 (1,090 TJ in 2011) makes up the largest part of the total energy consumption of OTE. In line with the global trend in the ICT sector, total electricity consumption of OTE increased by 4.3% compared to 2010, a rate which is almost half compared to the one observed in the 2010/2009 period (8.4%) as a result of: The increase of the services provided that in terms of data transferred was about 50% reaching 243 Gbit/s in 2011 (182 Gbit/s in 2010). The electricity conservation measures in place. The lower average temperatures prevailed in 2011 compared to 2010 that resulted in decreased cooling needs. The stemming of electricity consumption growth rate and its eventual transformation to a reduction of the electricity consumption to the extent that is technically and economically feasible, as well as covering our electricity demand directly or indirectly by renewable energy sources represent the key priorities of OTE. In this context, we have secured (from our electricity provider PPC S.A.) for 2011 Guarantees of renewable Origin (GOs) covering 100% of our electricity demand.  4 Energy consumption is based on actual consumption data for the period up to September November 2011, which are extrapolated to the end of the year due to data provision arrangements within the DT group.  5 Electricity consumption is estimated on the basis of actual data for Attiki covering the period up to November 2011 that are compared to the corresponding 2010 data and are then extrapolated to all of OTE administrative regions and to the end of the year. 74 75 Environment Environment FUELS & ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION non technical, and domestic waste from OTE buildings. Total generated solid waste amounted to 2,900 t in 2010, with printing paper (A4 paper) accounting for about 10% of total generated waste (290 t approximately). Recycling, through authorized (for waste management) companies, represents the major management practice utilized by OTE (see also Paragraph FUEL CONSUMPTION (TJ) ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION (TJ) 3.E). Existing recycling programs cover the whole of technical waste and about 39% of paper. Solid waste disposed accounts for about 40% of the total waste generated. 120 1500 d. Ozone 100 1200 OTE is gradually replacing old cooling systems operating with ozone depleting substance (ODS) as refrigerants, while fire suppression systems use suppressants with zero ozone depleting potential (ODP 7). The ODS (i.e. R22) quantity being re80 plenished in the existing cooling systems for 2011 (all administrative regions are included as of 2011) amounted at 164 kg 900 ODP (that is a reduction of 15%, at least, compared to 2010 for which only partial information was available). ODS use in 60 Attica in 2011 was further reduced to 22 kg ODP (from 79 kg ODP in 2010). 600 Currently, HFC blends are utilized either for substituting ODS or for installation in new cooling systems. The quantity 40 replenished for 2011 (all administrative regions are included as of 2011) was about 5,950 kg of refrigerants, which is equivalent to GHG emissions of about 10,230 t CO2 eq8. These emissions account for 4% of the GHG emissions from energy use 20 300 (both scope 1 and scope 2) and therefore measures to address this issue should be explored. 0 0 e. Greenhouse Gases and other Gases Emissions The calculation of GHG emissions is based on the methods described in the GHG Protocol developed by the World Busi2008 2009 2010 2011 ness Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World Resources Institute (WRI). The GHG and other gases emissions inventory of OTE includes direct emissions (scope 1) from fuel consumption in OTE owned / controlled instalLiquid fuels for vehicles Natural gas lations, vehicles, etc., and indirect emissions (scope 2) from electricity and district heating consumption. More details are Heating diesel Electricity including Collocation presented in the online version of this report (http://www.ote.gr/cr2011/en). Diesel for stationary engines Electricity OTE In 2011, total direct GHG emissions from energy consumption were estimated at 11,450 t CO2 eq, presenting a decrease of about 6% compared to 2010. In total direct GHG emissions decreased by 23% for the period 2008 – 2011, with emissions Comment: a. Data on diesel for stationary engines refer to planned tenders for supplies for 2008 2009 and actual consumption for 2010 2011. from heating fuels presenting a more intense decrease of 38%. b. An amount of less than 2 TJ for district heating is included in electricity consumption for 2010 and 2011. Indirect GHG emissions (scope 2 emissions due to electricity consumption and district heating) for 2011 were estimated at 247,000 t CO2 eq, presenting an increase of 4.3% compared to 2010, without considering the GOs secured. If GOs secured are considered, then scope 2 GHG emissions are reduced to 184 t CO2 eq, as emissions from electricity consumption are Direct primary energy consumption for 2011 (excluding electricity consumption and district heating) is estimated at 159 reduced to zero. It is noted that as of 2011, the effect of collocation (concerning COSMOTE and wholesale providers) on TJ, and indirect primary energy consumption (by allocating to OTE the energy consumption needed for the production of the electricity consumption of OTE and the associated emissions was quantified and calculated back to 2008. the electricity and the district heating consumed by OTE) is estimated at 2,520 TJ (reduced to 1,090 TJ if GOs are taken into account). f.

Water Consumption In OTE, the use of water covers sanitation needs in buildings and stores as well as catering and water supply of large buildings. Water consumption in 2011 (214,108 m3 excluding water consumption from privately owned wells) decreased by more than 10% compared to 2010 (243,484 m3) as issues related to water leakage were resolved. OTE is not directly inemissions from OTE’s volved in water withdrawal as water consumed is provided by the relevant public bodies at regional level that are responsible for water supply and the sustainable withdrawal of water from the available water systems, and therefore water sources are not significantly affected by our activities. Wastewater from the operation of OTE refers to domestic wastewater, which is directed to the available wastewater networks and is treated according to area-specific processes in the municipal wastewater facilities. No planned or unplanned water discharges to the environment took place during 2011. energy consumption present decrease of about h. Biodiversity At OTE, we are aware of the high biodiversity values of Greece and we recognize the close relationship between biodiversity, sustainable development and human well-being. In this context, we are committed to minimize any potential impact that our activities could have on biodiversity. These potential impacts are mainly related to the operation of installations on 6% compared to 2010. isolated areas necessary for the reliable provision of telecommunication services and infrastructure works for upgrading telecommunication network. All potential impacts are addressed in the Environmental Impact Assessment studies we carry out and submit for approval to the designated authorities. In these studies special reference is made to protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value that are near to our activities. Given the characteristics of our activities, our key priorities concern leakage minimization from telecommunication equipment and land restoration on the completion of infrastructure works. It is noted that all buildings / installations that are currently in use by OTE are registered and relevant information can be found at DG Technology and Operations. i. Other Electromagnetic radiation, noise and visual impact are not considered as significant environmental impacts from OTE activities. Nevertheless, there are preventive initiatives in place to anticipate any potential issue. Our products bear all necessary labels foreseen by national and EU legislation. In order to ensure that any potential impacts from electromagnetic radiation associated with the construction and operation of wireless communication stations are mitigated we conduct environmental impact assessments studies. Noise impacts are restricted to the operation of stationary engines that are necessary only when there is no reliable electricity supply. The operation of electricity generators in urban areas is in line with all provisions foreseen by national legislation. For the installation of new telecommunication infrastructure necessary for the provision of communication services, all appropriate arrangements are introduced, to the extent that is technically feasible, to minimize the visual intrusion that it is going to produce on the landscape, especially in urban areas. In addition, appropriate modifications are also applied for existing telecommunication infrastructure. 78 79 Environment Environment 3.

Our scope of work was limited to OTE’s activities in Greece.We carried out Type 1 limited (i.e. moderate) assurance in accordance with AA1000AS. A Type 1 engagement requires us to report on the nature and extent of adherence to AA1000 APS. To achieve moderate-level assurance we have used the criteria in AA1000AS to evaluate adherence to AA1000APS in combination with our robust evidence-based and quality-assured approach to professional, independent assurance. We carried out limited assurance on the selected key performance indicators in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000). To achieve limited assurance theISAE 3000 requires that we review the processes, systems and competencies used to compile the areas on which we provide assurance. This is designed to give a similar level of assurance to that obtained in the review of interim financial information. It does not include detailed testing of source data or the operating effectiveness of processes and internal controls. 92 93 Annexes Annexes Our key assurance procedures To improve future management and reporting of CR in accordance with AA1000APS we make the following recomTo form our conclusions, we undertook the following procedures: mendations to OTE: Analysed and tested on a sample basis the processes related to stakeholder identification and engagement, includInclusivity: ing review of a sample of engagements and the outcomes of engagement; OTE Management is engaged in a process of dialogue with its stakeholders for the development of an integrated Reviewed the process that OTE used to identify and determine material issues to be included within the CR Reand consistent CR related strategy.
