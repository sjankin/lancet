Declaration of Support TO WHOMSOEVER IT MAY CONCERN I am pleased to confirm that Avasant LLC reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and AntiCorruption. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. Sincerely yours, Kevin Parikh Chief Executive Officer Statement of support Avasant wholly supports and adheres to UN’s ten principles of the Global Compact and its endeavour to make this world a more conducive environment that fosters collaborative progress of businesses and society. Avasant believes that corporate social responsibility makes good business sense and imbibes UN’s ten principles across its various processes and practices including  Winning and Retaining Clients  Recruitment and Retaining Employees  Supply chain  Culture and Value System  Sustainable growth, revenue generation and profitability  Accountability to stakeholders, society and the environment Avasant’s adherence to UN’s ten principles of the Global Compact has been detailed as follows: PRINCIPLE 1 BUSINESS SHOULD ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES PRINCIPLE 2 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT AND RESPECT THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY PROCLAIMED HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLE 3 USINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF FORCED AND COMPULSORY LABOUR PRINCIPLE 4 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOUR PRINCIPLE 5 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT OF EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION Internally… Avasant’s Commitment Avasant is a strict equal opportunity employer and believes that its inherent strength lies in the diversity of its workforce. It strongly believes that its employees are its biggest asset. They contribute through their intellect, knowledge, implicit understanding and passion towards Avasant’s goal of guiding its clients through often difficult, uncertain and ambiguous situations. Avasant through its policies upholds human and employee rights and strongly believes in acknowledging and respecting dignity, rights and ambitions of its employees. We treat our employees that are located globally impartially and fairly irrespective of their tradition and values. We had zero attrition during the peak of global financial meltdown and continue to believe in securing the employment of our people. We have a zero tolerance policy for any kind of harassment, discrimination, coercion and misconduct. We believe in fair-trade policy and neither permit nor use any child labour, bonded labour or prison labour. Avasant’s Initiatives Avasant holds formal 360 degree feedback sessions twice a year along with informal interactive “happy hour” sessions at least once a month. Through these interactions, employees voice their concerns and suggest changes to any policy or practice that will help nurture and develop them personally and professionally. Ideas that integrate teams globally and provide equal opportunities are also discussed. Any idea that is favoured by the majority is then taken up as a time bound initiative. Our partners and buddy mentors also hold regular one-to-one sessions with our associates where concerns are discussed freely while maintaining anonymity. Avasant’s Impact Being cognizant of the fact that a consulting job can be demanding on an employee’s time, Avasant supports flexi-working which allows a consultant to work from his/her home as per convenience. We also believe that this lets a consultant maintain a healthy life-balance and offers them more control of their own time. We have received positive feedback from our employee on our policies and believe that it has created good will not just among our employees but also the very people they impact – our stakeholders and clients. Externally… Avasant’s Commitment Avasant has adopted a focused approach to align its Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives with its deep expertise in Outsourcing:  Avasant strongly believes in the philosophy of giving back to the society and supporting the disadvantaged in the society. The firm works with various Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) globally, primarily in areas of sustainable employment generation and social upliftment.  One of major initiative which the firm has been involved is with The Rockefeller Foundation’s “Poverty Reduction through Information and Digital Employment” (PRIDE) program.

Key areas of engagement include:  Providing global best practices related to outsourcing and engaging people from the base of the pyramid in the outsourcing sector  Support analysis of findings in terms of likelihood of policy and incentives adoption  Identifying countries that show the most promise for policy change with a view to understanding where Impact Sourcing is most likely to scale  Developing roadmaps for Impact Sourcing adoption detailing policy levers, incentives and global best practices that countries with outsourcing sectors can implement to promote, support and encourage IS o Help build the network of key Impact Sourcing stakeholders to advance the sector The Impact Sourcing project seeks to achieve growth with equity in Africa by enabling people at the base of the pyramid to tap into employment opportunities generated by the $119 billion global outsourcing sector. Avasant also works with Donor agencies like Rockefeller on impact sourcing in Latin America, India, Eastern Europe and South America by  Creating jobs for those who would not otherwise have the opportunity for sustainable employment  Catalyzing a new sector that leverages the outsourcing sector and substantially improved ICT infrastructure in Africa & globally  Many of these employment opportunities includes call center support, Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) centers, and Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO)  Jobs are targeted to be located in economic development zones, low-income areas, and rural towns with the objective of driving employment and opportunities to lower income individuals Sony Charity Golf Classic Avasant iss proud to sponsor and support 2012 “Sony Electronics Charity Golf Classic” held at the Rancho Bernardo Inn in San Diego on Monday, September 24, 2012.

Upon completion of these documents, suppliers wishing to tender will receive the RFQ/RFP which includes timescales and the format of responses that suppliers must adhere. All tenders provide for an opportunity to allow suppliers to respond with questions and to give an identical time period for all to respond.
