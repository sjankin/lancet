Dr. Karl-Friedrich Rausch DB Mobility Logistics AG Member of the Board of Management DB Mobility Logistics AG • Bellevuestraße 3 • 10785 Berlin • Germany United Nations Global Compact United Nations Plaza New York, NY 10017 USA March 29, 2012 Dear Sir or Madam, Our understanding of a corporate policy oriented towards sustainability is more than just a social commitment. It is the key to our company’s success. Acting sustainably has therefore been deeply anchored within DB for many years. Our employees’ social concerns and the expansion of our product range to promote environmentally friendly transport systems have always been important to us. In addition, ethical business practices that comply with regulations are a basic prerequisite for DB. The Management Board of DB sent a clear message in 2009 by creating the Compliance, Privacy, Legal Affairs and Corporate Security Board Division. In order to continue the successful handling of an increasing variety of opportunities and challenges in our market environment, the Management Board of DB decided in mid-2011 to make sustainability an even more integral part of the corporate strategy and organization. We are convinced that having an economically, ecologically and socially oriented corporate strategy is the only way for us to secure our future as a profitable market leader, top employer and eco-pioneer. An ambitious system of targets that applies internationally will serve as the framework for weighting decisions according to the three sustainability dimensions. As the Group’s Chief Sustainability Officer, I would like to give you a brief progress update on our sustainability activities. One very important issue is to ensure a comfortable, safe and environmentally friendly travel for our customers. We made great efforts in 2010/11 to improve our quality and invested 70 million euros in increasing vehicle and infrastructure availability. In 2011, we also placed a six billion-euro order for 300 new long-distance trains, which will be put into service beginning in 2016 and which will use up to 30 percent less energy per passenger than our current fleet. In the 2011 collective bargaining process, we have agreed with the trade unions to create a collective agreement that is supposed to contain arrangements on job security and provides important answers to demographic change through human resources policies oriented toward the different phases of life and career. We currently have nearly 10,000 trainees and students combining a degree course with work placement, making us not only one of Germany’s largest employers, but also one ...

Our diversity efforts include a participation in the European project “Women in Rail” and setting up measures for families like our “Career with Children” mentoring program. Since 2010, we have involved over 8.500 executives, employees and social partners in nationwide dialogues on culture and have worked with them to generate and implement ideas for change. We want to pursue the process in the coming years and make it an integral part of the future development of what leadership means to us at all levels of management. We have made progress in environmental protection as well. DB has targeted to reduce specific CO2 emissions by 20% worldwide across all modes of transportation between 2006 and 2020. By 2011, we have already managed to reduce emissions by 8.5%. DB’s 2011 decision to increase the percentage of renewable energy in the current traction mix from 21.8% in 2011 to 35% in 2020 is one of the most important strategic tools for achieving our vision of 100% CO2-free rail transport based on renewable energy sources in 2050. We and twelve partners signed a cooperation agreement for the Eco Rail Innovation (ERI) project in summer 2011. The project aims to develop innovative technologies to enable further reductions in CO2 emissions. Furthermore, we have expanded our green product range: initially introduced for rail transport in 2009 we now offer our customers in global logistics alternative CO2-neutral and CO2-reduced products. We have also made key advances in reducing air pollutants by purchasing 130 shunting locomotives equipped with particle filters. By building noise barriers along routes subject to particularly heavy noise and testing innovative technologies in track areas, we are continuing to work toward our target to halve rail noise by 2020 compared to 2000 levels. DB takes its responsibility to uphold and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms very seriously. We ensure that human rights principles are respected and consistently implemented within the context of our global business activities. Establishing a group-wide, decentralized compliance organization with the aim of further preventing corruption and white-collar crime in all of our business units was another of our main objectives in 2011. To manage increasingly complex legal issues, DB developed an IT-supported compliance risk analysis for the entire DB Group as a core element of its compliance efforts. In 2011, DB also introduced a tool that checks the integrity of business partners in a structured way. The tool is currently in the test phase. We are well aware that sustainability entails a constant change process. That is why I am pleased to assure you that DB will continue its efforts to achieve a more sustainable future. Yours sincerely, II.

Together, the partners plan to use ERI as a platform to help equip the rail sector for the future, both economically and environmentally. The project partners’ overarching goal is to make zero emissions a reality for vehicles and installations. Their focus will be on promoting low-emission, energy-efficient components and drive systems – such as energy-storage devices for rail vehicles. The rail sector plans to use ERI to contribute to sustainable mobility, strengthening its role as a technological and scientific leader.
