All of the wastes are sent to disposal/recycling companies licensed by Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning with licensed transport vehicles after they are stored at source in temporal storage area separately under waste management procedure. We work with Environmental Protection and Packaging Waste Recovery and Recycling Foundation (ÇEVKO) regarding the issue of packaging waste management. We are also in the list of Foundation Member of Protection and Packaging Waste Recovery and Recycling Foundation (ÇEVKO). Recycling quotas of our plastic waste by years under Packaging Wastes Control Management are in the table. 2010 2011 2012 %37 %38 %40 WASTES DANGEROUS DOMESTIC RECOVARABLE MEDICAL (CONTAMINE) WASTES WASTES WASTES WASTES 10 1 16. ENVIRONMENTAL APPLICATIONS EFFICIENT USAGE OF NATURAL SOURCES We carry out activities to recycle waste scrap plastics arising in the end of our processes in units within our scope in the factories both in Istanbul and in Izmir. KOROZO TOTAL ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION Korozo Genel Elektrik Tüketimleri ratio 2010 2011 Oran 64.392.025 kWh 63.832.913 kWh -0,9% Our projects about energy efficiency; Electricity and Natural Gas consumption monitoring systems have been set up and are followed before our projects for energy productivity; the projects for energy productivity. Our Energy Management in Industry in Broad Strokes is followed and monitored as it is listed in the articles below. 1-) Monitoring/Measuring Systems 2-) Productive Use of the Engine and Equipment. 3-) To choose productive engines in new investments 4-) Use of Productive Electric Motors. 6 5) Works to increase or remove loss and leakages. 6) Recycling Systems 7) Lightning Systems 8) To follow tariff use 9) Korozo has updated monitoring systems and followed Legal Regulations and Energy Market. Inform and follow-up regarding productive use of the engines have been carried out and are carried out. Attention was paid to particularly energy productivity to choose chiller as a new investment; and 35 % fall has appeared in energy consumption of chillers despite of 17 % rise in its production. Productive armature with high lumen is used in our lightning systems. Project to improve lightning quality has been carried out. 102 16. ENVIRONMENTAL APPLICATIONS Our water consumption is monitored in our destination table within environmental management system. Productive use of water is provided by determining targets to dicrease consumption each year related to productive use of natural resources. We committed to provide 5% dicrease in our management programme. Our works done within this framework are: 1. We designated that we can use the unused water arising from water purifying device as irrigation water analyzing it. 2. We decreased our water consumption turning taps photocell. 3. We made siphons in toilets, with double reservoirs. 4. We arranged activities to raise awareness of all of our workers about productive use of natural resources. Water consumption each year is monitored and targets are given to reduce it in our destination table. Our quantity of Korozo water consumption: around 18000 tons Consumptions are monitored with the target of 5% decrease each year. Water consumption occurs intensely in the part of Processes before Pressure. Waste water arising is sent to our waste water purifying facility being separated at source and is discharged to channel being purified. Measures have been taken through secondary trays against outpouring of chemicals used in production. Soil and surface-ground water pollution are avoided through remnant kits according to our remnant interference procedure. There has been no accident like environmental pollution based on outpouring. Supplying transport vehicles carrying hazardous material firstly go through Safety check pursuant to regulation. Their safely entrance to our company having all of their documents questioned is permitted. Energy management, waste management and productive use of natural resources as Korozo are works conducted to avoid bio-diversity to be affected. Especially productions of environment-friendly plastic packages that turn to natural products in nature in short time also contribute to protect the environment. As Korozo, the zones where our establishments are placed are within organized industrial zone. Thus we carry out our activities without causing damage to cultural and natural resources. We aim to always contribute to protect natural green areas with our social responsibility 10 projects. 3 16.
