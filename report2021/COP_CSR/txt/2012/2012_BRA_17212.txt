Subsequently, a report was presented containing the themes indicated as being important, together with the considerations of the consultancy firm hired to carry out the work. The setting up of this assessment panel fulfilled the commitment signed under Agenda 21 Empresarial, to involve the engagement of stakeholders in the Bank’s credit policies and practices. The development of the sustainability directives for the granting of credit is one of the objectives of risk mitigation efforts as part of the Água Brasil program, which aims to revise, update and improve criteria for the evaluation of socio-environmental risk in internal financing and investment processes. The Água Brasil program is the result of a partnership between Banco do Brasil, Fundação Banco do Brasil (FBB), the National Water Agency (ANA) and WWF Brazil, aimed at raising the awareness of internal and external public audiences of the need for good environmental management and conservation. The idea is to engage the public audiences in the quest for combined solutions, particularly in the responsible management of Brazil’s water resources. To achieve these objectives, the program is organized on four fronts: Socio-Environmental Projects, Communication and Engagement, Risk Mitigation and Sustainable Businesses. As part of the Risk Mitigation front, discussions are also envisaged for the establishment of sustainability directives for the granting of credit in the building and mining sectors. 168 | Banco do Brasil Responsible Credit GRI FS2 | FS3 | HR7 | FS9 As a signatory to the Ecuador PrinciThe project must be in alignment with (when applicable) during the application ples, Banco do Brasil applies the perforthe performance standards of the IFC and implementation of the project, in all mance standards of the International and the EHS (occupational health and relevant aspects; to provide periodic reFinance Corporation (IFC) in the analysafety) directives specific to the sector, ports; and decommission installations, sis of risk for Project Finance.

Annual Report 2011 | 171 The Bank for Foreign Trade Banco do Brasil’s international expansion strategy is based on three key elements: the existence of Brazilian communities abroad, the transnational spread of Brazilian companies, and the increase in commercial interchange between Brazil and the rest of the world. In the last few years, the Bank has been seeking to expand its international presence through acquisitions and acquiring stakes in financial institutions. Thus, it has a presence in twenty-four different countries, with 49 units in its own organic network, focused on different client profiles and markets. The effect of this strategy can be clearly seen in the increased percentage of BB’s overall results, with profits abroad rising from 0.24% in 2009, to close to 4% in 2011. To strengthen this internationalization process, the Institution created the International Business Directorship, which resulted from merging the International Directorship with the Directorship for Foreign Trade, and adopted the following measures: United States: it is BB’s objective to cater to the needs of the more than 1.5 million Brazilian immigrants resident in that country with its financial products and services, and provide support for Brazilian companies that operate in the US, as well as clients in the wholesale segment. In this regard, in 2011, the Bank signed a contract for the acquisition of 100% of EuroBank, for US$6.0 million. The acquisition process was concluded in January 2012, with the necessary authorizations granted by the regulatory bodies involved, both in the United States and Brazil. South America: approximately one year after announcing the signing of a Share’s Sales and Purchase Agreement, in April 2011 the operation to acquire shareholder control of Banco Patagonia S.A., in Argentina, became effective. In fulfillment of the legal and contractual requirements, Banco do Brasil carried out a public offering for the shares of the bank. As a result, BB ended up with 58.96% of the total shareholding. This transaction is in alignment with the idea of building on potential business based on commercial trade flow between Brazil and Argentina, which has grown by 70% over the last four years, in addition to catering to the needs of 400 Brazilian companies for banking services and products. Also in South America, BB plans to carry out inorganic expansion in Chile, expand its presence in Paraguay, revise its presence in Uruguay, as well as setting up a representative office in Colombia, which was authorized by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN) in December 2011. 172 | Banco do Brasil Europe: in 2011, BB concluded its project to revise its operations in Europe, with the aim of consolidating its branches in Spain (Madrid), Italy (Milan), France (Paris) and Germany (Frankfurt) into the structure of its European subsidiary Banco do Brasil AG, whose headquarters is in Austria (Vienna). Centralization improves the governance structure and optimizes results. In addition, a business support center was set up in Portugal – BB Europa Servicing Center –, which provides support for all the units on the continent. The operational strategy in Europe also includes maintaining its branch and security dealing operation (BB Securities Ltd.) in the United Kingdom (London), which operate in synergy with the Bank’s entire structure on the European continent. Asia and Africa: in this context the internationalization strategy will involve the reorganization of the Bank’s structure in the Far East, with the revision of operations in Japan, consolidation of the Bank’s presence in China, expansion of operations in Hong Kong and the setting up of a stock brokerage unit in Singapore. In 2011, Banco do Brasil obtained authorization from the Central Bank of Brazil to transform its representative office in Shanghai (China) into a branch, which will allow it to expand its activities in that country. While, in Africa, the entry strategy involves both organic and inorganic growth, as well as the negotiation of strategic partnerships. Annual Report 2011 | 173 Products and Services BB has the following foreign exchange and commercial trade products and services available: Foreign Trade Services Delegated by MDIC/SECEX: through delegation by the Foreign Trade Secretariat (SECEX), part of the Ministry for Development, Industry and Foreign Trade (MDIC), BB provides foreign trade services to Brazilian importers and exporters, which includes analysis of Import Licenses (LI), alterations to Export Registers (RE) and the issue of “Form-A” certiﬁcates of origin, among others. On-Line Services: the Bank offers a portfolio which includes a series of services which simplify processes and reduce costs for Brazilian companies that trade in export markets. At the end of 2011, 48.0% of the import contracts and 67.5% of the foreign-exchange export contracts were carried out on-line. In total, 43.5% of Banco do Brasil’s foreignexchange transactions are contracted through the internet. Another point of note is the “digital signature” of foreign-exchange contracts, a tool which accounts for the formalization of 49.1% of contracts of this nature. PROEX: in the program for Export Financing (PROEX), BB achieved a record performance of US$554.2 million paid out for this type of ﬁnancing. While in its operations for the passing-on of ﬁnancing from the BNDES-Exim credit line, the amount reached was US$790.4 million. Export and Import Financing: business involving Advances on ForeignExchange Contracts (ACC) and Foreign-Exchange Deliveries (ACE) amounted to a total volume contracted of US$17.4 billion during the year, a new annual record in terms of the amount paid out for this type of business, ensuring BB’s leadership in this market, with a market share of 33.7%. Foreign-Exchange Market: the Bank ended 2011 in a leadership position in the foreign-exchange import and export markets, with respect to volumes of US$45.6 billion and US$76.4 billion, and a respective market share of 22.4% and 29.3%. 174 | Banco do Brasil Highlights in 2011 The agreement was renewed Consultancy services and The Bank also began sales with the Ministry for international business training of the Ourocard Visa Travel Development, Industry and started operating under a new Money card, prepaid in Foreign Trade (MDIC), for a period model, more in keeping with foreign currency, to savings of ﬁve years, for the carrying out the dynamics of the market. account holders who do not of foreign trade services. have current accounts with BB.

Total 129, 179 Annual Report 2011 | 205 Independent auditors’ limited assurance report To The Board of Directors, Shareholders and Other Stakeholders of Banco do Brasil S.A. Brasília DF Introduction We have been engaged for the purpose of applying Limited Assurance Procedures on the sustainability information contained in the Annual Report of Banco do Brasil S.A. and subsidiaries (Banco do Brasil), related to the year ended December 31th, 2011, which was prepared under the responsibility of Banco do Brasil. Our responsibility is to issue a Limited Assurance report on this sustainability information. Procedures of Limited Assurance The limited assurance procedures were performed in accordance with NBC TO 3000 – Assurance Engagement Other than Audit and Review, issued by CFC – Accounting Federal Board and with ISAE 3000 International Standard on Assurance Engagements, issued by International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board., both related to “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”. The procedures comprised: (a) the planning of the work, considering the importance, coherence, volume of quantitative and qualitative information and operational and internal control systems that served as a basis for the preparation of the sustainability information contained in Banco do Brasil’s Annual Report; (b) the understanding of the calculation methodology and the consolidation of the performance indicators through interviews with the personnel responsible for the preparation of information; (c) the comparison, on a sample basis, of the quantitative and qualitative information with the sustainability information disclosed at the Annual Report; and (d) the comparison of the financial indicators with the financial statements and/or accounting records. Reporting Criteria The sustainability information contained in Banco do Brasil’s 2011 Annual Report was prepared according to the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines (GRI-G3) for sustainability reporting and the financial services sector supplement “Financial Services Sector Supplement – Version 3.0. FSSS Final Version”. Scope and Limitations The objective of our work was to apply limited assurance procedures on the sustainability information contained in Banco do Brasil’s Annual Report, on profile items (disclosures that set the overall context for understanding organizational performance such as its strategy, profile, and governance), on management approach and on the sustainability performance indicators and it does not include any evaluation of their policies, practices and sustainability performance. The applied procedures do not represent an examination in accordance with the Brazilian and international audit rules for financial statements. In addition, we do not provide any assurance on the greenhouses gases data and the achievability of future information (such as targets, expectations and ambitions) nor on qualitative information that is under subjective evaluation. 206 | Banco do Brasil GRI G3 Application Level According to the GRI-G3 guidelines, Banco do Brasil declares an Application Level of A+ for its Annual Report, related to the sustainability information for the year ended December 31th, 2011. Banco do Brasil has reported the profile items, the essential performance indicators and the indicators from the financial services sector supplement “Financial Services Sector Supplement – Version 3.0. FSSS Final Version”, as well as some additional indicators that were considered material for their stakeholders. We considered the applied procedures sufficient to agree that the application level declared by Banco do Brasil complies with the GRI-G3 guidelines.
