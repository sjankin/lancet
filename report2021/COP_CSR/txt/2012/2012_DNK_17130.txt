Realisation: 2012-17 In Gjersrud-Stensrud a CO2-neutral life is supported through new, more enjoyable and healthier ways of living together, where the landscape connects and communicates the social’s network. As Oslo’s last expansion area GjersrudStensrud possesses a unique opportunity to redefine how we live. We believe the landscape must always be present, at least 50m from your doorstep to provide amenity value, supporting healthy lifestyles and tackle environmental challenges. The landscape city will become a social and experimental alternative to the way we normally live and think; an alternative that makes it good to live and simultaneously easy and attractive for individuals to take action against climate change. By condensing the built environment, we achieve more nature and new communities in the built and landscape, gathering energy consuming functions which before belonged to the individual household. BJØRVIKA | Oslo Central Harbour Location: Oslo, Norway Client: Municipality of Oslo Design phase: 2006-12 Area: 18 ha. Realisation: 2012-17 New neighborhoods are often built according to plans in which urban spaces occurs as gap between the buildings. In Bjørvika, Oslo’s largest urban development project, the planning is reversed. In an international competition in 2005 SLA won first prize with the development plan of the harbour of Oslo. SLA’s proposal connects downtown Oslo with the bay and creates a new district where the city and the water unite through sensory elements. Central to the masterplan is the creation of a great and vibrant urban life and place specific allmenninger that creates a clear and cultural identity in the new urban areas. The master plan is completed and the development under way. The individual spaces are now under design and realization. The project is one of SLA’s longest collaborations. NOVO NORDISK | Landscape for new Head Quarter of Novo Nordisk Location: Bagsværd, Denmark Client: Novo Nordisk Design phase: 2011-12 Area: 31.000 m2 Realisation: 2012-14 A landscape in 100 percent water balance is the core of SLA’s landscape for Novo Nordisk’s new corporate headquarters. Performative landscape features enhance biodiversity in the area, while there is 100% water balance ie. that all rainwater is percolated or absorbed locally and used recreationally through open streams, ponds and ditches.SLA’s design of the new landscape of Novo is an attractive gathering place where utility and recreational value go hand in hand. Excess soil from the excavation of the bicycle storage is reused for creating a moving surface with varied opportunities for activities and accommodation. At the same time it allows delaying and using the rainwater in the landscape, so the water becomes a visible and attractive part of the experience. the rain water is handled at the surface where the water can evaporate and seep into the ground without burdening the public sewerage system. page 7 SLA is dedicated to promote sustainability, eco-friendliness, and healthy living. These principles SLA incorporates in all our projects, wheter it is counseling, city planning or design of landscapes and urban spaces. SLA participates in the national and international debate on the architectural profession’s sustainability and is a leading reference in Denmark on urban climate change, the acclimatization of our cities and future development of the urban context. Through its practise it is SLA’s hope that it will encourage its client, colleagues and competitors to fullfill and promote the values and ideas of the United Nations Global Compact. page 8
