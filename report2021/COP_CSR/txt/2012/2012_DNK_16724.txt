Part of the growth can be by one year to 49 years. attributed to the changing winter weather while the significant growth in lorry traffic is also due to generally favourable developments in the freight market. In total, Turnover from the road link across Storebælt totals 10.8 million vehicles crossed the bridge. Almost 8.4 milDKK 2,450 million lion passengers travelled by train across Storebælt in 2011, which is a fall of 0.9 per cent on the year. Despite the economic situation, Sund & Bælt’s EBIT increased by DKK 133 million on the year 7.0 million cars crossed the Øresund Bridge, equating to a decline of 1.2 per cent compared to 2010. Lorry traffic During the year under review, DKK 1.5 billion was rerose by 9 per cent which can be ascribed to favourable paid on A/S Storebælt’s interest-bearing net debt, developments in the freight market. Changing winter which totalled DKK 27.6 billion at year end 2011 weather conditions meant that passenger traffic fell by 1.8 per cent on the year. 11.1 million passengers took the train between Denmark and Sweden, which is a rise of 1.5 per cent on the year.

On the basis of the negative fair value adjustment, Øresundsbro Konsortiet achieved a lower equity, which means later dividend payments to the owner companies. The consequences are that the repayment period in respect of the bridge has been reduced by one year and now constitutes 34 years. 4 A nnua l R eport 2 0 1 1 Man ageme n t’ s r eport Traffic Traffic on Storebælt’s road link rose by 3.1 per cent on For HGVs, growth has been particularly pronounced.

The effects of the wintry conditions aside, passenger traffic 2010-2011 2009-2010 2008-2009 was on a par with 2010, i.e. close to zero growth. This is Passenger cars 2.7 -3.1 -0.6 underlined by the fact that traffic in Q2 and Q3 of 2011 Lorries 6.5 -1.5 -10.6 was at the same level as in 2010.

This, however, can hardly explain the Quarterly growth in 2011 compared to the corresponding quarter in 2010 growth in its entirety. It is also important to note that growth on Storebælt rose before the above-mentioned Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 changes on the Århus-Kalundborg service took place.

M a nag ement’s repo rt Ann ual Report 201 1 5 Clean roads on Storebælt Based on the Group’s policy for promoting greater environmental responsibility, Sund & Bælt took part in the Clean Roads Now 2011 campaign, which is aimed at influencing motorists’ attitudes to throwing litter out of their car whilst driving or when stopping at Storebælt’s two lay-bys at Knudshoved and Halsskov. On weekdays, more than 30,000 cars pass through the Storebælt toll station and during the campaign staff at the toll station, wearing jackets carrying the campaign’s message, distributed litter bags and pocket ashtrays to motorists. At the end of the campaign, the network organisation behind Keep Denmark Clean, which instigated the initiative, carried out an analysis of the public’s awareness of the campaign. The results are that approximately 1 million Danes have seen or heard about the campaign. Sund & Bælt intends to participate in the campaign again in 2012. 6 A nnua l R eport 2 0 1 1 Man ageme n t’ s r eport Financial position Within the context of the economic trends, the year’s financial assets and liabilities of DKK 2,888 million net results were satisfactory.

The area comprises a large area with forest, play facilities and other green recreational areas. Located alongside one of Denmark’s busiest motorway sections, the facility is particularly attractive to motorists who have often driven for an extended period when they cross Storebælt. Tiredness is a significant cause of traffic accidents even if the exact number of accidents caused by tiredness cannot be determined. The rest area, therefore, offers an attractive opportunity for motorists crossing the Storebælt link to stop and take a break.

M a nag ement’s repo rt AN N UAL REP ORT 201 1 15 Reinforcing the Kalvebod dyke Sund & Bælt wishes to contribute to greater environmental responsibility in areas where it is believed that the company can contribute its expertise and resources. As a consequence of the potential risk from more storms as well as increases in the water level, the Øresund motorway and the Øresund railway, which lie below sea level over large sections, are exposed to a greater risk of flooding. This is why Sund and Bælt has, for several years, endeavoured to provide the basis for reinforcing the 7 km long Kalvebod dyke on West Amager and raising it by approximately 2 m. In addition to the Øresund link, the Metro and extensive residential areas in Ørestad and Tårnby as well as nature areas at West Amager will be better protected against flooding once the work is completed. The reinforcement of the dyke is being undertaken by Kalvebod Environment Centre, which is currently excavating for a large depot and therefore has surplus soil. West Amager Pumpedigelag is responsible for the project. As a member of the Pumpedigelag Sund & Bælt, together with Kalvebod Environment Centre, has been the driving force behind the project. Due to an official procedure, the project has been dormant since October 2010. The process, however, has been completed and the work was resumed in August 2011. It is expected to be completed before the end of 2012.

The links are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life. With regard to the road and rail link across Storebælt and Øresund’s road link, the links have been divided into sections with identical useful lives: • The main part of the links comprises constructions designed for a minimum useful life of 100 years. For these sections, the period of depreciation is 100 years. • Mechanical installations, crash barriers and road surfaces are depreciated over useful lives of 20-50 years. • The rail links’ technical installations are depreciated over 25 years. • Software and electrical installations are depreciated over usesful lives of 10-20 years. A/S Øresund’s rail link is depreciated over a useful life of 100 years. As Banedanmark is financially responsible for the maintenance of this facility and for normal reinvestments, no differentiation of the depreciation period has been made.

ACO UNTS ANNUAL REPORT 2011 77 Note 23 Financial risk management (continued) (DKK million) The financing expenses’ sensitivity to an interest or inflation rate change of 1 percentage point can be estimated at DKK 30 million and DKK 36 million respectively and the impact will be symmetrical since there is no hedging of the floating interest rate exposure, and with the current level of inflation the lower limit for inflation indexation derived from sold floors on a notional of EUR 190 million will not be effective. When interest rates change, this affects the market value (fair value) of the net debt and, in this respect, the impact and risk are greater on fixed rate debt with long maturities. This is owing to the discounting effect and offsets the alternative cost or gain relating to fixed rate debt obligations in comparison to financing at current market interest rates. The duration denotes the average remaining maturity on the net debt. A long duration implies a low interest rate refixing risk since a relatively small proportion of the net debt needs to be reset to the current interest rate. The duration also expresses the interest rate sensitivity on the net debt stated at market value.

Based on the current operating and maintenance expenses as well as investments relating to the Øresund line, the assessment is that the repayment period for A/S Øresund will be extended by 3-5 years. As the bridge companies have a target for maximum repayment times of 50 years, a capital injection in A/S Øresund is a possibility. The Government has presented a tax package which changes the rules for the carry forward of losses as well as interest deduction limitations. The full consequences of these rule changes are unknown as yet, but the repayment period for the Sund & Bælt Group’s bridge links will be prolonged. At the start of 2012, Femern A/S initiated an analysis of the project’s overall timetable.
