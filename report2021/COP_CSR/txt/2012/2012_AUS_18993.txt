SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 1 contents the road to creating better cities Message from the CEO When I joined Transurban in July this year, one of the things I looked forward to most was the opportunity to make our cities better places to live. Great cities need great transportation— efficient motorway networks and public transport options. And Transurban, as a toll road owner and operator with a focus on the long term, is in an excellent position to work alongside governments to keep our cities moving. This is, and has always been, our challenge and our opportunity. corridors shared with public transport; chairman's welcome Right now cities in Australia and the to integrated transport network On behalf of the Transurban Board, US—both markets where we operate— pricing to encourage the use of public I am proud to present the 2012 are becoming choked with traffic as the transportation.
