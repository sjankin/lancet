The United Nations (UN) Global Compact is globally recognised as the world’s largest strategic policy initiative for businesses and organisations that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principals in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The CEO has been involved in Global Compact member organisations since the Compact was first established in July 2000.

The Authority is an active member of the UN Global Compact Australia (UNGCA) network, hosting and presenting at the national roll out of training for the network members in July 2011 and the Inaugural meeting of UNGCA Environment Leadership Group in April 2012.

Set on the shores of Sydney harbour, Barangaroo is an extraordinary opportunity for urban, waterfront renewal, rarely available to global cities. On the western edge of Sydney’s CBD, this 22 hectare former container port is being transformed into a vital new extension of the city. Barangaroo is set to be a transformative and demonstrational urban renewal project for Sydney and Australia due in part to its progressive environmental and social sustainability commitments that have been embedded into the project delivery in an innovative and financially responsible manner. COMMUNITY WELLBEING ZERO CARBON ZERO WASTE WATER POSITIVE IN BALANCE the next generation in water, waste, carbon & community Barangaroo will set new world benchmarks in sustainability to inspire innovation for generations to come. We aim to be Climate Positive having a net positive impact environmentally, economically and socially, precinct wide and to our external areas of influence. Our goal is to operate as a Climate Positive community, one of the first precincts of its size in the world and certainly the first CBD precinct in Australia, aiming to be:  Water positive – through reduced consumption and water reuse precinct wide and by exporting more recycled water to the CBD than is used across Barangaroo;  Zero waste – through prevention, minimisation, recycling and reuse; and potentially cleaning up more waste from the CBD than we generate within the Barangaroo precinct;  Carbon neutral – through resource efficiency and by generating and offsetting more new renewable energy than total net greenhouse emission generated by the Barangaroo precinct; and  Socially sustainable – by inspiring community wellbeing, through learning and development programs, effective community infrastructure and a distinctive commitment to culture and the arts. September 2012 Barangaroo Communication on Progress 2012 UNGC 4 Barangaroo Delivery Authority Barangaroo seeks to enable people to live happy and healthy lives within a fair share of the earth’s resources. This focus on people and community wellbeing provides the opportunity to move beyond sustainable buildings to sustainable precincts and sustainable lifestyles.
