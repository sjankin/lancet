I am convinced that the keyword for transport development is and must be sustainability. What do I mean when talking about sustainable transport solutions? To start with, it is crucial to reduce the negative impact on the environment. However, we must broaden the Olof Persson, scope and look at it also from the economic and social point of view. President and CEO, Volvo Group I envision a transport system that enables high productivity with energy-efficient solutions which are safe and secure for people and goods. ” I envision a transport system that enables high productivity with energy-efficient solutions which are safe and secure for people and goods. We embarked on our journey towards sustainable transport solutions many years ago. This has resulted in solutions such as environmentally-enhanced products that can operate on renewable fuels, energy efficient solutions such as hybrid technology and systems like Bus Rapid Transit that facilitate efficient public transports. But we are not there yet. A lot is still to be done. To meet society’s need for sustainable transports, cooperation is essential. We are at our very best when we work closely with our business partners, first of all with our customers. It is in the dialogue with our customers we can really understand what drives their business and how we can capture the opportunities to build our common success. Our products and services are important parts of the transport system and in order to develop the most efficient solutions we will continue to engage in partnerships to ­generate ­pioneering knowledge, pool innovation capabilities and develop new solutions adapted to different market ­conditions. 4 This document is a PDF-version of the Volvo Group’s CSR and Sustainability Report 2011.

VOLVO GROUP C SR AND SUS TAINABILIT Y RE PORT 2011 S TR ATEGIC APPROACH Economic growth The interest in and demand for environmentally-enhanced products have increased. The Volvo Group is well positioned to capture the growth opportunities related to this development. This is done by: • Developing new products that enable our customers to choose more sustainable products and services • Expanding the product and service offer linked to the existing business, such as support, to ensure that the products are used in the most environmentally-efficient and safest way, through measures such as driver training, traffic safety and transport academy • Accessing new markets • Creating the future market for sustainable transport ­solutions. Resource effiency Resource efficiency is a matter of economic and strategic importance. As one of the world’s largest manufacturers of heavy commercial vehicles, the Volvo Group has consistently worked to reduce the environmental impact of our products. We have always strived for our operations and products to have the least possible negative environmental impact. But it also makes economic sense to use available resources in the most efficient way, it makes us more competitive. By improving the management of resources such as energy, material and water, we also reduce costs. 10 This document is a PDF-version of the Volvo Group’s CSR and Sustainability Report 2011.

VOLVO GROUP C SR AND SUS TAINABILIT Y RE PORT 2011 S TR ATEGIC APPROACH Global drivers To predict and shape the future In 2012, the Volvo Group celebrates 85 years. In 1927, the first series-produced Volvo car rolled off the production line at the Gothenburg plant and in 1928 the first truck was ­produced. For 85 years, Volvo has developed pioneering products and services, and been a driving force for socio-economic development. the number of megacities and megaregions with populations exceeding ten million is growing rapidly. Approximately 20% of the world’s population is expected to live in cities with populations in excess of two million inhabitants by 2015. This trend is leading to an increased need for transportation. People, as well as large quantities of goods, are transported daily within as well as to and from cities. Cities, particularly major cities, have specific requirements for town and traffic planning. Furthermore, congestion and noise pollution need to be addressed through vehicles specially adapted for urban environments. The Volvo Group’s approach Much has happened since 1927. The Volvo Group has evolved We are working on parallel approaches to improve transport from a small local industry to one of the world’s largest manusolutions for the world’s cities to enable more goods and facturers of trucks, buses and construction equipment with people to be transported without increasing congestion approximately 100,000 employees, production facilities in 20 and emissions. countries and sales in more than 190 countries.

Today approximatly 30% of a truck is produced from recycled material. New materials based on nanostructured compounds or alloys could create light-weight materials without losing the mechanical strength and thus create opportunies to reduce the weight of vehicles. 4. Safety and security Traffic safety is becoming even more important as transportation increases. There has also been an increase in awareness and the demand for safe products and safety guidelines at construction and operation sites. The subject is a high priority for governments and institutions worldwide. 13 This document is a PDF-version of the Volvo Group’s CSR and Sustainability Report 2011.

The vehicles that meet the demanding requirements of EPA 2010 are equipped with both: • Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) • Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). EGR lowers the amount of oxygen in the combustion chamber, which reduces combustion peak temperature and in doing so lowers the formation of NOX. With SCR technology, diesel exhaust fluid, a water solution of urea, is injected into the exhaust stream to convert NOX into harmless nitrogen and water vapor. It is necessary to use both techniques to achieve low emissions as well as high fuel efficiency in vehicles. This unique technology has proven fuel savings of up to 5% compared with the previous engine model. Exhaust emissions The environmental impact of exhaust emissions, PM (Particulate Matter) and NOX (Nitrogen Oxides), is significant as regards the product’s impact on local air quality over its life cycle.

Environmental permits All of the production plants in Sweden have the required environmental permits. 17 facilities in Sweden require permits that cover waste, noise and emissions to land, air and water. No permits had to be renewed in 2011. An annual inventory is made of polluted land on our properties. No remedial operations had to be done at real estate property in 2011. No spillages were reported in 2011. Remediation programs Audits may reveal a need for remedial work at contaminated properties used for former or current operations. Through an ongoing program of remedial measures, contamination discovered in refurbishment or rebuilding projects are dealt with immediately. Installations that pose the greatest risk of causing soil and groundwater contamination, such as underground storage tanks and underground piping systems, have been targeted for rebuilding work under an internal directive focusing on such installations.

All vehicles and transport services are insourced. Volvo Logistics also brings valuable knowledge and experience into Volvo Group’s product development process. To minimize environmental impact, we focus on smart logistics, reduced emissions, renewable fuels, energy efficiency and knowledge-enhancement. Calculating the environmental impact of transports Volvo Logistics plans the logistics for material flows from suppliers to the Volvo Group’s plants and the transport of new vehicles from the plants to the dealers. The EnvCalc tool is used to calculate emissions to air for new or changed transport routes or for choice of carriers. The calculation is based on the volume of goods, distance and mode of transport. The result is presented to the customer as Environmental Load Units (ELU) or broken down into the amounts of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, sulphur oxide and particle matter emissions. Volvo Logistics also offers customers a Logistics Emission Report for a specified transport scope, such as all inbound Carbon footprint reduced by 22% and outbound transports for a specific plant over one year. Between 2006 and 2010, emissions of carbon dioxide Logistic Emission Reports were supplied to seven of the from the rail, road and short sea land-based transportation Volvo Construction Equipment plants in Europe, and to of goods to and from the Volvo Group’s plants in Europe, three Volvo Parts warehouses in 2011.

VOLVO GROUP C SR AND SUS TAINABILIT Y RE PORT 2011 E nvironmental Responsibility Clean shipping and intermodal transports A significant portion of our transports, measured in tonkilo­ meters, are done by sea. Since 2010, all of our contracted sea carriers have been required to report the environmental impact of each of their vessels. The driving force of the Clean Shipping Project is a network of 30 of the largest export and import companies in Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands of which the Volvo Group is one. The main objective of this project is to catalyze a process towards effectively functioning techniques for clean shipping and to place stringent but reasonable health and environmental demands on ship transport. We clearly communicate environmental requirements for shipping operators in respect of chemicals, water, fuel and waste control, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and particle matter, which have been formulated in a clean shipping index. Longer trucks The Volvo Group is in favor of flexible truck combinations based on present vehicles modules where longer combinations are a possibility to increase transport efficiency. The maximum length for truck and trailer is 25.25 meters in Sweden, and 18.75 meters for the rest of Europe. Increasing the truck length in Europe would mean that two trucks could carry what is currently transported by three trucks. This would benefit the environment and reduce congestion on European highways. Volvo Logistics uses the longest truck available in Sweden aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. A 32 meter long vehicle shuttles between our terminal in Arendal, Gothenburg and the Port of Gothenburg. This means that two 40-foot-long containers can be transported instead of one, a reduction of 20 grams of carbon dioxide per tonkilometer. Using a 32 meter long truck with two 40-feet containers results in a 20 gram carbone dioxide reduction per ­tonkilometer. Did you know? Between 2006 and 2010, emissions of carbon dioxide from the rail, road and short sea transportation of goods to and from the Volvo Group’s plants in Europe, was reduced by 22%. 67 This document is a PDF-version of the Volvo Group’s CSR and Sustainability Report 2011.

In many countries, the Group is an important part of society. As a company and as individuals, we engage with society in ­different ways. We have gathered a sample of projects supported and activities carried out during the year. • Renault Trucks donated a minibus to help disabled children in Dakar, Senegal, get to school. The donation was made together with Michelin to the Solidarité Laique Association. In a country where disability is still a taboo subject, the minibus will provide transport to school for approximately 50 children. • Renault Trucks donated 23 vehicles to a number of different technical colleges and apprentice training centers.

The aim of developing strategic partnerships is to support the Volvo Group’s vision by creating platforms for developing pioneering knowledge, pool innovation capabilities and secure skilled competence for the future. A partnership should provide benefits for the society and add value to the business.
