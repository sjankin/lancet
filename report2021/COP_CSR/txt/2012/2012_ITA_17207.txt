STAKEHOLDERS Operating on the national and international market today requires a capability to innovate, offer new services and guarantee high levels of quality. GRI/G3.1 > 1.1 Above all in road safety. Our commitment on this has yielded a constant stream of improvements. The number of fatal accidents on our network has dropped 19% since 2010 – and this is thanks to Tutor, an automatic speed detection system installed on 39% of the Autostrade per l’Italia network, to extension and upgrading with 3rd and 4th lanes to improve traffic flow, to the near total coverage of the network with draining pavement, to massive installation of traffic info systems in collaboration with government agencies and the Traffic Police, and to information and prevention campaigns addressing travellers. In 2011, Autostrade per l’Italia in accord with the Traffic Police started to experiment Overload Tutor, a system that identifies and stops commercial vehicles travelling on the motorway overloaded, a practice that often causes accidents, sometimes very serious ones. Regarding workplace safety, Autostrade per l’Italia obtained OHSAS 18001: 2007 certification of its health & safety management system from TÜV Italia for all its activities, including motorway network development. On the environmental protection front, Autostrade per l’Italia entered a voluntary carbon footprint agreement with the Environment Ministry in 2011 to define a systematic framework for the various activities it has been carrying on to date to safeguard ecosystems and contain climate change. The project provides for the adoption of methods in line with international protocols for calculating carbon footprint over a given section of motorway and auditing CO2 emissions produced by infrastructure operation. 02 Another significant result in 2011 was recorded in what is one of the Group’s cutting-edge businesses: technological innovation at the service of mobility. Last October, Autostrade per l’Italia entered a partnership agreement with the French government to produce and operate a satellite toll system for heavy vehicles over 3.5 tonnes on around 15,000 km of the French road network. The Group’s commitment to sustainability and integrated reporting of its activities in line with the demands of institutional and financial stakeholders and the global market in general has been carried forward. New developments here include our decision to join an integrated reporting pilot programme under the guidance of the International Integrated Reporting Committee (IIRC). Atlantia kept its place in the Dow Jones Sustainability World index for the 3rd year running, gaining maximum scores in the Customer Relationship Management, Codes of Conduct/Compliance/Corruption&Bribery, and Human Capital Development categories. In 2011, we also stepped up our commitment to the Global Compact, which we joined in 2004, and were given a seat on the Committee that manages the network in Italy. The period we are going through requires everyone – government, businesses, workers, civil society – to make concerted efforts to generate new growth prospects in the shortand longterm. This is why a company that maintains an important slice of the country’s infrastructural assets must rise to the challenge and campaign for growth; it must exploit the opportunities offered by the globalized market and meet the demands and needs of the community in which it operates. Business as usual.

Income statement amounts for 2010, other than profit for the year, are therefore different from those published in the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2010, due to the reclassifications carried out. (b) The figures for 2011 benefit from the contribution from the Brazilian motorway operator, Triangulo do Sol Auto–Estradas, consolidated from 1 July 2011, following the acquisition of a further 20% stake during the third quarter of 2011, in addition to the 50% interest already held. A further 10% of the company was acquired during the fourth quarter of 2011, giving the Atlantia Group an 80% interest in the Brazilian operator at the end of 2011. (c) Operating cash flow is calculated as profit + amortisation/depreciation +/– provisions/releases of provisions + financial expenses from discounting of provisions+/– impairments/reversals of impairments of assets +/– share of profit/(loss) of investments accounted for using equity method +/– (losses)/gains on sale of assets +/– other non–cash items +/– portion of net deferred tax assets/liabilities recognised in the income statement. (d) Gross operating profit (EBITDA) is calculated as operating revenues – operating costs except amortisation/depreciation, impairments/reversals of impairments of assets, provisions/releases of provisions and provisions for adjustments.

The Report was prepared in accordance with the “Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G3.1” GRI/G3.1 > 3.1 published by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The effects of applying version 3.1 compared to the previous version used to draw up the 2010 Report are: disaggregation of workforce data by gender (turnover, geographical distribution, grades, training, remuneration, accidents, etc.); introduction of a new indicator (rate of retaining job after parental leave); disaggregation of accident rates by geographical region. Also introduced, on an experimental basis in the “Environmental Responsibility” section, are three new indicators (CRE1 Building energy intensity, CRE2 building water intensity, CRE3 greenhouse gas emissions intensity from building) provided for in the supplement to the GRI “Construction & Real Estate” sector relevant to motorway companies and whose application will be obligatory from the 2012 Report onwards. The GRI Protocol Boundary and GRI Indicator Protocol were also followed, where applicable. GRI/G3.1 > 3.5 The 2011 Sustainability Report shows a maximum level of compliance with the aforesaid guidelines (level A+). Information and indicators were selected on the principle of materiality in terms of information content and relevance to the organization’s business and its stakeholders’ interests. In 2004, Autostrade per l'Italia joined the Global Compact , a UN initiative to promote corporate social responsibility and support ten principles regarding human and labour rights, the environment and the fight against corruption. Activities carried out and results attained by the Organization are integrated in this Report by means of a table (see end of Report) linking the 10 principles and the GRI indicators.

In addition to operating sections of motorway, the Group offers integrated solutions for the motorway industry, from design and construction to maintenance. Spea Ingegneria Europea is one of the main Italian engineering companies in the transport infrastructure sector. Pavimental is the Group’s specialist in motorway and airport construction and maintenance. One of the pillars of the Group is technological innovation for mobility: from the introduction in the early ’90s of Telepass (which now has 7.7 million customers) to the implementation in Austria of a free-flow toll system and the recent adjudication, in a tender called by the French government, of a contract to produce and operate an obligatory satellite toll system for heavy vehicles in transit (Eco Taxe Poids Lourds). The system will be introduced on around 15,000 km of the French road network. Not least, Autostrade per l'Italia developed Safety Tutor, an average speed control system that has proved decisive in reducing the accident rate on the Italian motorway network. The Group also develops GRI/G3.1 > 2.7, 3.11 numerous transport information instruments of fundamental importance for traffic management on motorway networks. 1.2 The Group 51,7091 million km were travelled on Autostrade per l’Italia’s network in 2011, of which 40,380 million by light vehicles (78% of the total) and 11,329 million by heavy vehicles in Italy (22%). On a comparable perimeter basis, kilometres travelled was down 1.3% on 2010 (light vehicles -1.7% and heavy vehicles -0.2%). Nearly all the concession companies put in negative results, most notably Tangenziale di Napoli and Autostrada A3 Napoli, both down 3.7%. The traffic trend is a direct reflection of the negative overall situation in Italy. The Group is currently working on a programme to upgrade around 860 km of network, at a total cost of around €20 billion and to be completed by the end of the concession. The aim is to enable the network to handle growing volumes of traffic and improve efficiency and safety. AUTOSTRADE IN NUMBERS 1,350 variable message panels 2,364 traffic control cameras 2,504 km of network covered by the Tutor safety system (39% of the Group’s network) 241 service areas 73 “Punto Blu” customer help desks 2,194 toll gates, of which 480 for Telepass traffic With the exception of the Variante di Valico and the so-called “Gronda di Genova” (the Genoa node between the A10 and A7 motorways) and new sections under construction by concession operators belonging to the Group, the programme consists mainly of widening existing motorways with third and fourth lanes to increase the network’s traffic capacity and eliminate bottlenecks. (1) This figure refers to traffic on motorways operated by Autostrade per l’Italia SpA and its Italian concession holding subsidiaries and does not include 239 million km travelled on sections operated by Società Autostrada Tirrenica pA, of whose capital 69.1% was transferred on 28 November 2011. 13 ITALIAN NETWORK UNDER CONCESSION Udine Mont Blanc Aosta Milan Turin Venezia Bologna Genoa Florence Livorno Ancona Pescara Rome Bari Naples Taranto Autostrade per l’Italia and subsidiaries network Other concessionaires MAIN INVESTMENT PROJECTS Autostrade per l’Italia Total km Km completed €/mld (1) total €/mld completed 1997 Agreement 237 155 6.5 4.2 2002 IVth Addendum 266 126 5.6 2.0 2007 Single concession agreement (2) 326 5.0 Other works 2.0 0.1 Total 829 281 19.1 6.3 Italian subsidiaries (3) Construction of Raccordo Autostradale Valle d’Aosta 12 12 0.4 0.4 Construction of 3rd lane of Autostrade Meridionali 20 16 0.6 0.4 Total 32 28 1.0 0.8 Group total 861 309 (1) Total cost of carrying out the works, as assessed as at 31 December 2011, including the base bid price (net of bid or agreed reductions), available funds, recognised reserves and early completion bonuses. The value of works under the Arrangement of 1997 are net of an amount included in “Other investment”. (2) The Single Arrangement signed by Autostrade per l’Italia on 12 October 2007 provides for the further upgrades of the network, totalling around 330 km, at a cost of approximately €5 billion, in addition to new specific projects worth approximately €2 billion. (3) In 2011 the operators Strada dei Parchi SpA and Società Autostrada Tirrenica pA were deconsolidated. 14 In 2011, work was done on over 60 km: GRI/G3.1 > EC8 • upgrading of the A14 between Rimini Nord and Porto S. Elpidio (widening from 2 to 3 lanes on a total of 154.7 km) and completion of work on a 68 km section between Ancona Sud and Porto S. Elpidio; • opening to traffic of the 3rd lane from Roma Nord to Settebagni (16 km) and the new exit at Castelnuovo di Porto; • opening to traffic of the 3rd southbound lane between Scandicci and Firenze Sud; • upgrading of the Lainate-Como Grandate section of the A9 (from km 11 to km 34): 3 lanes widening and emergency lane) with opening to traffic of the Lainate link road between the A8 and A9 and completion of upgrading works on around 6 km of motorway; • Variante di Valico construction project: completion of works on 24 km. During work on the network, Autostrade per l’Italia does its best to limit inconvenience for users. All projects provide for the adoption of measures to minimize effects on traffic flow and safeguard travellers and personnel. In particular, widening is done without reducing the number of lanes and when traffic has to be limited or suspended, this is done on days and at times of lower traffic flow. 1.3 The Group outside Italy The Group is gradually building up its international operations by acquiring significant GRI/G3.1 > 2.5 interests in high growth rate countries like Brazil, Chile, India and Poland, where it now operates around 900 km of network under concession.

Sustainability requires awareness on the part of all players involved that respect for the fundamental principles of fairness, loyalty, scrupulousness, ethics and transparency in day-to-day work and of equal opportunities for everyone regardless of gender, race, nationality, age and religious beliefs are not options but indispensable requisites. In Autostrade per l’Italia, the principles of sustainable development mean safeguarding the working conditions, health and safety and wellbeing of the people who work everyday to achieve our business objectives, respect for the environment, on which the Group’s operations have such pervasive effects, focussing on the community and on creating opportunities for overall growth in our business to the social and economic benefit of all our stakeholders. Infrastructure systems are critical elements in any country, being capable of accelerating or retarding development at home and relations with other countries. The players directly or indirectly involved must necessarily adopt an integrated approach, both internally and in relation to the system as a whole, which needs to be oriented towards sustainability with increasing rigour. Autostrade per l’Italia has been working for years to apply the principles of sustainable development so that all its activities, whether internal or external, are carried on in full awareness that its performance, as the leading motorway operator in Italy, is crucial to the country’s future. Sustainability also works on a strategic level, it is synergically integrated in the business, its extended governance models and the processes and mechanisms that implement them are all designed to control the impact of operations not only in the shortbut more significantly the long-term. Autostrade per l’Italia is constantly assessing the risks and possible repercussions for society and the environment posed by each phase in the life cycle of infrastructure, from design through construction to operation, and aims to maximize its positive effects and neutralize the negative ones, all the while monitoring the evolution of the process. 20 Autostrade per l’Italia is well aware that progress towards sustainability depends on human resources. An enterprise’s employees are capital, they must be developed and involved to achieve their real worth. This is the aim of the policies, processes and instruments that have been put in place and are being constantly upgraded and refined on both a professional level throughout employees’ careers in the company, and on a personal level though programmed improvements to the wellbeing of employee’s and their families. The sustainable development model cannot be implemented without a full life cycle approach or by merely following the letter of the law. Impact on the environment and society is felt above all in the long-term and requires innovative preventive action. Sustainability parameters cannot be optimized by merely tweaking existing production and consumption models. These considerations have been assimilated by the business in the form of research and development projects driving major improvements in performance. This involves both network safety and fluidity and education on environmentally responsible conduct, with a strong focus on countering climate change through use of renewable energy sources and widespread use of solutions providing increasing degrees of eco-compatibility. Sustainability at a strategic level also means adopting an integrated approach entailing systematic stakeholder engagement. From the supply chain to customers and government, Autostrade per l’Italia works through communication and education, dialogue and constructive debate on critical issues to achieve synergy in terms of overall growth, a task facilitated by the gradual spread of models of conduct that respect the environment and society. Autostrade per l’Italia’s sustainability strategy received official recognition in 2011 too (its listed holding company, Atlantia, is ranked in a number of ethical indexes, such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index) and has also taken up new challenges. These include voluntary participation in an International Integrated Reporting Council pilot programme to define a framework for integrated enterprise reporting (economic/financial, social, environmental and governance). A number of initial results in this connection will be seen in the company’s reporting on 2011. 21 2.2 Participation in initiatives and official recognition Membership of sustainability initiatives GRI/G3.1 > 4.8, 4.12 Global Compact: launched in 1999 to promote 2004: Autostrade per l’Italia corporate social responsibility. signs up Supports ten basic principles designed to safeguard human and labour rights, protect the environment and fight corruption.

SUPPLIERS Supply Chain 33 2.4 Innovation and technology Over the years Autostrade per l’Italia has become a leading force for technological innovation in the infrastructure and transport industry. The technological solutions it has developed have various aims, including: • raising quality of service in terms of safety and traffic flow, partly through network upgrading, maintenance and monitoring; • improving the operational management of the network and the efficiency of transport with specially developed IT systems; • minimizing the environmental impact of motorway activity starting with the motorway infrastructure design phase and through infrastructure management based on the sustainability criteria underlying national and European environmental objectives. R&D and innovation activities are carried out both in-house and in collaboration with research centres and universities and, on occasion, in partnership with other companies. Work in this area also includes participation in various bodies and associations, national and European, engaged in defining transport regulations regarding, for example, safety, implementation of intelligent transport systems and remote tolls and input for drafting European and national R&D and innovation programmes. In 2011, total investments and costs sustained by the Group for its innovation and R&D activities amounted to €12.7m, up 51% on the previous year. The figure represents the sum of all resources dedicated by Autostrade per l’Italia to research and development, including operating costs, investments and personnel costs (full-time and part-time).

GRI/G3.1 > 4.1 Corporate governance structure Atlantia SpA has adopted a traditional governance system which includes, in addition to the board of directors, statutory audit committee and external auditors, a series of committees and other bodies, some of which provided for in Atlantia’s Corporate Governance Code (basically assimilating the provisions of Borsa Italiana’s Code of Conduct for Listed Companies, March 2006) and others set up voluntarily by the company. The latter also include the sustainability and corporate social responsibility functions. GRI/G3.1 > 4.6, 4.7, 4.9, 4.10 Board of Directors The Board of Directors (BoD) is the body designated to govern the Company and therefore has exclusive competence and full powers of management. It pursues the priority objective of creating value for the stakeholders in observance of the law and regulations, the provisions of the Company’s Code of Ethics and the principles of sustainable development in general. It approves the Company’s and Group’s strategic, industrial and financial plans (including long-term ones) and the Group’s consolidated budget, it defines the Group’s corporate governance guidelines, and assesses all projects and initiatives that significantly impact on the Company’s performance in terms of opportunities and risks. It is called on every year to approve the Sustainability Charter and Sustainability Report. GRI/G3.1 > 4.2, 4.3 Composition of the Board of Directors Member Esecutive Non-executive Independent Other posts** Fabio Cerchiai (Chairman) X 8 Giovanni Castellucci (CEO) X 4 Gilberto Benetton X 7 Alessandro Bertani X 5 Alberto Bombassei X X 5 Stefano Cao X 9 Roberto Cera X Alberto Clò X X 3 Antonio Fassone X 3 Giuliano Mari X X 3 Gianni Mion X 7 Giuseppe Piaggio X 8 Paolo Zannoni X 3 Antonino Turicchi X X Monica Mondardini (since 20 January 2012) X X **Number of administration or control offices held in other companies listed on regulated markets, finance houses, banks, insurance companies or other large organizations. 38 On 30 November 2011, Prof. Malinconico resigned and was replaced on 20 January 2012 by Monica Mondardini, bringing the number of non-executive directors to 13. Regarding the non-executive directors, their number and authority are such as to ensure that their judgement has a significant influence over the Board’s decisions and brings specific professional expertise and experience to bear on boardroom discussion, thereby favouring the voting of motions in the best interests of the Company. The independence requisites of the independent directors (whose number is deemed adequate) were verified by the Board of Directors of Atlantia SpA’s BoD, while the Board of Auditors checked that the criteria and procedures used by Board in that assessment were correctly applied. The BoD is exclusively responsible for assessing the adequacy of the Company’s and Group’s organization, administration and accounting structures and their general performance, periodically checking actual against programmed results and examining and assessing conflict of interest situations. The Board makes such assessments on the basis of information received from Company officers, Company and Group management and the internal control function. In so doing it takes into special account information received from the Chairman, the CEO and the Internal Control and Corporate Governance Committee. Assessment of the size, composition and workings of the Board of Directors The Listed Companies Corporate Governance Code requires the Board of Directors to assess the composition and functioning of the Board and its Committees at least once a year. The Board may also express its opinion on the maximum number of directorships or statutory auditorships that directors may hold in other companies listed on regulated markets, finance houses, banks, insurance companies or other large organizations without being incompatible with effective performance as a director of the Company. Regarding the assessment process, which had been carried out on a self-assessment basis for two years, the Board decided in its meeting on 16 December 2011 to retain an external consulting firm, Crisci & Partners, to assess the composition and functioning of the Board and its Committees for 2012. BOARD OF DIRECTORS (AT 20.01.2012) Members 15 Executive 2 Non-executive 13 Independent** 5 Board meetings in a year 11 Meetings of the independent directors in a year 1 Attendance rate* 92% Directors’ ages: (G3.1-LA13) 40 – 50 years 13% 50 – 60 years 20% 60 – 75 years 67% % women 94% % men 94% * Compared to the BoD as of 31/12/2011. ** Independent as per the definition in the 2011 Corporate Governance and Ownership Report, which can be consulted on www.atlantia.it. 39 To enable the directors to be sufficiently well informed for the needs of their roles, the Chairman organized a series of initiatives to enrich their knowledge of the business and update them on new legal and regulatory developments. There were also a number of induction days in which directors and statutory auditors were given information on the strategy for and state of activities in service areas, on energy sourcing, self-production and saving, on toll system technology and business, on road surface and civil works maintenance systems, on the Eco Taxe Poid Lourds project and on activities under the communication plan. Board of Auditors The current Board of Auditors of Atlantia SpA, chaired by Marco Spadaccini, was appointed by the shareholders on 23 April 2009 for the financial years 2009, 2010 and 2011. The Board of Auditors met 18 times in 2011 and also met periodically with the statutory audit company, the officer charged with drafting the Company’s accounting documents and the internal control officers. In 2011, the Board of Auditors addressed the matter of engaging a statutory audit company for financial 2012 to 2020, involving competitive bidding to identify an auditor to propose to the Shareholders’ Meeting. Eight meetings were dedicated to this matter and the chairmen (or their delegates) of the statutory audit committees of all the subsidiaries were also invited for the purpose of being informed on the process and results of the selection of the external audit company. Shareholders’ Meetings The directors encourage and facilitate the highest possible attendance of shareholders at General Meetings and provide all the information and documents (also on the website) needed for informed participation in meetings. There are no specific procedures enabling minority shareholders or employees to make GRI/G3.1 > 4.4 recommendations or issue directives to the BoD, as there are no such provisions in current company law. Shareholders may interact with the Company through the Investor Relations function and the Shareholders Office, while employees can communicate via the Central Human Resources Department. One Shareholders’ Meeting (ordinary session) was held in 2011. It examined and approved the financial statements for 2010 and voted a dividend, changes to the 2009 Stock Option Plan and further incentive schemes, including long-term plans. The Shareholders also met in an extraordinary session to vote an unpaid capital increase and modifications to the by-laws. GRI/G3.1 > 4.1 Board of Directors Committees The November 2011 update of Atlantia’s Corporate Governance Code retained the committees contemplated in Borsa Italiana’s Corporate Governance Code as updated in March 2010. The Human Resources Committee changed its name to Human Resources and Remuneration Committee to reflect the extension of its tasks. There is no appointments committee because directors are appointed by a list voting procedure provided for in art. 20 of the By-laws in transparent terms complying with the requirements of the Listed Companies Corporate Governance Code. The shareholders have so far had no problem in producing lists of candidates, so Atlantia’s BoD has not deemed it necessary to set up such a committee. The BoD has not set up an executive committee. 40 Independent Directors’ Related-Party Transaction Committee On 21 October 2010, in compliance with Consob Regulations on Related-Party Transactions (resolution 17221, 12/03/2010, and subsequent amendments), Atlantia set up an Independent Directors’ Related-Party Transaction Committee comprising three independent directors. This Committee is called on to express its opinion on Atlantia’s Related-Party Transaction procedure and modifications thereto, on any relative modifications to the Bylaws and on Atlantia’s “related-party transactions of greater importance”. The Committee met five times in 2011. GRI/G3.1 > 4.5 Human Resources and Remuneration Committee The BoD set up a Human Resources and Remuneration Committee comprising five directors, a majority of whom non-executive and including two independent directors. The Committee provides the Board with information, consulting and proposals. At least one member of the Committee has adequate expertise and experience in finance, as ascertained by the BoD at the time of appointment. The Committee submits proposals to the Board of Directors regarding the overall remuneration of the Company’s Chairman, the CEO, directors holding special offices and executives with strategic responsibilities. The Committee also submits proposals regarding the performance objectives used for the variable part of remuneration and checks on their actual achievement, and examines any stock option or cash incentive plans for Company or Group employees, the criteria for the composition of boards of directors of subsidiaries of strategic importance and policies for the strategic development of human resources.. The Committee met six times in 2011. Business included the final amounts of the longterm incentive plan and the updating of the 2009 stock option plan for the Group management, final calculation of the CEO’s 2010 MBO, fixing of criteria for variable remuneration in 2011, the 2011 Stock Option and Stock Grant plans, definition of a general remuneration policy for the Chairman, the CEO, directors holding special offices and executives with strategic responsibilities (for further details, see the Annual Report and Corporate Governance Report). In line with art. 7, Borsa Italiana Corporate Governance Code (assimilated in art. 10 of Atlantia’s Corporate Governance Code), the general remuneration policy for directors and executives with strategic responsibilities (approved by Atlantia’s BoD on 16 December 2011) is to be illustrated, from 2012 on, in a report submitted by the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee and approved by the BoD. Such report will be submitted to the Shareholders’ Meeting in April 2012 and will be available on Atlantia’s website. Internal Control and Corporate Governance Committee This Committee advises, makes recommendations and generally assists in verifying the operation of the internal control system. Its members in 2011 were: • non-executive director Giuseppe Piaggio (chairman); • independent non-executive director Giuliano Mari; • independent non-executive director Antonino Turicchi (elected from minority list). The Committee met 10 times in 2011. 41 GRI/G3.1 > 1.2, 4.9 Internal control system and risk management In 2011, Atlantia continued to review and adapt its internal control system, ie. the rules, procedures and organizational structures for identifying, measuring, managing and monitoring the main risks for the purpose of ensuring conduct of business on sound and fair principles and in line with objectives. The BoD defines guidelines for the internal control system, assesses its adequacy and effectiveness and makes sure the main business risks (operating, financial or other) are properly identified, managed and monitored. The CEO is charged with overseeing the working of the system and defines the instruments and procedures for operating the internal control system in line with policy provided by the Board; he makes sure the system as a whole is adequate and properly working and duly modified to meet operating circumstances or new legislation; and he recommends to the Board the appointment or revocation of one of more internal control officers. To verify proper functioning of the internal control system, the Board of Directors is assisted by the Internal Control and Corporate Governance Committee and one or more officers with a suitable level of independence and adequate means for carrying out such function. The CEO orders any modifications to the internal control system deemed necessary on the basis of the findings of the aforementioned control work. GRI/G3.1 > 1.2 Internal control officers: Internal Audit and Risk Management The internal control officers are the Internal Audit manager and Risk Management officer, who report on their work to the Chairman, the CEO, the Internal Control and Corporate Governance Committee and the Statutory Auditors. Internal Audit has the functions of monitoring and checking the correct operation of the internal control system in an annual programme of internal auditing designed to verify the adequacy and operational effectiveness of the Internal Control System and compliance with the law and Company procedures and provisions. It carries out monitoring of the “organization, management and control model pursuant to Law 231/01” on behalf of the Company’s Supervisory Board. The Internal Audit unit is charged with identifying areas for improvement in internal auditing work, monitoring the “organization, management and control model pursuant to Law 231/01” and making proposals for corrective action to the CEO, the relevant function heads and internal control officers. GRI/G3.1 > S03 Internal Audit must also follow-up the corrective action they recommend and report on its completion to the CEO, the relevant function heads and internal control officers. In 2011, Internal Audit ran 38 audits across 13 Group companies to monitor prevention and control of risks relating to corruption and it organized training activities (involving over GRI/G3.1 > HR3, S02 3,000 Group employees in Italy and abroad) focusing on the Company’s anti-corruption policies and procedures. GRI/G3.1 > SO4 There were no cases of corruption in any Atlantia Group companies in 2011 or, therefore, any corrective action. The Risk Management unit, which reports directly to the CEO, is responsible for the Group level management process for risks identified in the Company’s Business Risk Model (compliance risk, regulatory risk and operational risk). 42 The framework Atlantia has adopted for these activities is the COSO Enterprise Risk Management (hereafter ERM), which is considered the main international benchmark and provides a number of parameters used by Standard & Poor’s for the purposes of its corporate ratings. The Risk Management Unit’s main tasks are to: • draw up an annual risk assessment plan for the Company in line with indications from top management, control officers and the findings of Internal Audit; • carry out any risk management intervention not provided for in the plan, acting on specific instructions; • support company structures in the process of identifying, assessing, managing and monitoring risks, also through ad hoc communication and training; • submit proposals to the top management for modifications of the internal control system, monitor implementation of same and assist the structures involved; • carry out periodical maintenance of the risk catalogues of Atlantia, Autostrade per l’Italia and the concession holding subsidiaries in order to adjust for the effects of internal organizational change and new legislation, the results of risk analysis and audits. The Unit also assists the Supervisory Bodies in preparing and updating the illegality risk maps contemplated in law decree 231/01, and in activities preliminary to the drafting or periodical revision of the Organization, Management and Control Model promulgated by said law. GRI/G3.1 > 1.2 Business Risk Model For its internal control, Atlantia opted for separation of responsibilities between, on one hand, the structure actively following the process of risk management and designing the relative controls (“ex-ante” activities) and, on the other, the independent structure overseeing the adequacy and operational efficiency of the Internal Control System (“expost” activities). The process of identifying, assessing, managing and monitoring risks is disciplined by the “Risk Management Process” internal procedure, which describes how risk interventions are activated and managed. Penalties for breaching laws disciplining relationships with ANAS and the October 2008 Agreement and other agreements with other Group concession operators stipulated in 2010 Co Penalties for infringement of laws in particular. k m and regulations in general. Regul isk ato ce r ry an ris pli Opera tional risk Failure of the Company’s organization structure, processes, procedures and controls to adequately support pursuit of its corporate purpose. 43 The Risk Management Unit’s main activities in 2011 were: 1. extension of the ERM model to Telepass SpA, involving a specific risk assessment to produce a personalized risk catalogue to be updated annually by Risk Management; 2. start up of illegality risk mapping for Autostrade per l’Italia SpA following the introduction in August 2011 of art. 25-undecies, decree law 231/01 on environmental offences, and preparations for updating the relative Organization, Management and Control Model contemplated in said decree and Confindustria guidelines; 3. risk analysis of processes inherent to the security of Autostrade per l’Italia’s ICT systems; 4. a risk management operation involving a Stalexport operating process. Risk Management also continued its periodical on-the-job training for Autostrade per l’Italia managers on the subject of risk and the control systems they are responsible for. Supervisory Board Atlantia’s Supervisory Board is made up of a chairman, the Company’s General Counsel and the head of the Internal Auditing Department. It met four times in 2011 and dealt with issues relating to regulatory changes, updating of the Organization, Management and Control Model and implementation of the action plan for monitoring and assessing the adequacy and actual implementation of the Model. The Supervisory Boards of Group companies also implemented plans to monitor and assess the adequacy of their organization, management and control models. Scheduled operating checks were carried out by the parent company’s Internal Audit and periodical reports on supervisory activities were submitted to the companies’ boards of directors and statutory audit committees. GRI/G3.1 > 1.2 Crisis Management Autostrade per l’Italia’s organization is systematically geared to preventing risks and maintaining a crisis management capability to ensure safe transit on motorway sections in certain special circumstances. This requires technical, management and organizational measures to deal with emergencies and take the appropriate traffic measures, all of which through continuous co-operation with internal and external subjects (traffic police, fire service, civil protection, etc.). The heads of the regional offices (Sections) are responsible for crisis management, while the network operations manager is responsible for coordination. The main emergencies are caused by snow, flooding, landslides, fires and accidents involving hazardous goods. 44 Snowfall is the phenomenon involving the most intervention. In 2011, snow events were down 73% on 2010 (60,372 hours of snow x km (*) against 224,934 in 2010). To handle unforeseen climatic events, Autostrade per l’Italia draws up a complex emergency plan every year, providing for: • monitoring of weather conditions (forecasts provided by the relevant local sources: regional ARPA, Civil Protection and Air Force) on the basis of which to organize action and resources; • preventive spreading of salt at regular intervals on the basis of the weather forecasting and monitoring system; • co-ordinated intervention of vehicles to clear snow; • timely and accurate information (including alternative routes) for travellers provided by Viabilità Italia; • agreements with Civil Protection to facilitate their care for travellers in difficulty in the event of significant bad weather. Further, the efficiency of winter operations is guaranteed by a system of operating rules establishing tasks, responsibilities and basic procedures covering management of all phases. There is also a system of alarms and information (based on levels of seriousness of meteorological events) shared across all the Group’s motorway concession companies.

The Committee promotes the principles and values of sustainable development within the Group and proposes CSR objectives, programmes and initiatives. It monitors achievement of the goals declared in the Sustainability Charter and initiates the process of yearly updating of the Charter. It analyzes and discusses the draft Sustainability Report before its approval by the Board of Directors. In its two meetings in 2011, the Committee analyzed the medium/long-term sustainability strategy and the plan of activities to implement, especially for the environment, human resources, supply chain and communication areas. Regarding the latter, it noted the need to improve the internal and external visibility of sustainability policies adopted, above all by stepping up web communication. It also dealt with the Company’s participation in the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) in connection with the definition of future standards for integrated reporting.

The Committee met three times in 2011 and dealt with various matters, including the widening of the network of services supporting the work-life balance and the definition of guidelines for assessing community projects. The project admission criteria were updated and new assessment criteria were approved to achieve greater coherence between economic intervention and the corporate mission and to more effectively cover the measures set out in the 2011 Sustainability Charter, especially for the funding of socially useful projects and the development of knowledge as a lever of personal and social promotion and growth.

Embodying the values and principles that guide the Company in its business, the document has been adopted by all the companies controlled by ASpI. The rules in it apply to all the Group’s employees and non-employee collaborators (eg. consultants, representatives, brokers and agents), to business partners and all subjects in long-term commercial relationships with the Group. The Code has been distributed to all employees in the Group, it is given to new entries and is displayed on notice boards. It is also accessible by employees on the Company intranet and by the public on the website (www.atlantia.it/it/corporate-governance). The Ethics Office is responsible for promoting and assessing knowledge of the Code of Ethics by all subjects concerned and for monitoring compliance with the Code and running any checks deemed necessary, also in collaboration with Atlantia’s Internal Audit function. The Office also proposes the introduction of guidelines and procedures designed to reduce the risk of breaching the Code and submits modifications to such documentation to the Supervisory Board. A company procedure was introduced in 2010 to discipline the examination of reports of possible infringements or conduct or practices not in conformity with the Code of Ethics made by employees, company officers or 3rd parties concerning Atlantia or its Italian or foreign subsidiaries. To this end, an e-mail contact (ethic_officer@atlantia.it) can be used to signal conduct non conforming to the principles of the Code of Ethics and to make enquiries about the Code. To raise the profile of the Code of Ethics, a study was commissioned in the 1st half of 2011 to identify measures to take to communicate the principles and provisions of the Code and the work of the Ethics Office. The following proposals were made and will be implemented in 2012: • a new Ethics Office logo with animated graphics to use on the Company intranet and Group company websites to invite users to click on Code of Ethics and Ethics Office section; • a page of detailed information on the Code of Ethics and Ethics Office, with video, text and graphics content; • a story-board of a video on the work of the Ethics Office and how to report to it; • two leaflets to distribute inside the Company (employees, visitors, new-entries) and outside (eg. suppliers on signing contracts); • e-mailings to all employees. The Ethics Officer also produced a video interview on the importance of the Code and the role played by their Office. This material will be posted on the relevant website and intranet pages. In the 2nd half of the year, the Code of Ethics was translated into French and Spanish for use by the foreign subsidiaries which have adopted Atlantia SpA’s Code of Ethics. 49 The Ethics Office received 21 reports in 2011. Some of these were examined following the necessary investigations and, depending on the findings, were either archived or referred to the relevant departments for the purpose of making organizational improvements. Ten of the reports are still under investigation. The Ethics Office in all cases interacted with department heads and the directors of Group GRI/G3.1 > HR4 companies concerned by the reports with the aim of obtaining real improvements. There were no reports of discrimination or any other serious infringements of the Code. ETHICS OFFICE Giuseppe Langer (Co-ordinator) IT and Technology Development Manager Giulio Barrel Operating Compliance Manager Enzo Spoletini Legal, General Affairs, Procurement and Sales Manager (Società Raccordo Autostradale Valle d’Aosta pA) NB.: The Ethics Office met 7 times in 2011. Certification Autostrade per l’Italia SpA’s commitment to sustainability is also reflected in its decision to certify its management systems. Implementation of such systems, which meet international standards and are certified by independent organizations, has grown steadily throughout the Group to render sustainability an increasingly visible priority. 50 CERTIFICATIONS OBTAINED BY GROUP COMPANIES COMPANY STANDARD PROCESSES CERTIFIED ISSUE • Management of processes of acquisition and control of data on accidents, traffic, fluidity, accessibility and quality in service areas.

The activity involved the following: • definition and assessment of sustainability matters relevant to the Group in relation to its mission, strategy, Sustainability Charter, the provisions of the national and international standards the Company has adopted, national agreements and, in general, major sustainability issues on a global scale; • a survey to identify matters relevant to stakeholders on the basis of input from the engagement activities carried out (see table below), analysis of press reviews, demands advanced by public opinion, communities and government. Findings will be regularly updated to track changes in the reference context and in stakeholders’ needs and expectations, thus generating new information requirements to satisfy them, in line with the Company’s strategic outlook on sustainability. The next materiality analysis will look explicitly at aspects relevant in terms of structure and content for integrated reporting, a theme on which the Company is directly engaged through its participation in the pilot programme launched by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) to define international standards for the future.

Firmly rooted in the territory through its core business and well aware of its social role, Autostrade per l’Italia is bound to its stakeholders by trust, consensus and stability. Relationships between an enterprise and its stakeholders are bilateral and involve categories with differing needs, aims and interests that are not always easy to reconcile. To find common ground on which to base a collaborative approach, Autostrade per l’Italia has gradually developed “codes of conduct” and “control bodies” to organize relationships with the main stakeholder categories.

RESPONSIBILITY Participation of Autostrade per l’Italia in the activities of the Global Compact Italian Network, of which it is a sustaining member and a member of the Steering Committee (since 2011). 56 57 ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY 4.1 Overview 4.2 Market data and Atlantia share price 4.3 Shareholders and investors 4.4 Distribution of value added 4.5 Social and environmental expenses and investments 4.1 Overview Autostrade per l’Italia has for years been engaged in creating value for the stakeholders on whom its business has a direct or indirect impact. The pursuit of such aim can never said to have been fully achieved; it requires constant focus and effort on all levels, as well as the direct involvement of external stakeholders in basic choices and within an extended model of governance, which is indispensable in the pursuit of sustainable development. The management of economic dimension, one of the key aspects of sustainability, requires the adoption of a proactive and all-pervading approach that also translates into action at an organizational level and technical platforms and procedures and processes for controlling the critical variables and risk factors the Company has to face, including environmental and social ones. All this in full awareness of the profound interconnections between the various elements and of the repercussions, positive and negative, they may have on the economic and financial front. In 2011 Autostrade per l’Italia continued to invest resources in refining its overall model, in Italy and abroad, and building on its consolidated knowledge base and expertise. It also maintained its focus on technological development to maximize the value created for its stakeholders through various projects that further the Company’s mission, and in particular the construction and operation of toll motorways. Value added is the main indicator of the economic impact directly generated by the Company. Over the last three years, an average of over 75% of the gross value of production has been transformed into value added, an objective reflection of the Company’s significant capacity to directly generate economic resources to reinvest in the business and distribute to social stakeholders. Despite the deeply difficult social and economic situation in the country, the value added indicator continued in its positive trend, reaching around €3 billion, up 3% on the previous year. The proactive approach that defines Autostrade per l’Italia’s commitment to sustainability can also be seen in its economic support for prevalently social and environmental activities. In fully adopting the principles of social responsibility, the Company continues to undertake voluntary initiatives whose results go well beyond those of compliance with the law. In the 3-year period 2009-2011, social and environmental expenses and investments reached nearly €5.3 billion, with over €1.7 billion last year, mostly in the social dimension (91%). Yet these figures underestimate the Company’s overall economic impact because of the difficulty, if not impossibility, of measuring the positive environmental and social benefits for the community, such as, for example, the improved quality of the air following reductions in vehicle emissions and the lowering of accident rates. 60 4.2 Market data and Atlantia share prices GRI/G3.1 > 1.2 MAIN EQUITY VALUES 2011 2010 Share capital (at 31 December) (€) 630,311,992 600,297,135 (a) Number of shares (par value 1 euro) 630,311,992 600,297,135 (a) Market capitalisation (euro million) (b) 7,797 9,167 Earnings per share (€) 1.34 1.11 (a) Operating cash flow per share (€) 2.74 2.31 (a) Dividend yield (b) 6.0% 4.9% Price at year end (€) 12.37 15.27 Minimum (€) 16.10 18.10 Maximum (€) 9.37 13.68 Share price / Earnings per share (P/E) (b) 9.2 13.8 Share price / Cash flow per share (b) 4.5 6.6 Market to book value (b) 2.0 2.6 Atlantia on FTSE Italia All Share index (b) 2.39% 2.29% Atlantia on FTSE/Mib index (b) 2.21% 1.69% Group credit ratings Standard&Poor's A(negative outlook) (c) A(negative outlook) Moody's A3 (stable outlook) A3 (stable outlook) Fitch Ratings A(stable outlook) A(stable outlook) (a) The capital increase voted by the Shareholders’ Meeting (extraordinary session) on 20 April 2011 was made on 6 June 2011 by an unpaid allocation of 1 new share for every 20 held.

Such capacity is one of the most important social objectives of an enterprise. The calculation and breakdown of the value added produced by Autostrade per l’Italia is based on a reclassification and integration of analytical accounting data originating from the reclassified income statement. The calculation method is based on the principles of the GBS (a financial reporting study group) and also meets the requirements of GRI/G3.1. The DIAV generated by the Group in 2011 (calculated as described above) reached around €3 billion, up 3% on the value for 2010.

The decrease of around €200m on 2010 (and the corresponding increase in the Enterprise portion) was due mainly to the fiscal effects of 989 a ministerial decree issued on 8 June 2011 which recognized the full fiscal relevance of the values restated in the financial statements of Autostrade per l’Italia SpA at 31 2009 2010 2011 December 2009 in specific application of IFRIC 12 and thus confirming the deductibility 786 661 of the balance sheet items (for further details, see note 7.9 to Atlantia’s consolidated 671 financial statements); • €510m went to employees, mainly in pay and severance indemnity and provisions for 686 613 490 495 504 527 420 incentives. 510 431 460 353 Staff Shareholders Capital providers Business Government 63 4.5 Social and environmental Autostrade per l’Italia’s commitment to activities of environmental and social importance expenses is also economic, involving outlays that are annual (operating costs) and long-term and investments (investments). The real economic impact produced in this field, however, is greater than the sum of expenses and investments made over the year. Investments to ensure higher levels of safety and fluidity on motorways, for example, make it possible to reduce the negative impacts of transport by lowering the environmental and social costs borne by the community, including atmospheric pollution, accidents and congestion1. Total socio-environmental expenses and investments in 2011 amounted to over €1.7 billion, down 4% on 20102. Of the total, 91% (€1.62 billion) was mainly social, while the other 9% was in favour of the environment.

The decrease in the fluidity line is due to the deconsolidation of Società Autostrada Tirrenica from the Group’s reporting boundary and the resulting decrease in investments in new motorway infrastructure made by that company (€30m in 2010, €48m in 2011).

The “energy” item is down due to completion in 2010 of the solar power plan in service areas and delays in legislation in 2011 that slowed down a number of projects in their start-up phase.

Management of human resources (10,750 people at 31.12.2011) is based primarily on compliance with the provisions of law and voluntary adoption of international standards regarding human rights and labour conditions, which together form the framework of the Company’s selection, induction, development and engagement policies. The Company’s approach to workplace Health & Safety is reflected in its continual development and certification of management systems, processes and procedures, and its focus on the equipment used by operatives. In 2011, Autostrade per l’Italia completed voluntary certification of its Workers Health & Safety Management System (WHSMS) to the international OHSAS 18001:2007 standard. The main effort on this front is education/training (around 27,200 hours), backed up by information and awareness raising campaigns (in 2011, the “In health & safety, three eyes are better than two!” initiative), and audits on compliance with legislation, standards (OHSAS 18001) and Company operating procedures (audit results continued to be positive in 2011). Alongside these activities, the Company is engaged in government relations. In 2011, it took part in technical discussions with the Employment and Social Policies Ministry and continued to operate the “Learning through mistakes” method in collaboration with INAIL. The problem of finding the best talents is addressed by the Company’s recruiting and induction policies, which are based on job mobility and important collaboration and partnership agreements with the academic community within the “Autostrade for Knowledge” framework set up in 2010 to transfer and develop the Company’s unique know-how. The scope of this project, covering both preand postgraduate activities, was considerably widened in 2011, with the start up of a plan to provide over 100 scholarships and total investments of around €1m. In-house and external job mobility initiatives involved 176 people in 2011. Professional development and enhancement of human resources are carried forward by projects and initiatives within a systematic framework geared to the long term. 2011 saw a sharp rise in the number of people involved in development programmes to 250 (up 56% on 2010). The Performance Management system was also extended to grades previously not included and involved a total of 1,268 resources, of which 27% women. Over 78,000 hours of training were provided (an average of 7.3 hours per employee). Regarding equal opportunities, Autostrade per l’Italia continues to manage its human resources in full compliance with the rights established by law and in labour contracts, and without any limitation or discrimination with regard to gender, race, nationality or religion. The presence of women in the workforce in 2011 rose to 21% from 18% in 2010. The Company does not operate any discriminatory policy in the criteria for selection and remuneration of men and women employees, nor are any differences applied in the treatment of protected categories. The ratio between the basic salaries of men and women, by employee category, is 1. 68 Social initiatives addressing employees and their families are designed to improve wellbeing and quality of life (also economically through cost savings) and to promote the adoption of behaviour based on sustainability principles. “Health and Wellbeing”, “Summer Camps” and “Welfare, tax and legal consulting” initiatives enabled the 3,294 people taking part in 2011 (2,540 in 2010) to save an estimated €666,650 (€630,000 in 2010). Guided by Autostrade per l’Italia’s engagement policies, Internal Communication is designed to strengthen people’s sense of belonging to and sharing the values of the Company, including its sustainability commitment. Communication tools (“Autostrade Informa” newsletter, Group Intranet, online photo gallery and live streaming) were further developed and widened in 2011, while other initiatives included “My Stations” (rewarding good suggestions for improvements to toll station operations) and continuation of the HR press review launched in 2010. Industrial relations are based on rigorous observance of the provisions of law and the national labour contract, as well as on constructive dialogue with trade unions, a central element in the framework and not only in the traditional dimensions of productivity and efficiency but also in the wider context of development of human resources. All of Autostrade per l’Italia’s workforce are covered by national collective labour contracts, as required by law in Italy, and around 70% of employees belong to trade unions. Workforce profile and occupational trends At 31 December 2011 Autostrade per l’Italia’s workforce numbered 10,750 people, thus continuing the upward trend. There are 9,490 employees in Italy and 1,260 abroad. The GRI/G3.1 > LA1 number of people on indefinite-term contracts reached 10,126 (up 98 on 2010), while those in fixed-term contracts amounted to 624 (down 92 on 2010). 2009 2010 2011 Total workforce 10,395 10,742 10,750 STAFF BY CATEGORY Men Women Men Women Men Women Senior managers 169 8 163 11 173 13 Middle managers 549 144 538 134 553 138 Administrative staff 2,859 1,167 3,137 1,278 3,123 1,318 Toll collectors 3,064 515 3,032 467 2,717 614 Workers 1,868 52 1,901 81 1,881 220 Note: for 2011, Strada dei Parchi SpA and Società Autostrada Tirrenica pA left the reporting boundary. 69 2009 2010 2011 GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION Men Women Abruzzo 534 542 279 80 Campania 1,329 1,315 1,243 59 Calabria 1 Emilia-Romagna 780 818 746 163 Friuli Venezia-Giulia 160 159 139 29 Lazio 2,485 2,566 1,618 698 Liguria 580 580 520 57 Lombardy 1,213 1,343 1,024 300 Marche 212 229 220 22 Molise 15 15 14 1 Piedmont 370 374 314 57 Puglia 279 285 250 25 Tuscany 1,196 1,198 1,004 208 Umbria 50 43 40 Valle d'Aosta 154 149 311 55 Veneto 234 227 12 1 USA 404 505 241 223 Poland 390 317 152 163 South America 9 75 301 154 France 16 8 India 1 2 2 2009 2010 2011 WORKFORCE BY TYPE OF CONTRACT Men Women Permanent 9,884 10,028 8,105 2,021 % on total 95% 93% 80% 20% Fixed-term 511 714 342 282 % on total 5% 7% 55% 45% Full-time 9,413 9,653 9,572 % on total 91% 90% 89% Part-time 982 1,089 1,178 % on total 9% 10% 11% Note: for 2009 and 2010 the breakdown by gender was not possible. 2009 2010 2011 WORKFORCE BY GENDER AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREA Men Women Men Women Men Women Italy 8,050 1,541 8,075 1,601 7,735 1,755 Overseas 474 330 696 370 712 548 Total 8,524 1,871 8,771 1,971 8,447 2,303 70 GRI/G3.1 > LA2 Turnover Personnel % on total % on total % on total by gender 2009 workforce 2010 workforce 2011 workforce Terminations/hirings T T T T T H T H Men 333 3.9% 444 5.1% 338 250 4% 3% Women 78 4.1% 140 7.1% 134 149 7% 7% Total 411 4.0% 584 5.4% 472 399 4.66% 3.94% Note: 2009 and 2010 hirings figures were impossible to obtain.

The average age of Group employees was 42, a significant rejuvenation. There was also a significant reduction in seniority, due in part to the hiring of young people and in part to the high level of retirements (35% of discontinued indefinite-term contracts in the Group). The reduction in the average age reflects the upward trend in employees under 30 and, at the same time, the decrease in numbers in the 30-45 and 45-55 brackets, trends which are in line with the Company’s policy of rejuvenating the workforce.

They are based on the following drivers: • internal equity meaning that remuneration grows in step with levels of job complexity and/or impact on the Company’s results; • external competitiveness with respect to other organizations comparable in terms of size and business area. Under Autostrade per l’Italia’s system, all employees’ remuneration is formed by a fixed and a variable part. By using various types of rewarding (cash or financial incentives and benefits), the Company aims to motivate and loyalize its human resources to create value sustainable over time.

Special training will be provided in 2012 for managers and staff in the Protection and Prevention Services of Section INAIL Departments and administrative offices, to be followed up by the involvement of workplace safety representatives and operators in all Section Departments and administrative offices. Permanent round table on safety in Variante di Valico construction sites: Bologna province, contactors, Work continued on the implementation of a system for signalling near misses on work sites and safety training. A local health authorities, reward system for people signalling near misses has been in place for two years. Eight teams (65 people) received trade unions such bonuses in 2011. 258 bonuses have gone to 241 people since the start up of the safety programmes. Health & Safety documental and IT system The documental system for the workplace health and safety management system is a complex structure covering operating procedures and rules that are constantly updated in line with new legislation and organizational modifications. The IT system can be accessed by all personnel via the intranet and HSE portal. The following operating regulations were updated in 2011: • Criteria for verifying the activities of the safety co-ordinator in the execution phase (CSE) in temporary or mobile work sites. (decree law 81/08 and subsequent amendments and additions); • Criteria for monitoring legal and regulatory issues and compliance. Management and control activities Fostering a culture of workplace safety and prevention and the identification of potential risks are absolute priorities at Autostrade per l’Italia. Stringent audits to identify and monitor workplace health and safety risks are carried out every year by IRCA-qualified lead auditors in the HSE (Health, Safety & Environment) structure, with visits to all the Section Departments to check the conformity of safety processes to OHSAS 18001, to Autostrade per l’Italia’s guidelines and operating rules and current law in the field of workplace health & safety (decree law 81/08 and subseq. amend.). In 2011 too the Company’s workplace health & safety organization and procedures were found to be in full compliance. To improve the effectiveness of monitoring health and safety compliance by 3rd party contractors working on the network, the Health & Safety and Environment unit initiated a programme of inspections by the “Site Safety Team” on road works under the Section Departments’ control. Co-operation and co-ordination with suppliers and contractors on safety issues continued in 2011, with the drafting and updating of “Assessment of risks from interference” documents. 85 2011 ACCIDENT FREQUENCY INDEX 4.57 Health & Safety training Over 27,000 hours of health and safety training were provided in 2011 (8,600 hours for 2.07 ASPI alone, addressing around 1,000 people). Information, education and training activities are constantly updated and adapted for each homogeneous group of workers. 0.77 The “Autostrade in safety” training plan funded by Fondimpresa and designed to improve Italy workplace health & safety was carried forward in 2011 with a programme addressing all USA South America the Section Departments. The three main initiatives scheduled for 2012 and involving Poland 0 around 2,500 people will focus on Hazardous Goods (Fire Service instructors), Safe India 0 Driving (ACI instructors and “Learning through mistakes” (INAIL). France 0 Man: 4.91 0.90 3.39 Woman: 2.53 0.59 GRI/G3.1 > LA7 Accidents on the job There were 353 accidents on the job in 2011 against 339 in 2010. One of these was fatal (Pavimental) and is under investigation by the Milan judiciary. There were no cases of occupational disease in 2011. 2011 LOST WORK DAYS INDEX The environment presenting the highest number of safety risks is undoubtedly the work site. There is constant monitoring of accidents involving contractors’ personnel by works 218.3 safety co-ordinators who report on a routine basis to ASPI’s works managers. The efficacy of such activity is demonstrated by the appreciable reduction in “ANAS accidents” (accidents during works under concession approved specifically by ANAS and involving at least one day’s absence from work not counting the day of the accident itself). There were 180 accidents in 1st half 2011 (199 in 2010) and 148 in the 2nd half (156 in 2010), none 29.1 of which fatal or with permanent effects. 28.7 Italy USA 0 South America Poland India 0 France 0 Man: 246.2 47.6 10.4 GROUP RATES Men Women 2011 2010 2009 Woman: 64.6 44.3 Accident frequency rate (1) 4.6 1,8 4.1 4.1 4.6 Days lost (2) 225.2 48.8 191.0 133.1 107.2 2011 ABSENTEEISM RATE Absenteeism (3) 11.199.4 12.720.7 11.494.0 9.684.0 12,540.0 Fatal accidents (4) 1 0 1 0 0 13.244 (1) Ratio between number of accidents with loss of work hours and hours worked over the year, multiplied by 200,000 (50 40hour working weeks for 100 people; Source: ILO).

Over 80% of on the job accidents are caused by unsafe behaviour, such as over-confidence or underestimation of risks, haste or habit, improper use of equipment, non-compliance with procedures and even lack of order and cleaning. GRI/G3.1 > LA4, LA5 Industrial relations The Company’s industrial relations system is based on consolidated and constructive dialogue with trade unions for the purpose of increasing productivity and service efficiency and promoting the enhancement and development of human resources within the framework of the relevant national legislation and collective employment contracts. All of Autostrade per l’Italia’s workforce are covered by national collective labour contracts, as required by law in Italy, and around 70% are members of a trade union. Notice periods and procedures for transfers are regulated by decree law 18/2001 and law 223/1991 and vary according to circumstances.

There was no strike action during negotiations for the renewal of the contract. 87 In addition to the statutory pension scheme under Italian law, Autostrade per l’Italia operates a national supplementary pension fund for employees in the motorway, road, transport and infrastructure sector (ASTRI). This Fund is formed by both employees and employers. The latter make a monthly payment of a portion of their severance indemnity, which may be total or partial depending on the date of first occupation, plus an optional percentage (from 1% to 4%) of their remuneration (workers may also fix higher percentages). Employers pay in 1% of the monthly remuneration of the employees participating in the fund or 2% for any GRI/G3.1 > EC3 employees who also pay in a minimum of 2%. Social initiatives for employees GRI/G3.1 > LA8 Autostrade per l’Italia supplements traditional measures in favour of its employees (flexible hours, health insurance and pensions, commuter services and sustainable mobility) by organizing other socially useful initiatives. To help reconcile the demands of private and professional life, the Company has enhanced its welfare provisions in three areas in particular: health & wellbeing, employees’ children, family & personal.

The Group is engaged in planning and implementing network upgrading and maintenance programmes, organizing customer assistance and running systematic and wide-reaching information and communication projects promoting the adoption of driving habits that are safer and environmentally cleaner. Performance on the safety front, one of the components of the service offered by the Company, is not completely under its control, for the Company’s actions are not the only factors at work. Also to be taken into account are network users’ behaviour and the characteristics of the vehicles they use. This is why the Group’s integrated approach over the years has been to engage users more and more. That the strategy is paying off is shown by the positive results in the key performance indicators, from the overall accident rate (which has been dropping for years and was down 34.55 in 2011 against 36.51 in 2010) to the fatal accident rate showing the same downward trend (down 19% from 0.32 in 2010 to 0.26 in 2011). Fluidity has also significantly improved: the main indicator, Total Delay (hours lost through traffic congestion), dropped below 4.6 million hours from 5.4 million in 2010, partly due to completion of major infrastructure work. Similarly positive results were seen in traffic info (the service’s coverage was extended) and service areas. Autostrade per l’Italia’s focus on customers is reflected in its systematic surveying of their perceived level of service quality, the customer’s viewpoint being an indispensable input in the process of continual improvement. Customer satisfaction surveys are conducted every year: 2011 saw an overall improvement, with the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) at 6.93 against 6.92 (scale of 1 to 10) in the previous 2-year period. This reflects positive results in practically all the components of the service. Autostrade per l’Italia continues to refine its customer communication system, in which a central role is played by the annually updated Service Charter. This document summarizes the main characteristics of the service, its constituent elements, the standards adopted and results obtained. The Service Charter is part of a wider system of communication with customers including other instruments and resources enabling the company to dialogue with users and respond rapidly and effectively to their requests. These include customer help desks (Punto Blu), motorway personnel (traffic control auxiliaries), call centres, websites, radio channels and television coverage. The number of customer inquiries was down in 2011 against an improvement in response times. Also down was the number of complaints, by around 27% (7,762 against 10,625 in 2010). In detail, complaints about toll payments were down around 34%, while complaints about customer relations management were down around 76%. Regarding dialogue with consumer associations, work continued within the framework of the Safety and Quality of Service Committee in 2011, reflecting the Group’s constant commitment to engaging with stakeholders in increasingly systematic consultation. Initiatives in 2011 (some breaking new ground, others building on existing projects) focused on disseminating safety culture (partly by stepping up customer info on how the Company’s safety systems work), health, litigation and credit recovery, and fuel price monitoring and information. 90 AUTOSTRADE PER L’ITALIA TARIFFS Toll charges AND INFLATION 127.1 Customers must pay a toll to use the motorway network. In its tariff policy, Autostrade per l’Italia is subject to certain legal constraints and provisions that exclude all pricing autonomy. On its part, the Company is committed to maximum transparency in relations with customers. The unit charge (per km) is net tarifs determined by a mechanism provided for in the Agreement and applied by Autostrade per 100 inflation l’Italia under the supervision of ANAS, the Infrastructure Ministry and the Finance Ministry and the latter’s regulatory control body (NARS). (*) Source of inflation figures: ISTAT retail price index Toll charges are adjusted annually for all sections of the network without distinction and for the entire nation (including tobacconists). with no discretionary power. 2010 EUROPEAN TOLLS LIGHT VEHICLES CALCULATION OF TOLL CHARGE (EURO CENTS/KM, VAT INCLUDED) 9.70 (tariff* per km x km travelled) + 21% VAT +/rounding to 10 eurocents 8.08 * including a charge due to ANAS 5.96 6.70 6.44 The ANAS charges included in the unit tariff (€0.006/km for A and B class vehicles and €0.018/km for classes 3, 4 and 5) were raised on 1 January 2011 and adjustments to the toll charges applied by Autostrade per l’Italia SpA and its Italian concession operator subsidiaries came into force. These factors, among others, led to an 8% increase in toll revenues compared to 2010 despite a 1.3% contraction in traffic on the network operated by the Group’s Italian concession operators (see Atlantia’s consolidated financial Italy (ASpI) Spain (ASETA) statements for further details).

Maximum toll on top of chart, lower in white box. 91 Regarding the Group’s overseas subsidiaries, Brazilian Triangulo do Sol Auto-Estradas (taken over in 2011) has an open, manual and electronic toll system (“Semparar”). Tariffs are geared to type of vehicle and number of axles and subject to an annual adjustment of 100% of the change in the retail price index (tariffs have risen 9.76% since 1 July 2011). Stalexport Autostrada Malopolska saw its tariff system changed on 1 July 2011: the “shadow toll” on heavy vehicles (>12 tonnes) was abolished and a direct toll was introduced. At the same time, the toll on heavy vehicles (<12 tonnes) was raised by 11.1%. The overall effect of these tariff hikes on toll revenues was 13.4% (net of the increase in the VAT rate from 22% to 23% as of 1 January 2011). Tariffs applied by Sociedad Concesionaria de Los Lagos have not changed since 1 January 2011 due to the offsetting of various factors (inflation, non-recognition of the “safety premium” toll increase and rounding of charges to 100 pesos). In 2011 the French subsidiary Ecomouv’ entered a contract with the Ecology Ministry to build and operate a satellite toll system for the “Eco-Taxe”, which will be applied to heavy vehicles on around 15,000 km of French roads from 2nd half 2013 on. GRI/G3.1 > 2.7 Commitments to customers Autostrade per l’Italia customer categories • private customers, including commuters and occasional travellers, totalling around 20 million people/year; • business operators, including hauliers and business customers, totalling around 5 million people/year. • frequent travellers (12 trips per year): about 16 million people/year, representing around 65% of private customers. Customer satisfaction surveys Service Charter GRI/G3.1 > PR5 CUSTOMER Quality Report ACTIVITIES Customer Care System Dialogue with consumer associations Monitoring perceived quality Autostrade per l’Italia retains an external specialist organisation to conduct periodical customer satisfaction surveys focusing on motorway services. These surveys measure the main components of the service (traffic flow, traffic information, tollgates, payment systems, safety and service areas) and the results are processed to obtain the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI), which expresses customers’ overall judgement of the areas under survey. Customer sample 3,602 customer phone interviews: • 1,198 occasional travellers • 1,203 business travellers • 600 commuters • 601 truckers 92 The weights of the various indicators used in calculating the CSI are determined by the importance they are given by the customers themselves during each survey. The CSI in 2011 was 6.93, slightly up on the previous 2-year period (6.92), reflecting improvements in all the components of the service.

It describes the various services and states results obtained in terms of quality delivered to customers. All Autostrade per l’Italia S.p.A motorway subsidiaries have their own Service Charters, which are standardized in terms of quality levels and declared principles. As required by the Agreement, the Charter is updated annually and published on www.autostrade.it, as well as being distributed with the main Italian dailies and news magazines. 93 Service Charter contents • Network of Autostrade per l’Italia and its subsidiaries • Basic principles underlying the business (in terms of access to and maintenance of infrastructure) • Network upgrading plan, • Road safety and Tutor (number of installations) • Traffic management • Toll calculation and payment methods • Variable message panels and traffic information • Traveller care services available in service areas • Quality management policies and indicators • Telepass: customer assistance and points of sale (Punto Blu and Telepass Point) • Autostrade per l’Italia and Telepass websites • Safety and Service Quality Committee • Safety and Quality of Service Committee • Complaints and refunds • Conciliation procedure References: “Directive for the adoption of the motorway Service Charter” Infrastructure and Transport Ministry directive 102, 19.02.2009. “Operating Instructions” ANAS 29.01.2010 Monitoring of the quality of service delivered: the Quality Report The Quality Report publishes the results of motorway service performance monitoring and highlights ongoing improvements in the quality of services delivered. The components of the service to analyze are identified by interviewing a sample of customers during customer satisfaction surveys. Initially produced by Autostrade per l’Italia SpA, the Quality Report was extended to the Group’s Italian motorway subsidiaries in 2009. Improved results were seen in substantially all the areas monitored in 2011: • Safety: all the accident indicators improved with respect to 2010. Of these, the fatal accident rate, which has already fallen below the 50% reduction targeted by the European Union, was down 12% in 2011, while the global accident rate was 5%. • Fluidity: all the indicators improved with respect to 2010. The network fluidity index (Total Delay) was significantly down (from 5,399 million hours in 2010 to 4,557 million in 2011), mainly due to completion of upgrading work on major infrastructure (A1 Milano Napoli in the Florence area and the A14 Bologna Taranto), as well as favourable weather conditions. Percentages of Telepass and automatic lane transits have been growing for the last three years (Telepass accounted for 58.9% of the total in 2011, the other automatic lanes carrying 20.4%). • Traffic information: service coverage was increased and improvements were recorded in nearly all indicators. • Customer relations: levels of service remained fairly high, though certain indicators were down (Commercial Call Center and average response time via e-mail). • Service Areas: these continue to show very good performance, partly due to modernization and upgrading in 2010. 94 Quality report (boundary: Autostrade per l’Italia SpA) SERVICE QUALITY PROVIDED 2009 2010 2011 Global accident rate 36.48 36.51 34.55 Motorway accident rate 30.67 30.89 28.83 SAFETY Casualty accident rate 10.43 10.02 9.29 Fatal accident rate 0.30 0.32 0.26 Death rate 0.32 0.33 0.29 Horizontal road markings indicator: ISEGN Range 1:100 78.93 74.58 75.82 Traffic flow index: Total Delay (total hours lost due to congestion) 5,337,759 5,399,128 4,557,225 Total duration of tailback and delays (hours): 31,898 35,370 30,491 of which due to works 2,439 3,226 2,005 of which due to accidents 5,027 5,025 4,655 FLUIDITY Total hours of traffic stops: 507 467 419 of which with duration > 1 hour 293 244 232 % Telepass transactions out of total 57.2 58.3 58.9 % unpaid transits out of total traffic on exit 0.37 0.36 0.37 Average waiting time between request and operator response (sec.) 11.6 11.6 11.5 Variable message panels along road 523 528 548 % of traffic covered by the service 99 99 99 TRAVEL INFORMATION % of toll stations with VMPs on entry 96 96.5 97 % of traffic covered by service on entry 98 98 98.5 % of calls handled by Commercial Call Centre 98.4 97.5 97.3 % of calls handled by Traffic Call Centre 99.1 99.6 99.8 CUSTOMER RELATIONS % of calls handled by billing and credit recovery Call Centre 99.5 99.4 99.5 Average response time for total ASpI complaints Letters & fax (days) 7.7 9.9 7.5 Average response time for total ASpI complaints E-mail (days) 3.4 3.6 6.4 SERVICE AREAS % of surveys for service areas within standards 98.9 98.5 98.5 The Quality Report is produced by all the Group’s motorway concession companies except Società Italiana del Traforo del Monte Bianco, which is not comparable on account of its peculiar infrastructure characteristics and legal context. The data for 2011 show: • an overall improvement in safety (performance varying from company to company); • fluidity results (duration of tailbacks and delays caused by work sites and accidents) substantially in line with 2010, with a general improvement in the handling of problems with payment at toll stations (reduction in average times between requests for intervention and operator response); • traffic information ensured by an adequate number of variable message panels and improvements in average response times for complaints, especially on the Naples ring road (average response times down 30% on 2010) and Autostrade Meridionali (down 25%); • quality delivered in service areas at the same high performance levels as Autostrade per l’Italia; there were overall improvements in the quality of parking and access, food&beverage services and cleaning in toilets. 95 Customer care system Autostrade per l’Italia’s Traffic Call Centre is the biggest call centre of its kind in Italy, providing traffic information on sections of motorway operated by Autostrade per l’Italia, the Brenner and Strada dei Parchi motorways. The service is active round the clock, with a pool of qualified internal phone operators and automatic news recordings (IVR), which are territory-specific and updated every five minutes. Innovations introduced in the last two years to raise levels of quality include the voice option for selecting IVRs, which improves safety by limiting the use of phone keypads while driving, as well increasing the number of IVR options for personalized information. Alongside the traditional macro-regional feeds (North West, North East, Central, South) there are now: • traffic news for the urban areas of Milan, Rome, Naples, Genoa, Bologna and Florence; • real-time traffic info on specific routes (voice option enabling users to indicate their points of departure and arrival and receive relevant news within a few seconds); • traffic forecasts for the main macro-regions (North, Central, South). 2011 saw an overall reduction in the number customer inquiries across all channel against an improvement in response times. There were a total of 402,562 calls, with an answer rate of 99.5%. 34.7% of callers chose to talk to an operator and 94.26% of these were answered within 20 seconds. Quality of service is continually monitored by both an online questionnaire (Company website) and the Mystery Client. The processes of traffic information acquisition and diffusion through the call centre have ISO 9001:2000 certification (first obtained in 2005 from TÜV Italy). The Commercial Call Center for Telepass and Viacard customers took 1,342,871 calls, with an overall answer rate of 96.08%. 67.88% of callers chose to talk to an operator and around 88% of these were answered within 20 seconds. Regarding written commercial correspondence in 2011, the Centre received around 160,000 letters and faxes and around 158,000 e-mails and web forms. The average response time for letters and faxes was 2.14 days, with an answer rate of 96.03% within 10 days. The average response time for e-mails and web forms was 1.65 days, with 93.33% being answered within 4 days. CHANNEL NO.

Coming under a protocol of intent with consumer associations, it was applied to around 500 km of Autostrade per l’Italia network in 2011. Some of the initiatives in the table above will be implemented in 2012. 98 5.4 Government and communities Government relations are of central importance in the process of stakeholder engagement. Autostrade per l’Italia interacts with government on a day to day basis at GRI/G3.1 > SO5 national and local level. It is involved in various activities with parliamentary bodies, government authorities, ministries and local administrations. Such dialogue and the monitoring of legislation are constantly backed up by direct relations with the territory and listening to requests from local communities. Activities include formal and informal meetings, participation in technical discussions, also in view of the application of European directives relevant to the infrastructure sector and during works authorization procedures, and seminars, workshops and round tables (national and international) on themes relating to infrastructure development and sustainability. Autostrade per l’Italia also plays a leading role in major national and international industry GRI/G3.1 > 4.13 associations: Confindustria (Confederation of Italian Industry), AISCAT (the National Association of Motorway and Road Tunnel Concessionaires), ASECAP (the European Association of Toll Motorway Concessionaires), AIPCR (World Road Association) and IBTTA (the International Bridge Tunnels and Turnpike Association).

Autostrade per l’Italia’s social commitment also works through direct dialogue with local communities. This takes place not only for the purpose of funding solidarity projects in areas such as charity, health and scientific education but also in subsequent monitoring of the development of such projects. The model adopted for reporting on community oriented projects and initiatives undertaken voluntarily is that of the London Benchmarking Group (LBG), the main international standard. Using this model, Autostrade per l’Italia’s economic commitment in favour of the community in 2011 topped €4.76m, mainly in the Investments in the Community category (59%). . 99 SOCIAL SOLIDARITY AND PROMOTION PROJECTS FINANCED IN 2011 CORPORATE SPHERE GEOGRAPHICAL # DIRECT BUDGET DESCRIPTION SOCIALE OF ACTION LOCATION BENEFICIARIES REQUESTED OF PROJECT FINANCED On the move is a mobile unit aiming to raise awareness amongst young people of road safety issues involving at-risk lifestyles ­La Lanterna Onlus Society Italy, Milan 120 € 48,950 (alcohol and drugs).

Initiatives for the Community Initiatives Action in the “Initiatives for the Community” category reached nearly €600,000 in 2011, for the Community (12%) or 13% of Autostrade per l’Italia’s total commitment to the community. Charity (29%) Main initiatives included the sponsoring of cultural, sporting, social and scientific events, Investments for the Community (59%) such as the “Meeting dell’Amicizia” in Rimini, cultural events in Cortina, the Festival of Science, national young entrepreneurs conventions (Confindustria) and the De Adamich safe driving course. 101 Charity Autostrade per l’Italia gave €1,374,343 to charity in 2011 (29% of the overall amount going to the community). Such charity included scholarships granted under the Autostrade for Knowledge programme (€625,000) and a series of philanthropic initiatives chosen by the Social Solidarity and Promotion Projects Committee. In 2011, select associations were given over €400,000 for around 20,000 direct beneficiaries. Other important initiatives in this category included a €200,000 contribution to Fondazione Santa Cecilia and a €100,000 donation to Comunità di S. Egidio. Investments in the community Autostrade per l’Italia invested nearly €2.8m in the community in 2011. Major projects included the safety campaign, the annual communication campaign on summer traffic (€374,000), participation in the Bologna Motor Show (€243,000) and the “Open Work Sites” communication campaign involving the organization of 14 events on works scheduled in eight Italian regions. Action in this category also included other information activities in areas affected by works on motorways. The Group’s foreign companies are also involved in community initiatives, some of which are part of long-term safety programmes to raise awareness and lower accident rates. Triangulo do Sol has been producing an annual campaign addressing hauliers since 2001. It also provides information, medical tests and vaccinations. The initiative in 2011 involved 10,418 people and 17,676 vaccine doses. Other periodical education campaigns, run for the first time in 2011, involved over 15,000 people (of which 3,700 children). Media Autostrade per l’Italia constantly monitors the press for articles mentioning the Group and assigns them positive, neutral or negative status depending on whether facts and opinions reported are favourable or unfavourable to the Company. Press monitoring in 2011 recorded 5,225 articles of interest against 5,263 the previous year: most articles were “neutral” (77% against 82% in 2010), followed “positive” ones (19%, up on 13% in 2010). “Negative” articles were slightly down on 2010. 2009 2010 2011 Number of articles reviewed 5,180 5,263 5,225 Positive judgement 22% 13% 19% Neutral 75% 82% 77% Negative 3% 5% 4% 102 JUDGEMENT MAIN THEMES TREATED IN PRESS ARTICLES • Adjudication in France of a satellite toll system for vehicles over 3.5 tonnes; • Atlantia’s financial disclosures; • “Open Work Sites” initiatives; • Car pooling and other communication and marketing initiatives; • Group’s road safety results (Tutor and launch of Overload Tutor); • Progress on works: Variante di Valico (entry into service of the EPB tunnel borer, the world’s biggest, Positive in Galleria Sparvo), upgrading of the Florence node of the A1, A14 (Marche and Emilia-Romagna), A8 and A9 (Lombardia), opening of the first lot of the Tirrenica motorway and Rosignano toll station (SAT); • Improvements in service and infrastructure: opening of toll stations at Guidonia (A1) and the exits at Porto Sant’Elpidio and Senigallia (A14), opening to traffic of the Lainate link road between the A8 and A9, and the Origgio Uboldo exit on the A8. • Motorway network upgrading and improvement plan: A1 in Toscana and Lazio, A14 in Emilia-Romagna and Marche, Gronda project in Genoa (Tunnel di Fontanabuona in Liguria), construction of the Tirrenica motorway in Toscana, and A8 and A9 in Lombardia; Neutral • Construction of the external ring road, Milan; • Tariffs and tolls; • Information on traffic, works and management of emergencies (summer peaks and bad weather); • Financial communication on the transfer of Strada dei Parchi. • Inquiry into landslides linked to the digging of the Val di Sambro tunnel in Ripoli (Variante di Valico); • Closing of the inquiry opened in 2008 into the collapse of the Melarancio tunnel (negligence, fraud and environmental offences); Negative • Antitrust sanctioning of ASpI in connection with snow emergency management (inadequate info about the 17 December 2010 snowfall on the A1); • Polemics in local newspapers regarding the impact of works, including the construction of certain minor works, expropriations, safety and road info. GRI/G3.1 > SO9 Critical issues regarding government and the community Significant regulatory and legal developments in 2011 regarded: • toll charge increases for 2012; • snowfalls in December 2010; • other litigation. A detailed analysis can be found under “Significant regulatory events” in the Notes to Atlantia’s 2011 financial statements. 103 TOLL CHARGE INCREASES FOR 2012 CONCESSION OPERATOR TARIFF INCREASE IN 2012 COMPONENTS AND CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS • 1.47%: 70% of inflation between 1 July 2010-30 June 2011 • 1.99%: “X investments” component in the tariff formula Autostrade covering additional investments written into the 2002 3.51% per l'Italia IVth Addendum • 0.05%: return on new investments1 (K factor) • programmed inflation Raccordo Autostradale • rebalancing 14.17% Valle d'Aosta • return on investments • quality • programmed inflation Tangenziale • rebalancing 3.49% di Napoli • return on investments • quality • programmed inflation Autostrade • rebalancing 0.31% Meridionali • return on investments • quality Autostrada Torino-Savona 1.47% • 70% of inflation between 1 July 2010-30 June 2011 • 2.47%: average of inflation rates in France and Italy, Società Traforo 1 September 2010-31 August 2011 5.97% • 3.50%: in accordance with the 24 February 2009 del Monte Bianco agreement by the Italian and French governments (destination still to be established at government level) (4) Based on state of progress on individual projects as per the balance sheet at 30 September 2011, in accordance with the provisions of the current sole concession agreement. Snowfalls GRI/G3.1 > PR9 Action by ANAS On 21 April 2011, ANAS served four notices of complaint on Autostrade per l’Italia relative to the management of snow emergencies in December 2010 on the Florence section of the A1 Milano-Napoli motorway, the A11 Firenze-Pisa Nord, and the Pescara-Vasto and LoretoSenigallia sections of the A14. The notices referred to: 1. infringement of art. 14, Highway Code and relative ANAS communication dated 8 October 2010; 2. infringement of Autostrade per l‘Italia plan for Winter Operations; 3. infringement of the provisions of ANAS communication dated 19 December 2008 and subsequent Aiscat communication dated 24 December 2008 on full and prompt information to the “Ispettorato Vigilanza Concessioni Autostradali” (IVCA motorway concession supervision inspectorate) regarding emergency situations (this count does not apply to the complaint about the A11). On 10 June 2011, Autostrade per l‘Italia presented its defence. At the end of the relative proceedings, ANAS handed down: a) two decisions, on 11 November 2011, to archive the investigations into the snow emergences on the A14 (Loreto-Senigallia) and the A11 (Firenze-Pisa Nord); 104 b) two decisions, on 22 November 2011, to apply the contractual penalties provided for in the Sole Concession Agreement regarding the snow emergencies on the A1 and A14 (Pescara-Vasto). The penalties amount to €483,871 for the A1 and €96,032 for the A14 (Pescara-Vasto) and were calculated in accordance with the terms of the Sole Concession Agreement. Action by the Antitrust Authority In connection with the snowfalls on 17 December 2010 on the A1 Milano-Napoli, the Antitrust Authority initiated investigations into both Autostrade per l'Italia’s communication of information to users on the actual state of the motorways under concession and into the ways the Company managed critical events capable of significantly disrupting traffic flow. On 4 January 2011, the Authority carried out inspections at Autostrade per l'Italia’s Rome and Florence offices and seized documents and information. In subsequent hearings before the Authority, the Company produced its operating procedures for winter operations management and communication to users via the institutional channels (RAI Isoradio) and the Company’s instruments (Variable Message Panels). The Company also produced its undertakings with the Authority to improve procedures for communication to users during bad weather events. At the end of the preliminary proceedings, the Antitrust Authority decided not to accept the undertakings presented by Autostrade per l‘Italia (as notified on 25 July 2011). The Authority ruled that Autostrade per l’Italia’s conduct during the event was unfair commercial practice and therefore prohibited the continuation of this kind of communication and fined the Company €350,000. Autostrade per l'Italia appealed to the TAR del Lazio Court on 7 November 2011 to annul the aforementioned ruling on the grounds, among others, that the obligation toward motorway users is of means (ie. providing users with a motorway that can be travelled on in safety) and not, as sustained in the ruling, an obligation of result. Class action In connection with snowfalls in December 2010, a class action (pursuant toi art. 140-bis, Consumer Code) was brought before the Civil Court of Rome by a number of associations (Associazioni Codici, Unione Nazionale Consumatori, Movimento Difesa del Cittadino and ACU-Associazione Consumatori Utenti). The action is pending. Following the snowfalls in the Florence area on 17 and 18 December 2010, Autostrade per l’Italia initiated talks with the Safety and Quality of Service Committee to discuss possible measures to take in respect of customers who suffered inconvenience and damage which it did not, however, deemed attributable to Autostrade per l’Italia SpA. At that stage, Autostrade per l’Italia decided to repay (or not charge) tolls in proportion to the extent of the inconvenience suffered by drivers and to pay token compensation. To implement the settlement procedures, a form was drafted as agreed with the consumer associations and posted on Autostrade per l’Italia SpA and the associations’ websites. At the same time, the Company initiated a review of its snow event management procedures to identify any areas for improvement, especially with regard to information for users. 105 GRI/G3.1 > SO8 Other litigation Regarding non-compliance with laws and regulations in general, no significant infringements were reported for 2011. Annual Monitoring Programme for 2010 In 2011, ANAS applied a fine in relation to implementation of the Annual Monitoring Programme for 2010. Following examination and discussion of evidence, Anas ordered the Company to pay fines totalling €240,000 under Annex N to the Sole Concession Agreement. In lieu of payment, Autostrade per l’Italia made a provision of said amount to its charges and risks reserve. No formal statement has yet been made by ANAS concerning implementation of the Annual Monitoring Programme for 2011. Developments relating to tariff increases, competition issues and relations with the GRI/G3.1 > SO7 Antitrust Authority (AGCM) included two proceedings concluded and three still pending. Tariffs Autostrade per l‘Italia is involved in an action (pending) brought by the TAR del Lazio Court by Codacons and other consumer associations regarding the tariff increase for 2003. A similar action seeking annulment of tariff increases since 1 January 1999 was debarred by the Tar Lazio Court on 9 November 2011 by virtue of the lapsing of the time limit. Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM) ACI Global SpA and Europ Assistance VAI SpA An appeal lodged with the Consiglio di Stato (Council of State) by the AGSM applying for annulment of decisions 4994/09 and 5005/09 of the TAR del Lazio Court in which the 1st level judge upheld, albeit partially, appeals lodged by ACI Global SpA and Europ Assistance VAI SpA for annulment of the Antitrust Authority’s ruling on 23 October 2008 (no. 19021) on mechanical assistance, is still pending. Autostrade per l‘Italia put in a formal appearance at the appeal hearings. Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM) – Telepass In July 2011, the AGCM initiated proceedings against Telepass on the grounds of unfair commercial practice in the production and diffusion of misleading advertisements regarding Top Rider, an offer addressing its customers. During the proceedings, Telepass specified the procedures with which the advertising campaign was conducted, assured its good faith and undertook to provide correct information to all customers who had signed up for the initiative on how to use the service and explain that abandon of the initiative was not subject to any constraints or membership costs. In view of such undertakings, the Authority archived the proceeding at the hearing on 21 December 2011. TAI Srl On the subject of unfair competition, on 28 July 2011, TAI Srl (supplier of IT systems and specialists to Autostrade Tech) served a claim form on Autostrade Tech and Autostrade per l‘Italia complaining of unfair competition, misappropriation of TAI Srl know-how by TECH SpA and abuse of dominant position through practices designed to suppress competition and seeking compensation for damages. Astaldi The Rome Court of Appeal issued a decision on 26 May 2011 that partially granted Atlantia and Autostrade per l'Italia’s main appeal against Astaldi and others. It declared the inadmissibility of the claims and allowed a reduction of Autostrade per l‘Italia’s original debt to around €44m, of which €30m already paid by Autostrade per l‘Italia. Atlantia and Autostrade per l'Italia lodged an appeal against the sentence with the Court of Cassation. Astaldi put in a cross-appeal. 106 With specific reference to litigation regarding environmental issues, no final court rulings GRI/G3.1 > EN28 against Autostrade per l’Italia were issued, nor were any major administrative sanctions applied in 2011 regarding non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Autostrade per l’Italia is also a respondent in a number of actions concerning expropriations, contracts and compensation for damages in connection with motorway circulation. At present, it is not thought that settlement of such litigation is likely to cause any significant liabilities for Group companies in excess of provisions already taken as of 31 December 2011 and stated in the consolidated accounts. For details on other pending litigation, including the adjudication of the Pedemontana Veneta concession and the construction of the “Genoa road and motorway node”, see “Significant regulatory events” in the Notes to Atlantia’s 2011 financial statements. 5.5 Supply Chain Autostrade per l’Italia’s approach to supply chain management is based on GRI/G3.1 > EC6 sustainability principles and operates across the economic, environmental and social dimensions. Its relationships with suppliers go beyond the traditionally commercial DISTRIBUTION OF sphere and are significantly geared to fostering socially and environmentally AUTOSTRADE’S MAIN SUPPLIERS responsible behaviour amongst all its stakeholders, of which suppliers play a key role in BY ADMINISTRATIVE REGION Autostrade per l’Italia’s business model. Its supply chain is made up of businesses that provide construction of new works and maintenance of the existing network and 26% Lombardia businesses that supply products and services. 23% Lazio 12% Toscana Supplier relationships are managed on the principles of fairness, transparency and 8% Emilia-Romagna good faith, as indicated in the Code of Ethics, a key document in contract negotiations 5% Piemonte because all suppliers are required to have knowledge of and subscribe to it. Adoption of 5% Veneto its principles is a pre-requisite for inclusion in Autostrade’s suppliers list. Autostrade 3% Puglia entered over 3,000 goods and services supply contracts in 2011. Of these, the top 50 3% Liguria (in terms of contract value) account for around 45% of procurement costs, a significant 2% Campania degree of concentration also reflected on a geographical level, with the three most 2% Abruzzo important regions (Lazio, Lombardia and Toscana) accounting for over 61%. 2% Marche 2% Sicilia Contracts for new works and network maintenance 2% Other 5% Overseas In awarding and performing construction, operation and maintenance contracts, Autostrade per l’Italia uses procurement procedures ensuring that the companies involved are treated with maximum transparency, objectivity and fairness. To award supply contracts, Autostrade per l’Italia uses international tender procedures involving participation requisites in line with the relevant EU legislation (decree law 163/2006 and subs. amendments and additions, enforcing EC Directives 17/2004 and 18/2004) ensuring maximum transparency and fairness. Adjudication is on the basis of lowest price or highest economic advantage, as specified in tender documentation, and without discriminating in terms of where businesses are based or any other preferential criteria. 107 In general, quality, safety and cost optimization are the main criteria in choosing suppliers. All suppliers must undertake on their own behalf and that of any authorized subcontractors, consultants and employees, to guarantee compliance with the principles of the Group’s Code of Ethics and Conduct. Stiff penalties and even contract termination are provided for in cases of non-compliance. Under contracts stipulated in Italy, Autostrade requires contractors to guarantee personnel safety through compliance with the provisions of the law, regulations and rules invoked in the National Labour Agreement and national workplace health, safety and hygiene legislation and through application of the relevant insurance and social security coverage. 30 contracts together worth around €19m were stipulated with 3rd parties in 2011. Public tender procedure may prove inconvenient in terms of the organizational times and costs involved, so Autostrade per l’Italia often commissions works directly from Pavimental SpA. Under the public works, services and supply contracts Code (legislative decree 163/2006 and subseq. amendments), it is possible to directly commission up to 60% of construction work under concession from a Group company. Autostrade is often obliged to act in this way when works need to be started immediately. Network maintenance is a good example of work requiring speed and effectiveness to meet customers’ needs, especially in terms of safety. Seven contracts totalling €159m were assigned to Pavimental in 2011. Environment, Health & Safety in Autostrade per l’Italia’s supply chain The safety of all workers during the performance of their tasks is a strategic priority for all Group companies, the most immediate objective being to eliminate accidents. Orders and contracts concerning special materials include an additional clause laying down specific tasks for suppliers with regard to the following: • health and safety regulations for personnel engaged in specific operations (e.g. sanitization); • regulations to be complied with when using toxic or hazardous materials; • regulations regarding roadworks where traffic is present; • liability insurance to cover any damage caused to 3rd parties by a supplier’s personnel in carrying out works; • presentation of specific proof of compliance with all regulations concerning insurance and social security at the request of Autostrade per l’Italia. Under decree law 81/2008 (workplace health and safety, with specific provisions applying to building sites), Works Supervisors and Safety Co-ordinators are fully empowered to carry out inspections and checks and also to request information from suppliers regarding compliance with their contractual obligations. To maximize the efficacy of such controls, Autostrade per l’Italia runs a specific audit process for contractors and sub-contractors, in accordance with current legislation, to make sure there are no serious infringements and that all subjects are technically and professionally in line with safety regulations. In 2011, the HSE unit initiated a programme of inspections by the “Site Safety Team” on road works by 3rd party contractors under Section Departments control. Co-operation and co-ordination with suppliers and contractors also continued with the drafting and updating of “Assessment of risks from interference” documents. 108 SUPPLIER AUDITS IN 2011 SUPPLIER CATEGORY AUDIT FOCUS INTERNAL AUDITS EXTERNAL AUDITS Health & Safety 162 5 Construction companies for new works Environment Other 42 Health & Safety 54 Maintenance providers 10 7 Environment Other Health & Safety n.a. n.a.

The initiative provides the companies concerned with a number of free-of-charge opportunities: • participation in Autostrade per l’Italia’s “Our Safety Vision” workshops, in which contractors can discuss work safety issues with ASpI; • assistance in drawing up annual work safety training plans; • consulting on loans for work safety training available from inter-professional funds; • participation in training courses for safety instructors (“From Expert to Instructor”); • support for training co-ordination in terms of management and accounting of activities; • assistance in obtaining loans for projects to improve health and work safety levels, including the development of organizational models and other instruments for fostering safety culture. GRI/G3.1 > 3.7 NB.: only Autostrade per l’Italia SpA contracts 109 ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY 6.1 Overview 6.2 Environmental commitment in network development and management 6.3 Responsible use of resources 6.4 Climate change strategy 6.5 Protecting biodiversity 6.1 Overview Optimizing relationships with the eco-system is of strategic importance to Autostrade per GRI/G3.1 > 4.11 l’Italia and depends on organizational responsibility at all levels, dedicated instruments and processes and stakeholder engagement policies. The Sustainability Charter is the main instrument representing its responsibility to the ecosystem. The efficacy of this approach is also demonstrated by the fact that it achieved all its environmental objectives in 2011 as well. The Company’s approach to the safeguarding of environmental assets is based on the life cycle concept. The design phase is geared to continual improvement in environmental compatibility both in building new works and in upgrading existing ones. One of the targets here is full re-use of excavation materials (around 5.8 million cubic metres re-used in 2011, up 66% on 2010). The environmental monitoring process saw a 20% reduction in the total number of measurements made, while critical issues remained substantially stable. Network management must guard against a range of environmental repercussions, from noise pollution to accidental spillage of hazardous substances. On the noise pollution front, Autostrade per l’Italia is engaged on one hand in a reclamation programme (91 interventions by the end of 2013) and on the other in the installation of new acoustic barriers (around 50 km of new barriers in 2011 and another 30 km scheduled for 2012). To deal with spillages of hazardous substances the Company has special procedures in place to discipline management of such events on both the network (55 in 2011) and in service areas. Regarding the latter, promotion of eco-sustainable fuels was stepped up (at 31.12.2011 there were 143 LPG pumps and 15 natural gas distributors in Autostrade per l’Italia service areas). Energy has been a key priority for the Group for years, also in terms of the repercussions of emissions and the issue of climate change. Consumption levels in 2011 were down 6% on the previous year to 467 GWh, thanks in part to energy efficiency measures and use of renewable sources. On the wider theme of limiting climate change, on which the Company has been engaged on a voluntary basis for years, 2011 saw the start up of certain important initiatives, including the Carbon Footprint project under an agreement with the Environment Ministry to measure the impact of the Company’s activities. The effectiveness of action already taken can be seen in the continual reduction of CO2 emissions (around 180,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2011, down 7% on 2010), reflecting reduced electricity consumption, wider use of renewable sources, a reduction in emissions from building heating systems and measures affecting the vehicle fleet. Emissions intensity indicators relative to overall surface areas of buildings and of the network were down 3.6% and 2.9%, respectively, on 2010. 112 One of the main activities is extending the use of renewable energy sources and especially solar power, which will save around 5,100 tonnes of CO2 a year (3,300 tonnes at the end of 2011) at capacity. On the energy efficiency front, LED lighting is being installed in motorway tunnels (11,724 lights in 2011) and should be completed in 2012 (with an estimated overall saving of 11,560 MWh), and improvements continue to be made to outdoor lighting and indoor temperature regulation. Autostrade per l’Italia’s proactive and wide-ranging approach is also evident in its focus on reducing traffic emissions. Investments in this area have achieved significant results by lowering congestion times (thus avoiding 19,355 tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2011) and extending and upgrading Telepass (avoiding 25,318 tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2011). Other environmental inputs and outputs requiring responsible use of resources include water, waste, bitumen conglomerate and de-icing salt. Regarding water, 2011 saw an increase in consumption compared to 2010 (around 603,000 m3, up 9.8%) due mainly to higher levels of activity on motorway worksites. The Company is engaged on issues relating to the collection, treatment and monitoring of road surface water and the application of instruments and methods to limit environmental impact both on road surfaces and in service areas. On the waste management front, production of waste in 2011 was down on 2010 and the recycling rate was 64%. One of Autostrade per l’Italia’s key efforts in this area is its use of bitumen conglomerate for road surfaces (947,623 tonnes in 2011, up 10% on 2010). The Company is developing technologies that produce bitumen conglomerates made almost totally (90%) of recycled road surface and delivering considerable benefits in terms energy savings and overall environmental sustainability (in 2011 over 123,000 tonnes were recovered from fixed sites and 110,000 tonnes through cold recycling on site). Another aspect of network management is the prevention of ice on road surfaces in winter, which involves the use of de-icing salt, consumption of which is GRI/G3.1 > EN.12 tied to weather conditions. Thanks to lower snowfall levels, salt consumption dropped to 110,000 tonnes in 2011, around half the previous year’s amount. Safeguarding biodiversity is another important undertaking: around 185 km of Autostrade per l’Italia’s network is adjacent or connecting to areas that are protected or in any case of high biodiversity value, and 29% of motorway surface area (around 6,300 hectares) is made up of green spaces. Regarding the latter, Autostrade per l’Italia is engaged in experimenting re-vegetation techniques (5 sites involved). 113 6.2 Environmental commitment Autostrade per l’Italia’s environmental responsibility policy is synergically integrated in in network all phases of its activities. Possible repercussions for the ecosystem are considered and development assessed in the design phase and monitored during construction, management and operation of arterial motorways. and management All motorway design work, new works under construction and infrastructure upgrading projects are subject to Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedures that analyze GRI/G3.1 > EN26, SO1 the potential impact of building and operating infrastructure on all the environmental aspects of a territory. Anthropic: atmosphere, noise and vibrations ENVIRONMENTAL Water: surface and sub-surface water IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA) Nature: vegetation, soil and fauna Geotechnical: physical state of territory Design optimization: Motorway design Platform water collection and disposal Landscaping Complementary measures agreed with community/government * Improvements to the quality of the air, integrating new roads with existing fabric, acoustic protection systems for communities near motorways. The parameters covered by the EIA procedure are monitored before, during and after construction of works. Monitoring is also extended to the companies carrying out the work. Compared to 2010, the monitoring boundary changed in 2011 following completion of 3rd lane work on the Casalecchio-Sasso Marconi section of the A1 motorway (completed at the end of 2010).

Florence construction Problems with buildings Information for residents and vibration Vibrations of a dune, Lot 4 affected by work monitoring of buildings. 116 To minimize procurement of inert materials from quarries and use of landfills to dispose of unused excavation materials, all projects, in both the design and construction phases, aim to make full use of excavation earth both in the construction work itself (embankments, landscaping, anti-noise dunes, etc.) and to reclaim degraded areas indicated by local authorities (eg. abandoned quarries). 2011 saw the re-use of around 5.8 million cubic metres of excavation material (up 66% on 2010) in various lots of the Variante di Valico and the A14, on the Florence section of the A1, for works on the A9 and for 3rd lane upgrading on the Fiano – Settebagni section of the A1. Since the start of works on the sections under GRI/G3.1 > EN2 Autostrade per l’Italia’s investment plan, the total quantity of excavation material re-used amounts to over 21 million cubic metres. Monitoring and mitigation of environmental impact in network management All-encompassing environmental control is also exercised in the operation of motorways, in both routine and extraordinary circumstances. To this end, Autostrade per l’Italia SpA has initiated a process to implement an environmental management system to ISO14001 for its network operations. At 31.12.2011, drafting of the documental system for the management model had been completed. An issue of great importance here is noise pollution. The Company has programmed 91 reclamation jobs (Part 1 the Reclamation Plan) to be completed by 2013. Around 50 km of new acoustic barrier was installed in 2011 (in excess of the target defined in 2010) and a further 30 km is scheduled for 2012. Autostrade per l’Italia’s website has a special section on this, with an innovative 3D presentation of the results of acoustic mapping and information on critical areas and relative plans of action.

Accidents on the motorway network and in service areas sometimes involve spillage of hazardous substances. Such accidents create serious problems for both the people concerned, including emergency personnel, and the environment. Management of this sort of event is complex and disciplined by a special internal procedure covering all the main types of emergency on motorways, not only car accidents but also management di environmental risks (eg. dispersion of hazardous substances, GRI/G3.1 > EN23 fire, landslide and flooding, snowfall, ice, fog, etc.). In 2011, there were 55 accidents involving spillage of hazardous materials on Autostrade per l’Italia’s network. 117 NO. OF ACCIDENTS INVOLVING SPILLAGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL 2009 2010 2011 41 56 55 Note: volume couldn’t be quantified. ECO-COMPATIBLE FUEL PUMPS There is also a specific procedure for accidental spillage of hazardous substances and ON AUTOSTRADE PER L’ITALIA’S NETWORK pollutants in motorway service areas indicating the technical and organizational measures that personnel must take to prevent and limit damage that such events may cause. 257 257 There are two distinct zones in service areas: 243 243 • Autostrade per l’Italia zone, with parking space for cars and heavy vehicles; • oil company zone, the “hot area” where fuel is stored and sold. The two zones may “interact” in that a leakage of pollutants in the “hot area” may spread 150 145 into adjacent areas. Autostrade per l’Italia has voluntarily assumed an active role in 144 143 supervising the reclamation processes that oil companies have to provide and assisting them in the administrative procedures they have to go through. In this connection, Autostrade per l’Italia, acts in concert with local government and the authorities and organizes meetings to co-ordinate the fuel distributors’ reclamation activities, especially in the more critical cases. Regarding the commitment to promote the use of eco-sustainable fuels, at 31.12.2011, 15 17 18 13 Autostrade per l’Italia service areas had 143 LPG pumps and 17 natural gas distributors, accounting for 59% and 7%, respectively, of total fuel pumps. 2010 2011* Forecast 2012* 2009 Environmental control and monitoring is also provided for in all the business processes of the Group’s foreign companies. The Brazilian Triangulo do Sol, for example, carries out control and mitigation of the environmental impacts of both traffic operations and Petrol distribution plants worksites and industrial plant. Areas monitored include removal of vegetation, erosion of LPG embankments, sedimentation, protection of water resources, management of solid and Methane liquid waste, noise, atmospheric emissions, etc. All the environmental control activities carried out by motorway concession operators are described in an annual environmental document (RADA) which is submitted to ARTESP * The drop in the number of pumps between 2010 and 2011 relates to distributors on motorways operated by (the public services and transport regulator in the State of São Paulo). Strada dei Parchi and Società Autostrada Tirrenica (14 In Triangulo do Sol’s 12 years of operation there have been no cases of irregularities or pumps, of which 10 LPG), no longer within the reports by supervision bodies, which reflects the effectiveness of the company’s reporting boundary. environmental control activities.

Of this, around 49% was produced by Pavimental (T/YEAR) SpA and 49% by Autostrade per l’Italia SpA’s Section Departments. Recycled materials accounted for 64% of total waste produced in 2011 and consisted mainly of mixed waste 90,182 from construction and demolition, paper, scrap iron and excavation earth and rock, 94,549 packaging, bitumen mixes and old equipment. 72,958 The Italian motorway network has 34 temporary waste collection points (“Ecological 30% Islands”) installed in strategic points and 65 sorted waste collection facilities. For waste 58% disposal, Autostrade per l’Italia uses municipal waste disposal services or approved 36% specialist companies, which are also hired for recycling. Bitumen conglomerate for road surfacing Use of bitumen conglomerate for road surface maintenance and motorway network upgrading in 2011 totalled 947,623 tonnes (up 10% on 2010). It was produced and used by the subsidiary Pavimental SpA, which specializes in the production and laying of bitumen 70% 42% 64% conglomerate for the motorway platform.

Of the various ways of reusing such material, the most important is the production of bitumen conglomerates, consisting of around 90% recycled materials bound together by special bituminous emulsions and cement. GRI/G3.1 > EN1 The development of emulsions that enable mixing at ambient temperature was a major innovation because it eliminates the costs and emissions of traditional bitumen GRI/G3.1 > EN2 conglomerate production. In 2011, Pavimental recovered over 123,000 tonnes of milled material from its fixed plant and 110,000 tonnes through cold recycling on site.

Developed in collaboration with the Politecnico di Torino, the project replaced the bed of hot bitumen conglomerate with a cold one made up of 90% recycled material and 10% natural sand. The recycled material is stored at Pavimental’s Magliano Sabina plant and comes exclusively from road demolition work for maintenance purposes on Autostrade per l’Italia’s network. Work was carried out in 2010 and 2011 and the section was opened to traffic in July 2011. Use of this technique delivered economic benefits (containment of costs) as well as environmental ones due to the reduced impact of production sites in terms of lower energy consumption (and relative emissions), lower risk of pollution, safeguarding of the territory and higher overall energy efficiency. Thanks to this project: • it was possible to avoid quarrying around 100,000 tonnes of sand and gravel (around 3,500 truck loads); • around 170,000 tonnes of demolition material was recovered; • it was possible to avoid using fuel for heating and drying of materials and maintenance of bitumen at working temperatures (around 1,000 tonnes of fuel oil and 300,000 litres of LPG saved); • pollutant emissions were reduced (CO, particulates, SOx and NOx). GRI/G3.1 > EN1 De-icing salt The use of de-icing salt (sodium chloride and calcium chloride) during winter maintenance DE-ICING SALT CONSUMPTION operations to prevent ice forming on roads is indispensable for ensuring road safety and (T/YEAR) keeping roads open in winter. Annual salt use obviously depends on temperature and weather events (snow). In 2011 the Group’s motorway companies used a total of 108,362 tonnes of de-icing salt for winter operations, half the amount used in 2010 due to the 73% 216,449 decrease in snowfalls. 187,348 108,362 2009 2010 2011 122 6.4 Climate change strategy Atmospheric emissions Carbon Footprint Project GRI/G3.1 > EN16, EN18, EC2 The Carbon Footprint project is a voluntary agreement stipulated by the Environment Ministry and Autostrade per l’Italia in December 2011 to measure the environmental impact of the Company’s business. It is the first agreement of this sort in Italy to be applied specifically to motorway infrastructure operations. The project is a significant step forward in Autostrade per l’Italia’s process of systematically reporting the action it takes to produce positive environmental results (solar power, energy efficiency, technological innovation) by adopting a standard method of calculating emissions and an emissions management system. The project provides for: • identification and development of a carbon footprint calculation method in line with international protocols; • preparation of an inventory of the greenhouse gases emitted for each of the activities under survey; • definition of cost effective action to reduce emissions; • definition of an emissions management system. The first phase, to be completed in 2012, will be carried out on a section of around 600 km of motorway. The method will then be extended across the Group’s entire consolidation area. Autostrade per l’Italia emitted 180,694 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) in 2011, down 7% on 2010 due mainly to the reduction in electricity consumption through optimization measures, use of energy self-produced from renewable sources and savings on emissions from building heating.

Further information on the methods for estimating emissions can be found in the “methodology notes” section of Autostrade per l’Italia’s website (www.autostrade.it/sostenibilita/methodology.html). The figures for 2011 do not include values for Società Autostrada Tirrenica pA (around 1,770 tonnes CO2 in 2010) and Strada dei Parchi SpA (about 11,50 tonnes CO2 in 2010), which were deconsolidated as of 31.12.2011. 123 Exclusion from the Emission Trading system (EU Directive 2003/87) and the specific nature of motorway concession business mean that climate change is not at present a direct threat to the Group’s business activities or financial performance. However, the Company is actively engaged on climate change issues and invests in a series of projects to improve the eco-efficiency of its processes, produce energy from renewable sources and reduce CO2 emissions. Regarding the indirect effects of climate change (extreme meteorological events), the Company has a purpose-designed management system in place (see section on “Crisis Management”). The priority objective of motorway network operation is to guarantee optimum levels of quality and road safety. Doing this entails consumption and emissions by plant and electronic equipment, lighting in tunnels, interchanges, toll stations and service areas, fleet management, work in operating offices, telecommunication systems, and routine and extraordinary infrastructure maintenance. For some of these factors, legislation and/or contractual obligations towards the concession grantor fix increasingly stringent parameters (eg. scheduled upgrading of quality and safety levels in service areas, interchanges and toll stations) that preclude significant reductions in consumption and emissions. 124 GRI/G3.1 > EN5, EN6 Energy and environment initiatives PROJECTS / INITIATIVES ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS AIMS IN 2012 Activities • completion of connection of plants built in 2010; • construction of new solar power plants in admin. buildings and rooftops of peripheral units (maintenance posts and toll stations), mostly in the central and southern parts of the network.

GRI/G3.1 > EN17 Reduction of network traffic emissions The motorway network is not a direct source of pollution but an infrastructure for vehicles that generally speaking emit climate-altering gases and atmospheric pollutants. Emissions levels depend on several factors, some under the operator’s control and others not (eg. how people drive, ages and types of vehicle). Regarding the former, a decisive TOTAL DELAY: factor that Autostrade per l’Italia has been working on for years is traffic fluidity, meaning 2006-2011 TREND the adapting of infrastructure capacity to changing traffic volumes. The Company pursues higher levels of fluidity by, for example, the extension of electronic payment systems 98,000,000 (Telepass and Viacard), better planning of roadworks, improved management of accidents and bad weather situations and the adoption of preventive measures. Over the years, the measures taken by Autostrade per l’Italia have helped to appreciably reduce traffic congestion on the network and time lost in tailbacks, which are measured internally via the fluidity or Total Delay (TD) index5, which has come down 54% in the last five years, producing a significant reductions in levels of emission of CO2 and other 46,000,000 atmospheric pollutants arising from motorway traffic. The estimate of CO2 emissions avoided by reducing congestion times in 2011 (based on fluidity index (Total Delay) the annual fluidity index calculated for the ASpI network) is 19,355 tonnes. CO2 EMISSIONS (BASED ON TOTAL DELAY FLUIDITY INDEX TONS) 2009 2010 2011 TARGET 2012 Emissions due to congestions 22,306 22,931 19,355 18,200 Difference vs. previous year* -4,341 +625 -3,576 -1,172 * Calculation method can be looked at on www.autostrade.it/sostenibilita/methodology. The introduction and upgrading of the Telepass system at toll stations on the motorway network operated by Autostrade per l’Italia made it possible to save 25,318 tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2011, up 1% on 2010. 5 Total Delay (hours lost through traffic congestion): difference between the average travelling time measured on a given section in the period under examination and the average time under free flow conditions at an average speed typical for the section multipled by the number of transits. 126 Company vehicle fleet Autostrade per l’Italia’s vehicle fleet serves motorway infrastructure maintenance and management operations. The Group’s policy is based on a two-pronged strategy: • replace vehicles after a limited number of km travelled so the fleet is efficient, safe and increasingly clean; • switching from petrol to diesel and hybrid vehicles to reduce fuel consumption based on like-for-like distances. This strategy is also backed up by various measures to contain consumption levels, such as energy saving tyres, tyre pressure monitoring systems and satellite tracking of vehicles to help reduce travelling time and km travelled. FLEET FIGURES Composition at 31.12.2011 • 1,099 cars • 1,870 vans, trucks and special vehicles • 387 vehicles used by traffic police • 3,167 diesel vehicles • 173 petrol vehicles • 16 hybrid vehicles (bio-ethanol or natural gas) km travelled 103 million km (up 2.9% on 2010), 93% of which by diesel vehicles. Operations vehicles assigned to Autostrade per l’Italia SpA’s Section Departments make up over 53% of the Group’s fleet. These vehicles now have reduced levels of CO2 emissions (119 g/km). In October-December 2011, Section Department vehicles used by highway police were further upgraded by the replacement of 77 vehicles with models having lower CO2 emissions (136 g/km). 127 6.5 Protecting biodiversity Autostrade per l’Italia’s green spaces include central reservation flowerbeds, grass verges and green spaces at toll stations, service areas and car parks, amounting to a total 6,300 GRI/G3.1 > EN11, EN12, hectares, or 29% of the total motorway surface area. EN14 In addition to their aesthetic value, trees and shrubs: • help protect soil from erosion; • provide effective filtering of dust particles, gases and noise produced by vehicle traffic; • play a supporting safety role by preventing motorists from being dazzled by the lights of oncoming vehicles (central reservation hedges); • provide space for indigenous plants, which are often at risk in heavily built-up areas. Green spaces absorb CO2 by photosynthesis. In 2009 Autostrade per l’Italia started experimental re-vegetation of excavation waste (non-contaminated material from tunnel works used in filling and banking) by hydroseeding a mixture of C4 type perennial grasses which have a different method of fixing CO2 and higher photosynthesis efficiency (keeping up a high rate of photosynthesis even with little water) and greater resistance to high temperatures. Experiments are being carried out on five sites. The map overleaf shows the location of the principal protected areas along Autostrade per l’Italia’s motorway network. Protected areas and motorway infrastructures are shown to be highly compatible: the infrastructures do not interfere with natural habitats and they provide road users with the means of reaching them, either through toll stations or, in some cases, special access points in service areas. Around 185 km of the motorway network managed by Autostrade per l’Italia is estimated to be adjacent to or connecting parts of a protected area and/or an area of outstanding natural interest (national and regional parks, special protected areas, sites of local importance, nature reserves, wetlands, etc.). To prevent the motorway network forming a territorial barrier, a series of wildlife passages (tunnels, etc.) have been built to ensure territorial continuity. In connection with 3rd lane widening works on the Firenze Nord-Firenze Sud section, the Technical Assurance Committee asked for the impact of the project’s transparent acoustic barriers to be verified with respect to the risks posed for birds. To this end Autostrade per l’Italia, through its design subsidiary Spea, carried out a survey involving bibliographical research, specialist consultants and in-the-field experiments. This led to the identification of alternative solutions which were also discussed with the relevant environmental associations and will be further tested on work sites on the section in question. 128 MOTORWAY NETWORK AND PROTECTED NATURAL AREAS Legend Protected marine areas and reserves ZPS (Specially Protected Areas) GAPN (Marine sanctuaries) SIC (Sites of Community Importance) MAR (Marine reserves) Ramsar areas (Internationally important wetlands) AANP (Other protection areas) National and regional parks National and regional nature reserves PNR Regional parks RNR (Regional Nature Reserves) PNZ National parks RNS (State Nature Reserves) PNZ_m (Map source: Progetto Natura Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Territory and Sea). 129 GLOBAL COMPACT-GRI CORRESPONDENCE TABLE Area Global Compact principles Company systems and activities Main GRI indicators Ethical Code; ETHICs Office; training on and promotion of the Ethical Code; continuous monitoring of compliance with the principles Principle 1: Businesses should support and of the Ethical Code, also in collaboration with LA4, LA7 LA9; LA13, respect the protection of internationally Internal Audit; ongoing training on health & LA14, HR3, HR4, SO5, proclaimed human safety for all employees; workplace health & PR1, PR2, PR8 safety management system to OHSAS 18001; initiatives addressing contractors HUMAN RIGHTS (Safety Academy) Ethical Code; ETHICs Office; Model pursuant Principle 2: Businesses should make sure to D.Lgs. 231; regular monitoring of workers that they are not complicit in human rights and sub-contractors; clauses written into HR3, HR4, SO5 abuse works and supply contracts requiring compliance with the Ethical Code; internal audits and inspections of construction and maintenance firms.

In terms of documentation, the Group has maintained full compliance with the principles AUTOSTRADE and requirements of the G3.1 guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (once again receiving the highest rating). The organization of the Report is substantially in line, in PER L’ITALIA’S formal and structural terms, with the previous year’s and also shows certain improvements in both the reporting process as a whole and in the quality of Report, also 2011 in view of the work to be done in 2012 to come into line with new GRI standards (and the construction of Key Performance Indicators in particular). In this connection, the SUSTAINABILITY Committee welcomes the Company’s efforts to perfect the instrumental platform, above all with the enhancement of the set of KPIs. This involved the construction of significant REPORT new indicators and an effective process of definition of relevant quantitative information strongly geared to the dimension of actual outcome, ie. the impact generated on our territories, where Autostrade per l’Italia’s business is only one of the forces at work. The Committee notes in the Company a widespread awareness of the importance of these indicators, not only for understanding the phenomenon and communicating it to the outside world but also as objective sustainability parameters that impact at strategic, management, organizational and comportmental levels, both within the Group and in dialogue and engagement with stakeholders. The Committee appreciates the efficacy of the sustainability planning and programming process and the Company’s significant work in defining increasingly challenging targets. These efforts in 2011 produced important results in all the dimensions of sustainable development, and especially in critical areas like safety, the community, climate change, the supply chain and human resources. On the external communication front, the Committee applauds Autostrade per l’Italia’s voluntary joining of the International Integrated Reporting Committee (IIRC) pilot programme, thus confirming the Company’s commitment to playing an active role in the management of innovative sustainability developments at an international level. A number of initial moves were made in 2011 to integrate the Company’s corporate reporting, involving both the Annual Report and the Sustainability Report, in a process that must be completed by the end of 2013 and which will further strengthen the Group’s position as one of the leading players in the field of sustainability at a national and international level.
