Report on activities supporting the UN “Global Compact” initiative and the European Business Campaign on Corporate Social Responsibility (CRS) carried out within the framework of the “Approved Partner” Programme in 2011 Introduction The Mission of the Approved Partner Programme is to promote modern management methods and reliability and responsibility in business as significant principles in the creation and functioning of civic society as well as related education, in particular through the dissemination of good examples of reliable operation of companies involved in social environment initiatives and caring for the natural environment (www.solidnypartner.pl ). The main objectives of the Programme also include dissemination of economic, legal and other knowledge about the economic market and modern methods of corporate management, paying special attention to the standards observed and followed in the European Union. The “Approved Partner” Programme is the initiative of the Reliable Business Association and the European Education and Consulting Centre (until end of 2004 – Business Promotion Centre) introduced in 1995 in Wielkopolska. At the time it was the only programme of this type in Poland. It is important to add that The Delegation of the European Commission in Poland and The President of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) extended honorary patronage to the Programme. A multi-step company verification system combined with ongoing monitoring of company reliability are among the main values of the new version of the Programme implemented in 1999, which makes it distinct among other similar initiatives. The verification procedures are systematic based on verification requests submitted by companies and the documents, which are assessed in line with the principles stipulated in the Programme regulations. The assessment checks how reliably a company conducts its business, whether it pays its liabilities on time, whether it is solvent, whether it observes legal and administrative regulations and the principles of fair competition, whether the methods used internally and externally are friendly, what the quality of its goods and services is, how involved it is in the issues of the social environment and how it cares for the natural environment and last, but not least, how prepared it is to function in the European Union. In the period under discussion systematic marketing activities connected with the Programme were carried out, including ongoing monitoring and verification of the companies participating in the Programme. The documentation defined in the Programme regulations submitted by the company was collated and prepared for analysis by the Licence Bureau of the “Approved Partner” Programme (maintained by the Centre for European Education and Consultancy) and the Verification Committee (composed of representatives of the Association) assessed the companies seeking the award or extension of the right to use the “Approved Partner” logo and honorary title in their marketing activities.
