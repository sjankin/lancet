Growing Towards the Better Together Dear valued stakeholders, In May of 2011, DGB Financial Group ventured to become a regionally based comprehensive financial group. In order to turn itself into a ‘small, but strong and superior comprehensive financial group’ it had to overcome the limitations of being a local bank and establish a foothold for improved growth. To do so, DGB Financial Group has been accumulating resources from DGB Capital, KARDNET, Daegu Credit Information, and the DGB Data System. At the heart of all this is Daegu Bank, Korea’s first regional bank, with 45 years of history. In the short span of one year after its establishment, DGB Financial Group has contributed to the vitalization of the local economy and small-loan financing. It has also focused its resources on establishing the foundations for the group’s synergy businesses. As a result, we have been maintaining a stable, steady growth and recorded a 1.09% return on assets (ROA), a 15.02% return on equity (ROE), a 1.38% nonperforming loan ratio (NPL Ratio), and total assets of 34 trillion won. Notably, as a result of accomplishing solid financial results and promoting sustainability management last year, we were listed in both the 「2011 Dow Jones Sustainability Index Asia Pacific (DJSI Asia Pacific)」 and the in a row. In addition, we were selected as the leading financial company for climate change information disclosure in the 「2011 Carbon Information Disclosure Project (CDP Korea)」 for three consecutive years. Moreover, we were the first in the financial field to win the private sector grand prize in the 「Korea Sustainability Management Grand Prize」. These accomplishments have raised the prestige of our credible financial group, which faithfully strives towards our company’s high social responsibility. On a foundation based on this continuous growth, DGB Financial Group will continue to grow alongside our diverse stakeholders, which include customers and stockholders, local communities, and employees. In order to become a superior financial group, we will faithfully strive to accomplish the following tasks. First, to maximize our group’s synergy, we will strengthen our affiliated businesses with a focus on communication and solidarity. We will lay down even stronger roots in the region by demonstrating group synergy with teamwork between our subsidiaries. It will also be achieved through the accomplishment of balanced development by strengthening the capabilities of both our bank and our subsidiaries. Second, we will establish a foundation for sustainable growth that is unshakable when faced with any type of environmental change. We will accomplish this by improving our management structure with constant development and innovation. We will strive in every single step towards the long-term future to achieve sustainable growth. This will be done by diversifying into non-banking sectors and accelerating outward advancement with the goal of creating a successful group, rather than a goal of futureless external expansion. Third, we will strengthen our ‘warm-hearted finance’ by being a loving and reliable financial partner that promotes a win-win situation with the local area. For the development of the local community, we will strengthen social sharing and contribution activities and actively create ‘compassionate finance,’ such as diversifying small-loan financing in financial businesses. These actions will also increase our prominence as a regionally based comprehensive financial group. Fourth, we will reemphasize the importance of ethical management and put it into practice. Ethical management focuses on the protection of financial customers by establishing itself on legal principles and socially accepted moral codes. We regard this as a cornerstone for the achievement of sustainability management. We will establish this as the company culture of DGB Financial Group. The 2011/2012 Sustainability Report, published by DGB Financial Group, is created with international standards of social responsibility (ISO26000) and the GRI G3.1 Guidelines. It also reflects the opinions of various stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, local communities, partner companies, and employees. We strive to be transparent in disclosing our actions to fulfill the UN Global Compact’s 10 Principles. This report focuses on Daegu Bank, the main affiliate of DGB Financial Group. It contains our initiative to fulfill our role and responsibilities to the economy, society, and environment. We are also determined to transparently disclose our visions, goals, major execution strategies, and activities for sustainability management, while faithfully implementing them. We will continue to practice sustainability management that meets global standards while listening to the voices of our stakeholders. In our endeavor to become a world class regional bank that shares its dreams and prosperity with the local community, I humbly ask all of you, our stakeholders, for your continued, unwavering support and encouragement.

(a) The Company The Company was incorporated on May 17, 2011 through a business combination involving the exchange of the Company’s common stock with the former shareholders of Daegu Bank, Kardnet Inc. and Daegu Credit Information Co., Ltd. The Company’s shares were listed on the Korea Exchange on June 7, 2011 and the Company’s outstanding common stock totalled 670,266 million as of December 31, 2011.

The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the board of directors on February 8, 2012. (b) Basis of measurement The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material items in the consolidated statement of financial position: Growing Towards the Better Together Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 • Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value • Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value • Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value • Liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements are measured at fair value • Liabilities for defined benefit plans are recognized at the net of the total present value of defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets and unrecognized past service costs (c) Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in Korean won, which is the Parent Company’s functional currency and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. (d) Use of estimation and judgment The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with K-IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. Information about critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes: • Note 13 – Loans and Receivables • Note 20 – Investment property and other assets • Note 35 – Impairment losses and reversal Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year are included in the following notes: • Note 13 – Loans and Receivables • Note 23 – Provisions • Note 24 – Retirement payment liabilities • Note 44 – Commitments and contingencies 3.Significant Accounting Policies The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated interim financial statements. (a) Basis of consolidation (i) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. DGB Financial Group 2011/2012 Sustainability Report 92 | 93 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 (ii) Investments in associates and jointly controlled entities (equity accounted investees) Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. Joint ventures are those entities over which the activities are jointly controlled by the Group and another party, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. Investments in associates and jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are recognized initially at cost. The Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the income and expenses and equity movements of equity accounted investees, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest, including any long-term investments, is reduced to nil, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee. (iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. (b) Operating segment An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s CEO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. The Group has four operating segments which consist of Individuals, Corporate, Public and Money Market Center, as described in note 4. (c) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and are used by the Group in management of its short-term commitments. Generally equity investments are excluded from cash and cash equivalents. However, redeemable preference shares, for which the period from the acquisition to redemption is short, are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts are deducted from cash and cash equivalents. (d) Non-derivative financial assets The Group recognizes and measures non-derivative financial assets by the following four categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The Group recognizes financial assets in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Upon initial recognition, non-derivative financial assets are measured at their fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the asset’s acquisition or issuance. (i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset is classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss if it is held-for-trading or is designated as such upon initial Growing Towards the Better Together Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 recognition. Upon initial recognition, transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss when incurred. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognized in profit or loss. (ii) Held-to-maturity investments A non-derivative financial asset with a fixed or determinable payment and fixed maturity, for which the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity, are classified as held-to-maturity investments. Subsequent to initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. (iii) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method except for loans and receivables of which the effect of discounting is immaterial. (iv) Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments or loans and receivables. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value, which changes in fair value, net of any tax effect, recorded in other comprehensive income in equity. Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured and derivatives that are linked to and must be settled by delivery of such unquoted equity instruments are measured at cost. When a financial asset is derecognized or impairment losses are recognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. Dividends on an available-for-sale equity instrument are recognized in profit or loss when the Group’s right to receive payment is established. (v) De-recognition of financial assets The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognized as a separate asset or liability. (vi) Offsetting between financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position only when the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts, and there is the intention to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. (e) Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are either recognized in profit or loss or, when the derivatives are designated in a hedging relationship and the hedge is determined to be an effective hedge, other comprehensive income. (i) Hedge accounting The Group holds forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, currency swaps and other derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The Group designated derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments (a fair value hedge) and foreign currency risk of highly probable forecasted transactions or firm commitments (a cash flow hedge). On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument(s) and hedged item(s), includDGB Financial Group 2011/2012 Sustainability Report 94 | 95 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 ing the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction, together with the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on a quarterly basis, whether the hedging instruments are expected to be “highly effective” in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items during the period for which the hedge is designated, and whether the actual results of each hedge are within a range of 80%-125%. For a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction, the transaction should be highly probable to occur and should present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income. Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of a derivative hedging instrument designated as a fair value hedge are recognized in profit or loss. The gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value for a derivative hedging instrument and the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in profit or loss in the same line item of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or if the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting. Any adjustment arising from gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is amortized to profit or loss from the date the hedge accounting is discontinued. Cash flow hedge When a derivative is designated to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction that could affect profit or loss, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax, and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in profit or loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss in the periods during which the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in other comprehensive income is recognized immediately in profit or loss. (ii) Separable embedded derivatives Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately only if the following criteria has been met: (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the embedded derivatives are not clearly and closely related to a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative that would meet the definition of a derivative, and (b) the hybrid (combined) instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of separable embedded derivatives are recognized immediately in profit or loss. (iii) Other derivative financial instruments Changes in the fair value of other derivative financial instrument not designated as a hedging instrument are recognized immediately in profit or loss. (f) Recognition of trade date profit & loss When a financial instrument is recognized initially, the Group measures it at fair value. If there are any significant observable inputs used in the valuation technique, the transaction price is not the initial fair value. Using systematic methods, any profit & loss implied from the valuation technique at the trade date is deferred. The deferred amount is recognized over the period between the trade date and the date when the market is expected to become observable, or over the life of the trade (whichever is shorter). (g) Impairment of financial assets A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective Growing Towards the Better Together Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably. However, losses expected as a result of future events, regardless of likelihood, are not recognized. Objective evidence that financial assets (including equity securities) are impaired can include default or delinquency by a debtor, restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy, or the disappearance of an active market for a security. In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment. If financial assets have objective evidence that they are impaired, impairment losses should be measured and recognized. (i) Financial assets measured at amortized cost An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. If it is not practicable to obtain the instrument’s estimated future cash flows, impairment losses would be measured by using prices from any observable current market transactions. The Group can recognize impairment losses directly or establish a provision to cover impairment losses. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized (such as an improvement in the debtor's credit rating), the previously recognized impairment loss shall be reversed either directly or by adjusting an allowance account. (ii) Financial assets carried at cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has occurred on an unquoted equity instrument that is not carried at fair value because its fair value cannot be reliably measured, or on a derivative asset that is linked to and must be settled by delivery of such an unquoted equity instrument, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset. Such impairment losses shall not be reversed. (iii) Available-for-sale financial assets When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognized in other comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment even though the financial asset has not been derecognized. Impairment losses recognized in profit or loss for an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale shall not be reversed through profit or loss. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in profit or loss, the impairment loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognized in profit or loss. (h) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost and after initial recognition, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes expenditures arising directly from the construction or acquisition of the asset, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located. DGB Financial Group 2011/2012 Sustainability Report 96 | 97 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 Subsequent to initial recognition, an item of property, plant and equipment shall be carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation method and the useful lives of the respective assets are as follows: Depreciation method Useful lives (years) Buildings Straight-line method 40 Leasehold improvements Straight-line method 5 Operating moveable properties Declining-balance method 4 (i) Intangible assets Intangible assets are measured initially at cost and, subsequently, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization of intangible assets except for goodwill is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date that they are available for use. The residual value of intangible assets is zero. However, as there are no foreseeable limits to the periods over which club memberships are expected to be available for use, this intangible asset is determined as having indefinite useful lives and not amortized. The estimated useful lives of the Group’s assets are as follows: Useful lives (years) Computer software 4 Contributed acceptances 10 – 20 Usable and profitable donation assets 10 – 20 Industrial property 5 No depreciation is provided on intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, and are subject to impairment testing, if deemed appropriate. The useful life, residual value and depreciation method of such intangible asset should be reviewed each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite assessment for that asset. If they do not, the change in the assessment from indefinite to finite should be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate. (i) Research and development Expenditures on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. (ii) Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when they increase the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which they relate. All other expenditures, including expenditures on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred. (j) Investment property Property held for the purpose of earning rentals or benefiting from capital appreciation is classified as investment property. Investment property is measured initially at its cost. Transaction costs are included in the initial measurement. Subsequently, investment property is carried at depreciated cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Growing Towards the Better Together Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 (k) Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than assets arising from employee benefits, inventories, deferred tax assets and non-current assets held for sale, are reviewed at the end of the reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, are tested for impairment annually by comparing their recoverable amount to their carrying amount. The Group estimates the recoverable amount of an individual asset, if it is impossible to measure the individual recoverable amount of an asset, then the Group estimates the recoverable amount of Cash-Generating Unit (“CGU”). A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. The value in use is estimated by applying a pre-tax discount rate that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU for which estimated future cash flows have not been adjusted, to the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or CGU. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each CGU that is expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the goodwill acquired. Any impairment identified at the CGU level will first reduce the carrying value of goodwill and then be used to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Except for impairment losses in respect of goodwill which are never reversed, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. (e) Leases The Group classifies and accounts for leases as either a finance or operating lease, depending on the terms. Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases. (i) Finance leases At the commencement of the lease term, the Group recognizes as financial assets and financial liabilities in its consolidated statements of financial position, the lower amount of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. Any initial direct costs are added to the amount recognized as an asset. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Contingent rents are charged as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. The depreciable amount of a leased asset is allocated to each accounting period during the period of expected use on a systematic basis consistent with the depreciation policy the lessee adopts for depreciable assets that are owned. If there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life. The Group reviews to determine whether the leased asset may be impaired. (ii) Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. DGB Financial Group 2011/2012 Sustainability Report 98 | 99 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 (iii) Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease Determining whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease shall be based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets (the asset) and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. At inception or reassessment of the arrangement, the Group separates payments and other consideration required by such an arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values. If the Group concludes for a financial lease that it is impracticable to separate the payments reliably, the Group recognizes an asset and a liability at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset that was identified as the subject of the lease. Subsequently, the liability shall be reduced as payments are made and an imputed finance charge on the liability recognized using the purchaser's incremental borrowing rate of interest. (m) Non-current assets held-for-sale Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. In order to be classified as held for sale, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable. The assets or disposal group that are classified as noncurrent assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. The Group recognizes an impairment loss for any initial or subsequent write-down of an asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell, and a gain for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell, up to the cumulative impairment loss previously recognized in accordance with K-IFRS No. 1036 ‘Impairment of Assets’. A non-current asset that is classified as held for sale or part of a disposal group classified as held for sale is not depreciated (or amortized). (n) Non-derivative financial liabilities The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of financial liabilities. The Group recognizes financial liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial liability. (i) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading or designated as such upon initial recognition. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognized in profit or loss. Upon initial recognition, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. (ii) Other financial liabilities Non-derivative financial liabilities other than financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are classified as other financial liabilities. At the date of initial recognition, other financial liabilities are measured at fair value minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The Group derecognizes a financial liability from the consolidated statement of financial position when it is extinguished (i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires). Growing Towards the Better Together Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 (o) Fair value of financial instruments (i) Determination of fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value Where the classification of a financial instrument requires it to be stated at fair value, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument or by using a valuation model. The best evidence of fair value is quoted prices in an active market. If the market for a financial instrument is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using a valuation technique. Valuation techniques include using recent arm's length market transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, as reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models. If there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, the Group uses that technique. Periodically, the Group calibrates the valuation technique and tests it for validity using prices from any observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on any available observable market data. Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information available, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical techniques. (ii) Classification and level of disclosure for fair value K-IFRSs No. 1107 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires the Group to classify its financial instruments held at fair value according to a hierarchy that reflects the significance of observable market inputs. The classification of a financial instrument is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below. Level Description Level 1 Financial instruments are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market. If there are no quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets, financial instruments classified as Level 2 have been valued using models Level 2 whose inputs are observable in an active market. Financial instruments are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market Level 3 data (unobservable inputs). (iii) Determination of fair value of financial instruments that are not measured at fair value Deposit, loans and receivable The estimated fair value of deposit (with a residual maturity of less than 6 months) and loans and receivables is carrying amount. The estimated fair value of deposit (not impaired) and loans and receivable is discounted at current market rates by considering the default rates and credit spreads. Held-to-maturity financial assets Held-to-maturity financial assets include interest earning, held-to-maturity financial assets and their fair values are determined the price quoted by the market or a credible and public evaluator. If there is no such information, their fair values are estimated by using financial assets with similar credit level, maturity or profit rate. DGB Financial Group 2011/2012 Sustainability Report 100 | 101 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 Deposits The estimated fair value of non-interest earning deposits with no stated maturity or a residual maturity of less than 6 months is the carrying amount. The estimated fair value of interest earning deposits is discounted at the interest rate (market rate) of recently issued deposits with similar maturities. Borrowings The estimated fair value of borrowings with readjustment term for floating rate or a contract maturity of less than 6 months is the carrying amount. The estimated fair value of borrowings not quoted in an active market is discounted at interest rate (market rate) of recently issued borrowings with similar maturity. The estimated fair value of borrowings in won is the carrying amount. In the case of borrowings in foreign currency, the estimated fair value of borrowings with a residual maturity of less than 6 months is the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of borrowings with a residual maturity of more than 6 months is discounted at LIBOR. (p) Employee benefits (i) Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably. (ii) Other long-term employee benefits The Group provides employees with an overseas education program and participation in this program is contingent on the years of service. The estimated costs are recognized similarly with the accounting procedure of defined benefit plans. (iii) Defined-contribution retirement plans Defined-contribution retirement plans must pay the specified contribution regardless of results from operating pension. The Group recognizes the contribution to be paid as retirement benefit in the accounting period. (iv) Defined benefit plans The Group's obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former employees and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more than expected) and investment risk fall, in substance, on the entity. If actuarial or investment experience are worse than expected, the entity's obligation may be increased. Defined benefit plans use actuarial techniques to make a reliable estimate of the amount of benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. This requires an entity to determine how much benefit is attributable to the current and prior periods and to make estimates (actuarial assumptions) about demographic variables (such as employee turnover and mortality) and financial variables (such as future increases in salaries and medical costs) that will influence the cost of the benefit. The Group shall determine the present value of defined benefit obligations and the fair value of any plan assets with sufficient regularity that the amounts recognized in the financial statements do not differ materially from the amounts that would be determined at the end of the reporting period. (v) Termination benefits Termination benefits are recognized as an expense when the Group is committed demonstrably, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognized as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting period, then they are discounted to their present value. Growing Towards the Better Together Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 (q) Provisions Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the best estimate of a provision. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined at the present value of the expected future cash flows. Where some or all of the expenditures required to settle a provision are expected to be reimbursed by another party, the reimbursement shall be recognized when, and only when, it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the entity settles the obligation. The reimbursement shall be treated as a separate asset. Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. A provision shall be used only for expenditures for which the provision was originally recognized. (r) Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to the functional currency using the reporting date’s exchange rate. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognized in profit or loss, except for differences arising on the retranslation of available-for-sale equity instruments, a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. (s) Capital (i) Ordinary shares Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares and share options are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. (ii) Repurchase of share capital (treasury shares) When share capital recognized as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognized as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity. When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received results in an increase in equity, and the resulting net amount on the transaction is not recognized in current year profit and loss. (t) Share-based payment transactions The grant-date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. DGB Financial Group 2011/2012 Sustainability Report 102 | 103 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as personnel expense in profit or loss. (u) Financial income and expense (i) Interest Interest income and expense are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or liability (or, where appropriate, a shorter period) to the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not future credit losses. The calculation of the effective interest rate includes all fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability. (ii) Fees and commission Fees and commission income and expense that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset or liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate. Other fees and commission income, including account servicing fees, investment management fees, sales commission, placement fees and syndication fees, are recognized as the related services are performed. When a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw-down of a loan, the related loan commitment fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the commitment period. Other fees and commission expense relate mainly to transaction and service fees, which are expensed as the services are received. (iii) Dividends The Group recognizes dividend income when the shareholder's right to receive payment is established. (v) Income tax Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. (i) Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. The taxable profit is different from the accounting profit for the period since the taxable profit is calculated excluding the temporary differences, which will be taxable or deductible in determining taxable profit (tax loss) of future periods, and non-taxable or non-deductible items from the accounting profit. (ii) Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognized, using the asset-liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. A deferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences. A deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which they can be utilized. However, deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill, or the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction Growing Towards the Better Together Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting profit or loss nor taxable income. The Group recognizes a deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates, and interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The Group recognizes a deferred tax asset for all deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, to the extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized. The carrying amount of a deferred tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduces the carrying amount to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to offset the related current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis. (w) Accounting for trust accounts The Group accounts for trust accounts separately from its bank accounts under the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act. Funds transferred between a bank account and a trust account is recognized as borrowings from trust accounts in other liabilities with fees for managing the accounts recognized as non-interest income by the Group. (x) Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise convertible notes and share options granted to employees. 4. Segment Reporting The Group has a Procurement Division, Operational Division, Strategic Business Division, Management Support Division, Business Support Division, and conducts interdivisional and intradivisional performance evaluations. Each business sector has been identified by each division on the basis of revenues and expenses, segment performance evaluations and resource allocation decisions by financial segment unit. DGB Financial Group 2011/2012 Sustainability Report 104 | 105 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 Segment aggregation is on the basis of intersegmental economic similarity (eg. characteristics of the services provided). The Group is divided into four separate segments by importance of generating revenue and profit. The four reportable segments are as follows: Description Business area Corporate Procurement and financial services for corporate Individuals Procurement and financial services for individuals Public Procurement and financial services for public Securities (including stocks) investment and operation, business acquisitions and sales of public debt, derivaMoney market center tives design and operation, work related to foreign exchange Segment reporting as of and for the two hundred-twenty-nine day period ended December 31, 2011 is as follows: Money market Financial Classification Corporate Individuals Public center Other Subtotal Adjustment accounting Net interest income ￦ 274,152 240,895 77,315 150,767 (17,584) 725,545 (1,299) 724,246 (loss) Interest income 854,145 677,838 217,043 1,351,804 8,962 3,109,792 (Interest income 630,865 319,938 84,025 255,579 1,510 1,291,917 (7,431) 1,284,486 from external customers) Interest expense 579,993 436,943 139,728 1,201,037 26,546 2,384,247 (Interest expense 146,672 222,099 80,597 110,352 1,681 561,401 (1,161) 560,240 to external customers) Fee & commission 27,594 50,308 9,507 1,595 1,608 90,612 (35,899) 54,713 Income, net Other financial 11,405 2,141 800 22,135 527 37,008 (19,147) 17,861 Income* Bad debt expense (101,312) (101,312) Other operating loss (83,315) (138,948) (36,744) (40,334) (6,728) (306,069) (109,388) (415,457) Income (loss) before tax 229,836 154,396 50,878 134,163 (22,177) 547,096 (267,046) 280,050 expense Total assets 14,791,834 8,459,039 1,863,349 6,065,938 109,103 31,289,263 4,740 31,294,003 (In millions of won) * Other financial income, (excluding interest income/expense and the dividend income) includes net income on financial assets held for trading, net income on financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss, net income on available-for-sale financial assets, net income on held-to-maturity financial assets, net income on derivative assets hedge accounting, net income on assets-hedge accounting, impairment loss and reversal of impairment loss on financial assets, net income on foreign exchange and net disposal income of loans and receivables.

The Group is able to deal with unexpected cash flows through the disposal of securities and by additional fund raising resources such as the asset liquidization market. (e) Market risk Overview of market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments or future cash flows is affected by the volatility of market rates or prices such as interest rates, stock prices and foreign exchange rates. The most important risk related trading position is interest rate risk arising from debt securities or interest bearing financial instrument securities. Additional risk is stock risk and foreign exchange risk. Also, nontrading position is exposed to interest rate risk Market risk management Purposes of market risk management are to secure the profitability and stability by controlling the losses generated from managed assets and liabilities due to volatility of market risk factors such as interest rates, stock prices and foreign exchange rates. Objects for market risk management are securities held for trading, foreign currency net open positions, derivatives, off balance transactions and other market risk inherent assets and liabilities. The Group divides the exposure degree to market risk into trading position and non-trading position. To promote the classification and management of trading position, the Group operates its accounting and computer system according to the classification. The Group also classifies and operates a trading desk and non-trading desk separately. Market risk management of the Group is conducted by the Committee, the Council, the Working Group, the Department and sub risk management departments. The Department is distinctly separated from operating departments and controls entire market risk. The main tasks of the Department are to establish and implement a market risk management policy-to review the adequacy of market risk management criteria, to establish and implement the market risk tolerance management system-to distribute market risk tolerance, to monitor the observance of market risk tolerance, to assess, analyze and report total market risk and to establish and implement the market risk management system. Front Office is distinctly separated from the assisting department and the Department. The main tasks of the Front Office are to establish and implement investing policy, process and strategy, to set out and operate the limit of the Group's market risk tolerDGB Financial Group 2011/2012 Sustainability Report 150 | 151 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 ance, to record transaction history and to submit related documents to assisting department. Assisting department is supposed to secure the restrict separation of work and mutual control function between Middle Office and Back Office. The main tasks of assisting departments are to review the compliance of limits, transactions, profit and loss evaluation, to conduct follow-up works such as exchanging transaction confirmation documents based on operating department's transaction documents, accounting, money and to submit market risk reports. Trading position ① Definition of trading position Trading position is the interest rate, equity positions, derivatives, foreign exchange positions, among others, that pursue profit from shortterm changes in market factor price rather than pursue profit from interest income. Specifically, it includes short-term trading and the financial instruments for arbitrage trading of stock, interest rates, foreign exchange, commodity, among others, which are acquired by a professional dealer or operational departments within a predetermined limit, things acquired for hedging risk, derivative that does not apply hedge accounting, etc. ② Risk management method The tolerance limit (including the limit of VaR, investment, loss or sale of a loss) to manage the market risk on trading positions is required to be set principally at least once a year, and approved by the Committee. Compliance of the tolerance limit is monitored daily and the changes of the risk are simultaneously reported to the management, the Council and the Committee on a regular basis (daily, monthly, and annually). Plans for dealing with the market risk are established and operated for each level of the risk. ③ VaR (Value at Risk) -Measurement of VaR The main method to measure and manage exposure to market risk for trading position is VaR. The VaR measures the potential loss in value of a risky asset or portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval. The VaR is calculated by applying 99% confidence level at a 10-day MA method. -Verification Adequacy of the VaR model is continuously monitored through follow-up verification. Verification is conducted for the latest 250 business days. If real loss exceeds virtual loss (1-day VaR) of the previous day significantly, the Group verifies assumptions and modifies the model, if necessary. Verification is conducted every business day and implementations are reported to the Council once or more times a month. -Analysis of crisis situations (stress resting) The Group conducts crisis situation analysis to determine changes in market price of the portfolio under extreme market volatility that can not be considered in the VaR model. Crisis situation analysis is conducted every business day for all the assets, or if necessary, can be performed by constructing a portfolio. Implementations are reported to the Council one or more times a month. At times of severe changes, historical scenario, historical interest rates, stock prices, or exchange rates are used. Growing Towards the Better Together Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 -VaR by risk types (trading position) VaR by risk types as of December 31, 2011 are as follows: Classification End Average Minimum Maximum Interest rate risk ￦ 52 493 Foreign exchange risk 439 1,933 76 5,215 Stock risk 550 2,028 4,133 Diversification effect (478) (1,967) 16 (4,110) Total risk 511 2,046 92 5,731 (In millions of won) The sum of VaR for each risk type does not match the total VaR due to correlation between risk factors and the diversification effect. ④ Details of risk type -Interest rate risk The majority of the interest rate risk from the Group’s trading position arises on debt securities in won. The Group’s trading strategy focuses on trading gain. Because the value of trading instruments is assessed daily, the interest rate risk related with trading accounts is managed through the value-at-risk and sensitivity analysis. -Foreign currency risk The majority of foreign currency risk arises on assets and liabilities in foreign currency. Most of assets and liabilities in foreign currency are presented in USD and the rest are presented in JPY or EUR. The Group manages the foreign exchange risk through the VaR and risk capital limit. -Stock risk Stock risk arises on trading stock in won, and the portfolio for trading stock in won consists of listed stocks on the Korea Exchange and derivative instruments related with stock, and is managed through the strict portfolio limit. Non-trading position ① Definition of non-trading position The Group manages interest rate risk for non-trading position. Interest rate risk of non-trading position is the risk that the net asset value or net interest income might decrease due to the inconsistency of interest rate maturity and the unfavorable change of market interest rate. The Group measures interest rate risk for interest assets such as loans, dues and bonds, for interest rate liabilities such as deposits and borrowings and for hedge derivatives. The majority of Interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are presented in Won, and the majority of assets and liabilities in foreign currency are presented in USD and the rest are presented in JPY or EUR. ② Risk management method The tolerance limit to manage the interest rate risk on trading positions is required to be set principally at least once a year, and approved by the Committee. To verify complying with the tolerance limit, the interest risk is measured and managed at least once a month, and reported to the management, the Council and the Committee. DGB Financial Group 2011/2012 Sustainability Report 152 | 153 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 ③ Assessment Methods for Interest Rate Risk -Interest rate VaR (VaR) Interest rate VaR measures the potential loss in value of a net asset over a defined period for a given confidence interval. The Group calculates interest rate VaR by the gap of interest rate and the modified duration. -Output of interest rate VaR Interest rate VaR is calculated by the BIS standard method by considering the interval interest rate gap proposed from BIS, the standard modified duration of a defined period and the possibility of changes in interest rates. Interest rate VaR as of December 31, 2011 are as follows: Classification End Average Minimum Maximum December 31, 2011 ￦ 14,466 38,220 14,466 59,000 (In millions of won) -Other method The Group measures the interest rate risk by using interest rate VaR in addition to the interest rate EaR and interest rate gap ratio etc. The Group analyzes the influence on interest rate risk through analysis of the crisis when abnormal market conditions occurred. Foreign exchange bias Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments or future cash flows is affected by the volatility of foreign exchange rate. The Group does not divide foreign exchange position into trading position and non-trading position but manages it on the whole. Degrees of exposure to foreign exchange risk as of December 31, 2011 are as follows: Classification Enterprises Households Credit card Total December 31, 2011 Foreign currency financial assets ￦ 1,351,467 359,948 190,849 23,532 Foreign currency financial liabilities 1,714,664 308,992 174,461 5,693 (In millions of won) (f) Operational risk Overview of operational risk Operational Group is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Group's processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure and from external factors. Operational risk management The Group designates a related department to indentify operational risk and other departments are responsible for recognition of loss data and computer system management. The Department is responsible for establishing and implementing operational risk strategy, policy and process. It is also responsible for establishment, operation and improvement of operational risk management system and management of the Group's loss data. The Group applies basic index method and calculates 15% of average gross profit based on last three years' statements of income, as required capital. Tolerable limit for operational risk is set at least once a year and gets approval from the Committee. Operational risk is measured and is reported to the management, the Council and the Committee on a regular basis. Growing Towards the Better Together Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011 (g) Capital management The Group manages internal capital, which is able to maintain its business continuously with various risk. It can be defined as the scale of capital required to cover unexpected losses under a certain probability. The purpose of capital management is to use measure of financial strength rating by comparing internal capital scale with available capital scale, and to provide base of performance measurement considering risk. The Group allocates to credit risk, interest rate risk, and operation risk annually in available capital through resolution of the Committee. The Group first computes available capital by adding loan loss reserves and deducting the expected losses from base capital, and then distributes risk capital based on business plans designed to reflect risks associated with credit, market, interest rate, credit bias and liquidity. The unallocated capital is retained as capital buffer to cover other risks. Regulatory capital adequacy of the Group is mandated to maintain more than 8% on BIS ratio compared to risk-weighted assets by adopting the recommendations of BIS's Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The Republic of Korea and the Group comply with Basel recommendations. The Committee determines the Risk Appeti-te in associated with the group’s strategy and allocates the risk capital to major subsidiaries by the type of risk. The major subsidiaries operate efficiently the capital within the allocated risk capital. The Council monitors the compliance of risk capital limit status and reports to management, The Council and The Committee. In the case that risk capital exceeds the limitation due to launching a new business or expanding a business, the Group manages through previous review and approval process of the Group’s capital adequacy control. Regulatory capital of the Group consists of the following capital. -Basic capital : capital stock, capital surplus, hybrid capital securities, the Group's non-controlling interest -Complementary capital : revaluation reserve, amount equivalent to 45% of unrealized gain on valuation of available-for-sale securities and gain on valuation of equity method, eligible allowance exceeding the expected loss, convertible preferred stock not included in hybrid capital securities, issued funds of usance subordinated bonds in the period (more than 10 years) and borrowed funds of usance subordinated bonds in the period (more than 10 years), issued funds of usance subordinated bonds in the period (more than 5 years) and borrowed funds of usance subordinated bonds in the period (more than 5 years), permanent subordinated bonds and cumulative preferred stock.

(However, if subsidiary's ratio of total asset is under 5%, that subsidiary can be exempted.) The Group sets the policy of risk capital management and risk tolerable limit to evaluate and manage the capital adequacy. The Group reviews the adequacy regularly and reports the results to the Committee and management. Capital management of the Group meets both external and internal criteria and the results of capital adequacy evaluation are used through the management. The Group constantly pursues improvement in risk recognition and evaluation.
