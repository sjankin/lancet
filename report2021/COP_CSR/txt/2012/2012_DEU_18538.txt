Communication on Progress 2011/2012 ThyssenKrupp ThyssenKrupp AG !':. September 2012 ThyssenKrupp is committed to the United Nations Global Compact For ThyssenKrupp, sustainability means strengthening our ability to manage future challenges and seize opportunities. Sustainable and responsible business practice has been an integral part of ThyssenKrupp's corporate culture for 200 years. To document this, we have expanded our sustainability reporting on the corporate website. The world's population is growing rapidly, while at the same time we have increasing urbanization and globalization. The world wants more , but it has to meet these needs in a better way. With our engineering expertise in the areas of Material , Mechanical and Plant , we enable our customers to gain an edge in the global market and manufacture innovative products in a cost and resource efficient way. This is based on responsible corporate management geared to long-term value creation. We want to keep our customers, investors and stakeholders continuously informed about our successes in this area. ThyssenKrupp is following a new approach in its sustainability reporting: Information on topics such as sustainable innovations, Group-wide environmental data, employees, and a variety of projects is fully integrated into our website and will be updated continuously. So instead of a separate sustainability report, we will provide integrated reporting. Additional, user-friendly navigation provides links to content in line with GRI standards and to communicate progress on the implementation of the Global Compact principles. The integrated presentation of content on our website clearly demonstrates the connection between sustainability and business success. All relevant content is linked and will be updated continuously. Continuous reporting on our website will therefore serve as an excellent complement to our annual report, which will also include more information on our sustainability performance in the future.
