Communicating to our employees and external stakeholders is an ongoing process today that involves much more diligence and engagement than publishing a single annual report. However, the process of reporting forces a critical look at our actual performance and an accounting of our actions, which in turn ensures we remain accountable to our corporate, social and environmental stakeholders. This report is the latest segment of a conversation that began more than 140 years ago, when our Company’s founders first started canning quality vegetables and soups from a small warehouse in Camden, New Jersey. Today, reporting is but one element of a much richer conversation among our employees, customers, consumers — and everyone else connected with Campbell Soup Company and our family of brands — about the role of a food and beverage company in our society — its impact, contributions and obligations. We know not to be reactive, but strategically proactive. With multiple new trends emerging almost daily, at its core, responsible corporate behavior has focused on accountability, transparency and engagement. For companies in the food and beverage sector, however, there are a number of additional dynamics that contribute to the overall picture. Some issues unique to our sector, for example, include sustainable agriculture, responsible sourcing, promotion of human health and sound nutrition, and responsiveness to consumers’ ever-changing expectations of the foods they choose for themselves and their families. At Campbell, we strive to address each of these issues through a lifecycle lens — from start to end. Deﬁning Context Because CSR and sustainability have different definitions among different stakeholders, it is important to provide some context on how we view these terms at Campbell. At the core, CSR and sustainability at Campbell Soup Company mean: – Advancing global wellness and nutrition; – Helping build a more sustainable environment; and – Honoring our role in society from the farm to the family. More broadly, we believe corporate social responsibility and sustainability are integrated business platforms that build longterm shareowner value. These platforms foster innovation, drive operational efficiency, improve environmental performance, reduce costs, and strengthen our employees’ relationships with our customers, and ultimately create business advantage. We expect our Company to be judged not only on its financial performance but also on its commitment to CSR and sustainability. We believe firmly that our consumers, customers, employees and investors expect no less from us as we head i nto a time of fewer resources and multiple challenges. We believe the importance of this commitment will only increase. As you peruse the next few pages, which will offer a quantified lens at our progress in FY 2011, we invite you to join the conversation and become our partners in becoming responsible corporate citizens. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 2 01 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS CEO Letter A CEO perspective on our commitments to our stakeholders, our journey toward being a more sustainable company and creating long-term value in society Dear Campbell Stakeholders, Welcome to Campbell’s latest Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report. I’m pleased to have this opportunity to update you on our progress and share my perspective with you. I’m encouraged to report that Campbell continues to strengthen its long-standing commitment to creating long-term value in society by becoming a more sustainable and socially responsible company. I believe two key elements are required to implement a successful CSR strategy, and Campbell is diligently advancing both fronts. The first is to actively integrate CSR into how we conduct our business and ensure that these concepts are not standalone initiatives. The other is to effectively engage our employees by making CSR a part of their performance expectations. By bringing these two important facets together, CSR becomes an integral part of our culture. “To me, the professional and personal elements of our successful CSR work came together beautifully one day this past October at an elementary school in Camden, New Jersey. The experience brought to life my personal mission that leadership is service and reinforced the true power of giving back.” The Campbell Leadership Team and I served a healthy lunch to 150 students at Holy Name School, to help celebrate national Make a Difference Day. Our executive team and Campbell chefs created a lunch that was nutritious, delicious and, importantly, fun for the students — and for us. It featured turkey sandwiches on Pepperidge Farm Goldfish bread, Healthy Request Tomato soup and gelatin made with V8 V-Fusion juice. The lunch met the federal standards for both healthy and affordable lunches. It was a memorable day for everyone involved. I had the chance to see the excitement of so many kids. Their faces lit up as they ate — one child enthusiastically called it a “5-star lunch.” I also witnessed our leaders walking the talk, serving the children in Camden, New Jersey, the place we’ve called home for more than 140 years. The experience I had in Camden that day is not unusual. As I travel throughout the Campbell world, I hear from our employees about their pride — in our company and also for their communities. I believe it is part of Campbell DNA to be involved in the communities where we live and work. Our employees are generous with their time and expertise, and readily serve as active participants improving people’s lives in their hometowns. Whether as community group members, volunteer firefighters, school coaches, or however they chose to get involved, our employees are truly making a difference. On a recent trip, I had the chance to visit our largest manufacturing facility in Napoleon, Ohio, and tour our new 60-acre solar field, one of the largest solar panel installations in the United States. As I stood on that ground, it became clear how sustainability is a win-win proposition. This source of renewable energy will significantly lower greenhouse gases while providing our plant with 15% of its power at a lower cost. We know that improving environmental performance is good for our business. More importantly, it’s good for our planet as we work to preserve the environment for the generations that follow us. At Campbell, we are hard at work executing a new strategic framework designed to make us a more innovative, balanced and responsive company. I believe that as we build a better company under this strategic vision, we also have the opportunity to become one of the most socially responsible consumer goods companies in the world. We have a long-standing commitment to CSR, spanning more than 140 years. We are proud of our past, but are focused forward on consumers and ahead to create our future. We are also continuing to work to strengthen the core elements of our culture and our performance evaluations. We’ve captured our commitment in a statement we call “The Way We Work” that states “We will positively contribute to building and sustaining a safe, diverse, inclusive, engaged and socially responsible workplace focused on delivering business results with integrity.” Each Campbell employee has a responsibility to bring this statement to life in their own way, again marking the important intersection of the professional and personal aspects of our CSR strategy. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 3 01 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS Last year, we made significant progress against the 2020 destination goals outlined in our 2010 CSR report. In the following pages, we have endeavored to present a candid review of our efforts and achievements toward those goals. While we are proud of our achievements, we know that we have much more work to do. We are committed to nourish consumers’ lives “their way” with tasty, affordable, convenient food and beverages while helping to make our communities and environment better. I encourage you to learn more about our initiatives by reviewing our 2012 CSR Report. We hope you’ll share your comments and feedback with us at csr_feedback@campbellsoup.com. In the years to come, I look forward to celebrating with you the ongoing success of this great company. Best, Denise M.

Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 5 01 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS Key Impacts and Opportunities Understanding the impact of our products, from farm to fork Campbell’s global business and family of brands have multiple impacts within and across their product lifecycle from farm to fork. As a food and beverage company, our ingredients are grown on farms and are inherently renewable, but how we manage these resources today and in the future is critical. From agriculture and resource management to product innovation, nutrition and packaging, and extending to distribution and consumption, we impact our employees, the communities we live and work in, our customers, consumers and suppliers, and a wide range of other stakeholders that interact with our people and products. We look at every step in our operations and every personal interaction as an opportunity to advance our performance and benefit to consumers and society.

Our mission statement is an incredible tool in informing our decision-making as well as inspiring us to produce high-quality, wholesome products that are trusted the world over and to make a positive difference in the world we live in. In keeping with our company mission, we continually look to making our world’s future more nourished and sustainable. To honor that, we have reinforced new strategic business drivers this year. Campbell will be: A More Innovative Company We will be critically focused on consumer-driven innovation in products and packaging as the primary driver of organic growth. A More Balanced Company We will drive our company’s growth by providing a wide array of delicious, nutritious and convenient products across a growing global consumer base. A More Responsive Company We will be far better positioned for engagement with new and growing consumer groups. Our cultural focus is summed up in The Way We Work, which inspires us to build a safe, diverse, inclusive, engaged and responsible company — we realize the weight of those words! — that conducts business and delivers strong results with the highest standards of integrity. Deﬁning CSR and Sustainability Strategy Each year we conduct a formal strategic planning process in which we reassess and refine our core business strategies — including CSR, sustainability and community affairs. At Campbell, these are core platforms that are incorporated into key business and functional-unit strategic plans with three-year time horizons and annual performance goals that then lead to executive and personal performance objectives. Strategic CSR: Campbell Nourishes Our strategic planning process begins with a broad situation assessment, where we examine our key internal and external drivers and challenges to our CSR and sustainability strategy, including, but not limited to, key trends in the sustainability and the evolving expectations of our stakeholders. Our strategic plan for CSR and sustainability rests on four key pillars: – Nourishing Our Planet: Environmental stewardship – Nourishing Our Consumers: Our interactions with customers and consumers – Nourishing Our Neighbors: Community service – Nourishing Our Employees: Building an extraordinary workplace As part of our annual situation assessment, we not only review our performance in each of these areas, but also take into consideration external trends and drivers in the marketplace, and our stakeholders, through a multifaceted lens. We analyze a matrix of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to help us fine-tune our goals, strategies and operational priorities in each of our four primary CSR platforms. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 9 01 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS This process of self-evaluation and critical introspection helped us identify several characteristics that are important to longterm success. These include: – A shared perspective on CSR across the company; – Definition of core metrics and long-term performance goals; and – Recognition that our executives and employees must have the necessary resources and tools to activate our strategy. We declared that our strategy should provide for active stakeholder engagement; that our practices, performance and results be transparent; and, most importantly, that our efforts be shaped by a focus that is unique to Campbell and the impact we can have. Materiality Analysis Carefully examining a myriad of internal and external issues that help shape our CSR and sustainability programs Defining materiality is an important component of an effective CSR and sustainability program. We believe that this process of examining the internal and external drivers of our purpose and mission is crucial. This also helps us determine which areas align with marketplace and stakeholder priorities. There are many areas in which Campbell’s long-term business success aligns with marketplace and stakeholder priorities, including: – Sustainable agriculture: Our suppliers depend on us to educate them, engage with them on new technology, resource and energy conservation, etc., and to include them in our business’ long-term strategy. In fact, we believe that we owe them those things. – Responsible sourcing: Choosing our suppliers — who have an undeniable role in furthering our mission of nourishing our consumers’ lives — is critical for our mission to be a success. – Promotion of human health and sound, yet affordable, nutrition: Millions remain without access to nutritious food choices, while obesity continues to increase. We seek to change that by promoting sound healthy and affordable choices. We believe that carefully considering these areas of alignment can lead to a more informed CSR strategy and help drive both positive social impact and long-term business success. While most materiality issues remain relatively stable year to year, we view the monitoring and assessment process as a key organizational learning function. In addition to our ongoing issues monitoring and assessment processes, we conduct several rigorous efforts to inform and refine our CSR materiality assessment. This year’s process included: Formal meetings: We held formal meetings with social and advocacy investment stakeholders and researchers to better understand and engage on issues of priority to them. Community polls: We polled our community and external partners involved in our childhood hunger and obesity initiative, learning that issues involving our youth remain at the top of the priority list of our community stakeholders, and that, while all issues were ranked high, an immediate concern such as hunger ranked higher than education or the environment in our communities. Consumer surveys: We fielded another survey of Campbell consumers, asking them to rank issues by materiality and provide open-ended comments on our business and CSR strategy. Here, too, responses were stable. In-depth research: Dr. Daniel Sonke, Manager of Agriculture Sustainability Programs, conducted a series of approximately 50 interviews to examine priority focus areas for our suppliers. Interviewees included farmers, agriculture suppliers, retail and food service customers, NGOs and global Campbell employees.

Leadership Teams We have created an active CSR Leadership Network at Campbell that consists of five leadership teams. Each team has a formal charter, mission statement and indicators of success. Four of the teams are focused on key content areas: 1. Environmental sustainability; 2. Community affairs; 3. Building an extraordinary workplace; and 4. Delivering on the promises of our brands to our customers and consumers. These teams meet regularly to define strategy and review performance. The fifth team is our CSR Steering Committee, led by the CEO, and composed of senior executives of the company’s largest businesses and corporate functions, including Finance, Human Resources, Supply Chain, Legal, Research & Development, Public Affairs and Information Technology. The Steering Committee reviews the overall situation assessment and strategic plan for the CSR, sustainability and community affairs functions. Periodic updates on the Company’s CSR and sustainability strategy, as well as topic briefings, are also provided to the Board of Directors throughout the year.

Goals defined in the scorecard fall within four key measurement areas with respect to the Company’s financial, strategic, operational and marketplace objectives. The CSR, sustainability and community affairs organization maintains an additional corporate balanced scorecard that addresses strategic, operational, internal and external metrics. Through our balanced scorecard, we assess not only whether we achieve our objectives, but also how we achieve them. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 15 01 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS The Way We Work: Integration of CSR Further, CSR and sustainability metrics are included in categories across Campbell’s strategic planning process and are cultural components of our individual performance objective process: The Way We Work. These are the primary tools used to drive accountability and judge success on annual performance expectations. Objectives range from specific steps in strategy development to individual reporting milestones, such as establishment of agreed-upon metrics, expansion of community service programs, workplace diversity and inclusion, supplier diversity and safety. Some examples of objectives in the CSR/sustainability balanced scorecard from FY2011 include: – Advance operational performance in key metrics and cost-effective renewable energy – Develop stakeholder-informed sustainable agriculture strategy – Define communications and metrics for the Healthy Camden Initiative – Complete lifecycle assessment (LCA) for key product and packaging plans – Effectively leverage value of memberships in external organizations – Deepen strategic relationships with suppliers and customers on sustainability – Extend reach and depth of CSR communication vehicles – Effectively execute and grow employeeand community-related CSR programming – Update and/or publish key policy statements such as the Supplier Code of Conduct Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 16 01 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS Performance Scorecard Strengthening our baseline metrics and key measures and tracking our progress year over year ECONOMIC ($ millions) FY2008 FY2009 FY2010 FY2011 Net Sales $7,998 $7,586 $7,676 $7,719 Earnings Before Interest and Taxes 1,098 1,185 1,348 1,279 Taxes on Earnings 268 347 398 366 Dividends Paid 329 350 365 378 Capital Expenditures 298 345 315 272 Research and Development 115 114 123 129 1 Products with a Reduction of Negative Nutrients (revenue) 3,389 3,729 3,902 Products with a Reduction of Negative Nutrients1 (revenue/total revenue) 52 57 60 2 Products with Increased Positive Nutrients (revenue) 2,125 2,205 2,297 Products with Increased Positive Nutrients2 (revenue/total revenue) 33 34 36 3 Healthy Products (revenue) 1,741 2,060 2,269 Healthy Products3 (revenue/total revenue) 27 31 35 1 Includes products that are lowered in or developed with less saturated fat, trans fats, sodium or sugars (U.S. only). 2 Includes products that provide positive nutrition through vegetable and fruit servings (at least 1/4 cup [1/2 serving]), ﬁber and/or good source levels of vitamins A or C, calcium, potassium and iron (U.S. only).. 3 Includes products that meet the FDA deﬁnition for “healthy.” ENVIRONMENTAL ($ millions) Water Use (gross 000 gal.) 7,829,355 7,050,749 6,891,498 6,671,102 Water Use Cu.

Our multifaceted Winning With Integrity program provides the systems and tools to help our employees win while honoring Campbell’s distinguished heritage. All Campbell associates share the responsibility to ensure that our pledge to win with integrity in the marketplace, the workplace and the community is fulfilled every day, through each and every action they take. Corporate Governance To pursue the highest standards in corporate governance, our Board has long been led by an independent, nonexecutive chairman. Our goals are reflected in our Corporate Governance Standards, which are evaluated annually with systematic procedures in place for assessing the effectiveness of the Board and Board committees. Corporate Governance: Our Board of Directors Purpose & History: Campbell’s commitment to responsible corporate citizenship and a sustainable business model begins with our Board of Directors. Consisting of 14 independent members, one nonexecutive director and one executive director, our Board operations are managed by an independent, nonexecutive chairman. All our directors stand for election annually. In FY2011, the full Board convened six times, the four standing committees met a total of 29 times and all directors attended at least 75% of scheduled Board meetings and the sessions of the committees on which they served. A segment of every Board meeting was allocated exclusively for the directors to confer on relevant issues without the participation of management. Diverse Board Makeup: The diversity of our directors’ perspectives and experiences contributes exponentially to sound corporate governance. Our current Board includes 5 women: 1 from India, 1 born and raised in Argentina, 2 African Americans, 1 raised in Colombia. Our directors represent a cross-section of industries, including the food industry, consumer products, financial services, retail, packaging, finance and international businesses. Responsibilities: The Board focuses on areas that are important to shareowners, such as strategy, leadership development, emerging markets, director recruitment, external development and executive compensation. Directors have numerous opportunities to interact with individual members of Campbell’s senior management team, including periodic visits to plant facilities and customer locations to assess operations and gain additional insights into the Company’s business. The Campbell Board is also extremely focused on enterprise risk management and has a framework in place that helps assign specific accountabilities to the Board. These responsibilities as reflected in the framework are included in meeting agendas with the Audit Committee reviewing the entire framework annually. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 20 01 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS Risk Management The Process: Campbell has an extensive Risk and Crisis Management system in place, with Senior Vice President and Chief Legal and Public Affairs Officer Ellen Kaden and Chief Financial and Administrative Officer Craig Owens heading the function.

Additionally, the Vice President of Environmental Programs and the Vice President of Public Affairs and Corporate Responsibility present the Company’s progress and status regarding environmental sustainability to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors annually, focusing on the Company’s progress on energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, energy conservation projects, water use, wastewater treatment and solid waste recycling, and, further, how these efforts are impacting climate change. Public Policy and Engagement Our commitment to open dialogue, thorough disclosure and accountability in key regulatory issues Encouraging Dialogue Campbell participates actively in the discussion of local, state, national and international public policy issues that are relevant to our business strategies and operations, from food safety and advertising to healthcare and international trade. We also contribute to public dialogue on policy issues through our memberships in food and related industry trade associations. Disclosure Full Disclosure...

Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 22 01 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS ...Strengthening with Principal Codes and Policies Campbell’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is the foundation document of the Winning With Integrity program. The Code outlines our Company’s basic standards and expectations, highlights important Campbell policies, and summarizes certain fundamental legal requirements that our employees must follow at work. It also provides guidance about other resources that employees can use to answer any questions or concerns they might have regarding a potential legal or ethical dilemma. Respecting the diversity of our workforce, the Code is available in multiple languages, with every Campbell employee receiving a personal copy at the time of hire. ...and Ensuring Compliance = Winning With Integrity Our CEO is instrumental in keeping our worldwide force aware of corporate policy statements on specific compliance issues as they occur. Business units issue other policies and guidelines throughout the year, as needed. A central Index of Standards and Procedures for Compliance, maintained by the Legal Department, provides a comprehensive inventory of the policies, procedures and guidelines in use at the corporate level and within the individual businesses and functions. Revised corporate policies and guidelines are issued every year. Existing policy statements that are regularly reviewed and revised as needed include: – Code of Business Conduct and Ethics – Anti-Bribery Policy – Guidelines and Commitment Concerning Advertising to Children – Environmental Sustainability Policy – Human Rights Principles – Political Accountability Guidelines – Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual Education and Training: Employee Empowerment & Innovation Campbell provides comprehensive training for every employee on core issues such as ethics and compliance and risk-based training that is tailored to individuals’ roles in the Company and the issues associated with their specific job responsibilities.

This training is available online or in person, and is offered in 13 languages. Campbell’s Integrity Hotline Campbell’s Integrity Hotline is a service through which complaints and concerns can be reported to the Company or the Board on a confidential and/or anonymous basis. Access to the hotline is available through a secure Internet website and toll-free from all countries in which Campbell does business. To comply with special requirements of the European Union, and in certain EU member states, we maintain a separate hotline service for employees in France, Belgium and Germany. The availability of this Integrity Hotline is widely publicized and encouraged among our employees, with all reports to our hotlines investigated. Evolution of the Program Our Winning With Integrity program is continuously assessed and adjusted to reflect developments in our business. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 23 01 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS Stakeholder Engagement Winning With Our Stakeholders: Recognizing the critical importance of engaging our multiple stakeholders in business strategy Often the missing piece of business strategy and consumer orientation is true engagement. Our team at Campbell recognizes the competitive advantage we achieve from engaging our diverse spectrum of stakeholders. To that end, we use multiple approaches to gather diverse external perspectives on our business activities. IDENTIFY: In addition to third-party consumer and customer research, our Consumer and Customer Insights and Consumer Affairs departments and our Customer Relationship Managers help us identify the priorities of our marketplace stakeholders. SET PROCESSES: Specific processes are used to engage suppliers, employees, investors and external thought leaders in a range of topics, including health and nutrition, food safety and quality, environmental stewardship, community relations, and diversity and inclusion. BENCHMARKING: We conduct benchmarking for leadership performance within and outside our sector and interact with many trade and issue management groups worldwide. To complement the rich input we receive through our existing stakeholder engagement models, in FY2011 we conducted specific surveys on CSR and sustainability with consumers, suppliers and community stakeholders. With more than 230 Campbell consumers taking the time to score different topics in terms of their relevance to them and to society in general, we received incredible input and hundreds of direct comments. Direct Market Feedback: A few conclusions of our most recent CSR consumer survey indicated that: 1. Strategic Community Initiatives: Giving back to the community is something that is expected. Food companies should also help minimize hunger in the community. 2. Commitment to Food Safety: A commitment to food safety should be listed as a priority for Campbell Soup in our CSR reporting to the public. 3. Prioritizing Affordability: Manufacturing and marketing products in a way to keep food affordable, while maintaining shareowner value, should be included as a priority for our Company. 4. Championing Nutrition: Improving the nutritional content of food should also be a focus area, including a focus on using all-natural ingredients. And here are some of the ways we are responding. Public-Private Partnerships Campbell’s business leaders serve as trustees or members of the advisory boards of many organizations engaged in the CSR and sustainability agenda, including, for example, the following: – American College of Nutrition – American Council for Fitness and Nutrition – Association for Consumer Research – Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship – Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia – Childhood Obesity 180 – European Cluster for Fruit and Vegetable Innovation – Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network – Food Allergy Research and Resource Program Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 24 01 / STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS – Food Bank of South Jersey – Food for All – Foundation for Strategic Sourcing – Graham Sustainability Institute at the University of Michigan – Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation – Net Impact – Philabundance – Society of Consumer Affairs Professionals (SOCAP) – Local United Way Chapters Scientiﬁc Advisory Panel Campbell is leveraging a Scientific Advisory Panel made up of experts in Nutrition and Food Science from leading universities in the U.S. and Europe to provide external perspective on plant-based nutrition (e.g., vegetables, grains, fruits, spices). The panel has been designed to provide strategic insights on current and emerging science around plants, including their nutrient/ phytochemical composition and potential health benefits that could be derived from these ingredients and compounds. The panel also provides valuable perspective on how formulation and processing can be utilized to optimize health benefits and create products with consumer appeal, interacting directly with senior executives biannually and on as “as-needed” basis for specific initiatives.

Since 2003, Campbell Canada has removed more than the equivalent of 46 million teaspoons of salt from over 100 products across its soup brands, such as Campbell’s Condensed, Chunky and Gardennay brands. Our FY2011 efforts include: – Expansion of the number of Pepperidge Farm reduced sodium breads to 80% (69 varieties) that are at least 25% lower in sodium than regular breads, rolls and bagels; – Reformulation of SpaghettiOs canned pastas to meet the USDA criteria for healthy entrées; – Campbell Canada introduced Campbell’s No Salt Added Ready to Use Chicken broth, which contains 40mg of sodium per 150mL serving — 90% less sodium than our Campbell’s 25% Less Sodium Chicken broth; – Campbell Canada reduced sodium content by 25% in 24 of its soups — eliminating the equivalent of 16 million teaspoons of salt from the Canadian diet; and – In Australia, the sodium levels across all of Campbell’s ready-to-serve soups now meet the Australian National Heart Foundation’s sodium guidelines per 100g. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 35 02 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS Consumer Trends in Health and Wellness Along with heightened awareness about nutrition and the importance of having a balanced diet, Campbell’s consumer insights and other market research indicates demand for natural and organic food has also increased in recent years. Campbell commends this awareness and continues to proudly offer more than 100 all-natural products, including all Select Harvest soups, Prego Italian sauces, many Pace products, Swanson broths and stocks and V8 beverages. Additionally, all Wolfgang Puck soups are organic and many are now also gluten free. In FY2011, total U.S. gross sales of Campbell natural, organic and/or gluten free products exceeded $2.1 billion dollars, a testament to our commitment to prioritizing our consumers’ needs and preferences. Consumers around the world are interested in products that are 100% natural or made without artificial ingredients. Some of our FY2011 global efforts in this area include: – Campbell Germany converted 26 products to “clean labels” through the removal of artificial colors and flavors, and replacing table salt with sea salt. This encompasses 40% of their net sales. – Campbell France launched a range of 100% natural ingredient soups under the Liebig Recette Maison brand. These soups are processed with no colors and no preservatives. – In Australia, Campbell’s Real Stock and Arnott’s Vita-Weat meet the Australian criteria for 100% natural. – In Australia, Arnott’s has removed artificial colors and flavors from all of our plain sweet biscuits and from Tiny Teddy (all varieties except Tiny Teddy Half Coat Milk Chocolate), Tic Toc and Hundreds & Thousands, which are favorites with children. – In Canada, our soups, vegetable beverages and crackers are made without artificial flavors or colors. Communicating Health and Wellness Campbell is committed to providing our consumers with the nutrition information, resources and tools they need through integrated communications across brand and corporate platforms, including advertising, digital destinations and corporate partnerships. This ensures our consumers have access to this information regardless of how they engage with our company. Here are a couple of examples of our FY2011 best practices in nutrition communication. Campbell Soup Company’s Health and Wellness Portal: Campbellwellness.com Campbell’s Health and Wellness website was completely redesigned in 2011 to offer a robust consumer experience, complete with product information and advice on how to live a healthier life by incorporating Campbell products into that lifestyle. We are very proud of our redesign because it organizes content and communications in areas consistent with the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans: Weight Management, Heart Health, Vegetables & Fruits and Grains & Fiber. It is easy to navigate and offers a robust product search functionality that allows consumers to search products by general nutrition needs (e.g., fruits, vegetables & grains), beneficial nutrients (e.g., vitamin A, C, potassium) or dietary restrictions (e.g., fat, saturated fat, sodium), as well as by brand or product name. The new website provides users with science-based content, tips from nutrition experts, and downloadable resources like healthy eating plans and a food diary, to help them in pursuing a healthier lifestyle. All content was designed to be interactive, and consumers can share and Tweet the information they find helpful across all major social media platforms, as well as receive our monthly e-newsletter. We invite you to visit the website and explore for yourself. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 36 02 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS Kid Balance: Health and Wellness Curriculum The Labels for Education program, along with industry experts including Life Time Fitness, and with the help of our Campbell nutritionists, has created 10 different standards-based modules that provide a holistic approach to health and wellness through nutrition and physical activity education. Each module teaches children how to lead a more physically healthy and balanced life. The Kid Balance curriculum is a program appropriate for children 6–11 years of age and is available to participating Labels for Education schools. Product Innovation Continuously striving to develop new food products that meet or exceed expectations for being great-tasting, affordable and nutritious Campbell understands the need to innovate continuously and develop new products that meet or exceed the expectations of our consumers. We strive not only to develop new products but also enhance the quality of existing products. Our manufacturing processes are designed to maintain nutritional value and preserve the quality of our wholesome ingredients. As part of our new strategic plan launched in 2011, we are devoting significantly greater resources to disruptive innovation that will expand our product and packaging platforms to reach new consumers. Our Deﬁnition of Innovation – The creation or adoption of new products, services, systems or processes; – That results in sustainable competitive advantage, or eliminates competitive disadvantage; and – Enhances the value of the Company. Our Principles of Innovation 1. Every employee in every role is expected to have an innovation mindset to improve our products, services, systems and processes. 2. We set aspirational objectives, aligned with our Mission and strategies, to drive our innovation agenda. 3. We identify, prioritize and resource the innovation initiatives that are most likely to ensure we reach our desired destinations. 4. We ensure that all innovation initiatives adhere to disciplined principles and processes. Using Nutrition Science to Enhance Food Nutrition Research Campbell has a long history of conducting and supporting research focused on advancing better nutrition, food preparation and dietary patterns. Using a multidisciplinary approach of nutrition, food, sensory, culinary and packaging science, we offer consumers healthier choices that meet their uncompromising taste expectations. Our Research and Development department continually monitors trends to improve our products to better meet the needs of our consumers. Our goal is to help consumers reduce negative components in their diets, close nutrition gaps, maintain healthy weight and protect heart health, while emphasizing vegetable and grain nutrition. Technology We do this in several ways, including deploying cutting-edge technologies and working with external partners, such as suppliers and universities, on research and the latest innovation. In fact, Campbell has increased its focus on innovation sourcing through the sponsorship of multiple Innovation Fairs at our locations around the world. These fairs are demonstration exhibits targeted toward specific categories or objectives and source ideas from employees as well as external suppliers and vendors. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 37 02 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS Ideas for Innovation Our online innovation platform Ideas for Innovation allows our consumers, customers, suppliers, contractors, inventors and friends to share ideas with us. Through this web portal, people submit ideas for consideration by our Research and Development and Marketing personnel, who are constantly looking to improve our products, packaging and production methods. A Commitment to Innovation In July 2011, as part of an effort to further increase the rate of innovation across our baking and snacking portfolio, Campbell made a commitment to invest $30 million to build a new 34,000-square-foot innovation center at our Pepperidge Farm headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut. This will not only strengthen our commitment to innovation but also give our exemplary innovators the necessary resources to execute that commitment. FOCUS FORWARD We plan to enhance significantly our investment in innovation capabilities to deliver even more great-tasting healthy options to our consumers, while tracking and reporting our innovation progress. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 38 02 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS Ensuring Consumer Satisfaction Listening to our consumers and providing them with information they want and need Campbell actively seeks and values consumer feedback, both the positive and the negative. Last year, nearly 400,000 consumers in the U.S. and Canada contacted Campbell to ask questions, express concerns or praise our products. A majority of these conversations occurred through our toll-free phone number, although some consumers also sent us letters and engaged with us through our websites. Our dedicated Consumer Affairs team is charged with receiving, tracking and responding to all consumer feedback. This includes continuously engaging with individuals who use social media outlets to comment on our products. Through an ongoing analysis of consumer comments, we are able to improve our products, packaging, production processes and level of service. FISCAL YEAR 2011 Consumer Contact Primary Categories Inquiry: 54% Praise: 6% Complaint: 40% Tracking Consumer Feedback In addition to unsolicited feedback from consumers, we also proactively conduct frequent surveys and other research to gauge consumer satisfaction and improve our understanding of our consumers’ expectations. We constantly challenge ourselves to find new and innovative ways to meet or exceed these expectations. One of the best ways to find out whether our consumers are satisfied has been simply to ask them. Consumer satisfaction is the key to consumer loyalty and retention. Consumers participate in a short, post-call survey and provide us with useful information that is then used to create process and service improvements. Our consumers literally mean the world to our Consumer Affairs team. Providing Information Our Consumers Want Campbell continually develops and tests new programs to provide consumers with useful information on meal ideas, health and wellness, and other tips. For example, each day our Meal-Mail program delivers nearly 500,000 convenient, great-tasting meal ideas and recipes electronically to busy Americans. On the Campbell Kitchen website, consumers can also download recipe ideas that have been tested and approved by our Campbell’s Kitchen team, often with the assistance of our Campbell chefs and nutritionists. Nourishment extends beyond information and providing our consumers with choices. To that end, we actively engage consumers in programs designed to help them live better and longer lives. We understand, for example, that it can be a challenge to manage dietary needs for individuals who are allergic to certain foods. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 39 02 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS Partnership with the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network To increase awareness and provide additional education for families affected by food allergies, Campbell has partnered with the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) to offer a free six-month trial membership to any family dealing with allergies. By helping consumers participate in FAAN, we seek to assist those with allergies to understand their dietary options and obtain the information they need to minimize health risks. For consumers who prefer gluten free products, we have created a website that contains important information on regulating such a diet, as well as a list of products that are gluten free. Food Safety and Quality Providing safe and wholesome products, earning the trust of our consumers and continuously improving our safety and quality systems Over the course of generations, Campbell brands have earned the trust of our customers and consumers for delivering safe and wholesome products. We are committed to identifying and using the best available monitoring and protection technologies. We have developed and are continuously improving food safety and quality control systems that meet the highest standards in the industry. Particularly at a time when public concern over the safety of the food supply is intensifying, we know that maintaining consumers’ long-standing confidence in our products is critical. Trust is earned with each product we make, and we pride ourselves on the excellent quality standards and policies, outstanding process control capabilities and strong record of regulatory compliance we have in place. Our exacting requirements are applied not only to our facilities, but also to our contract manufacturers and suppliers globally. The Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law in January 2011, is changing the landscape of food safety regulation and will require manufacturers and suppliers to hold themselves to the strictest standards of safety and quality. Campbell is in an excellent position to comply with the new law’s food safety requirements. We expect that the law will bolster our already strong supply chain management program by requiring stricter compliance by vendors and importers around the world. Managing Food Safety Campbell has a great legacy of leading the industry in food safety. Food safety includes the growing, handling, preparation and storage of food with the goal of preventing food-borne illnesses. At Campbell, food safety involves a broad collection of departments and teams that work with one another and with external partners to manage risks and protect our consumers, our customers, our brands and our Company. Working Together… Campbell food safety professionals bring together a variety of scientific disciplines, such as microbiology, thermal processing, analytical chemistry and forensic analysis. Campbell experts are deeply involved with, and are often leaders in, the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) and other highly respected technical, trade and scientific organizations with committees dedicated to food safety. …Using Technology… Campbell employs several layers of technology to keep our food products safe — from optical sorters to magnetic scanning to eliminate metallic objects. To make certain that what’s on the label is what’s in the package, Campbell helped develop a “vision” system to help ensure that the labels placed on every can or package are correct. Another emerging area is cutting-edge X-ray technology that not only can detect metal, glass and other dense foreign objects, but can also identify package or filling defects. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 40 02 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS …and Committing to Food Safety We also understand that our products — and our reputation — are only as good as the ingredients that come from our suppliers. Campbell has developed a comprehensive program designed to protect the safety of ingredients and products throughout the supply chain, involving suppliers, packagers and co-manufacturers. Our suppliers’ quality controls must be as good as ours, and we work intensively with them to validate their processes and work with them on continual improvement. Ingredient Sourcing and Traceability We purchase our ingredients from carefully screened suppliers around the world, each of whom must comply with the strict requirements for safety and quality set forth in the Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual. These requirements were developed through comprehensive and careful auditing of suppliers’ systems and manufacturing locations and are based on best practices in the industry. Additionally, we conduct periodic audits of our suppliers as well as onsite inspections to ensure continuing compliance. We require that our suppliers know where their ingredients come from, and have exacting control and monitoring programs in place to ensure that safety and quality standards are maintained. With hundreds of suppliers located around the world, we maintain oversight and visibility into the systems and practices of our suppliers. Vendors must also meet stringent requirements, using procedures such as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), a systematic, preventive approach to controlling food hazards. We use HACCP in our own manufacturing facilities as well. Vendors and co-manufacturers are also subject to rigorous and regular audits by Campbell’s Global Procurement and Supply Base Quality teams to ensure continued compliance with our standards. We verify the safety of the ingredients and finished products using analytical tests, microbiological assays and investigations of packaging integrity — a holistic approach that makes Campbell a leader in food safety. Product Manufacturing Campbell operates 30 manufacturing plants in 10 countries with the support of more than 1,600 individual suppliers and more than 70 co-packers. Our facilities produce more than five billion packages of 10,000 distinct soup, sauce, baked snack, bakery and beverage products. Throughout the manufacturing process, our quality teams monitor, identify and address potential issues that could create a quality or safety risk. In collaboration with our suppliers, other food manufacturers and customers, Campbell has committed to the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). We require all manufacturing facility food safety systems to be certified to GFSIrecognized standards. Allergens We control for a variety of food allergens, including: – Fin fish – Shellfish – Peanuts – Tree nuts – Eggs – Dairy protein (dairy in Australia) – Soy protein – Wheat – Sesame seeds We maintain strict internal controls to safeguard against cross-contamination during production, including a data system to maintain label ingredient statement and claims accuracy. We have also pioneered the use of advanced coding and scanning technologies that help verify individual packages for labeling accuracy, allergen control and product traceability. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 41 02 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS Incident Management We maintain strict and consistent controls throughout our manufacturing processes and are prepared to act swiftly and effectively if there is ever a problem with any of our products. If we suspect that the safety of a Campbell product has been compromised, Campbell’s Corporate Crisis Management Team initiates a recall process to remove the product from store warehouses and shelves, and alerts consumers immediately. Working through protocols established by government agencies around the world, we can provide regular updates on the scope and status of any product recall. We also have 24-hour support available to our retail trade customers and consumers to address any questions and concerns. Following any recall, we conduct a thorough root-cause analysis to identify and implement corrective actions. The implementation of such a rigorous process has led to improvements in our tracking and manufacturing controls, with only two recalls affecting three products in 2011. Challenges: Genetically Modiﬁed (GM) Ingredients Campbell is keenly aware of ongoing concerns among consumers and regulators over genetically modified ingredients of food products in some of the markets where we sell products. For each of these markets, we employ rigorous practices to comply with local laws and regulations to guard against commingling of ingredients and maintain the integrity of our ingredient stream. Australia In Australia, we’re doing as much as is technically possible to ensure our products do not contain genetically modified organisms. Our policy is to use non-genetically engineered (GE) ingredients. We audit existing and new ingredient suppliers on an ongoing basis and have added a provision in their contracts stipulating our requirement for non-GE ingredients. Europe In Europe, we are committed to ensuring that our products always meet the preferences and demands of our consumers. As a result, we work to avoid the use of ingredients that are genetically modified or derived from genetically modified raw materials. That is why we currently only use ingredients from conventional sources across our portfolio of foods. Advancing Social Impact with Consumers Promoting healthy lifestyles, the prevention of chronic disease and access to healthy, nutritious and affordable food At Campbell, we stand strong in our belief that supporting strategic partnerships will allow us to make a more powerful impact on the lives of our consumers. Although there are many societal needs that deserve addressing today, we know that we are uniquely positioned to make the biggest impact in making healthy and nutritious foods accessible and affordable, targeting the hunger crisis and childhood obesity in the U.S., bringing positive opportunities to youth, and promoting heart health among women. By keeping our efforts focused, we can measure our impacts much more accurately. Campbell’s Healthy Communities Initiative We recognize that childhood obesity is a major health problem in the U.S. Campbell has long been focused on health in our workplace and healthy options in our product portfolio. In assessing the needs of our communities and our unique strengths as a company, we set a destination goal to help improve the health of young people in our communities by reducing childhood obesity and hunger by 50% by 2020. In 2011, we formally launched this program in our longtime home of Camden, New Jersey, by committing $10 million, spread over 10 years, to support our goal. We also hired a Director of Childhood Hunger and Obesity to drive our efforts in Camden and in other North American Campbell communities. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 42 02 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS Labels for Education The Labels for Education (LFE) program supports schools by helping them obtain educational resources they might not otherwise be able to afford, such as computers, athletic equipment and musical instruments. The program is registered in more than 50,000 schools and organizations, and benefits more than 42 million students. More than $9 million in educational merchandise was awarded to participating schools from 2007 to 2011. Campbell’s LFE program was recently enhanced to offer teachers 10 unique educational modules to teach children how to lead healthy and balanced lifestyles by integrating physical activity and nutrition. In 2011, additional brands, including Bic, Pop Secret, GLAD, Time magazine and Dannon have joined the LFE program, making it easier for participating schools to accumulate points and qualify for art, athletic and academic supplies. Stamp Out Hunger For the past 19 years, Campbell has partnered with the National Association of Letter Carriers and Feeding America on Stamp Out Hunger, the nation’s largest single-day food drive. Residents from across the country are invited to leave bags of nonperishable food items outside their mailboxes, which are then collected by the nation’s 210,000 letter carriers and delivered to local food banks. Campbell promotes household awareness through the distribution of direct mail postcards and a full public relations campaign. We kick off the drive each year by donating one million pounds of food to the effort. In FY2011, the food drive generated 70.2 million pounds of food, bringing the total collected since the drive’s inception to 1.1 billion pounds. Visit http://www.facebook.com/StampOutHunger to learn more. Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative The Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) was launched in 2006 by the Council of Better Business Bureaus and 10 (now 17) food manufacturers. The goal of the Initiative is to shift the mix of advertising primarily directed to children to encourage healthier dietary choices and healthy lifestyles. The Initiative uses nutrition standards to govern what products are advertised to children. Campbell is a charter participant in the CFBAI. Facts Up Front Nutrition Labeling Initiative Facts Up Front brings important information from the Nutrition Facts Panel, in a simple and easy-to-use format, to the front of food and beverage packages Campbell helped lead this voluntary initiative aligned with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines and regulations. Through Facts Up Front, participating food and beverage companies place icons on the front of their products that display calories, saturated fat, sodium and sugar per serving. Facts Up Front icons appeared on 45 Campbell products in 2011 and will continue to be expanded to additional products through 2012. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 43 02 / NOURISHING OUR CONSUMERS Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation The Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation is a national, multiyear effort designed to help reduce obesity, especially childhood obesity, by 2015. It focuses on three critical areas: the marketplace, the workplace and schools. Campbell is a founding member of the group, which includes more than 160 members, including retailers, food and beverage manufacturers, restaurants and other organizations. Together Counts Together Counts is a nationwide program created by the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation to inspire active and healthy living. The principle behind the program is energy balance, which means balancing the calories people consume with the calories they burn. Families can log onto the Together Counts website and “Take the Pledge” to schedule at least two meals and two activities together every week. Campbell and Pepperidge Farm further promote the Together Counts program through our Facebook page and website. National Salt Reduction Initiative As a leader in sodium reduction, Campbell Soup Company supports the National Salt Reduction Initiative (NSRI), an effort coordinated by the New York City Department of Health to encourage Americans to reduce their salt intake by 20% by 2015. Campbell has committed its SpaghettiOs pastas to the program; Pepperidge Farm breads and rolls, among certain other Campbell products, already meet NSRI 2012 targets. Child Obesity 180 Denise Morrison, Campbell Soup Company President and CEO, is a member of Child Obesity 180 (CO180). CO180 brings together a wide range of stakeholders from all sectors to provide a politically neutral point of engagement, create connections among leaders and organizations, and utilize the best available evidence to power up a portfolio of key initiatives to deliver accelerated, amplified impact to improve the health of the nation’s children. Key components of the CO180 approach include multisector collaboration, capacity building, large-scale initiatives and process and outcome measures. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 44 04 / NOURISHING OUR EMPLOYEES Nourishing Our Neighbors Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 45 03 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS Overview Honoring our long-standing commitment to the communities where we live and work At Campbell, we are committed to making a measurable difference in the communities in which we live and work. We describe our community initiatives, quite aptly, as Nourishing Our Neighbors. Our efforts focus on areas in which we are uniquely capable of making the biggest impact by leveraging our core competencies to drive meaningful change. Destination Goals Our 2020 destination goals are instrumental in informing our work in the community: – Measurably improve the health of young people in our hometown communities by reducing hunger and childhood obesity by 50%. – Make a positive impact on the lives of 100 million youth through our volunteer, community and signature programs. Primary Focus Core competencies: As a food company, Campbell is uniquely positioned to target hunger relief and childhood obesity. By focusing on our core competencies, we can institute change both through community programming and our brands. Each year, we partner with the National Association of Letter Carriers on Stamp Out Hunger, the largest single-day food drive in the U.S., collecting more than 70 million pounds of food in one day from generous Americans across the country. Focused diligence: We know we don’t have all the answers. Like with any other community strategy, finding all the right partners and the right approach takes time. By setting our destination goal and starting in Camden, New Jersey, where Campbell is headquartered, we are learning what it will really take to reduce hunger and childhood obesity by 50% in 10 years. By focusing on one community, we are efficiently building the foundation of a program that can be adapted to other Campbell communities in the future with the potential of impacting thousands of youth across the country. Innovation: We realize that writing regular checks and providing willing volunteers is not enough to answer our planet’s most pressing societal needs. We must develop innovative solutions. Campbell Canada’s Nourish product is a “meal in a can,” which was developed as a nutrient-dense stew fit for donation to local food banks and to aid in disaster relief situations. In partnership with local retailers, the product is sold in grocery stores across Canada, with 100% of the proceeds aiding hunger-relief efforts in two distinct ways: through the production of more product, and through a partnership with the United Nations World Food Programme. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 46 03 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS Supporting Volunteerism Providing enthusiastic and passionate employee volunteers to local nonprofit organizations to make positive changes in our hometown communities We consider our collaboration with nonprofit agencies as true partnerships that go beyond grants and in-kind support. Each year, enthusiastic and dedicated employees across the globe provide more than 23,000 hours of volunteer service to those in need in their local communities. From starting a food pantry to collecting gifts for the holidays, the impact of Campbell volunteers is felt across all regions where Campbell has operations. The Role of Employee Engagement Team volunteer events are a great way to engage our employees across departments. While these events happen year-round, more than 1,000 employees across the country make a special effort to participate in Make a Difference Week, Campbell’s annual week of volunteer service. In FY2011, Campbell employees worked with more than 20 agencies, donating nearly 2,400 service hours at 45 events across various Campbell and Pepperidge Farm communities. National Make a Difference Day, which Campbell has participated in for the past 21 years, grew to Make a Difference Week in 2007, because Campbell employees were looking for more turnkey opportunities to volunteer during their workdays. Participation in the week has doubled each year since its expansion. In FY2011, employees, including then Campbell CEO Doug Conant and his leadership team, packed 2,000 Thanksgiving food boxes for families in Camden, sorted 70,000 pounds of food for distribution and educated more than 200 children on nutrition among other projects primarily focused on reducing hunger and childhood obesity. In Norwalk, Connecticut, Pepperidge Farm employees promoted physical activity and wellness during a fall festival at a local elementary school and stuffed backpacks with food for urban youth who are eligible for free or reduced-cost meals in school but are at risk of going hungry on the weekend. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 47 03 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS Dollars for Doers Encouraging employee volunteerism and recognizing volunteer service Campbell employees are encouraged to volunteer during the workday, as well as in their own time. Our Dollars for Doers program recognizes and further supports these efforts by providing grant funding to community nonprofits, based on the service hours of employees, which are tracked in our Nourishing Our Neighbors portal, an online tool that captures volunteer hours, service projects, community events and more. In FY2011, Campbell employees throughout the U.S. and Canada volunteered more than 23,000 hours, a 25% increase over FY2010. According to values put forth by the Independent Sector, a leadership forum for charities, foundations and corporate giving programs committed to advancing the common good, the estimated worth of Campbell employees’ service time in FY2011 was $488,000. These service hours supported 215 organizations with more than 1,800 employees participating. Employee volunteerism is supported financially through the Dollars for Doers program. For every 25 hours volunteered, eligible nonprofit organizations receive a $500 grant. In FY2011, 220 Dollars for Doers grants were distributed totaling $233,500, a 36% increase from FY2010. These grants supported individual and team volunteer efforts of approximately 2,000 employees across 15 locations in the U.S. Volunteering with Strategic Focus Focusing on making the biggest possible measurable impact in our designated goal areas We recognize that to make long-lasting, sustainable change in areas such as hunger relief, childhood obesity and positive impacts to youth, financial support alone will not suffice. To complement our financial support, Campbell volunteers consistently utilize their passion, skills and talents to leverage Campbell’s core competencies as a food company to drive impactful change with key community partners. Norwalk: Kids Summer Backpack Program In the summer of 2011, employees at Pepperidge Farm headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut, launched the city’s first-ever Kids Summer Backpack Program in collaboration with United Way and the Connecticut Food Bank. Throughout this initiative, 150 children who qualify for free and reduced-cost meals during the school year received backpacks full of food each week during the summer months. Employees packed more than 1,000 backpacks in the first of this three-year program. Canada: Casseroles for the Hungry In Canada, 150 Campbell Canada employees “cooked for their causes” and created 260 casseroles for the Daily Bread Food Bank, Canada’s largest food bank, during their National Sales Meeting in Ontario. The 2,600 servings fed some of the nearly 900,000 Canadians that go to bed hungry every night. This effort was directly aligned with Campbell Canada’s commitment to alleviating hunger. Everett: Meals for Seniors Our employees work together to combat hunger in their local communities. In Everett, Washington, a group of plant employees delivered meals twice a week to needy seniors in their local community through Meals on Wheels with Senior Services of Snohomish County. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 48 03 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS Camden: Salvaging Fresh Produce At our World Headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, employees visit local farms to glean fresh produce, not perfect for sale, but ripe for donation. In an average visit to a farm, employees salvage approximately 5,000 pounds of desirable produce such as apples, sweet potatoes, collard greens and more. Campbell’s Commitment: Feeding America In most areas where Campbell has a facility, there is a steady volunteer partnership with the local Feeding America food bank. Employees assist with projects ranging from sorting food and packing kids packs and senior boxes, to building storage capability and assisting with capacity building through board service. Campbell’s South Plainfield, New Jersey, spice plant closed its facility for an entire day so employees could participate in an event at the Community Food Bank of New Jersey. In FY2011, nearly 4,000 hours were volunteered for Feeding America food banks and their member agencies. Impacting Local Youth The Hispanic Network de Campbell created the Volunteers Engaging Neighbors program with St. Anthony of Padua School in Camden, New Jersey, designed to help Spanish-speaking families and children adjust to the American school system through tutoring, English as a second language classes, and financial literacy education. In Napoleon, Ohio, volunteers help local schoolchildren with reading skills as part of a mentoring program. In Sacramento, California, employees volunteer with the local Boys & Girls Club in organizing recreational activity for the youth. Campbell People: Deb Garwood’s Story For Deb Garwood, volunteering for the Ronald McDonald House of Southern New Jersey means more than just contributing to a cause she believes in. Deb’s relationship with the Ronald McDonald House began in 2004 in Wilmington, Delaware, where the organization provided a “home away from home” for Deb’s family during her son’s cancer treatment. Upon returning to work later that year, Deb reached out to the Ronald McDonald House with a determination to give back to the organization and help other families facing the same issues she did. When Deb’s team in Consumer Affairs heard her heartfelt story, they decided to make her initiative a group effort and expressed an eagerness to participate. Ever since, Deb has personally volunteered and led the Campbell team in a variety of activities such as preparing meals to adopting families over the holidays. “In addition to benefiting the community and families in need, it also gives our team the opportunity to learn more about each other,” she says. Her most rewarding Ronald McDonald House volunteering experience was the House’s annual fundraiser, the Plane Pull, an event in which teams of volunteers are charged with moving a Boeing 737 in the shortest time. The event symbolized the different pieces of her life — her coworkers, family and friends — pulling together to reach a common goal. Through the efforts of Deb and her colleagues, the Ronald McDonald House received $10,000 in Dollars for Doers grants based on their service time in FY2011. Deb associates strongly with Campbell’s commitment to the community and corporate social responsibility. “It’s a beautiful thing when your personal mission and your employer’s goals can fit together,” she says.

Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 52 03 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS Disaster Relief In FY2011, a trio of disasters hit the Asia-Pacific region, including flooding in Queensland, Australia; an earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand; and an earthquake and tsunami in Japan. A series of devastating tornadoes also hit the U.S. heartland. Campbell responded to each of these disasters with product and cash donations as well as overwhelming support from Campbell employees worldwide. – Campbell Japan provided JPY 1,000,000 to the Red Cross and JPY 8 million worth of product to Food Bank Japan and directly to earthquake victims. Our employees served hot meals directly to those in affected regions in the days after the disaster. – Following the Queensland flooding, Campbell Arnott’s provided AU $100,000 to the Queensland Premier Flood Appeal and pallets of product to Foodbank Australia. – In response to the Christchurch earthquake, Campbell Arnott’s provided AU $90,000 worth of product to the Salvation Army. Globally, Campbell employees donated $60,000 to the Asia-Pacific disasters, which was matched dollar-for-dollar by Campbell and the Campbell Soup Foundation, to local Red Cross organizations in the affected areas, and the American Red Cross, Shelter Box, Doctors Without Borders and Save the Children in the U.S. In the U.S., Campbell donated more than 136,000 pounds of Select Harvest soup to those affected by the disaster following the tornadoes that hit Missouri, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia. Achieving Lasting Social Impact Making a measurable impact in the areas of hunger relief, childhood obesity and positive impacts to youth At Campbell, we know that in order to make a lasting impact toward hunger relief and childhood obesity, we need to embrace our core competencies, execute with focused diligence and take an innovative approach to finding real world solutions. Product Donations We know we cannot solve the hunger issue on our own. Therefore, we work closely with national organizations such as Feeding America. In FY2011, Campbell donated more than 5.6 million pounds of product in support of the efforts of 25,000 charitable organizations, an increase of nearly 700,000 pounds vs. FY2010. Additionally, more product was distributed through ongoing product reclamation efforts. Campbell Arnott’s contributed 1.2 million pounds of product to Foodbank Australia in 2011, a 12% increase vs. FY2010, a result of donations in support of natural disasters in Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Campbell Arnott’s NZ employees seperately donated to aid efforts there as a result of the Christchurch earthquake, and Campbell Japan donated and served product following the earthquake and tsunami. Campbell and Food Banks Canada continued their comprehensive multiyear partnership to support hunger relief across Canada through the donation of one million pounds of nutritious food, charitable funds, educational resources and capacity-building programs. In total in FY2011, Campbell donated more than $40 million worth of product to organizations that distributed it to those in need across the globe. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 53 03 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS Nourish In FY2011, Campbell Canada employees came together to develop Nourish, a nutrient-dense, “meal in a can.” This product was developed specifically for direct donation and packs in two full servings of vegetables and 18 grams of protein in a 15-ounce can, while being rich in fiber and other nutrients. Nourish can be heated or eaten at room temperature and features a pop-top lid, making it ideal for distribution in disaster relief situations. The initial run of Nourish included a 200,000-can donation to Food Banks Canada, the nation’s largest food collection and distribution agency. The product was sold at participating Canadian grocery stores for limited times with 100% of the net profits funding hunger relief efforts, both through including additional donations of Nourish and a partnership with the United Nations World Food Programme in which 25 cents of every can of Nourish sold helped to fund school meal programs for the poor. Stamp Out Hunger For the past 19 years, Campbell has partnered with the National Association of Letter Carriers and Feeding America on Stamp Out Hunger, the nation’s largest single-day food drive. Residents from across the country are invited to leave bags of nonperishable food items outside their mailboxes, which are then collected by the nation’s 210,000 letter carriers and delivered to local food banks. Campbell works to promote household awareness through the distribution of direct mail postcards, donation bags and an exhaustive social media and public relations campaign. Campbell also kicks off the drive each year by donating one million pounds of food to the effort. In FY2011, the food drive generated 70.2 million pounds of food, bringing the total collected since the drive’s inception to 1.1 billion pounds. Together is Amazing: Fill the Food Banks In FY2011, Campbell Canada partnered with Safeway and Shaw Communications’ flagship program, Together is Amazing, to fill food banks. The goal of the program was to deliver one million pounds of food to registered food banks before the start of the winter season to meet the needs of the nearly 900,000 Canadians that go to bed hungry each night. Consumers were asked to donate in Safeway stores and Shaw offices across Canada and each donation was tripled with a match from both Shaw and Campbell Canada, as part of their one million pound annual commitment to Food Banks Canada. The result: More than 2.6 million pounds of food collected through the drive. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 54 03 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS Let’s Can Hunger Campbell is a strategic partner with Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE), a global, nonprofit education organization that establishes a partnership between business and higher education to create a better world. In FY2011, collegiate members of SIFE teamed with Campbell for a third year on an initiative called Let’s Can Hunger, a series of competitions in which participating teams developed creative solutions for urgent and lasting hunger relief and building awareness about the hunger issue. In the 2010-2011 academic year, the challenge included participation from 236 teams spanning three countries, an increase of 24 teams vs. FY2010. These teams exceeded the cumulative goal of collecting one million pounds of food by nearly doubling it in FY2011 and benefiting 489 food banks and pantries. The overall winner for the U.S., Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, partnered with a local church and Feed My Starving Children to repackage one-ton bags of food into 162,000 individual meals for disaster relief in Japan. Their lasting hunger relief efforts included personal financial planning for 71 members of the Tulsa community. Since the program’s inception, more than 264 million people have been affected by hunger awareness outreach as a result of the effort of more than 6,600 students around the world. Help Hunger Disappear Now in its fifth year, Campbell Canada’s Help Hunger Disappear program encourages Canadians to get involved and make donations to their local food banks. This annual spring hunger campaign is timed with National Hunger Awareness Day to drive donations when Canadians don’t typically think of making donations. In partnership with key retail partners, the program has evolved to include in-store display of the word HUNGER built out of Campbell’s soup cans from which shoppers are encouraged to remove a can until HUNGER disappears. In June 2011, a store manager in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada was so inspired by the program he lived on his store roof for a week generating $40,000 in donations and food to his local food bank. Campbell Better Meals Community Kitchen Fund In 2009, Campbell Canada launched the Campbell Better Meals Community Kitchen Fund program to support local food banks across Canada in the development or expansion of a Community Kitchen. The program helps provide food bank clients with the nutrition education and cooking resources they need to make better meals. Last year the Campbell Better Meals Community Kitchen Fund provided grants to food banks in Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 55 03 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS Childhood Obesity and Hunger Focusing on our commitment to reducing childhood obesity and hunger through our signature strategic initiative We recognize that childhood obesity is a major health problem in the U.S. Today, more than 30% of our children are overweight or obese, which can lead to future health problems and associated medical and societal costs. Since its inception, Campbell has focused on health in our workplace and healthy options in our product portfolio. Campbell’s Healthy Camden Initiative In assessing the needs of our communities and our unique strengths as a company, we set a destination goal to help improve the health of young people in our communities by reducing childhood obesity and hunger by 50% by 2020. In 2011, we formally launched our Campbell’s Healthy Camden Initiative in our home of Camden, New Jersey. We announced a commitment of $10 million over 10 years in support of our goal and hired a Director of Childhood Hunger and Obesity to drive our efforts in Camden and other North American Campbell communities. Our initial efforts are focused at five pilot sites in Camden, a city of 78,000 residents, 23,000 children, one full-size grocery store and significantly higher levels of childhood obesity and hunger than the national average. Our strategy focuses on four areas: 1. Access to nutritious and fresh foods; 2. Access to safe places to play, exercise and walk; 3. Nutrition education — prenatal to adult; and 4. Building public will within the community to advance real solutions. As a food company with a healthy portfolio of products, we are uniquely positioned to participate in the creation of an accessible and equitable food system in our community. And, we are doing this by constantly leveraging our internal expertise by integrating nutrition education throughout our program strategies and engaging the community within all aspects of our work. Despite our expertise and resources, overall success will require a collective impact approach. We have assembled a group of representatives from different sectors that express a long-term commitment to our common agenda for solving the obesity and hunger issues facing our community, including: – The Y of Burlington and Camden Counties – Food Bank of South Jersey – Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers – The Food Trust – Camden Children’s Garden – Greensgrow Farms Our goal is to serve as a catalyst by identifying opportunities for long-term systemic change in Camden by inviting participation from other institutional donors, as well as ownership by community partners, throughout the city. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 56 03 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS Some of the current elements of this program include: – Promoting the introduction and uptake of healthy food choices in 10 corner stores in two target areas of Camden; – Providing adult nutrition classes to teach menu planning, smart shopping, basic cooking skills and food safety; – Implementing the CATCH training to introduce 30 minutes of daily activity four days a week during the school day; – Increasing awareness of nutrition, healthy eating and local produce for families and child care professionals by delivering more than 30 Cooking Matters classes; – Implementing the Nurse Family Partnership program to promote prenatal/well child visits focused on nutrition education; – Promoting organized urban gardening on vacant, city-owned lots to increase access to healthy produce; and – Expanding availability of seasonal produce at reasonable prices produced by local farmers, while accepting WIC, SNAP and senior coupons at all markets. In 2012, we expect to continue to advance the program in Camden, while building modules transferable to other Campbell communities. We also plan to have baseline BMI and food security outcome measures complete for Camden in 2012. Campbell Healthy Norwalk (Project L.E.A.N.) In Norwalk, Connecticut, hometown of Pepperidge Farm, childhood obesity approximates 40% and yet, until recently, no program to address this crisis existed. Pepperidge Farm invited a diverse group of community stakeholders to join us in developing a new approach to this challenge. These stakeholders, including Pepperidge Farm, the Norwalk Hospital, the Norwalk Health Department and Jefferson Elementary School, formed an alliance that was a first for the city. Each partner brought a unique set of skills and resources that resulted in very effective and productive meetings. In a matter of four months, the team designed and implemented the Learning with Energy from Activity and Nutrition (L.E.A.N.) project. Project L.E.A.N. is a three-year pilot program designed to teach a targeted group of elementary students at Jefferson School the importance of good nutrition and regular physical activity. The program is designed for second graders who will be tracked for three consecutive years. Some of the current elements of this program include: – Classroom education and exercise led by a dietician from Norwalk Hospital to promote good nutrition, healthy eating behaviors and physical activity; – A before-school “Breakfast Boot Camp” to provide students with 45 minutes of guided physical activity followed by a healthy breakfast; – Parent engagement sessions, which are scheduled throughout the school year to drive parent engagement and investment in Project L.E.A.N. Students participating in the program are also asked to complete a questionnaire designed to assess their knowledge, attitudes and behaviors toward eating healthy foods and being physically active. Additonally, at the beginning and end of each school year, BMI data is collected from each of the students. The program, while in early stages, is already showing positive shifts in attitudes and behaviors among the students. Parental feedback is extremely supportive, absentee rate for the class is down, and BMI results are moving in the right direction. FOCUS FORWARD Broaden our Campbell’s Healthy Camden Initiative to focus on a citywide food system, while also becoming a key player and convener of city and state officials, nonprofit organizations and others advocating for a food system plan to make nutritious, high-quality food accessible to everyone in Camden. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 57 03 / NOURISHING OUR NEIGHBORS Positive Impacts to Youth Increasing the availability and success of positive activities for local youth Integral to Campbell’s goal of impacting the lives of 100 million youth over 10 years is a breadth of programming aimed at improving education, health and well-being. This programming is managed by the Campbell Soup Foundation and includes consumer initiatives and beyond. Summer Program In 1975, the Campbell Soup Foundation created the Summer Program, an initiative to support safe, constructive summertime activities for underserved Camden youth. The Foundation has distributed more than $17 million in grants over 36 years to nonprofit organizations that offer summer activities in the areas of arts and culture, education, career exploration and recreation, servicing approximately 535,000 youth since the Summer Program’s inception. The Foundation annually contributes approximately $385,000 to 26 organizations during the Summer Program. Team Extreme Pepperidge Farm continues to partner with the NBA and star players such as Dwyane Wade, Tony Parker and Al Horford to engage youth across the country in fun, active play. To participate, youth simply have to join Team Extreme online, play outside and log their hours for a chance to win great prizes. The Team Extreme Website Play Center is the hub where kids can go to learn about a variety of active games to play outside. Team Extreme currently has more than 128,000 members who have logged and tracked 575,000 hours of active playtime, an increase of 86% versus the first year of the program in FY2010. Labels for Education The Labels for Education program, which provides educational supplies for the redemption of eligible product labels, has awarded more than $110 million in equipment and supplies to thousands of schools across the U.S. and Canada since its inception in 1973. The program is registered in more than 60,000 schools, with approximately 30,000 active participants. In FY2011, the program expanded through relationships with other manufacturers to include Pop Secret products, Post cereals, Emerald nuts, BIC stationery products, Glad food storage, Dannon kids yogurts and TIME Inc. publications, increasing the number of items eligible for distribution in the program from 1,500 to more than 2,600. E-Labels for Education The new e-labels initiative allows shoppers at supermarkets like Kroger, SuperValu, Safeway, Wakefern, Price Chopper and Giant Eagle to register their frequent shopper cards and designate a beneficiary school. Each time they purchase an item from an eligible manufacturer, the labels automatically get banked to the chosen school’s account, making clipping labels easier than ever. This new process allows youth and families to tap into their extended networks to support local schools and increase the number of opportunities for deserving schools to receive educational equipment they need. In the first full year of the program in FY2011, 29,000 schools received e-labels from 161,000 registered shopper cards.

Talent Management & Development Campbell believes that employees are more engaged and perform better when they know how their work relates to the bigger picture and understand what resources are available to help them develop. This year, Campbell launched a new global talent management system. This online system allows employees to enter personal objectives, view feedback and insights from their manager, and create and track an individual development plan based on their own unique career aspirations and skills. The system also provides leaders with real-time data that helps inform key talent decisions around compensation, succession, global mobility and development investments. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 64 04 / NOURISHING OUR EMPLOYEES Building a Learning Organization We recognize that development is a long-term commitment with great rewards and, therefore, develop our talent through diverse experiences, feedback, coaching, and learning programs. To do this, we organize our development efforts around four areas: All Employees Offerings focused on increasing personal effectiveness skills are available to all employees. Courses include presentation skill-building and how to effectively create an individual development plan. Managers Offerings designed to enhance manager quality are available, with topics including change management, managing performance and coaching. Leadership Offerings focused on enhancing company leadership capability are available to select leadership groups with courses like STARS, which provides a logical, consistent, iterative process for analyzing and addressing significant problems and opportunities. Functional These offerings are designed to increase employees’ knowledge and skills within a specialized function, such as marketing or finance. Enhancing Manager Quality Managers play a pivotal role in employee engagement and overall performance and are in a position to “make or break” the employee’s relationship with Campbell each and every day. Campbell believes it is essential that they have the skills and resources necessary to do their jobs well. To that end, over the last several years, Campbell has focused on building manager capability in key areas, including selecting talent, coaching and managing performance. This helps create a common language throughout the organization, and also ensures a common employee experience no matter where someone is located.

FOCUS FORWARD Our focus on Manager Quality helps ensure managers not only complete training but are also putting those new skills, processes and approaches to work within their teams. Doing so builds engagement, productivity and a better overall working environment. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 65 04 / NOURISHING OUR EMPLOYEES Diversity & Inclusion Cultivating and embracing a diverse employee population that fuels our growth and enriches our global culture Campbell defines Diversity a bit differently. For us, Diversity is “the vast array of differences, inclusive of everyone” while Inclusion is “an extraordinary place to be, where every voice is heard, you can be who you aspire to be and our differences make a difference.” Our diversity and inclusion efforts encourage all employees to bring their uniqueness and individuality to work every day. We understand that establishing an inclusive global culture is critical to our business success. In order to compete and succeed in a rapidly evolving workplace and marketplace, we must cultivate and embrace a diverse employee population that fuels our growth and enriches our global culture. This culture, represented by our commitment to The Way We Work, helps ensure we are an employer and business partner of choice for our customers, consumers, communities and shareowners. Our community of diverse cultures, ideas and voices attracts a talented and engaged workforce, sustains alignment and affinity with consumers, and fosters innovative solutions. Our Diversity & Inclusion strategy supports our intention to integrate what we know about changing global demographics into all aspects of managing our business. Today, women make up 45% of Campbell’s workforce. People of color make up 35%. While employee representation is important, we believe the culture of the organization creates and reinforces a dynamically diverse and inclusive environment. And to build this culture, our initiatives are executed with five goals in mind: Diversity Triangle Build sustainably good leadership conduct, support and accountability for driving diversity and inclusion across the organization.

In FY2010, we had to reevaluate our aggressive goals due to economic conditions. Since product volumes were down and many women-owned and diverse companies were closing or merging with larger companies, our overall supply spend was down. However, we exceeded our revised FY2011 goal of $120 million and have set an FY2011 target of exceeding $130 million in our spending with diverse suppliers. ’08 ’09 ’10 ’11 FOCUS FORWARD In FY2012 we plan to launch a supplier diversity course for our employees to ensure supplier diversity throughout the company, followed by a new scorecard and dashboard for tracking our metrics. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 69 04 / NOURISHING OUR EMPLOYEES Safety Creating a safe environment by eliminating workplace risks and rewarding safe performance Aspiring to Achieve Injury Rates of Zero We know that our journey toward an injury-free workplace requires a commitment from leadership of all levels. Campbell’s Global Safety Leadership Team was created in 2003 to develop and implement a Global Safety Strategic Plan. Our strong safety organization establishes direction and provides leadership in executing our Safety Plan. This plan aims to reduce injuries across all areas of our Company and to deliver world-class safety results. Our Safety Plan includes: – Development and implementation of global safety standards, including technology and online tools that help communicate safety measures clearly and consistently to our global workforce – Safety training for all of our 11,400 supply chain employees outside of our World Headquarters location, with more than 4,500 of them also receiving OSHA #501 advanced training on ergonomics, preventing slips and falls, and other topics – Annual regional safety conferences to share best practices and develop safety teams – Annual three-day audits of all locations, focusing on programs, conditions and behaviors – Safety recognition at Global Leadership Team meetings and through our Extraordinary Performance Awards We know that to ensure safety in the workplace, our employees must be fully engaged and trained in appropriate safety procedures. Safety systems are embedded into plant operations through employee engagement initiatives such as our Daily Direction Setting process and our Extraordinary Employee Performance Work Systems. Each region within the Campbell organization conducts an annual health and safety conference to build awareness and strengthen the ties between operational safety and workplace wellness. Results Campbell’s workplace safety performance has exceeded food industry benchmarks for the past four years. For example, the industry averages 1.4 lost-time incidents for every 200,000 hours worked. Our rate is significantly lower. Over the past 10 years, our lost-time incident rate has improved more than 80% from 2.39 to .42. The sustained safety results reflect a culture shift within the Campbell organization toward an injury-free workplace. The Campbell Soup Company occupational injury and illness frequency rate per 200,000 hours for 2011 was 2.64. Campbell experienced no fatalities in 2011. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 70 04 / NOURISHING OUR EMPLOYEES Total Lost-Time Injury Rate Recordable Rate of Injury A lost-time injury is a work-related injury or illness This rate measures significant work-related injuries that results in missed or restricted days of work. and illnesses that result in days away from work, medical care (other than first-aid), or restricted work activity.

The scope of injury statistics includes all temporary, seasonal and contract employees that work under the direction of Campbell management. Recognizing Achievements Beyond tracking and improving injuries and illnesses, we believe it is also important to recognize our employees when they reach important safety milestones. Campbell has implemented the Safety Flag Program to recognize key safety milestones at our locations. This program honors Campbell facilities where safety systems have kept employees safe from lost-time injuries on the job for at least one year or one million work hours. Today, 17 of Campbell’s 30 sites proudly fly the Safety Flag, many with gold Campbell “C”s added for reaching additional million-hour milestones. Additionally, Campbell’s Global Safety Excellence Award recognizes up to three Campbell facilities each year for their ongoing efforts to instill a concern for workplace safety into their cultures. Plants are evaluated based on a number of criteria, including: – Demonstrated safety results – Sustained safety systems – Achieving continued injury reduction – Safety leadership – Integration of safety systems – Employee ownership of safety efforts Winning plants are recognized each year in June, which is marked nationwide as National Safety Month. Past winners include the Pepperidge Farm plant in Willard, Ohio, and the Campbell plant in Maxton, North Carolina. FOCUS FORWARD The injury-free journey takes continuous improvement and diligence. Looking to the future, we will strengthen our ability to identify and share best practices and continue to advance the integration of safety and health management practices. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 71 04 / NOU NOURISHING OU O URISHIN NG OU OUR R EM E EMPLOYEES PLOYEES Nourishing Our Planet Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 72 05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET Overview Deepening our commitment to environmental stewardship through strategies focused on reducing the resources we use in the production of our products Campbell’s commitment to sustainability has evolved over more than 140 years into a set of business strategies and goals that will help us reduce our environmental footprint, as well as manage compliance, cost and efficiency. This strategy has kept us focused on providing sustainable solutions — for our business as well as our stakeholders — especially in the areas of sustainable packaging, agriculture, plant operations, logistics and transportation. We take a precautionary approach to the environment by seeking to apply processes or practices with less environmental impact when possible. To integrate these environmental programs throughout our global business operations and ensure they have the biggest impact possible, we have established long-term destination goals and performance targets in six key areas: – Energy – Carbon intensity – Water conservation – Waste management – Sustainable packaging – Sustainable agriculture Goals 2020 Environmental Sustainability Destination Goals Primary – Cut the environmental footprint of our product portfolio in half (water and greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions/tonne product produced)* Supporting – Reduce energy use by 35%, and source 40% of the energy used from renewable or alternative energy sources – Recycle 95% of waste generated globally – Eliminate 100 million pounds of packaging from Campbell products – Deliver 100% of global packaging from sustainable materials (renewable, recyclable or from recycled content) – Reduce water use by 20% and reduce the carbon footprint for tomatoes and vegetables by 20% *Relative reduction goals for energy use, water use and waste recycling in our operations are based on a baseline year of FY2008 performance.

Over the past three years, we have worked diligently at strengthening an EMS that applies to our manufacturing facilities and integrates environmental programs through our business operations worldwide. At the core of an effective EMS is strong governance and oversight. Campbell’s Board and CEO have chartered the Sustainability Leadership Team to lead the company’s sustainability efforts and climate policy. This team (comprised of senior executives in charge of Environment, Supply Chain, Procurement, Manufacturing, Agriculture, Packaging and Logistics) drives climate change strategy for the Company globally and was instrumental in establishing Campbell’s 2020 Sustainability Goals, with each plant creating its own strategic operating plan to contribute to the overall goals. Annual presentations on the company’s progress and status regarding climate change are made to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors. The environmental programs presentation includes progress on energy use and GHG emissions, energy conservation projects, water use, wastewater treatment and solid waste recycling and their resulting effects on climate change. Measurement The other key component of our EMS is the environmental performance software system, which was designed to ensure regulatory and corporate requirements are met. Campbell’s Environmental Management & Metrics System is used to collect and organize environmental documents (e.g., corporate policies, permits and reports) and activities (e.g., monitoring, measurement and reporting) to ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements and management system standards. The EMS is also able to identify, track and report on key environmental parameters. Auditing We audit our manufacturing facilities on a rolling schedule to verify compliance with environmental laws and company policies. These audits are based on the International Audit Protocol Consortium (IAPC) and any corrective actions generated are tracked within the environmental management system to ensure a timely reconciliation. Enlistment and Engagement More Campbell is also an active member of several groups globally who share goals of advancing sustainable innovation in business operations, supply chain and products. Internal experts from different disciplines participate in focus groups and committees focused on finding sustainable solutions in engineering, packaging, sustainable agriculture and lifecycle assessment (LCA). We are also a member of the Sustainability Consortium, which regularly brings together independent scientists, researchers, and engineers from businesses, NGOs, government and leading academic research institutions around the world to build a scientific foundation that drives innovation to improve consumer product sustainability. In 2011, Campbell employees participated in Earth Day activities at several facilities, which provided an opportunity for them to learn more about sustainability efforts across the company. In fact, Earth Day fairs were held at several locations, including our World Headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. These fairs have evolved as useful educational opportunities for our employees, helping them learn how Campbell and its vendors are reducing their carbon footprint and how they can also make a difference, both at work and at home. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 75 05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET Resource Stewardship Managing our environmental resources through strategies and focus areas that produce measurable results As a global food manufacturer that relies on high-quality agricultural ingredients and products for our consumers, we are aware of our impact on the environment, as well as the potential risks to the food system posed by climate change. Our employees are committed to continuing our long-standing efforts to reduce the amount of energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and water use in our operations. Teams at our plants implement strategies to reduce energy and water use in our manufacturing process. In the past four years, Campbell has completed a number of initiatives that have helped move toward our 2020 goal to cut our environmental footprint in half. These initiatives range from installing solar panels at several locations to the integration of motion detectors and energy-efficient lighting. Some specific initiatives are highlighted below. Green Building Design The new Employee Center at Campbell’s World Headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, was designed from the ground up and was awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council in June 2011. We have a commitment to utilize the U.S. Green Building Council LEED standards when constructing any significant new buildings. In September 2011, we broke ground for a new Innovation Center at the Pepperidge Farm headquarters campus in Norwalk, Connecticut. This $30 million investment will be designed as an environmentally friendly, LEED-certified green building and will employ a variety of energy-efficiency, water conservation and daylight harvesting techniques, while using recycled building materials in the construction. Climate Strategy Campbell’s climate strategy is integrated with our overall sustainable business strategy. Specific aspects include: – Sustainable agriculture – Procurement – Supplier engagement – Performance reporting In the short term, this strategy has resulted in specific capital improvements in operations, sustainability scorecard surveys in dialogue with suppliers, and tracking and reporting of performance across the Campbell plant network and to senior management. Addressing Scope 3 Emissions This year we worked with the school of Supply Chain Management at MIT to assess the embedded (Scope 3) carbon impacts of five strategic ingredients, including beef, chicken, tomatoes, flour and oils. This exercise identified several new high-impact areas for us to investigate and potentially consider in future supplier arrangements. We also began quantifying the carbon impacts of our corporate business travel. Some of the most significant sustainability decisions that have been driven by our climate strategy include capital investments in energy and water conservation projects, as well as our significant investments in renewable energy. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 76 05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET 2011 Resource Management Highlights Campbell’s Advanced Battery Technology Team slashed the average number of forklift batteries charged at our North American thermal plants from more than 1,000 per day to 83, and the number of batteries kept on hand from 1,000 to 600. They improved battery life by more than 25%, while achieving annual cost savings of $1.7 million. Campbell’s V8 Packaging Team eliminated the use of a cardboard insert inside the trays of 1.89L V8 and V8 Splash products. This resulted in the elimination of approximately 900,000 cardboard sleeves, resulting in a yearly savings of approximately $230,000. Campbell’s Energy Network Team led several initiatives that reduced water, fuels and electricity needed to make our products. Since 2005, the team reduced water use by approximately 17% and energy use by 14% per tonne of food produced. Over the past year, water use was reduced by 5% and energy use reduced by 4%. Cost of energy per case of product produced was reduced from $0.31 per case to $0.28. These projects are providing annual savings ranging from $2.5 million to $5 million. These teams were recognized at Campbell’s Extraordinary Performance Awards ceremony — the Company’s premier team recognition event. Nurturing Renewable Energy To reach our 2020 destination goal of reducing GHG emissions by 50% per tonne of product produced, we projected that Campbell needed to receive 40% of its electricity from renewable or GHG-free sources. To achieve this goal, a multidisciplinary team started working with local utilities and other third-party companies to investigate the construction of renewable energy projects at Campbell facilities. Several significant projects have come to life, including: A 60-acre, 10-megawatt (MW) solar panel project constructed adjacent to the Napoleon, Ohio, manufacturing facility This system was constructed by BNB Renewable Energy, and a power purchase agreement is in place, committing Campbell to buy 100% of the electricity generated by the system for the next 20 years. The system became operational in December 2011 and consists of over 24,000 solar panels mounted on mechanisms that track the sun each day from east to west, and efficiently positions each panel at the optimum angle to generate the most electricity. It is estimated that the system will generate approximately 15% of the electricity needed to run the Napoleon operations, the largest soup-manufacturing plant in the world. A 12-acre, 2-MW solar panel project under construction on our Sacramento, California, property This system is under construction, and is expected to begin generating electricity by April 2012. When finished, this system will consist of approximately 8,000 solar panels mounted on a similar geo-tracker mechanism and is expected to generate approximately 10% of the electricity needed to operate our Sacramento manufacturing facility. Campbell will purchase 100% of the electricity generated by the system for the next 20 years. A 250-kilowatt (kW) system installed at our facility in Puurs, Belgium This system will provide approximately 8% of the electricity needed to run the plant’s operations. A 100-kW system placed into operation at our facility in Paris, Texas This system was constructed on top of a canopy over the ingredient truck storage area. It consists of over 400 solar panels and began generating solar energy in August 2011. When these four systems are completed, Campbell will have more than 33,000 installed solar panels generating approximately 6% of the electrical power needed to operate Campbell’s worldwide operations. While considerable work is needed to achieve our 40% goal, these four projects demonstrate a strong commitment to renewable energy solutions within our sector. To help us advance our renewable energy strategy, other systems are being evaluated, including additional solar panel systems, wind turbines, biomass boilers, anaerobic digesters and other renewable energy generation systems. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 77 05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET Investing in Improved Compliance and Sustainability Performance Compliance and We are investing in a variety of new projects that advance environmental Sustainability Investments sustainability and will help us reduce the current environmental footprint of our ($ in millions) operations. These specific projects have improved the efficiency of our facilities and reduced our need for electricity, fuels and water. 23.3 We strive to comply with environmental laws and regulations while reducing our impact on the environment in our local communities by employing multiple resources, including water treatment systems, wastewater treatment systems 15.1 15.7 and air emission controls. Each year, we invest significant capital to maintain and 12.3 improve these operations. Since 2009, sustainability investments across Campbell’s plant network have yielded savings of more than $27.5 million. Waste Management FY2008 FY2009 FY2010 FY2011 We apply a consistent approach to managing the waste generated in our offices and plant operations and employ a hierarchical decision-making process for reducing, reusing and recycling our operations to minimize the impact our production has on the environment, while reducing total costs. Strategic initiatives are implemented to reduce these various waste streams. We leverage the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Food Waste Recovery Hierarchy to prioritize our food waste reduction efforts. Campbell actively participates on the Leadership Committee of a new three-year initiative launched by the Grocery Manufacturers Association and Food Marketing Institute to help the industry reduce levels of food waste. Efforts such as reducing the amount of food manufacturing waste and reusing waste product as either an animal feed or compost have reduced the amount of waste we send to local landfills. Campbell offices around the world have also supported our goal of reducing waste by implementing programs to minimize the use of office paper and recycle waste from our office areas. At Campbell World Headquarters alone, a consolidated effort has reduced office supply shipments by 50% since FY2009 and cut paper usage by over 20% in FY2011. That translates into positive environmental impacts. Material Use and Recycling Closed-loop options and beneficial reuse principles guide our processes when it comes to recycling materials. We continue to expand our comprehensive recycling programs as we strive to achieve our worldwide 95% recycle rate goal. Current programs to recycle food waste, corrugated paper, steel drums, office paper, plastic, fluorescent tubes, batteries, wood pallets and scrap metal are being evaluated to ensure maximum efficiency. Part of this effort included the diversion of off-specification product from local landfills to a facility that can remove the container to reuse the food material as animal feed ingredients. In FY2011, Campbell generated 301,445 metric tonnes of solid waste from our worldwide operations, which is a reduction of 7% from FY2010. Of this, 241,647 metric tonnes were recycled and 59,798 were disposed of in local landfills or utilized as fuel for resource recovery facilities. Campbell’s worldwide recycle rate for FY2011 was greater than 80%. The planned closing of our Utrecht facility eliminated a 100%-recycled waste stream, and therefore resulted in a slight decline of our corporate recycle rate. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 78 05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET Global Asset Recovery The Campbell Asset Recovery Team works globally to find beneficial reuse or recycling options for some of the food-processing and electronic equipment we no longer use or need. We maintain an online marketplace and data-tracking tools to help facilitate this program. In FY2011, Campbell recycled or reused close to 1.2 million pounds of used equipment and generated nearly $700,000 in revenue from the sale of used equipment. Water Resource Mapping Assessing our global water use and looking for ways to maximize water efficiencies Water is an integral component in the production of all food and beverages. At Campbell, we use water in many of our products, as well as for cleaning, cooking, and vegetable transport within our plants. Maintaining a clean and sustainable supply of water is essential both to the future of our Company and the future of our communities. Complex Use All of our manufacturing plants have implemented water conservation measures and have established systems to ensure that water used in our operations is appropriately cleaned and treated before it is returned to the environment. Our water use is complex and affects every aspect of our production and distribution process. For example, we use water: – To wash ingredients – To cool finished products – To satisfy our steam requirements – To clean and sanitize our operations – As an ingredient in our products All Campbell operations provide wastewater treatment through the use of either a Company-owned treatment system or through treatment prior to discharge to a municipal-owned treatment facility. We apply a stewardship philosophy when it comes to water, by advancing conservation across our enterprise and committing to returning clean and appropriately treated water to our local communities. Water conservation goals are included in business-level operational scorecards. As water demand increases to sustain environmental and human needs, Campbell is continually looking for sustainable solutions to maximize its water efficiencies. Site-by-Site Water Scarcity Mapping In 2011, Campbell performed a site-by-site mapping of water usage and cross-referenced the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Global Water Tool to include nearand long-term water scarcity. The WBCSD created the Global Water Tool to help companies map their facilities’ water intake, recycled water and wastewater extraction procedures. The tool, using close to 30 external datasets from various research and creditable sources, analyzes our plant data (geospatial and water records) against the external datasets to provide us with fundamental information on water dependency, water purification/treatment and water risk on a country level, as well as water supply and water scarcity per country, and local watershed levels. While we currently account for gross water use metrics, we have not fully accounted for our very strong water recycling and stewardship practices in the following table. In coming years, we will strive to strengthen the full gross-net water management data.

In 2009, we began filing our metrics within the framework of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Campbell’s latest submission can be reviewed in detail at the Carbon Disclosure Project website. Our scores have steadily improved, and we continue to compile sustainability data, including energy use, water use and solid waste generation and disposal for our worldwide operations. Our Sustainability Scorecard compares the metrics in these categories over the past four fiscal years.

Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 82 05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET Sustainable Packaging Innovating to drive continuous improvement in our sustainable packaging footprint Campbell’s global packaging development organization is committed to continuously improving our sustainable packaging footprint. Our packaging professionals are engaged in both short-term improvements and long-term packaging innovation that will reduce the environmental impact of our packaging. To support these efforts, we have established a global packaging sustainability program with publicly stated goals and established guidelines and principles. Integration into the development of our packaging is executed on a continuous basis. We have also developed training for our packaging designers so that they understand our expectations and direction. This enables them to make structured decisions whenever a packaging change is contemplated. Our Packaging Principles Design with a sustainability mindset to deliver safe, consumer-preferred Protect packaging while minimizing our environmental impact. Create economic value by linking sustainability with source reduction, Reduce material selection and supply-chain efficiencies. Recycle Partner externally with suppliers, customers and industry groups to strengthen our program and influence direction. Renew Protect Implement packaging that delivers the safest, highest-quality food, while Partner ensuring consumer and brand protection. Reduce Continuously seek packaging material and processes that utilize fewer resources while maintaining product quality and supply-chain efficiency. Recycle Utilize recyclable & recycled content packaging materials when possible. Renew Utilize renewable sources of packaging materials when safe and effective. Partner Work with suppliers to promote clean production technologies and best manufacturing processes. Sustainable Packaging Goals 100 million pounds of 100% of our global 100% of our packaging packaging eliminated packaging made from supply base proactively by 2020 through: sustainable materials, engaged in developing – Material selection including: sustainable alternatives – Renewable materials that are: – Material reduction – Recyclable materials – Economically feasible – Recycled content – Grounded in science and technology – Sustainable end-of-life scenarios Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 83 05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET Highlights FY2011 Material Reduction Highlights – Pepperidge Farm redesigned the Goldfish bread and Deli Flats package and reduced plastic usage by 65% (by unit weight). – Light-weighting of Campbell’s new V8 PET beverage bottles saved more than 540,000 pounds of plastic. Ongoing expansion of the program will save more than 1.2 million pounds and more than $850,000 annually in FY2012. – Campbell Canada achieved 250,000 pounds of steel reduction through an end light-weighting program. Alternative Packaging – Pepperidge Farm used more than 4 million, 100%-post-consumer-recycled shipping cases in its Denver and Downingtown, Pennsylvania, bakeries. – Arnott’s redesigned Cruskits pack saved more than 10,000 pounds of paper and 45,000 pounds of corrugate. Audits – Pepperidge Farm completed waste audits on two bakeries in an organized program to reduce packaging waste sent to landfills. Cross-Sector Collaborations – Campbell is a member of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition and the Sustainability Consortium, which are dedicated to developing and promoting global standards for the sustainable improvement of products. – Campbell attained a packaging score of 100 on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Innovation – We continue to work with our key suppliers on strategic technologies focused on producing sustainability breakthroughs in the area of packaging. Many of these innovations were showcased at our Sustainability Packaging Fair held at Campbell World Headquarters in April 2011. Packaging Challenges A topic that continues to receive increased attention is the use of a material called Packaging Reductions bisphenol A (BPA). BPA is widely used in the lining of metal food containers to prevent (in millions of pounds) corrosion and help maintain the food’s safety, quality and flavor. Campbell — with our suppliers — has been researching alternatives to BPA that perform as well as existing 4.62 4.71 packaging. We believe that the current can packaging technology used in our products is one of the safest food package options in the world. However, we have been studying the issue and recognize that there has been a debate over the use of BPA. 1.26 For more than 140 years, we’ve earned consumers’ trust — and we intend to keep it. We have already started using packaging lined with a BPA alternative in some of our soups, and we are working to phase out the use of BPA in can linings in the rest of our ’09 ’10 ’11 canned products. Steel Paper Corrugate Plastic Glass Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 84 05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET Sustainable Agriculture Collaborating with farmers and applying comprehensive agricultural science to strengthen our agricultural programs Tomatoes: An Iconic — and Mainstay — Campbell Crop Campbell Soup Company began as a preserve company in 1869 and canned tomatoes from the very beginning. The first soup made by the company (in 1895) was tomato soup. Today, we use tomatoes in a wide range of soups, sauces and beverages, and have a close relationship with tomato farmers. Thus, tomatoes have been a primary focus of the company’s long-running sustainable agriculture efforts. In 1947, Campbell opened its tomato processing operations in California. At least one tomato farming family has been selling to the company ever since that first season. All of the contract farms that sell tomatoes directly to Campbell are family owned. Most of them are thirdor fourth-generation farmers and many have been Campbell’s preferred suppliers for more than one generation. Today, California’s tomato farmers have their own membership-based cooperative bargaining agreement, which negotiates an industry price with Campbell and other processors. Since the 1950s, the processing tomatoes in California have been harvested by machine, unlike fresh market tomatoes. Processing tomatoes are vine-ripened and harvested at peak red ripeness. The majority of tomatoes used by Campbell are grown in the rich Central Valley farming region of California and processed at Campbell-owned plants. This region is highly diverse, with over 300 crops grown, and renowned for its high-quality production. For this reason, the region produces 95% of U.S. processing tomatoes. Regional Production As much as possible, tomatoes are sourced from farms located close to the plants to minimize transportation distance and time and the associated fuel use. Campbell’s agriculture team continues to look for ways to reduce this distance even more. Drip Irrigation Drip irrigation is one of the most effective ways to reduce the amount of water used per pound of tomato production. Campbell encourages its growers to utilize this technology where it is cost-effective to do so. In 2011, approximately 29% of the acres producing tomatoes for the company utilized drip irrigation. The developing Campbell Agriculture Sustainability Program is also investigating opportunities to promote the continued adoption of water conservation practices both in tomato farming and processing. We will continue to report on our progress in coming years. Variety Development Tomatoes Since 1939, Campbell has worked to identify varieties of tomatoes that have increased yields (therefore reducing the resources needed to grow and transport the crop) and are resistant to pests and diseases (to prevent the need for pesticides and improve yields for growers). That variety development program continues today, with an annual evaluation of varieties with growers. Wheat Similarly, in Australia in 1985, Arnott’s began working with wheat breeders to develop soft wheat varieties suited to northern wheat-growing regions in Australia. Arnott’s is Australia’s largest user of soft wheat (required for biscuit making), while the majority of wheat grown in Australia is hard wheat (used for bread making). Importing soft wheat is expensive and less desirable from a resource perspective. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 85 05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET The small Australian soft wheat industry is primarily located in the southern part of the country, though wheat is also grown in a more northern region. For Arnott’s, adding production in the north would reduce supply risk due to crop failure and also create production closer to one of Arnott’s three baking facilities, reducing transportation distances and resource use. However, the northern production region has a different climate and pest/disease complex than the southern region, requiring the development of better-suited soft wheat varieties. In 2011, the breeding program released a new variety of soft wheat called Impala, which is not only resistant to many of the pests and diseases of the northern wheat region (requiring less pesticide use), but also yields higher than most soft wheat varieties. With this and other varieties in development, Arnott’s is working to create options for Australian wheat farmers and a regional supply chain for Australia’s iconic biscuits. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Campbell helped pioneer the use of IPM in the California processing tomato industry. Award-winning research and outreach to growers in the 1990s resulted in a significant reduction in the use of pesticides with high human or environmental toxicity. In addition, by California state law, all farmers must utilize licensed Pest Control Advisers trained in IPM to identify the need for pesticides prior to their application. Sustainable Agriculture Research In 2011, as part of developing Campbell Agriculture Sustainability Programs, the Campbell Research and Development and Campbell Agriculture teams partnered with researchers from University of California, Davis, on three sustainability projects in processing tomatoes. UC professors and graduate students placed experimental plots at the Campbell Seeds research facility just outside the town of Davis. Campbell’s research staff provided tomato plants, maintained plots and assisted the university researchers with data collection. Campbell Agriculture Operations staff recruited tomato farmers to implement on-farm trials in actual fields growing tomatoes for the Company. These 2011 project teams were tasked with researching: – New techniques for predicting insect and disease outbreaks in tomatoes to reduce pesticide applications; – A form of furrow irrigation that would utilize less water; and – Analysis of greenhouse gas production from fields using different irrigation and fertilizer rates. The results of this research will be analyzed in 2012 for potential best management practices and shared with growers and family farmers supplying Campbell. Water Reclamation and Wildlife Habitat The Campbell tomato processing plant in rural Dixon, California, utilizes agricultural land to treat used rinse water coming from the plant during tomato season. The water is applied to pasture land as irrigation, allowing it to be filtered by the pasture prior to returning to groundwater or evaporating. The pasture is then used for cattle and hay production. In 2011, Campbell made a commitment to enhance the property’s benefits to wildlife. This effort was kicked off by a duck egg salvage day with the California Waterfowl Association (CWA). Campbell and CWA staff searched for duck nests in danger of destruction from the spring hay harvest, which were then hatched out by the CWA and the birds released to safer habitats. In coming years the CWA will work with Campbell and its property managers to further enhance the property’s ability to support wildlife while still supporting the primary task of water reclamation. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 86 05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET Stakeholder Engagement for New Sustainable Agriculture Programs We are in the process of enhancing our Agriculture Sustainability Programs, building on decades of investment in agriculture research and partnerships with farmers. As the Company develops objectives and metrics for the program, we intend to develop metrics that are aligned with the strategic goals of our internal and external stakeholders. Recognizing this, in autumn 2011, a series of stakeholder interviews were conducted by Dr. Daniel Sonke, Campbell’s Manager of Agriculture Sustainability Programs. Approximately 50 interviews were conducted, including Campbell employees in North America and internationally. Interviews were also conducted with farmers and representatives of agriculture suppliers, retail and food service companies who purchase from Campbell and nongovernmental organizations that have an interest in the environmental and social aspects of farming. Interviewees were asked a host of questions regarding their perception of Campbell, sustainability, target audiences for the Agriculture Sustainability Programs, priority focus areas related to environmental and social impacts of farming, and supply chain areas in which to focus beyond tomatoes. The results of the stakeholder interviews will be compiled and utilized in future strategic planning scheduled to be completed in 2012. Supply Chain, Logistics and Transportation Managing the sourcing of our products from farm to fork, including procurement and distribution Campbell Logistics: Engaged Supply Chain, Efﬁcient Procurement and Distribution System Campbell’s global supply chain organization is responsible for all aspects of our production from farm to fork, including procurement, engineering, manufacturing, quality assurance and distribution. Our supply chain organization works across Campbell locations and manufacturing facilities around the world. These employees work in close collaboration with our suppliers, research and development teams, and trade partners to optimize the supply chain from beginning to end. We understand and appreciate the complexity and diversity of our supply chain, and to continually make progress our initiatives focus on safety, quality, ethical sourcing, total delivered cost (TDC) and environmental sustainability, as well as customer service. Supply Chain Initiatives: Educate, Engage, Impact Campbell continues to implement projects aimed at reducing the environmental impact associated with the delivery of ingredients to our facilities and the distribution of finished products to our customers. Our manufacturing facilities continue to produce over 90% of all Campbell-labeled products. In an effort to better understand the environmental impact associated with sourcing ingredients to our facilities, Campbell worked with graduate students at MIT to calculate the Scope 3 Carbon Emissions associated with five strategic commodities. In addition to assessing Campbell’s carbon footprint, the students were able to make recommendations on sourcing considerations that could lead to a reduction in emissions. One significant sustainability advantage Campbell proudly maintains is the close proximity our container manufacturing operations share with our food production plants. By operating container manufacturing operations both for cans and plastic bottles in plants that are directly attached to our major food manufacturing plants, we eliminate the need to expend energy shipping empty containers from remote locations. This creates tremendous improvement to what some refer as the “embedded environmental impacts” of products. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 87 05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET Fiscal 2011 Highlights To further reduce the energy required to deliver our ﬁnished product, we: – Converted more than 15 million pounds of carrot concentrate supply to a source with higher solids content. While it might sound mundane to the average consumer, this change reduced embedded carbon emissions by 200 tonnes and saved freight dollars on 2.4 million pounds of ingredients. A similar change in concentration of acai juice resulted in the elimination of 16 tonnes of CO2 as a result of reduced freight. – Delineated CSR and sustainability requirements for all levels of suppliers and communicated them as part of the Campbell Supplier Summit in June. – Initiated procurement of Fair Trade Certified cocoa liquor and segregated RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) Certified Sustainable Palm Oil for certain products in the international portfolio. – Reduced our carbon footprint by optimizing sourcing locations and light-weighting. Light-weighting projects alone eliminated approximately 2 million pounds of plastics and resulted in $1.4 million in savings. – Began using up to 20% post–consumer-recycled PET in our beverage bottles based upon availability. Suppliers Building a Robust Supplier Base As a consumer goods company, one of our primary objectives is to provide safe, quality products that exceed our customers’ and consumers’ expectations. We realize that our suppliers and other business partners play a critical role in helping us execute this mission and our commitment to sustainability in an ethical and responsible manner. For Campbell, it is of utmost importance that they share our objectives. CSR/Sustainability Supplier Requirements Because corporate social responsibility is an integral mission at Campbell, we also require our suppliers to follow rigorous CSR and sustainability standards. Campbell’s Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual identifies the expectations and requirements of all firms that are, and aspire to be, a Campbell supplier. The requirements detailed in the manual are designed to help our current and potential brokers, co-packers, re-packers, special packers, suppliers, warehouses and licensees to meet these objectives. We consider adherence and performance to these expectations as essential factors when entering into or extending existing business relationships. These requirements include: – Legal, Health & Safety, Environment Requirements – Employment Standards – Anti-Corruption Section – Animal Welfare Requirements – Compliance Requirements Employment Standards are of particular concern to Campbell, with prescriptive requirements for the following areas: – Minimum Employment Age – Voluntary Labor – Wages and Benefits – Working Hours and Rest – Discrimination – Freedom of Association – Fair Treatment Campbell understands the importance of CSR when it comes to sourcing our raw materials. For maximum impact we have embedded CSR criteria as part of our procurement sourcing processes (e.g., RFIs and RFPs). Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 88 05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET Implementation of Supplier Standards Campbell has established a variety of elements to assure effective implementation of its standards for suppliers. Audits have been conducted at over 80% of our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities in 55 countries over the past two years. We have completed more than 1,700 vendor audits against our audit standards that include CSR and sustainability requirements. In addition to our internal auditors, we have also initiated third-party audits to keep accountability and performance high. Campbell plants and contract manufacturers are now required to obtain Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI)–recognized Food Safety and Quality systems certifications by an independent third party. Campbell North America manufacturing plants were certified in 2009, while our international and core contract manufacturer plants were certified in 2010. In addition, Campbell also assures effective implementation of standards through our Supplier Sustainability Scorecarding efforts. At the end of 2011, Campbell outlined its supplier expectations and performance in accordance with California’s new Human Trafficking and Slavery in the Supply Chain law. Managing Noncompliance We hold our employees and leadership to the highest ethical and compliance standards. Our suppliers are no different. To that end, Campbell has implemented stringent policies and procedures for managing noncompliance among suppliers. We have processes, documentation tools and software systems established for reporting individual incoming ingredient and direct food contact packaging nonconformance, engaging the supplier in corrective action plans and timing, and documenting closure of the report. Ongoing nonconformance trends are monitored and, when warranted, further improvement planning is established to address supplier or material category performance issues. Based on possible regulatory actions, nonconformance risk or frequency of occurrence, suppliers are subjected to a Campbell Audit focusing on the specific issues that may result in corrective action requirements and/or disqualification as a supplier. Deep processes are also in place to link consumer product complaints to specific ingredients or packaging materials. This information is further used to take corrective action with specific suppliers and/or drive supplier development programs. As defined by policies, Campbell and/or third-party, food safety and quality audits are conducted to assess the compliance to system requirements and the effectiveness of these systems. Supply Chain Challenges As a food and beverage company, we are often challenged with campaigns by nongovernmental organizations and others concerned about the safety and quality of our products. We work closely with suppliers, industry and professional associations, academic institutions and other outside experts to identify new and emerging issues in chemical, food safety and packaging technologies to ensure that our ingredients and packaging materials conform to the most rigorous scientific and technical standards. Palm Oil Food companies may be challenged for their sourcing of sustainable palm oil by NGOs. Palm oil is used in products like cookies and crackers, and the concern is that the industry is harming fragile ecosystems by expanding industrialized palm oil plantations. As a food company, Campbell recognizes the connection between the long-term vitality of our business and the imperative to advance environmental sustainability. We take this commitment very seriously. Our palm oil suppliers are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) — composed of palm growers, palm oil users, retail food chains and nongovernmental organizations — an association created to promote the development and use of sustainable palm oil through cooperation within the supply chain and open dialogue with its stakeholders. Campbell’s global businesses are striving to convert to certified sustainable sources of palm oil by 2015. Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 89 05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET FOCUS FORWARD We plan to establish enhanced key performance indicators such as carbon intensity, energy, water and packaging for our preferred supplier program. Transportation We continue gradually to make progress in reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions through our complex transportation fleet and logistics systems. We understand that transportation of raw materials, ingredients and finished products from farm to factory to stores presents multiple opportunities to create efficiencies. A majority of our transportation is contractual, and therefore impacts our Scope 3, or embedded, carbon impact. Improving transportation efficiencies requires cross-sector collaboration, and we are working with our business partners to become “SmartWay” qualified with the goal of ensuring that the remainder of our partners is qualified by 2013. In 2011, we continued to focus on increasing intermodal transportation. Intermodal freight shipping has become the number-one segment of all rail shipments. Each train can take up to 500 trucks off the highways, and, on average, railways are more than three times more fuel efficient than trucks. Nearly one billion gallons of fuel per year could be saved if only 10% of the freight that currently moves by truck were moved by rail. In addition, shifting freight from trucks to rail helps reduce highway congestion. Our 2011 achievements include: – We removed more than 11,000 trucks from the road and reduced CO2 emissions by Campbell’s Intermodal Usage over 26,000 tonnes. – A joint collaboration team developed and deployed a tool across Campbell’s four 26,647 U.S. thermal sites that leverages our planning system and automatically designs 22,328 21,799 weight-optimized trucks for shipment, resulting in: 1. More than 400 trucks per year being taken off the road, yielding a reduction of 50,000 gallons of diesel consumption and a reduction of over one million 11,331 7,943 8,687 pounds of carbon emissions; 2. Freight savings of more than $1 million per year; and 3. Significantly reduced administrative effort in the management of interplant FY2009 FY2010 FY2011 deployment. Count of Loadnum Sum of CO2 Savings (in tonnes) Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 90 05 / NOURISHING OUR PLANET Inspections, Compliance and Investment Our Environmental Sustainability Policy clearly outlines the expectation that all our plants and facilities around the world be operated in accordance with environmental laws and our own high-performance expectations. Our Napoleon, Ohio, facility, for example, continues to work with the Conservation Action Project (CAP) in Northwest Ohio to reduce runoff from agricultural land and reduce nitrate-nitrogen in the Maumee River. We have made a total of $225,000 in donations over the past four years to CAP as part of our 10-year commitment to this project. While we strive for perfect compliance every day, we also plan to be transparent in the areas that need improvement. The following table outlines the regulatory enforcement activities that occurred during fiscal year 2011.

In this report, we strive to provide our stakeholders with a balanced view of our CSR and sustainability strategy and performance in our worldwide operations during fiscal year 2011 (ended July 31, 2011). This report includes a full update to key programs and performance metrics. Our previous report was published in April 2011. Significant policy or program advances and recognition occurring after FY2011 may also be included. We prepared this report using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, along with the GRI Food Processing Sector Supplement. We have self-declared this CSR Report to a GRI Application Level of “B” based on the GRI Application Level Grid. This Campbell CSR Report addresses our operations on a global basis. Unless otherwise stated, principles and policies referenced in the report apply to all Company-owned locations worldwide, and to all employees of Campbell Soup Company. The metrics and goals in this report are established and measured by the Campbell business units and corporate functions that are responsible for achieving them. This is done in consultation with internal and, in some cases, external stakeholders, as well as by reference to external benchmarks and leadership practices. Our goal is to deliver a useful and accurate picture of our performance. Data collection in a multinational manufacturing company is complex, and there are meaningful challenges to compiling consistent performance metrics across numerous plant and facility sites in multiple countries. While this report includes globally consistent metrics in most areas, we continue to work on improving the standardization of our measurement systems and building baselines in other areas, such as agriculture. Performance metrics cover Campbell owned and operated facilities. Environmental metrics are reported using widely accepted parameters and units. We use the Carbon Disclosure Project Greenhouse Gas Protocol to calculate our GHG emissions. Nutrition metrics are fully described with footnotes and references. Financial data is presented in U.S. dollars. Campbell management uses a system of internal controls, including a process of verification by internal subject-matter experts, to ensure that this report fairly represents our CSR and environmental sustainability activities and results. The full version of this report can be downloaded from the Reports & Data section of this website. A printed highlights brochure is also available by request. Additional information about Campbell operations and financial performance is available in our 2011 Annual Report and Form 10-K, which are both available on our corporate website.

Campbell Soup Company committed to the principles of the UN Global Compact in 2009.

We highlight areas of strengths and challenges, and in the process provide suggestions for ways that Campbell Soup can enhance its future reporting. It should be noted that our review neither verifies nor expresses an opinion on the accuracy or timeliness of information provided in this report. Strengths and Achievements Clear presentation of efforts to enhance the nutrition and health proﬁle of its product portfolio Health and nutrition are critical issues for any food company, and the 2012 report increases the depth of coverage on how Campbell is adjusting its products to make them healthier and the impact that is having on its financial results. In addition, it explains how its products assist in the fulfillment of nutritional requirements for vegetables and fruits and whole grains, and impact heart health and weight control. And finally, the report provides detail on the development of new products and the modification of existing ones in order to make them healthier, and data on the revenue increases for such products over time. We hope that future reports build on this foundation by showing the company’s progress in enhancing the nutritional profile of Campbell’s products and the establishment of measurable timebound targets against which to assess performance. It would also be useful if a clear narrative were provided around the overall objectives of Campbell’s nutrition program and how individual product modifications fit into this framework. Commitment to establishing performance metrics for its key community initiatives Campbell has adopted two impressive goals related to its community initiatives: reduce childhood obesity and hunger by 50% by 2020 and make a positive impact on 100 million youth through its community outreach efforts. This year’s report notes that it will establish outcome measures related to food security and obesity by the end of 2012. We believe that this is a critical step in the evolution of Campbell’s community programs, and we expect that next year’s report will provide greater detail about these performance metrics and how they are being implemented. More extensive coverage of environmental initiatives and performance This year’s report provides more in-depth discussion of a number of critical environmental issues, including green building, renewable energy, water resource mapping and sustainable agriculture. Noteworthy is the focus on water resources, and particularly the analysis of water usage and the calculation of that usage on water scarcity in the areas surrounding many of Campbell’s facilities. Measuring and reporting water scarcity is a leadership practice in the food and beverage industry, and we hope that the analysis will be expanded in future reports to give a full picture of the impact on water resources of Campbell’s facilities and its agricultural operations, which form the foundation of Campbell’s business. Greater detail on public policy activities Although covered to a degree in previous CSR reports, this year’s edition provides more detail on the kinds of issues that Campbell engages on in the public policy arena and the positions it supports. Many stakeholders are interested in the role that companies play in influencing public policy, and the transparency shown by Campbell should allow for a greater understanding of its activities in this area. Challenges and Opportunities Balance discussion of successes and challenges As in our review of last year’s report, we recommend that Campbell provide a fuller account of the challenges that it faces across product formulation (health & wellness), environmental, social and community issues. One key characteristic of highly regarded CSR reports is the open recognition of challenges across the spectrum of CSR issues, and we believe that Campbell’s report needs to acknowledge such challenges and provide a thorough discussion of them. For example, the decision in 2011 to increase the amount of sodium in its soup products is clearly a challenge to the general trend evidenced in this report of Campbell taking steps to enhance the health profile of its product portfolio; stakeholders would benefit from a discussion of this decision and any implications it might have for future product adjustments. Calling out challenges also serves as an opportunity Campbell Soup Company 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report 104 06 / RESOURCES to create a call to action that seeks the participation of others to address issues that are multidimensional in nature, such as the goal of receiving 40% of electricity from renewable or GHG-free sources by 2020. Provide more thorough explanation of data The Performance Scorecard is a useful way of presenting Campbell’s social and environmental data, but there are no targets against which success is being measured. In addition, the report is lacking analysis that provides perspective and context to the data. For example, both energy use and water consumption declined from 2008 to 2011, but there is no way for the reader to know why this happened and what, if any, links this has to Campbell’s CSR activities. We recommend that such analysis occur in the specific sections where the issues are discussed in more detail. Clearly identify the most material issues The report provides a thorough description of the materiality process that Campbell conducts each year to ensure that it is focused on the right social and environmental issues. But while it identifies these issues, it fails to clearly define what they mean to Campbell and how they were derived. For example, advertising and labeling are classified as among the most material issues facing Campbell, and yet they are barely discussed in the report. Greater clarity in the materiality process is important because it underlies the content of the report as well as the company’s overall CSR strategy. Stakeholders would benefit from knowing more about how the material issues were chosen, including what trade-offs, if any, were made in the process of evaluating the various business and stakeholder criteria used in their prioritization. Share how stakeholder input is being incorporated We applaud Campbell for looking externally for input on its activities and stated focus for active engagement; however, it isn’t clear from the report how this input is influencing or being incorporated into its decisions or activities. As noted in our letter last year, it would be useful to have a discussion of the stakeholder’s perspectives and how these are being used to assess market positioning, product developments and enterprise risk. Summary Campbell’s 2012 report builds on previous editions by expanding the coverage of a number of critical issues and establishing important commitments relating to its supply chain and community initiatives. To realize its full potential as an engagement and communication tool for both internal and external stakeholders, however, the report’s content needs to be sharply focused on those social and environmental challenges that are most material to Campbell, and greater context and clarity provided regarding Campbell’s objectives and vision — against which annual progress can be evaluated. This will, in turn, lead to a shorter and more impactful report that will serve Campbell well in an age of increasing stakeholder expectations and hyper-transparency.
