Principle 9): Encourage the development and diffusion of environment friendly technologies BHEL’s products, including clean technologies are regularly monitored against those of other leading similar equipment manufacturers and relevant international standards. Gaps, if any, are identified and developmental projects are undertaken to bridge them. BHEL has been actively developing and acquiring clean technologies for power generation over past three decades. BHEL had initiated a coal research programme in the late seventies to develop technologies to efficiently utilize Indian Coal while minimizing the associated environmental impacts. These technologies enable BHEL’s customers to minimize the impact of power generation on the environment. Some of them are mentioned below:  Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) – BHEL is one of the few companies worldwide, involved in the development of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) technology which would usher in clean coal technology. An IGCC power plant combines the benefits of two highly efficient and environmentally clean processes: coal gasification and gas turbine based combined cycle. The integration of these technologies yields high efficiency of the combined cycle design with low cost coal as fuel. Gasification also inherently reduces emission of SOx. Further as the coal gas is cleaned before being fired in the gas turbine, particulate pollutants in the exhaust gases are negligible.  Supercritical Thermal power Plant – A Supercritical thermal power plant has higher efficiency compared to the conventional sub-critical cycle, thus offering the advantage of burning lesser fuel for the same output and with low emissions. BHEL is executing orders for 660, 700 and 800 MW supercritical steam generators and turbo generators.  Advanced Ultra Supercritical (Adv-USC) Thermal Power Plant Technology Under the aegis of the National Mission on Clean Coal Technology, BHEL, in association with Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research (IGCAR), NTPC and other organizations is developing Advanced Ultra Supercritical plants. Once operational, such plants will operate at efficiency exceeding 45% under Indian ambient conditions.  Advanced Class Gas Turbines BHEL is the only Indian company capable of manufacturing large size gas based power plant equipment, comprising of advanced-class gas turbines up to 289 MW (ISO) rating for open and combinedPage 5 of 8 cycle operations. The efficiency of an Advanced Class GT in the combined cycle mode is in the range of 56 57% under Indian conditions. Natural gas as fuel used in the gas turbine based combined cycle plants is the cleanest among the fossil fuels and produces the minimum pollution and carbon dioxide emission.  Sub-critical Thermal Power Plants with Enhanced Efficiency BHEL has been continually making efforts to improve the efficiency of thermal power plants. A new variant of 500 MW steam turbine has been introduced by BHEL wherein thermal performance of the cycle is about 0.6% better than that of the conventional cycle. A new cost effective and thermodynamically efficient plant with a unit rating of 600 MW has also been developed. Hydro Power Plants BHEL is a leading manufacturer and supplier of hydro power plant equipment, including hydro turbines and hydro-generators. These are comparable to the best in the world in terms of operating efficiencies. The product portfolio of BHEL includes custom built hydro turbines of Kaplan, Francis and Pelton types with matching generators, pump turbines with matching motor-generators up to 300 MW.  Reduction of NOx and SOx Emissions Emissions of oxides from thermal power plants of Nitrogen and Sulphur are collectively called NOx and SOx, and are a health hazard. BHEL has developed in-house several technologies for reduction of emissions from thermal power plants. Low NOx oil fired burners have also been developed. In addition, BHEL has developed a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system which can remove NOx from the flue gas. BHEL has also developed a dynamic classifier system which improves classification efficiency of the pulveriser and provides better particle size control enabling availability of uniform coal size to the burners leading to improvements of combustion efficiency of boiler and reduction in NOx emission from the boiler. The new dynamic classifier system has been commissioned at Dr. Narla Tata Rao Thermal Power Plant, Vijayawada. Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) systems remove Sulphur Dioxide from the flue gas. BHEL has supplied an FGD system for 250 MW Trombay thermal power plants in association with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan. Circulating Fluidised Bed Combustion (CFBC) power plants, which are suitable for high Sulphur content lignite, are also part of BHEL's product range.  Electrostatic Precipitators (ESPs) BHEL is the leading manufacturer and supplier of ESPs in the country used for removing fly ash from the flue gas (efficiencies up to 99.97%) for utility and industrial applications including Bio mass fired boilers, cement plants, steel plants, soda recovery boilers etc.  Solar Photovoltaics (SPV) BHEL is one of the leading manufacturer and supplier of silicon solar cells in India. For this, the Company has manufacturing facilities for solar photovoltaic cells modules at its Bangalore Unit with a capacity of 8 MW per annum and capacity augmentation up to 26 MW is under progress. There is also an R&D facility, Amorphous Silicon Solar Cell Plant Page 6 of 8 (ASSCP), located at Gurgaon. BHEL's solar modules have been contributing to the national effort for development of far-flung / remote areas. BHEL has supplied and commissioned large size stand-alone as well as grid interactive Solar Power Plants in a number of major cities and remote areas of the country. With an aim to perform a significant role in National Solar Mission’s proposed target of 20,000 MW of grid connected solar power, BHEL signed an agreement with Abengoa, Spain, a leader in solar projects to provide EPC solutions in Concentrated Solar Thermal Power (CSP) areas. BHEL is working with Bharat Electronics Limited to set-up a manufacturing plant of approx. 240 MW solar PV Products and systems.  Fuel Cells Hydrogen energy promises to the cleanest form of energy in future. BHEL has been carrying out R&D on fuel cells for over two decades. ANTI-CORRUPTION Principle 10): Businesses should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery BHEL is committed to enhancing transparency in all its business dealings for which it has a Vigilance set-up in place to prevent any irregularities. Main objective of the company is to curb corruption by focusing more on the preventive and educative aspects, rather than investigative /punitive. Training programmes, seminars/conferences and interaction of Chief Vigilance Officer with the employees is a regular feature in the Company. With a view to bring in transparency, Government of India has enacted Right to Information Act giving right to all citizens of India to seek information besides other rights. BHEL has taken a lead role in implementing all provisions of the act in letter and spirit. The organization has signed 'Integrity Pact' with Transparency International. The intention is to make public procurement and contracting more transparent by binding both the parties to ethical conduct. This would enable a monitoring role for civil society the ultimate beneficiary. In order to prevent corruption, a host of 'transparency measures' have been initiated Company wide, by leveraging technology. Some of them are: • Status of Purchase Orders, Works Contracts concluded every month, as per CVC format, is being uploaded by all Units. • Procedure and forms related to Vendor registration are hosted on the Company web site. Page 7 of 8 • Status of vendor registration applications is hosted on the web and can be viewed by vendors. • E-payment of vendor bills is being implemented throughout the organization and principle of first in first out is being followed as a rule in payment of vendor bills. • Status of bill payment can be viewed by the vendors on-line. • Indents are being raised on-line in most of the Units. • The performance reports of all executives are handled on-line through ‘MAP’ (Moving Ahead through Performance). • Information relating to Rules/Procedures governing the issue of license, permissions, clearances etc., is available on the BHEL/Units websites. As part of BHEL’s endeavor to set a high standard of conduct for its employees, a ‘Code of Business Conduct and Ethics’ has been laid down for all Board Members and Senior Management personnel.
