United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2011 We strive for supplying outstanding sustainable building material solutions for a better quality of life. As a signatory of the UN Global Compact, Wienerberger is committed to incorporating the “ten principles” in the areas of human rights, labour rights, the environment and the fight against bribery and corruption into its business policies. This commitment is also expressed by the Wienerberger Mission Statement: “Wienerberger regards the economy as an integral part of society which is designed to serve people and generate benefits for all. Our goal is to create sustainable values with natural products: a residential environment of highest quality and safety for our customers, a sound investment for our shareholders and attractive jobs for our employees. We take our role as a responsible member of society seriously and act in accordance with economic, ecological and social principles – in order to remain successful in the future.” In 2011, we have taken several important steps to achieve this goal ranging from the improvement of energy efficiency in production and energy-efficient product design to occupational safety. We have restructured and strengthened our sustainability management and have put an even much stronger focus on continuous improvement in the four core areas which we have identified for our sustainability performance: environmental protection in production, sustainable products, employees and corporate social responsibility. With the instrument of our Environmental Action Plan we have already succeeded to significantly reduce the specific energy consumption and the specific CO2 output in our production in 2011. Additionally we are investigating intensively the possibilities to replace fossil fuels by renewable energy and also the technical feasibility of the use of secondary raw materials and recycling. First successes regarding these issues were already achieved in 2011. Our vision for buildings of the future: healthy, energy-efficient, attractive and affordable. In order to make this vision reality, we are developing from a supplier of building materials into a partner with concepts for sustainable construction. We supply complete solutions that are easy to realize and individually adaptable – naturally with the right products and feel-good atmosphere for the entire family. One of the most important trends in new residential construction is the increasing focus on sustainability and energy efficiency. In order to realize our vision for healthy, energyefficient and sustainable buildings that are attractive and affordable, we joined together with partners from heating technology, thermal insulation and other fields to develop a building model – the e4 BRICKHOUSE concept. This concept meets all applicable requirements, including the strict near-zero energy standards defined by the European Union that will take effect in 2020. Our e4 BRICKHOUSE concept offers families an energy-efficient, healthy house that is also affordable. It reflects the growing wish of many private builders to make a statement in support of climate protection with their own building plans. We want to give people a home where they can feel well throughout their entire lifetime. In the important area of our employees we succeeded to very significantly reduce the frequency of occupational accidents in all countries by a large number of individual projects and we are continuing our efforts also this year and in the future. We have also restructured the whole area of our Corporate Social Responsibility activities and have developed a Wienerberger donation guideline. We will focus our respective projects in the future on those countries where we are on the market and besides providing shelter for families in trouble we will also invest in supporting young highly talented but disadvantaged people in their education. All these changes and developments need time. We have therefore decided to publish our sustainability report for the year 2011 later (most probably in July) than in the past years and we also publish an update of figures only and not a full report this year. As soon as this update is available we will of course publish it and provide it to UN Global Compact. A full sustainability report based on the new principles and targets will then be published in 2013 for the year 2012. The strength of Wienerberger is based on a strong and dynamic corporate culture with a high degree of efficiency in which goal orientation, entrepreneurial achievement and responsibility are a matter of course. Our operating companies owe their success to their highly motivated employees and managers whose drive to achieve is supported by the group’s corporate services. This dedication is also honoured by our customers and business partners. Heimo Scheuch, CEO United Nations Global Compact Wienerberger joined the UN Global Compact in 2003. This initiative was introduced by the United Nations in 1999 to promote good corporate citizenship and now encompasses ten guiding principles from the areas of human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and measures to combat corruption. Companies that join the program agree to voluntarily comply with the principles that are published on the UN Global Compact website. The following table provides an overview of some of the actions taken by Wienerberger during 2010 and 2011 to implement the ten Global Compact (“GC”) Principles. Reference is still made to the Wienerberger Sustainability Report 2010 which contains a detailed description of Wienerberger’s activities and policies to implement the GC principles, because the Sustainability Report 2011 will only be available in summer 2012. The table also refers to the corresponding Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators which provide a framework for measuring progress on the GC principles.

Occupational safety was a special LA 13 65-66 focus of our efforts during 2010. The Safety Initiative 2010 LA 14 66 included the roll-out of a group-wide safety standard to all SO 5 82-83 our plants, which substantially reduced the frequency and PR 1 56-57 severity of work accidents (p. 62, 63, 67-70).

Wienerberger plants. First successes, which include a EN 22 45-46 reduction of roughly 10% in specific energy requirements at EN 26 48-56, 59 one location, have already been realized (p 36, 42). Energy EN 28 82 efficiency is also a focal point of product R&D. Wienerberger SO 5 82-83 aims to develop house concepts that are energy-efficient and PR 3 51-53 economical at the same time and promotes a holistic view of buildings – from the building shell to the technical equipment and energy carriers used. In 2010, the product line of high thermal insulating filled bricks was extended to include a clay block filled with mineral wool (p. 48-50, 53-56).
