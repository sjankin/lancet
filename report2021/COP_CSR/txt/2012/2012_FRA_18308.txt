How do you view the company’s performance in 2011? _Roland Keppler: Overall, my view is that we managed to maintain the stability of the business despite increasingly volatile market conditions and widespread uncertainty.

By literally reducing the distance between Europcar and its customers, the service helps renters save time and money. Customers beneﬁt not only if they are not EUROPCAR CUSTOMERS ARE NOT ONLY DRIVING located near a rental station but also OUR VEHICLES; THEY ARE DRIVING THE COMPANY. by eliminating the time and expense of unnecessary travel through often-congested urban areas. Sustainable market leadership depends on an organization’s ability to anticipate changes in customer needs and desires and to respond to emerging customer trends. That’s why Europcar brought to market an innovative suite of new services and features over the course of 2011 and why the company continues to explore new ways to better serve customers worldwide. Europcar’s eReady service, launched in all nine Europcar corporate countries in 2011, simpliﬁes and streamlines the rental process.

The electric vehicle pilot programs now underway across Europe represent a particular ﬂeet management challenge. To optimize chances for success, Europcar ﬂeet specialists have targeted areas where the necessary infrastructure is in place to ensure suitable recharging of e-v batteries. For example, the pilot e-v project in Germany is located in and around Düsseldorf, which beneﬁts from a large number of recharging stations. Likewise in France, the pilot program targets customers travelling between Orly Airport and central Paris, to ensure convenient recharging. As they reﬁne their understanding of e-v usage, Europcar ﬂeet experts work in close cooperation with automaker partners Citroën, Nissan, Opel, Peugeot, Renault and Tesla. STREAMLINED FLEET MANAGEMENT EUROPCAR PROVIDES CUSTOMERS WITH THE NEWEST, MOST FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLES AVAILABLE IN 2011 WHILE LOWERING FLEET COSTS THANKS TO STREAMLINED, ADAPTED FLEET MANAGEMENT. Despite volatile customer demand and uncertain market conditions, Europcar continued to enhance the adaptability and efﬁciency of its ﬂeet of vehicles over the course of 2011. At the same time, the ﬂeet utilization rate was increased from 73.6% to 74%, in large part thanks to streamlined in-ﬂeeting (the addition of new vehicles) and de-ﬂeeting (the removal of unwanted vehicles). The increase in the company’s total cost of ownership of its ﬂeet was limited to 1.8% in 2011, i.e. below the rate of inﬂation, a further demonstration of efﬁcient ﬂeet management. While ﬂeet size remained stable, the company once again managed to provide customers with the newest vehicles, compared 12 EUROPCAR MOVING YOUR WAY 2011-2012 to all major competitors. The average age of the vehicles comprising the Europcar rental ﬂeet was 5.7months for cars and 10.7 months for vans and trucks in 2011.

It often seems as if car rental companies are more interested in their cars than in their customers.

MOVING YOUR WAY 2011-2012 EUROPCAR 15 Sponsorship TOUR DE FRANCE YIELDS FIRST CONCRETE RESULTS The 2011 edition of France’s Tour de France cycling race in July not only provided extraordinary exposure for the Europcar brand. It also brought asharp increase in bookings. The 26.75hours of TV exposure were the equivalent of more than 3,20030-second TV ads, a media blitz valued at over €13million. The result was a sharp increase in brand awareness. In France, for example, spontaneous brand awareness jumped eight points, to 39%. Among potential customers, the increase was even greater –from 45% to 57%. Two to three point increases in spontaneous brand awareness were also achieved in Spain and Belgium. The sponsorship sparked a 13.3% year-on-year increase in bookings on Europcar websites. In addition, numerous hospitality events involving key corporate customers, partners and franchisees TEAM were held during the entire month-long competition. The Team Europcar website was visited by more than 87,000individuals in France alone during EUROPCAR WINS THE the race, while the team’s Facebook page attracted more than 50,000total fans. SPOTLIGHT THE INITIAL YEAR OF EUROPCAR’S ONGOING SPONSORSHIP PROGRAM ACHIEVED EXCEPTIONAL RESULTS, IN TERMS OF BOTH SPORTS PERFORMANCE AND BRAND AWARENESS. The professional cyclists who comprise Team Europcar took part in some 300 days of competition during 2011, highlighted by the team’s stunning performance during cycling’s most important event, the month-long Tour de France. Sporting Europcar’s colors and logo, team members provided people everywhere with living proof of the values they share with their sponsor: agility, trust, commitment, diversity and safety. Launched at the start of 2011, the three-year sponsorship aims to heighten the visibility and awareness of the Europcar brand and to achieve a set of concrete corporate image and business objectives. Basic brand visibility and awareness was strengthened through the team name and Europcar logo, prominently displayed on team jerseys, 16 EUROPCAR MOVING YOUR WAY 2011-2012 websites and vehicles.

MOVING YOUR WAY 2011-2012 EUROPCAR 19 New mobility paradigm RENT VS OWN While car rental was viewed as the best alternative to ownership for individual transportation by half of those surveyed, only about 40% described rental as a practical service. More than 60% said they would be more likely to rent a car if they could beneﬁt from services such as booking and locating the nearest car by mobile phone and payment by the hour or by the minute. More than one-third (35%) viewed car rental as more economical than ownership, while 37% thought rental was better for the environment. MOBILITY ON DEMAND JUST AS CONSUMERS EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY MUSIC OR VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT THROUGH ANINSTANTANEOUS DOWNLOAD WHEREVER, WHENEVER THEY WANT, DRIVERS ARE STARTING TO EXPECT TOBENEFIT FROM ACCESS TO A CAR ON DEMAND. In contrast to traditional purchase and ownership models, Europeans are increasingly expecting innovation solutions that will afford them the freedom to access just about anything wherever, whenever they want. In mobility, as in so many other areas of daily life, we are evolving from an asset-based to a service-based approach, where our ability to beneﬁt freely from various mobility options overshadows our long-standing ownership inclinations. As the European car rental leader, Europcar closely tracks evolving business and consumer attitudes towards mobility, intent on providing the innovative services that best respond to changing needs. Cost, congestion, pollution, parking. These are just some of the reasons why European drivers are eager to explore new mobility options. In fact, a major survey of adult drivers in seven countries shows drivers increasingly open to alternatives to traditional car ownership. The results of Europcar’s Fourth Annual Transportation & Mobility Observatory report make it clear that for urban drivers especially, their love affair with their cars is turning sour. 20 EUROPCAR MOVING YOUR WAY 2011-2012 The survey results, with data from more than 6,000 participants in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK, show growing disaffection over car ownership among European drivers. In fact, 43% of European drivers have considered or could consider giving up their cars, compared to 36% in 2008. Disaffection with car ownership is even stronger in cities. In urban areas with populations of more than 200,000, 47% of drivers have considered or could consider giving up at least one of their household cars in the next twelve months. This trend is particularly strong among drivers under the age of 35 and in higher socioeconomic categories. It’s not that people will abandon the automobile as a form of transportation; it’s 43% OF EUROPEAN that they are beginning to think of it as a service, a way to get from one place to another, DRIVERS HAVE observes Bruno Marzloff, the French sociologist who heads Chronos, a European think CONSIDERED OR tank on mobility.

And as the dominance of the personal automobile decreases, the need to own a car declines, in favor of alternative services such as car rental, car pooling and car sharing. The latest survey results show several reasons behind the disaffection with car ownership, including cost and concern over the environment. More than one-third (36%) of participants were in complete agreement that car ownership is expensive. More than nine out of ten said they had changed their driving habits, such as driving more slowly and using the car less often, to save money. Eight in ten cited environmental reasons for changing driving habits. MOVING YOUR WAY 2011-2012 EUROPCAR 21 Customer satisfaction EVERYONE IS INVOLVED The Promoter Score program involves surveying all customers after each rental and questioning each customer who is not completely satisﬁed. When e-surveying is not possible for some reason, customers are surveyed by phone. The customer contact portion of the program is carried out directly by Europcar people, at all levels of the organization. Direct involvement by Europcar management and staff is designed to show customers that LISTENING TO Europcar people are genuinely, personally concerned about each rental experience. By involving all employees, the program also helps ensure that everyone in the Europcar organization –from senior CUSTOMERS executives to entry level personnel– understands and responds to customer expectations.

The overall environmental performance of the Europcar ﬂeet, already the best in Europe, improved substantially in 2011. At yearend, 24.5% of the ﬂeet qualiﬁed for an eco-label, compared to 17% a year earlier. The leadership environmental performance of the Europcar ﬂeet was reﬂected in unprecedented carbon emission data. At the end of 2011, average carbon dioxide emissions for the entire Europcar ﬂeet dropped to a record 133.5g/km traveled, compared to 136g/km a year earlier. Among the factors contributing to the record results were outstanding vehicle maintenance programs and low vehicle age. The average age for a car in Europcar’s rental ﬂeet was 5.7months, which means that Europcar offers its customers the newest vehicles of any major competitor in Europe. MOVING In addition to conventional vehicles, Europcar leads the market in introducing cars with alternative BEYOND GREEN energy sources, including hybrids and electric vehicles. In 2011 and early 2012, for example, the allelectric Peugeot iOn was introduced in pilot rental programs at selected sites in Belgium, France and Portugal. Fleets of all-electric Smart Fortwo vehicles were introduced in Amsterdam and San Diego in 2011 as part of the expansion of the car2go partnership between Europcar and Daimler AG. EUROPCAR IS EXPANDING ITS COMMITMENT TO ACT AS A RESPONSIBLE CORPORATE CITIZEN. For the third consecutive year, Europcar was named the “World’s Leading Green Transport Solution Company” at the 2011 version of the prestigious World Travel Awards ceremony. Long established as Europe’s leading car rental company in environmental performance, Europcar has launched an ambitious program that expands beyond environmental data to cover a wide range of corporate social responsibility issues. Begun at the start of 2012, the company’s corporate social responsibility reporting and enhancement initiative aims to establish a solid monitoring and enhancement system that will track social and corporate governance indicators as well as environmental performance. The program involves establishing a standardized set of CSR key performance indicators (KPIs) for Europcar’s seven European corporate (i.e. non-franchisee) countries. The implementation of a 28 EUROPCAR MOVING YOUR WAY 2011-2012 standard set of indicators covering every rental station and administrative site will establish a clear reference point, enabling Europcar to provide meaningful, company-wide CSR performance data. Perhaps more importantly, it will also enable the company to track progress over time and take action to enhance lagging results. EXCELLENCE The indicators cover a wide range of CSR issues. In the environmental area, KPIs include such data as consumption of water and variREWARDED Europcar was recognized as 2011 ous sources of energy, fuel consumption, energy efﬁciency, waste manWorld’s Leading Car Rental Company” and agement and disposal, greenhouse gas emissions and training.
