In this challenging environment, the Ascom Group posted solid results. Revenue from continuing operations amounted to CHF 437.5 million (2010: CHF 472.9 million), corresponding to a growth of 1.1% in local currencies. At 13.7%, the EBITDA margin from continuing operations was within the defined guidance range of 13 –14% for the fiscal year 2011. Wireless Solutions achieved excellent results. The division continued to perform positively, generating revenue growth of 6.8% in local currencies and improving the EBITDA margin by around 2 percentage points to 15.0% despite negative currency effects, what allowed continuing the positive business development. With the successful acquisition of the Finnish healthcare company Miratel in July 2011, the division further boosted its leading market position in the healthcare sector. In line with the market trend for mobile communication networks, Network Testing experienced weaker than expected demand. In particular, in the fourth quarter the demand declined unexpectedly due to cost-saving programs of mobile network operators for investments and operational expenses. The traditionally strong last two months of the year turned out to be much weaker. In local currencies, revenue was 6.9% lower year-on-year, adjusted for divestments. Lower revenue, coupled with negative currency effects, resulted in a significant decline in profitability with an EBITDA margin of 2.4%. Beside a comprehensive strategic and operative appraisal, the Board of Directors and the Executive Board initiated immediately the necessary measures to align the business in 2012 to the new economic facts to achieve a substantial improvement in profitability before restructuring costs and to enable the division to grow. As announced at the 2011 Half-Year Media Conference, the Ascom Group plans to focus consistently on the two globally oriented divisions Wireless Solutions and Network Testing. The core business units of the third and smallest division, Security Communication, are to be transferred to new owners. The Czech Ascom business unit was sold already in 2011, and the purchase agreement for the transfer of the largest business unit Defense to Ruag was signed in the first quarter of 2012. ASCom Annual Report 2011 Letter to Shareholders 3 For the 2011 financial year, Ascom posted Group profit (net profit including loss from discontinued operations) of CHF 23.1 million (2010: CHF 32.5 million). With an increased equity ratio of 40.2% (2010: 32.6%) and cash and cash equivalents amounting to CHF 73.3 million at 31 December 2011, Ascom is a sound technology Group. The Board of Directors will therefore propose to the 2012 Annual General Meeting a dividend (in form of a tax free distribution out of the capital contribution reserves) of CHF 0.25 per share, corresponding to a payout ratio of 39.0%. Fritz Mumenthaler was appointed CEO of the Ascom Group as of 1 April 2011. He handed over management of the Wireless Solutions Division to his successor, Claes Ödman, on 14 June 2011. The management team will continue to pursue the adopted corporate strategy with drive and determination and focus consistently on Mission-Critical Communication in its business-to-business activities. Ascom has set itself the goal of achieving a Group EBITDA margin of 14 – 15% in 2013. The management strives to improve within short time the profitability of the Network Testing Division substantially to achieve this target already communicated in 2011. Revenue – slight organic growth In fiscal 2011, revenue from continuing operations amounted to CHF 437.5 million (2010: CHF 472.9 million). The depreciation of important currencies (mainly US dollar and Euro) compared to the previous year resulted in sizeable negative foreign exchange effects when translating revenue into Swiss francs. In local currencies, Ascom recorded revenue growth from continuing operations of 1.1%. At the end of 2011, incoming orders in continuing operations amounted to CHF 451.4 million (2010: CHF 488.4 million), corresponding to a slight year-on-year increase in local currencies. Wireless Solutions performed very well in 2011, posting revenue of CHF 276.6 million (2010: CHF 282.9 million) and generating growth of 6.8% in local currencies. Organic growth amounted to 5.1%, with the Finnish healthcare company Miratel, acquired in July 2011, contributing an additional 1.7% to revenue. Revenue increased further across all sales channels and in most regions, with the USA and Germany reporting significant growth. In line with the market trend for mobile communication networks, Network Testing experienced weaker than expected demand as customers postponed or reduced planned investments, particularly in the fourth quarter. At CHF 138.9 million (2010: CHF 168.5 million), revenue generated by the division in 2011 was 6.9% lower year-on-year in local currencies, adjusted for divestments. Profitability – EBITDA margin of 13.7% Profitability remained largely stable and within the defined full-year guidance range for the fiscal year 2011. EBITDA from continuing operations (without core business units of the former division Security Communication) ended the year at CHF 59.8 million (2010: CHF 70.9 million) with an EBITDA margin of 13.7% (2010: 15.0%) despite negative currency effects and investments in new products and sales channels. At EBIT level, the continuing operations recorded a result of CHF 40.6 million (2010: CHF 51.4 million) with an EBIT margin of 9.3% (2010: 10.9%). Investments in research and development amounted to 10.5% of revenue (2010: 10.2%). 4 ASCom Annual Report 2011 Letter to Shareholders Ascom key figures* CHFm 2011 2010 Incoming orders 451.4 488.4 Revenue 437.5 472.9 EBITDA 59.8 70.9 Group profit (incl. loss from discontinued operations) 23.1 32.5 Number of employees (FTE) as of 31.12. 1,801 1,789 * continuing operations Wireless Solutions posted outstanding results, further increasing profitability despite negative currency effects. With EBITDA of CHF 41.5 million (2010: CHF 37.2 million), the division increased the EBITDA margin by around 2 percentage points to 15.0%. Lower revenue coupled with negative currency effects resulted in a significant decline in profitability at Network Testing. EBITDA ended the year at CHF 3.4 million (2010: CHF 27.7 million), with an EBITDA margin of 2.4% (2010: 16.4%). Continuing operations also include the Real Estate segment, which contributed a positive EBITDA of CHF 11.8 million (2010: CHF 6.5 million). This result comprises the book gain from the sale of the Facility Management Services unit to the German RGM Group as of 31 December 2011. Discontinued operations – divestments according to plan At the Half-Year Media Conference held on 18 August 2011, Ascom announced that new owners would be sought for the core business units of the third and smallest division, Security Communication, since the Group was aiming to focus consistently on the two globally oriented divisions Wireless Solutions and Network Testing. These business activities have qualified as “discontinued operations” since the intention to divest these activities was announced. Discontinued operations performed in line with expectations in the year under review, recording revenue of CHF 75.5 million (2010: CHF 100.1 million) and a loss at EBITDA level of CHF 5.7 million. The Security Communication Division was dissolved on 31 December 2011 and Dr Fritz Gantert, General Manager of Security Communication, stepped down from the Executive Board as of this date. As of 10 October 2011, the subsidiary Ascom (CZ) s.r.o. was divested in a management buy-out, and the purchase agreement for the transfer of the largest business unit Defense to Ruag Switzerland Ltd., was signed in the first quarter of 2012. The remaining divestments are expected to be completed swiftly. The interests of customers and employees alike were optimally served by all these transactions. Group profit and dividend proposal Group profit (net profit including discontinued operations) increased in the second half of 2011 to end the year at CHF 23.1 million (H1/2011: CHF 9.0 million; full-year 2010: CHF 32.5 million). Discontinued operations contributed a loss of CHF 7.5 million. The Board of Directors will propose to the 2012 Annual General Meeting the payment of a dividend (in form of a tax free distribution out of the capital contribution reserves) of CHF 0.25 per share, corresponding to a payout ratio of 39.0%. ASCom Annual Report 2011 Letter to Shareholders 5 Equity ratio increased to 40.2% With cash and cash equivalents of CHF 73.3 million (2010: CHF 129.0 million) and a significantly increased equity ratio of 40.2% (2010: 32.6%) at 31 December 2011, Ascom has a sound balance sheet structure. Challenges and outlook for 2012 The economic climate will remain challenging in 2012. Nevertheless, we aim to achieve profitable growth and sustainably increase Ascom’s corporate value. After carefully analyzing the results posted by Network Testing, the Executive Board initiated the necessary measures already in the first quarter of 2012 to achieve a substantial improvement in profitability before restructuring costs and to enable the division to grow. We also intend to examine opportunities for targeted, value-adding acquisitions. For 2013, Ascom has set itself the goal of achieving a Group EBITDA margin of 14 – 15%. Changes in the Executive Board Ascom is lead by a highly experienced and internationally skilled management team. Fritz Mumenthaler was appointed as new CEO of the Ascom Group on 1 April 2011. He has been a member of the Executive Board since 2005 and was very successful in managing the Wireless Solutions Division. On 14 June 2011, the Board of Directors appointed Claes Ödman, a manager with broad international experience and solid knowledge of the telecommunication industry, to succeed Fritz Mumenthaler as General Manager of Wireless Solutions. A word of thanks In 2011, the economic climate and internal changes at Ascom called for major commitment, dedication and flexibility on the part of our employees. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board, we would like to thank all our employees for their outstanding support. Our thanks go also to our customers for the trust they show in our products and services, the good business relationship and the many ways in which they inspire us. Special thanks also go to you, our valued shareholders, for your loyalty to Ascom, which makes 2012 a very special year for us. We are celebrating 25 years of innovation and the people behind the company. This anniversary is an occasion to look back with pride on past achievements and look ahead to a successful and innovative future.

ASCom Annual Report 2011 Corporate governance 35 Risk management As an internationally active Group, Ascom is exposed to a variety of risks arising from its operating business. Risk management is therefore an integral part of Group management and hence also part of the business processes. Financial risks (liquidity, foreign currency, interest rate, credit risk) are centrally monitored by Group Treasury in accordance with written guidelines. Capital risk is also monitored using defined ranges for the debt service ratio and the equity ratio. Further information on risk management can be found in note 26 to the financial statements of the Ascom Group on page 94 of this Annual Report. Internal Control System (ICS) A Board directive of 11 December 2008 and the ICS manual govern the Internal Control System (ICS). The ICS ensures the implementation of appropriate procedures and measures for the purpose of identifying and monitoring the main financial risks to which the Group is exposed. In particular, the aim of the ICS is to ensure the integrity and completeness of accounting, to provide timely and reliable financial reporting, and to prevent, minimize and identify errors and irregularities in the financial statements. In order to achieve these targets, Group companies in scope are determined annually. Hereby, it is ensured that at least 80% of revenue and of total assets of the Group are covered. The external audit confirms the existence of the ICS in connection with the year-end audit. Additionally, external audit submits improvement suggestions on a yearly basis which are implemented in the following year. 36 ASCom Annual Report 2011 Corporate governance MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD rikard lundqvisT general manager network testing fritz mumenthaler chief executive officer martin zwyssig chief financial officer claes Ödman general manager wireless solutions ASCom Annual Report 2011 Corporate governance 37 Fritz Mumenthaler Dr Martin Zwyssig chief executive officer Chief Financial OfFIcer (Since 1 april 2011) Nationality: Swiss | Born 1965 Nationality: Swiss | Born 1958 > 1992 MBA from the University of St. Gallen (lic. oec.

The Group has chosen to recognize an expense with a related credit in other capital reserves. The Group provides own shares to employees exercising stock options and elected to recognize the excess or shortfall of cash received over the acquisition cost of those own shares in other capital reserves.

GENERAL INFORMATION Ascom is an international solution provider with comprehensive technological know-how in Mission-Critical Communication. The company focuses on the areas of Wireless Solutions (high-value, customer-speciﬁc on-site communication solutions) and Network Testing (a global market leader in testing and optimization solutions for mobile networks). Ascom Holding Ltd., the parent company of the Group, is a public limited company and is domiciled in Berne (Switzerland). Ascom registered shares (symbol ASCN) are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich (Switzerland). 2. SUMMARY OF THE GENERAL GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES 2.1 Basis of preparation The functional and presentation currency of Ascom Holding Ltd. is Swiss francs (CHF). Ascom’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared based on the individual ﬁnancial statement of each Group company. These are based on historical costs except for the revaluation of certain ﬁnancial assets at fair value, and are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) including the standards and interpretation guidelines issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as well as the valuation and accounting policies described below. These policies have been consistently applied. The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, are disclosed in note 2.25. The closing date for the Group and the individual Group companies is 31 December. 2.2 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures a) The following new standards and amendments to existing standards are mandatory for the ﬁrst time for the ﬁnancial year beginning 1 January 2011: IAS 32 (amendment) “Financial instruments: Presentation – Classiﬁcation of rights issues”, IFRIC 19, “Extinguishing ﬁnancial liabilities with equity instruments”, IFRS 1 (amendment) “First-time adoption of IFRS – Limited exemption from comparative IFRS 7 disclosures for ﬁrst-time adopters”, IAS 24 (revised) – “Related Party Disclosures”, IFRIC 14 (amendment) “IAS 19 – The limit on a deﬁned beneﬁt assets, minimum funding requirements and their interaction”, as well as annual IFRS Improvements published in May 2010 to various IFRSs. These standards have no effect on the consolidated balance sheet or statement of comprehensive income of Ascom Group, as they are either mostly disclosure regulations or are of little signiﬁcance to Ascom Group. b) The following standards and amendments to existing standards have been published but are not yet effective. The Group has not early adopted them.

IAS 19 – “Employee Beneﬁts” was amended in June 2011. Ascom intends to adopt IAS 19 in the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2013. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of the following amendments: ■ Elimination of the corridor approach and recognition of all actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income as they occur: At 31 December 2011, the Group’s unrecognized actuarial losses amount to CHF 85.7 million. At adoption date of the amendments, this amount will be recognized directly in the reference period’s opening balance (1 January 2012) of retained earnings. ■ Immediate recognition of all past service costs. ■ Net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability or asset (funded status) replaces interest cost and expected return on plan assets. 2.3 Consolidation a) Subsidiaries The consolidated ﬁnancial statements cover Ascom Holding Ltd. and all companies over which the Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Proﬁts or losses from disposal of subsidiaries are recorded in net proﬁt or loss. The list of the consolidated Group companies is included under note 33. Percentages of the Group’s interest in share capital correspond to percentages in voting rights held. Group companies are included in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements in their entirety. The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, 58 ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognized directly in proﬁt or loss. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. b) Non-controlling interests The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. c) Associates Associates are all entities over which Ascom Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognized at cost. The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill identiﬁed on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss. The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition proﬁts or losses is recognized in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognized in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 2.4 Foreign currency translation The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in Swiss francs (CHF), which is the Group’s presentation currency. All assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into the Group’s presentation currency at the exchange rates prevailing on 31 December. Income, expenses and cash ﬂows of foreign entities are translated at average exchange rates for the year where this is considered an appropriate approximation of the applicable period rates. Exchange differences arising from the reconversion of the net investment in subsidiaries or associated undertakings in foreign functional currencies are recorded as currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive income. Also taken to other comASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 59 prehensive income are differences from the retranslation of borrowings that hedge such investments in foreign Group companies. Upon disposal of a foreign operation, accumulated currency translation adjustments are recognized in proﬁt or loss as part of the proﬁt or loss from divestment of a subsidiary or business. Foreign currency translation CHF ISO-code Unit 31.12. Average 31.12.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the rate prevailing on the acquisition date. Transactions in foreign currencies are accounted for at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the conversion of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in proﬁt or loss. Such balances are converted into the functional currency of the foreign entity at the exchange rates prevailing on 31 December. 2.5 Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identiﬁed as the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO). 2.6 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at purchase or manufacturing cost (i.e. historical cost) less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the items acquired. Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group holds the risks and rewards incident to ownership are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property or the present value of the lease payments (see note 2.19). Property, plant and equipment acquired under ﬁnance leases are depreciated over the lease period or, if shorter, the useful life of the asset. Land is valued at cost and is not depreciated. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life as shown in the following table: Useful life in years Buildings 20–40 Installations and transport systems 7–10 Production equipment, measuring and test equipment, IT hardware, furniture 3–5 Tools and demo equipment 3 60 ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The assets’ residual value and useful life are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the balance sheet date. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to proﬁt or loss during the ﬁnancial period in which they are incurred. Items of property, plant and equipment are eliminated from the balance sheet from their date of disposal, or written off when no further economic beneﬁt can be expected from their use. All gains or losses arising from the disposal of such items are included in proﬁt or loss. Where the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is higher than the recoverable amount, these assets are impaired to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 2.7 Intangible assets Licenses, patents, trademarks, software and other similar rights are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization. The amortization charge is calculated on a straight-line basis over the period of its estimated useful economic life as shown in the following table: Useful life in years Licenses 3–5 Customer relations 10 Technology 7 Trademarks 5 Internally generated development costs 3 Other 2–5 Purchased goodwill (the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquisition-date fair value of the acquired equity interests) is recorded as an intangible asset with an indeﬁnite useful life that is tested for impairment at least once a year. For the purposes of testing for impairment, the goodwill is allocated to the corresponding cash generating units. Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 2.8 Research and development costs All research costs are charged immediately to proﬁt or loss. Costs incurred on development projects (relating to the design and testing of new or improved products) are recognized as intangible assets when the following criteria are fulﬁlled: ■ It is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale. ■ Management intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it. ■ There is an ability to use or sell the intangible asset. ■ It can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic beneﬁts. ■ Adequate technical, ﬁnancial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset are available. ■ The expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably. ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 61 The capitalized assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective product. Development costs that cannot be capitalized are charged to proﬁt or loss in the period in which they occur. Property, plant and equipment used for research and development activities are capitalized in the same way as property, plant and equipment, and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful life. 2.9 Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets are classiﬁed as “Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss”, “Loans and receivables” or “Financial assets available for sale”. Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as “Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss” or “Other ﬁnancial liabilities”. a) Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss are either held for trading purposes or designated as such. Financial assets held for trading are purchased with the intention of generating a proﬁt from short-term ﬂuctuations in the price. All derivative ﬁnancial instruments are classiﬁed as at fair value through proﬁt or loss. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments comprise forward exchange contracts. b) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. c) Financial assets available for sale Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments that are either allocated to this category or do not belong to any other category. d) Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss are either held for trading purposes or designated as such. Derivatives with a negative replacement value are assigned to the category at fair value through proﬁt or loss. e) Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost particularly include trade payables, borrowings and other liabilities. All ﬁnancial assets are recorded initially at fair value including transaction costs, except for ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss, for which such costs are immediately expensed. All purchases and sales are recognized on the trade date, i.e. on the day an agreement has been entered. After initial recognition, ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are charged to ﬁnancial income or expenses in the appropriate reporting period. No hedge accounting is applied. The fair value of a quoted ﬁnancial instrument is based on available stock exchange prices. If a ﬁnancial instrument is not quoted in an active market, alternative valuation methods are used based on recent transactions between willing and independent third parties, discounted cash ﬂow analysis or similar. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 62 ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Following initial recognition, available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are recognized at fair value and changes in value are charged to other comprehensive income. Whenever there are indications of a possible impairment, the carrying amount of ﬁnancial assets that are not measured at fair value through proﬁt or loss are tested for objective substantial indications of impairment to identify concrete need for value reduction. Serious ﬁnancial difﬁculties, insolvency proceedings of the debtor or ﬁnancial reorganization, and default or delinquency in payments (more than 90 days overdue) are considered indicators that the ﬁnancial asset is impaired. For available-for-sale assets, material or sustained price reductions are indicators of potential impairment. Price reductions of 20% or more are considered material. Sustained price reductions are price reductions that last for at least six months. If there is objective evidence that such a ﬁnancial asset is impaired, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that ﬁnancial asset previously recognized in proﬁt or loss – is removed from equity and recognized in proﬁt or loss. Received dividends on available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are recognized in proﬁt or loss as part of ﬁnancial income. Financial assets are derecognized when Ascom gives up its control over them, i.e. when the rights associated with them are sold or expired. At their initial recognition and subsequently, ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss are measured at fair value. The transaction costs directly identiﬁable to the purchase of these liabilities are immediately expensed. Valuation of the non-current portion of ﬁnancial liabilities measured at amortized cost is subsequently carried out at amortized cost value using the effective-interest method. In addition to actual interest payments, ﬁnancial expenses include annual compound interests and pro rata transaction costs. 2.10 Inventories and work in progress Inventories are stated at the lower of purchase costs/manufacturing costs or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Manufacturing costs include direct material and production costs as well as material and production overheads. The costs are determined using the weighted average method. Value adjustments are made for obsolete and slow-moving items. Construction contracts are recognized according to the stage of completion of the contract (percentage-of-completion method), and the respective effect is recognized in proﬁt or loss. Provisions are made to cover all anticipated losses, as soon as these are identiﬁed. 2.11 Trade receivables Trade receivables are carried at the invoiced amount less provision for doubtful debts. A provision for doubtful debts is recognized when it becomes obvious that the originally invoiced amount is not fully realizable. The amount of the provision is determined by reference to the originally invoiced amount less the amount of the expected realization. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a provision account and the loss is recorded as marketing and distribution expenses. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the provision account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against marketing and distribution expenses. ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 63 2.12 Other current assets Prepayments and accrued income are stated at nominal value. 2.13 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash, which is restricted for at least 12 months, is recognized as a ﬁnancial asset. 2.14 Equity Registered shares are classiﬁed as equity. Own shares and options to acquire own shares as well as realized gains or losses from disposals and costs relating to capital increases and decreases are recorded in equity. Dividends are charged to equity in the period in which they are approved. 2.15 Borrowings Liabilities are stated as being current if they are settled within 12 months or if there is no unconditional right to extend the settlement to at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Initial recognition is at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Valuation is subsequently carried out at amortized cost value using the effective-interest method. 2.16 Employee beneﬁt obligations Various employee beneﬁt plans exist within the Group, which are individually tailored to suit the local conditions in their respective countries. For deﬁned contribution plans, the costs to be recognized for the reporting period are the agreed contributions of the employer. In the case of deﬁned beneﬁt plans, the costs to be recognized for the reporting period are determined by external actuaries using the projected-unit-credit method. The liabilities are backed by assets which are managed separately from the assets of the Group by autonomous employee beneﬁt funds (funded beneﬁt plans). By contrast, plans that do not have their own assets (unfunded beneﬁt plans) are backed by a corresponding employee beneﬁt obligation in the balance sheet. For deﬁned beneﬁt plans with separate funds, the deﬁned beneﬁt asset or liability comprises the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled, together with adjustments for unrecognized past service costs. The amount recognized takes into account any unrecognized actuarial gains or losses or outstanding rights. Any assets resulting from surpluses in deﬁned beneﬁt plans are limited to the value of the maximum future savings from reduced contributions. Liabilities are fully provisioned. Actuarial gains and losses result mainly from changes in actuarial assumptions, or from differences between actuarial assumptions and actual values. Actuarial adjustments that exceed the socalled corridor of 10% are debited or credited to proﬁt or loss over the average remaining working life of the insured employees (provided that the criteria for capitalization are fulﬁlled). The effects of amendments to plans are recognized until the beneﬁts become available to the employees. Other employee beneﬁts (e.g. service anniversary awards) are valued by the method described above and recognized in the balance sheet under employee beneﬁt obligations, with any actuarial gains being recognized immediately. 64 ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.17 Provisions Provisions are made when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If an outﬂow of resources to settle an obligation is not probable, a contingent liability is disclosed. Provisions for product warranties are made to the extent of the outﬂow of resources that can be expected to meet the obligation in full. For costs that are expected to arise in connection with plant closures, the disposal of companies or business units and restructuring, provisions are made at the time of the approval and announcement of the planned measures. For onerous contracts, provisions are provided if the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation exceed the economic beneﬁt to be received. 2.18 Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. a) Sales of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods. Revenue is recorded based on the price speciﬁed in the sales contracts, net of the estimated volume discounts, sales tax or valueadded tax as well as credit notes for goods returned. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts and returns. b) Rendering of services Revenue from ﬁxed-price contracts for delivering of services is generally recognized in the period the services are provided, using a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Such revenue could also be recognized based on the services performed to date as a percentage of the total services to be performed. If the selling price of a product includes an identiﬁable amount for subsequent servicing (multi-element transactions), that amount is deferred and recognized as revenue over the period during which the service is performed. c) Construction contracts Revenue from construction contracts is determined based on the stage of completion using the percentage-of-completion method (PoC) if the stage of completion and expected outcome can be measured reliably. The respective calculation is based either on the costs incurred compared to the total costs to complete or the units completed compared to the total number of contracted units. If circumstances arise that may change the original estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion, estimates are revised. These revisions may result in increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs and are reﬂected in proﬁt or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known to management. If it is probable that the contract costs will exceed the economic beneﬁt, the potential loss is recognized in proﬁt or loss regardless of the project progress. ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 65 2.19 Leases A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee in return for a payment, or series of payments, the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time. a) Lessee accounting Leases in which a signiﬁcant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred from the lessor to the lessee are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases. The leased assets are carried at cost not higher than the minimal lease payments and depreciated along with other property, plant and equipment (see note 2.6). The corresponding leasing obligations are shown as liabilities. Per period leasing installments are distributed accordingly as either capital repayments or interest expenses. Leases in which a signiﬁcant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classiﬁed as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to proﬁt or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. b) Lessor accounting When assets are leased out under a ﬁnance lease, the present value of the lease payments is recognized as a receivable. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognized as unearned ﬁnance income. Per period leasing installments are distributed accordingly as either capital repayments or interest income. When assets are leased out under an operating lease, the asset is included in the balance sheet based on the nature of the asset. Operating lease income is recognized in proﬁt or loss over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis. 2.20 Share-based payments Selected members of Ascom’s senior management receive remuneration in the form of sharebased payment transactions (stock option plans), whereby employees render services as consideration for such equity instruments (equity-settled options). Employees which are residents of the USA are granted share appreciation rights, which can only be settled in cash (cash-settled options). The costs of options are measured initially at fair value at the grant date using a binomial model, further details of which are given in note 19. For equity-settled options, this fair value is recognized over the vesting period under personnel expenses, together with a corresponding increase in other capital reserves in equity, adjusted to reﬂect actual versus expected levels of vesting. The dilutive effect of outstanding equity-settled options is reﬂected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share (see note 24). The fair value of cash-settled options is recognized under personnel expenses over the period until the vesting date with recognition of a corresponding liability included under other provisions. The liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognized as personnel expenses. 2.21 Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of the respective asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. 66 ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.22 Income tax Income tax is recorded based on the period to which it properly relates. Deferred income tax is recorded in full using the liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities arise on temporary differences between carrying values of assets and liabilities for Group purposes and their related tax values. These temporary differences arise mainly from depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, revaluation of certain non-current assets, employee beneﬁt obligations and tax loss carry-forwards, and, in the case of acquisitions, the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired and their tax base. The tax rates and laws enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date are used to determine deferred income tax. Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available against which the temporary deductible differences can be offset. Deferred income tax is recognized on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. Exceptions are temporary differences for which the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 2.23 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classiﬁed as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as completed sale within one year from the date of classiﬁcation. The assets must be available for immediate sale in their present condition. Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount at the date of their ﬁrst recognition as held for sale and fair value less costs to sell. Such assets are no longer depreciated or amortized systematically. A possible impairment is included in proﬁt or loss. A discontinued operation is a substantial component of the Group that either has been disposed of, or is classiﬁed as held for sale. 2.24 Deﬁnition of non-GAAP measures Earnings before interest and income tax (EBIT) as a subtotal includes all operating income and expenses before addition/deduction of ﬁnancial income and expenses and income tax. Earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as a subtotal includes earnings before interest and income tax (EBIT) before deduction of depreciation of property, plant and equipment as well as amortization of intangible ﬁxed assets. 2.25 Main sources of uncertainty with regard to estimates Below we explain important forward-looking assumptions and other main sources of uncertainty with regard to estimates, which could result in signiﬁcant value adjustments in respect of assets and liabilities carried on the balance sheet in the coming ﬁnancial year. Intangible assets from acquisition are initially capitalized at their fair value due to a purchase price allocation at acquisition date. The fair value is determined using the respective methods as disclosed further in note 6. Future assessments of a potential impairment of such intangible assets is dependent on the achievement of the forecasted cash ﬂows as used in the initial business plan. ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 67 This ultimately also applies to the goodwill that is recognized, since the purchase price allocation normally consists mainly of the portfolio value and goodwill. Goodwill is regarded as an intangible asset with an indeﬁnite useful life that must be tested for impairment at least once a year. Determining the present value of goodwill requires an estimate of the expected future cash ﬂows from the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated and the setting of an appropriate discount rate for calculation of the present value of these cash ﬂows. The estimates of the cash ﬂows are based on medium-term plans. The discount rate applied reﬂects the risk arising in connection with the respective business activities. Further information on goodwill can be found in note 6. For deﬁned beneﬁt plans, the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is determined using the projected-unitcredit method. Actuarial valuations of signiﬁcant deﬁned beneﬁt plans are obtained annually. Actuarial assumptions are used in determining the cost of funded and unfunded employee beneﬁts. These actuarial assumptions, such as discount rate, expected return on assets, future salary or pension increases and average life expectancy, are estimates and therefore sources of uncertainty (see note 14). Ascom management regularly monitors the net future outﬂow of economic beneﬁts related to onerous lease contracts. In calculating the value of these provisions, net cash ﬂows of forecasts with a time horizon to 2015 are used and the planned costs are amortized with market related discount rates. Management continuously updates the provisions for the likelihood of ﬁnding tenants for vacant space in the foreseeable future. Further information on onerous contracts can be found in note 15. Restructuring provisions are created in connection with the discontinuation or reorganization of a line of business and the closure or relocation of business locations if there is a detailed formal plan and the implications are known and communicated. Signiﬁcant judgment is required to determine the costs of restructuring plans (see note 15). In connection with recording revenue from construction contracts it is necessary to reliably determine the project progress and costs. The respective calculation is based either on the costs incurred compared to the total costs to complete or the units completed compared to the total number of contracted units. The contracts are analyzed and reassessed at least at each balance sheet date (see note 16). Ascom Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions. Signiﬁcant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income tax. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. At the balance sheet date, there were non-capitalized tax loss carry-forwards (see note 22). As a result of future positive developments with regard to income, the possibility may arise that deferred income tax assets in connection with these tax loss carry-forwards will be capitalized at least in part. 68 ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3. SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND OPERATIONAL CHANGES Acquisition of Miratel Oy At 1 July 2011, Ascom acquired all shares of Miratel Oy, based in Finland. The purchase price amounted to EUR 5.5 million. Miratel is the market leader in nurse call systems, communication and personal security systems for hospitals and care facilities in Finland. The company has over 40 years’ experience in nurse call systems, their deployment and commissioning as well as their maintenance and service.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash ﬂow projections based on ﬁnancial budgets approved by the management covering a four-year period. Cash ﬂows beyond the four-year period are extrapolated using a 1.5% growth rate. The discount rate applied is based on a risk-free 10-year bond adjusted for risk. The following assumptions based on experience are applied: 2011 2010 Revenue growth rate (CAGR) 1 – Wireless Solutions 8.1% 7.9% – Network Testing 2.4% 6.9% EBIT margin 1 – Wireless Solutions 11%–12% 9%–14% – Network Testing 0%–14% 6%–16% Pre-tax discount rate – Wireless Solutions 10.4% 10.3% – Network Testing 10.2% 9.9% 1 Based on approved four-year ﬁnancial budgets, excluding foreign exchange impacts. Based on these calculations there is no need for impairment. Regarding the sensitivity of changes to underlying assumptions used, Ascom Group showed that even a possible change in the discount rate up to 14% (previous year: 17%) would still not result in an impairment of goodwill, neither in Wireless Solutions nor in Network Testing. Also a reduction in EBIT margin assumption of 5 percentage points (previous year: 8 percentage points) would not lead to an impairment of goodwill. Intangible assets from acquisition consist of customer relations of CHF 26.7 million (previous year: CHF 28.7 million), technology of CHF 17.7 million (previous year: CHF 22.1 million) and trademarks of CHF 3.5 million (previous year: CHF 5.0 million). Customer relations are capitalized using the excessearning method for valuation of the existing customers at acquisition date. In 2011, customer relations of CHF 1.8 million were capitalized due to the acquisition of Miratel Oy. Customer relations are amortized over their estimated useful life of 10 years, using the straight-line method. Technology and trademarks are capitalized using the royalty rate method for valuation. Technology is amortized over the estimated useful life of 7 years, trademarks are amortized over the estimated useful life of 5 years, using the straight-line method. Amortization of intangible assets from acquisition of CHF 9.4 million (previous year: CHF 10.5 million) shown as separate line item in the income statement exclusively contains amortization and impairment of intangible assets initially capitalized due to a purchase price allocation at acquisition date. Taking into account the function of expense method this line item could be reassigned as follows: ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 75 CHF 5.4 million (previous year: CHF 6.2 million) to marketing and distribution as well as CHF 4.0 million (previous year: CHF 4.3 million) to research and development. Other intangible assets include mainly software. Following a reassessment of the remaining expected life and expected future economic beneﬁts to be generated by intangible assets, there was no need to impair intangible assets during the period under review (previous year: nil). 7.

The principal actuarial assumptions used in determining the cost of the employee beneﬁt plans vary according to local conditions. The assumptions applied in the valuation of the signiﬁcant plans in Switzerland and abroad are as follows: Plans in Switzerland Other plans 2011 2010 2011 2010 Discount rate in % 2.50 2.75 3.85–5.10 3.50–5.50 Expected return on assets in % 3.50 3.50 4.10–5.21 4.00–5.82 Future salary increases in % 2.00 2.00 2.10–3.50 1.00–4.50 Future pension increases in % 0.10 1.00 0.10–3.70 1.50–3.75 Average life expectancy in years of someone retiring at 62 for Switzerland and 65 for the other plans at the balance sheet date – Male 22.2 20.3 17.0–23.0 20.0–22.0 – Female 24.7 23.6 22.0–26.0 24.0 The current return on the pension fund capital was CHF 4.5 million (previous year: CHF 72.4 million). The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy. Expected yields on ﬁxed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields at the balance sheet date. Expected returns on equity and property investments reﬂect long-term real rates of return in the respective markets. The expected contributions to deﬁned beneﬁt plans for the year ending 31 December 2012 are CHF 4.3 million. For the Swiss pension plan the experience adjustments are as follows: CHFm 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Fair value of plan assets at 31.12. 851.5 921.7 916.9 907.9 1,270.6 Present value of funded plan obligations at 31.12.

In relation to the divestment of the core business units of the former Security Communication Division a new restructuring provision of CHF 1.7 million was recognized mainly related to costs for termination of labor contracts. Expected cash outﬂows are projected to occur mainly within one year but not later than within ﬁve years. In 2010, Ascom recognized provisions for several restructuring events. Thereof, all provisions were either used or released in the current period. Provisions include onerous lease contracts for a number of leased properties that are partially vacant. Ascom does not use the vacant space and the Group experiences difﬁculties to sublet the premises. The value of the provisions is based on net cash ﬂows using forecasts with a time horizon to 2015 and by discounting the costs with a market related discount rate of 6.0% (previous year: 6.5%). Provisions for warranties are project-related and are based on systematic extrapolation of historical payment patterns, which are veriﬁed and adjusted periodically. ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 83 Other provisions comprise obligations arising from claims or disputes in connection with the operational business of Ascom companies (CHF 1.5 million), provisions for environmental costs relating to premises (CHF 2.9 million), provisions in relation to termination of labor contracts (CHF 0.7 million), provisions in relation to open income tax cases (CHF 1.8 million) and obligations arising from cashsettled share-based payments (CHF 0.2 million). The residual amount represents an accumulation of several minor events. After taking appropriate legal advice, the outcome of the legal claims will not give rise to any signiﬁcant loss beyond the amounts provided at 31 December 2011. Cash outﬂows of other provisions are expected within three years. A reassessment of the most likely outcome of risks in relation to divested activities led to a release of unused other provisions of CHF 3.0 million in the period under review. Additionally, Ascom settled litigations connected to the operational business which led to releases of unused other provisions in the total amount of CHF 2.0 million. The remaining amount consists of several cases individually not exceeding CHF 0.5 million. 16.

At 31 December 2011, the liability recognized for cash-settled options amounts to CHF 0.2 million (previous year: CHF 0.6 million). Thereof CHF 0.1 million (previous year: CHF 0.1 million) represent the total intrinsic value of liabilities for which the employee’s right to cash had vested by the end of the period. The Enhanced American Model (binomial model) was used to determine the fair value of the options.

At the balance sheet date, payables due to key management in the amount of CHF 0.9 million (previous year: CHF 1.5 million) existed. Legally independent funds provide for Swiss pensions (see note 14). In the reporting period lease payments of CHF 0.4 million were disbursed to the Swiss pension fund for buildings occupied by the Group (previous year: CHF 0.4 million). In opposite direction administrative and facility management services in the total amount of CHF 0.6 million (previous year: CHF 0.6 million) were rendered to the Swiss pension fund in the year under review. At the balance sheet date, a current receivable of CHF 6.0 million (previous year: CHF 10.0 million) was outstanding, subject to an interest yield of 2.5% (previous year: 2.5%). The Swiss pension funds have not owned any Ascom shares in 2011 (previous year: nil). Zürcher Kantonalbank is a signiﬁcant shareholder of Ascom Holding Ltd. with an interest of 26.74% at 31 December 2011. For its hedging and cash management needs Ascom enters into foreign exchange contracts with Zürcher Kantonalbank. At the balance sheet date, forward contracts with a counter value of CHF 10.2 million (previous year: nil) are open leading to a replacement value at 31 December 2011 of nil (previous year: nil). Throughout the period, foreign exchange deals with net 94 ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS counter value of CHF 24.6 million (previous year: nil) were settled. These transactions were made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s length transactions. 26. RISK MANAGEMENT As an international company, Ascom is exposed to a variety of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial risks that are directly associated with the Group’s business operations. The Group’s risk exposure is addressed in accordance with the principle of risk limitation. Our overall risk management is an integral part of corporate management and the long-term corporate strategy, and it is correspondingly incorporated in the framework of our business processes and procedures. Ascom applies clearly deﬁned management information and control systems to measure, monitor and control the risks to which it is exposed. Our management monitors the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our risk management activities and control systems at regular intervals and proposes adjustments as required. 26.1 Financial risk Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury and is ensured by the relevant written principles and guidelines laid down by the management and approved by the Board of Directors. The Group has revised its treasury policy and treasury strategy in the current period. In the treasury strategy the Group’s risk capacity and appetite for the various risk factors are deﬁned. The treasury strategy speciﬁes the limit architecture and thereby deﬁnes the extent to which risk exposures will be hedged and the instruments and time-frame for implementation. All strategy proposals in the treasury strategy are reviewed and require annual approval by the Audit Committee. Group Treasury is in charge of risk quantiﬁcation and hereby measures ﬁnancial risks by means of at-risk-methodologies, sensitivity analysis and stress testing. Group companies are responsible for the correct identiﬁcation of the ﬁnancial risk positions resulting from their business activities. Transactions without underlying core business and all forms of speculation are prohibited. Financial risk comprises liquidity risk, market risk and credit risk: a) Liquidity risk The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that sufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources are available at any point in time in order to be able to completely and timely fulﬁll all payment obligations of the Group. Group companies prepare, on a monthly basis, a rolling liquidity forecast for a 12-month horizon. Based on these ﬁgures, Group Treasury centrally monitors the liquidity position of the Group. Group Treasury compares the planned liquidity requirements with the available funds to detect shortages in a timely manner. In addition, a liquidity reserve is held at all times for unplanned occurrences and undrawn credit facilities are available for ﬁnancial ﬂexibility. The total of committed credit facilities can be found in note 13. An analysis of the Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities into the relevant maturity groupings, based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date, is set out below. Contractual commitments in relation to ﬁnancial guarantees are further disclosed in note 28.

The cash ﬂows shown above are subject to the following conditions and exceptions: ■ All ﬁnancial instruments are included that were recognized on 31 December 2011 and 2010 respectively, and for which payments were already contractually agreed. Plan ﬁgures for future new liabilities are not included. ■ Foreign currency amounts are translated at balance sheet rate. ■ Variable interest payments for ﬁnancial instruments are based on the last interest rate ﬁxed on 31 December 2011 and 2010 respectively. ■ Derivative ﬁnancial instruments comprise derivatives with negative as well as positive replacement values. This takes into account that all derivative ﬁnancial instruments, and not only those with a negative replacement value, could have inﬂuence on individual timeframes. Local regulatory limitations related to the transfer of funds exist in a number of countries where Ascom operates, including Brazil, China, India and South Africa. As a consequence, these funds are not available within Group Treasury operations to meet short-term cash obligations outside the respective country. The above described funds are reported as cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet. At 31 December 2011, the balance under such limitations totals CHF 5.6 million (previous year: CHF 0.9 million). b) Market risk Market risk includes foreign currency risk, fair value interest rate risk, cash ﬂow interest rate risk and other price risk. Changes in the fair value of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities can affect the Group’s asset and income situation. Apart from interest rate and foreign currency risk, the Group is not exposed to any other signiﬁcant ﬁnancial market risk. 96 ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Foreign currency risk Due to the global nature of its activities, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk. Foreign exchange gains or losses arise from transactions as well as assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (mainly EUR, USD, SEK and GBP) if these are not the entity’s functional currency. Group Treasury is responsible for managing group-wide foreign exchange transaction risk on an ongoing basis. Annual net transaction risk positions of the Group are derived from planned cash ﬂows on a rolling horizon of 12 months. Group Treasury monitors these positions and loss limits which are the basis for hedging transactions. Respective forward contracts are stated at fair value. All hedging activities are carried out centrally by Group Treasury. The Group has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. These types of translation risk are currently not hedged. The currency related sensitivity of the Group at year end is shown in the following table: CHFm Reasonable Impact Reasonable Impact shift on net result shift on net result 31.12.2011 31.12.2011 31.12.2010 31.12.2010 EUR/CHF +/-15% +/-0.6 +/-10% +/-0.4 GBP/CHF +/-15% +/-0.6 +/-10% +/-0.5 SEK/CHF +/-15% +/-3.5 +/-10% +/-0.0 USD/CHF +/-15% +/-1.8 +/-10% +/-1.0 EUR/SEK +/-15% +/-1.7 +/-10% +/-1.6 USD/SEK +/-15% +/-1.8 +/-10% +/-2.4 The changes are mainly due to foreign exchange gains and losses on cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and forward contracts. Interest rate risk Every interest position is subject to either a cash ﬂow interest risk (associated with ﬂoating rate positions) or a market value risk (from ﬁxed interest positions). The revolving multicurrency loan facility the Group entered into at 26 May 2011 (see note 13) is the main interest rate risk position in the balance sheet of Ascom. This risk is currently offset with cash surpluses. The Group is holding non-current assets and liabilities which are discounted to reﬂect the time value of money. All these positions are exposed to interest market value risk. However, neither individually nor in total are these positions material. Based on the interest-bearing assets and liabilities existent at 31 December 2011, a 50 base point higher (lower) level of the market interest rates would lead to a CHF 0.3 million (previous year: CHF 0.3 million) higher (lower) net result on an annual basis. ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 97 c) Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative ﬁnancial instruments and deposits with banks and ﬁnancial institutions, as well as credit exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. Credit risk may result in a ﬁnancial loss if one party in a transaction is unable or unwilling to discharge its obligations. It is Ascom’s objective to limit the impact of a default. Credit risk of ﬁnancial counterparties is managed centrally by Group Treasury. For banks and ﬁnancial institutions, only parties with a minimum Standard & Poor’s credit rating of “A” are accepted. Individual risk limits are set by the Board of Directors. The utilization of credit limits and development of credit ratings are regularly monitored. Each Group company is responsible for analyzing the credit risk for each of their new customer and managing the quality of their trade receivables on an ongoing basis. The table below sets out the Group’s six major counterparties at the balance sheet date: CHFm Rating 1 Balance 31.12.2011 Counterparty Bank A A 21.5 Bank B A+ 7.2 Bank C AA– 6.4 Customer A BBB+ 4.9 Customer B B– 3.9 Customer C not rated 3.0 CHFm Rating 1 Balance 31.12.2010 Counterparty Bank A A+ 35.3 Bank D A+ 35.7 Bank C AA– 12.3 Customer A BBB+ 8.0 Customer D A– 3.8 Customer B B– 3.7 1 Long-term credit rating Standard & Poor’s. The number of customers and their geographical distribution reduces the risk of concentration. The management does not expect any losses from non-performance by ﬁnancial institutions where funds have been invested by the Group during the reporting period. The Group monitors the credit worthiness of its key customers by using independent ratings (if available) and by taking into account their ﬁnancial position, past experience and other factors at subsidiary level. Each division has its own policy in place to manage the quality of trade receivables. 98 ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The credit quality of ﬁnancial assets that are neither past due nor impaired at the balance sheet date can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings, if available, or to historical information about counterparty default rates: CHFm “A” or better Without public Total rating 1 rating Financial assets – 7.2 7.2 Cash and cash equivalents 71.6 1.7 73.3 Total at 31.12.2011 71.6 8.9 80.5 CHFm “A” or better Without public Total rating 1 rating Financial assets 0.4 7.9 8.3 Cash and cash equivalents 127.9 1.1 129.0 Total at 31.12.2010 128.3 9.0 137.3 1 Long-term credit rating Standard & Poor’s. 26.2 Capital risk The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for the shareholders and beneﬁts for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimally leveraged capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. Ascom aims to maintain a stable investment grade rating as perceived by bank partners and debt investors.

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices). Level 3: Inputs for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). The following tables present the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date: CHFm Based on quoted Based on other Based on unobTotal prices in active observable inputs servable inputs markets (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Available for sale ﬁnancial assets Investments in third parties – – 0.9 0.9 Balance at 31.12.2011 – – 0.9 0.9 Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss Derivative ﬁnancial instruments – – – – Balance at 31.12.2011 – – – – CHFm Based on quoted Based on other Based on unobTotal prices in active observable inputs servable inputs markets (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Available for sale ﬁnancial assets Investments in third parties – – 0.9 0.9 Other ﬁnancial investments 0.5 – – 0.5 Balance at 31.12.2010 0.5 – 0.9 1.4 Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss Derivative ﬁnancial instruments – 0.2 – 0.2 Balance at 31.12.2010 – 0.2 – 0.2 The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from a stock exchange. The quoted market price used for ﬁnancial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1. Instruments included in level 1 comprise primarily participations in investment funds available for sale. The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, overthe-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity speciﬁc estimates. If all signiﬁcant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. Forward exchange contracts are allocated to this level. ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 101 If one or more of the signiﬁcant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. These inputs reﬂect the Group’s own assumptions about market pricing using the best internal and external information available. Investments in third parties for which the fair value of the market prices cannot be reliably determined are allocated to this level and measured at cost less any impairment. 27.3 Derivative ﬁnancial instruments Foreign currencies are purchased and forward contracts are entered into at Group level as an economic hedge against foreign currency risk. The open contracts comprise the following forward contracts in various currencies: CHFm 31.12.2011 31.12.2010 Contract volume 41.0 3.1 Positive fair value 0.1 – Negative fair value 0.1 0.2 Breakdown by currency (CHFm) 31.12.2011 31.12.2010 EUR 11.7 0.4 CZK 0.3 – GBP 4.0 2.7 SEK 25.0 – Total 41.0 3.1 The fair value is included under other current assets or liabilities. The changes in value are recognized in proﬁt or loss under ﬁnancial income or expenses. 28. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES a) Lease commitments – Group as lessee The future minimum payments under non-cancellable lease obligations fall due as follows: CHFm Finance leases Operating leases 31.12.2011 31.12.2010 31.12.2011 31.12.2010 Within 12 months – 0.1 18.6 18.5 Between 1 and 5 years – – 31.2 46.0 Later – – 3.2 4.4 Total – 0.1 53.0 68.9 Signiﬁcant leasing agreements exist with regard to the sale and lease back of properties used for operational purposes in Berne and Hombrechtikon (Switzerland). 102 ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS b) Lease commitments – Group as lessor The future minimum lease receivables under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: CHFm Operating leases 31.12.2011 31.12.2010 Within 12 months 4.3 4.6 Between 1 and 5 years 15.8 16.1 Later 3.7 3.7 Total 23.8 24.4 c) Contingencies As an internationally active company, Ascom is exposed to a multitude of legal risks. These relate particularly to risks associated with product liability, patent law, tax law, and competition law. Some companies are involved in legal proceedings. The results of currently pending suits cannot be predicted with certainty, which means that decisions of courts or other authorities can cause expenses that have signiﬁcant consequences for the business and on future results. Wherever a reliable estimate of the ﬁnancial consequences of a past event is possible, and an independent expert conﬁrms that the outﬂow of resources is more likely than not, a corresponding provision is made. At 31 December 2011, contingent liabilities amount to CHF 34.1 million (previous year: CHF 40.3 million). There is no indication that these liabilities will lead to fulﬁllment payments. The Company has indemniﬁed certain purchasers of divested businesses for potential claims arising from the operations of the divested businesses. There are currently no proceedings in relation to indemniﬁcation ongoing. 29. PLEDGED ASSETS At 26 May 2011, the Group reﬁnanced its former loan facility which led to a release in pledged assets (previous year: all shares of Ascom Network Testing AB were pledged). At 31 December 2011, property, plant and equipment with a total carrying amount of CHF 2.6 million (previous year: CHF 2.8 million) and ﬁnancial assets with a total carrying amount of CHF 0.6 million (previous year: nil) were pledged. 30. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE Acquisition of technology related assets from Veelong Corp. At 3 January 2012, the Swiss company Ascom Network Testing Ltd. acquired all relevant assets relating to solutions for post-processing and analysis of mobile network testing data of Veelong Corp. based in Fanwood NJ (USA). This acquisition further strengthens the current position of Ascom Network Testing in the Reporting & Analysis market segment. The purchase price consists of a ﬁxed part of USD 5.5 million, and a performance related variable part to be paid over the next three years, which is estimated to amount up to USD 8.6 million from today’s perspective. Five key employees of Veelong, including the two founders, joined Ascom Network Testing.

Based on a discount rate of 6% the fair value of the deferred consideration amounts to CHF 3.9 million. The contingent consideration arrangement requires the Group to pay in cash 35%–45% of the revenue realized in relation to the acquired technology in the years 2012–2014 as well as for a successful development of a speciﬁed technology until 2012 up to a maximum undiscounted amount of USD 8.6 million. The total potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under this arrangement is between nil and USD 8.6 million. The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of CHF 7.3 million is based on a discount rate of 6% and assumed annual revenues related with the acquired technology between USD 11.0 million and USD 13.5 million. The fair value of the acquired technology of CHF 12.4 million is provisional pending receipt of the ﬁnal valuation for this asset. At the date of acquisition the Group owed to Veelong Corp. royalty fees of CHF 0.8 million in relation to revenues realized in the period under review. At 31 December 2011, these CHF 0.8 million are recognized as other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet of the Group. Acquisition-related costs of CHF 0.1 million were recorded in administration expenses of the reporting period under review. Divestment of Defense business unit of Ascom (Switzerland) Ltd. At 1 March 2012, Ruag (Switzerland) Ltd. purchased from Ascom (Switzerland) Ltd. all rights and obligations pertaining to the Defense business unit. All 84 employees and 10 apprentices were taken over at their existing locations. The initial purchase price amounted to CHF 17.0 million and was offset with a cash compensation paid by Ascom for the transferred net liability from construction contracts (including customer prepayments) of about CHF 72.7 million at divestment date. In addition, the purchaser has agreed to an earn-out payment up to CHF 8.3 million dependent on future success in the international business. In August 2011, the Board of Directors and Executive Board decided to seek new owners for the core business units of Security Communication due to strategic considerations. The Defense business unit was the largest and most important business unit within the former Security Communication Division. In accordance with IFRS 5, the Defense business unit has been classiﬁed as a discontinued operation in the ﬁnancial statements 2011. The result of the Defense business unit is included in the loss for the period from discontinued operations. The corresponding asset and liabilities are classiﬁed as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as disclosed in Note 23. 104 ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Although the transaction has not been ﬁnally assessed yet, Ascom will report a proﬁt from divestment of the Defense business unit in its ﬁnancial statements 2012. Since the balance sheet date, no further events have occurred that have an inﬂuence on the 2011 consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 31. PROPOSAL OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS For the year ended 31 December 2011, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting on 18 April 2012 a distribution of reserves from capital contribution of CHF 0.25 per share entitled to dividends.

Board of Directors’ Responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of Swiss law. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated ﬁnancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards as well as the International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 give a true and fair view of the ﬁnancial position, the results of operations and the cash ﬂows in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 GROUP REPORT OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 107 Report on other legal requirements We conﬁrm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence. In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we conﬁrm that an internal control system exists which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors. We recommend that the consolidated ﬁnancial statements submitted to you be approved.

Total remuneration for each member consists of a basic salary and a performance-related bonus as a variable component. The basic salary and variable component are paid in cash. The focus of the performancerelated bonus is linked to the attainment of clearly measurable targets set at the beginning of the year. On achieving the deﬁned targets, the respective member of the Executive Board shall receive a predetermined percentage of his basic salary as a bonus. In cases where the targets set in the member’s respective area of responsibility are exceeded – and the Group targets are also achieved – a sum up to a maximum of double the target bonus may be paid. In 2011, the CEO received options under the Ascom Stock Option Plan 2011 worth 20% of the total of basic salary and 100% potential bonus. The other members of the Executive Board received options worth 20% of the total of their basic salaries and target bonuses. The value of the options was determined by an independent third party. The allocation of options is made on the basis of stock option plans set up each year and agreed in writing. The conditions regarding exercising are deﬁned on allocation of the options, with no subsequent changes being made and in particular no re-pricing.

The options have a life of ﬁve years and are subject to two exercise hurdles (outperformance of the SMI index within a period of 12 months and a minimum share price of CHF 16.50 at the date of exercise). The options are subject to a ﬁxed vesting period of three years (one participant is entitled under the terms of his contract of employment to exercise one third of the options after one year and another third in each consecutive year). ■ The value of the options has been calculated as grant date fair value (using a binomial model) for options granted in the current year. The average grant date fair value of the options granted in 2011 was CHF 4.91. ■ In 2011, total other beneﬁts include contributions to medical beneﬁt plans and special premiums. ■ Executive Board members’ bonus claims for 2011 will be calculated and paid in 2012 after approval of the annual ﬁnancial statements. The criteria governing payment of the 2011 bonus are measurable and contractually regulated. The bonus amounts represent the accrued bonuses for services rendered during 2011. ■ Pension contribution includes the employer’s contribution to the pension funds. Contributions to mandatory social insurances are not included. ■ No loans or credits were granted to members of the Board of Directors or Executive Board in 2011. ■ For members leaving the Executive Board in the course of the year, the total amount includes remuneration during their term of ofﬁce including employer’s contribution to the occupational pension scheme.

Risk management in compliance with Art. 663b of the Swiss Code of Obligations Ascom Holding Ltd. is fully integrated into the group-wide risk and control process of Ascom Group (see note 26 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements). 116 ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 HOLDING COMMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Assets Investments include shares in Group companies amounting to CHF 127.2 million (previous year: CHF 275.2 million). The decrease in investments is mainly attributable to a distribution of capital contribution reserves from a Group company in the amount of CHF 150.0 million (recognized as capital repayment). The remaining net increase in investments of CHF 2.0 million results from an acquisition, a capital increase and a capital reduction in relation to Group companies. In the year under review, loans to Group companies increased by CHF 210.2 million. This increase is mainly related to a ﬁnancing of a distribution of capital contribution reserves in the amount of CHF 150.0 million from a Group company. Additionally, the Group reﬁnanced its activities in 2011. Respective loan facility was transferred from a Group company to Ascom Holding Ltd. leading to an additional ﬁnancing of the Group company which formerly held the loan in its balance sheet. The loans are mainly denominated in CHF, EUR, USD and SEK. Capitalized ﬁnancing costs relate to the reﬁnancing of the Group in 2011. Accounts receivables from Group companies consist mainly of short-term receivables denominated in CHF, EUR and USD. Liabilities and equity At 31 December 2010, reserves from capital contribution in the total amount of CHF 21.9 million were split into general reserves from capital contribution (CHF 6.2 million) and reserves for own shares from capital contribution (CHF 15.7 million). In line with the resolution of the annual general meeting, reserves for own shares were directly allocated from retained earnings in 2011 leading to a consolidation of reserves from capital contribution in the amount of CHF 21.9 million at 31 December 2011. Due to the net decrease of own shares, an amount of CHF 0.2 million was released from reserves from own shares to retained earnings. Bank loan consists of a revolving multicurrency loan facility in an aggregate amount of CHF 120.0 million. The ﬁnal maturity date of the loan facility is 24 May 2016. Provisions primarily cover general valuation risks, receivable risks as well as unrealized foreign exchange differences. Income statement Investment income represents ordinary dividend payments from Group companies. The increase in ﬁnancial income results mainly from foreign exchange gains on Group loans and accounts receivables. Other income comprises trademark fees charged to Group companies and a release of provisions. Financial expenses mainly increased due to a fair value adjustment on own shares of CHF 3.4 million. Administration expenses include CHF 1.0 million (previous year: CHF 1.0 million) of personnel related costs. Proﬁt for the period In 2011, Ascom Holding Ltd. records a net proﬁt of CHF 5.3 million (previous year: CHF 274.8 million), while Ascom Group records a consolidated net proﬁt of CHF 23.1 million (previous year: CHF 32.5 million).

Board of Directors’ Responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of ﬁnancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these ﬁnancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the ﬁnancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 comply with Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation. ASCOM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 HOLDING REPORT OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 119 Report on other legal requirements We conﬁrm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence.

We further conﬁrm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation. We recommend that the ﬁnancial statements submitted to you be approved.
