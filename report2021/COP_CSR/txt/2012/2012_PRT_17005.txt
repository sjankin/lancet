The award’s ceremony takes place at a safety technical session, to which the executing and supervising entities are invited, as well as REN’s employees, and where issues related to safety at work are addressed through technical presentations, as to share useful information on safety procedures, practices and behaviour in construction sites. The award is given to the entities performing with more hours of work, one for power line works and another for works in substations, provided they have not had any fatal accident or permanent disability, and have met the targets set by REN for the frequency and severity rates of accidents. Other companies that meet the above requirements, and have over 40,000 hours of work in the year to which the award relates also receive a honourable mention. These indexes, for the ambitious nature with which they were defined in 2007, have remained constant until now. The sessions have been considered a contribution to the continuous improvement of safety at work since 2009, there was a significant reduction in the rate of severe accidents in the construction of substations, and 2011 was the year with the lowest figure since 2007. In construction works of lines there is also an improvement in the frequency rate of accidents, and the lowest figure to be registered in five years was achieved in 2011. In addition, these sessions have helped to convey the safety goals sought by REN and changes to some of the practices that are adopted on site. Examples include the required strengthening of safety teams and their involvement in work sites, the improved enforcement of alcohol control and new demands on the contents of awareness raising initiatives. 118 REN´S SUSTAINABILITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE HEALTH The strong human component All employees are covered by one of the associated with the company’s facilities two possible health plans which began management, requires systematic in the companies that presently make awareness and training on how to act up the Group.

Since the dialogue process is with all affected landowners, as well very important to REN, there is a close as with other stakeholders. The direct monitoring of these services by the contact between REN and landowners company, which carries out, directly, the helps to providing information on the required formal communications. infrastructures to be built, to inform them on the rights and duties of owners Once the infrastructures are built, REN regarding the installation of utilities continues to foster permanent and infrastructures and on the consequent constant dialogue with the landowners, losses to their estates, as well as on in order to harmonize the use of the land the compatibility between the operation in service areas with the safety standards of the infrastructures and other types imposed by good practices and the law of use the estates. This contact also in force. In 2011, due to the high level of investment made for the expansion of the company’s electrical and natural gas infrastructure, 59 estates were acquired and contacts with some 2,400 landowners were made. Thus, on December 31st 2011, the owners database contained about 63,400 records, which, in itself, shows the importance this group of stakeholders has for REN. For the establishment of rights of way, in more delicate situations, REN often feels the need to resort to legal mechanisms such as the subpoena process or to request support from public authorities for the progress of the works. In 2011, it had to resort to the subpoena process in four occasions only in the electrical lines, in a universe of over 3,000 contacts that were made. In the field of gas, that need did not exist. These results are an indicator of the efforts that REN has been making with a continuous improvement of performance, in order to reconcile the legitimate interests of landowners and communities affected, with the establishment and operation of the company’s infrastructure. 120 REN´S SUSTAINABILITY 5.2 REN, being aware of its responsibility consecutive year, the partnership with SUPPORT TO on corporate citizenship, and in line with the Portuguese Society of Physics under its commitment to maintain a model the MEDEA Project, which encourages THE COMMUNITY of ethically and socially responsible high school students to develop projects management, supported once again, in on the topic of electromagnetic fields of 2011, many civil society organizations and very low frequency. public institutions, by participating in many initiatives in several domains: social, cultural, Also targeted at university students, it education, environment and sports. is highlighted the sponsorship to the Católica Top + program and to The Some of these supports have helped Lisbon MBA.

TUNES LINE -TAVIRA 1 AND 2 AND TAVIRA-ESTóI 1 AND 2 The project initiated in 2009, which includes the development and implementation of a set of compensatory and monitoring measures for specific pairs of Bonelli’s eagle nesting near that very high voltage line, was continued, defined within the respective process of Environmental Impact Assessment, for “Sections 1 and 2”. In this second phase of the project the monitoring and compensation measures already implemented and aimed at specific couples of Bonelli ‘Cepo’ and ‘Court’, shall continue, namely by overcoming constraints and knowledge gaps identified during the previous phase. The following initiatives shall be carried out by REN during this second phase, between 2009-2014: • Compensatory and monitoring measures for specific couples of bonelli’s eagle ‘Cepo’ and ‘Court’; • Recovery and development of populations of wild rabbit; • Monitoring and health control of wild rabbit populations subject to measures to promote their development; • Maintenance of a safety perimeter around the nesting site of the ‘Cepo’ couple; • Construction/strengthening of the nests of bonelli couples potentially most affected by the line; • Restoration/maintenance of the plant cover in the nesting site of the ‘Cepo’ couple. LINE SINES-PORTIMÃO 3 The project includes the development and implementation of a set of compensatory measures and specific monitoring aimed at the pair of Bonelli’s eagle labelled as “Odelouca” and which nest near that very high voltage line. For the three year period 2010-2013 the implementation of the necessary activities for the operationalization of the following compensation measures and the monitoring specific pair of Bonelli named “Odelouca” was proposed”: • Monitoring and Compensation Measures for Bonelli’s Eagles The plan of activities includes the continued monitoring of the pair “Odelouca” and sustainable measures to protect the nesting habitat in terms of reinforcing / maintaining nests and artificial platforms, and maintenance of safety protection against wildfires. • Increased food resources for the couple of Bonelli’s eagle named “Odelouca”. Recovery of wild rabbits The recovery of wild rabbit populations in the area of intervention will be followed until an appropriate level for their exploitation as a food resource by the Bonelli’s Eagle is achieved, while simultaneously allowing their hunting, with the creation of mechanisms self-sustainable in the medium / long term to ensure the maintenance of a high density of wild rabbits. • Health monitoring program for wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus) 146 REN´S SUSTAINABILITY INTERNATIONAL DOURO AND VALLEY OF THE TAVORA RIVER The initiatives developed with the implementation of compensatory measures intended to ensure the ecological recovery of bird populations (black stork, britango, Bonelli’s eagle, golden eagle, eagle owl, peregrine falcon, raven-deRed-billed) affected by predictable negative impacts of the new lines that will cross the International Douro Natural Park (DINP) and the Valley of the Tavora River, were structured according to the following components: • Description and evaluation of the baseline situation and selection of sites to be intervened upon. • Implementation of Habitat Management Compensatory Measures The ecological improvement and restoration actions that will build on the implementation of the following habitat management measures: – Measure 1: habitat management for the wild rabbit and the red partridge; – Measure 2: construction and settlement of traditional dovecots; – Measure 3: execution of ponds; – Measure 4: promotion of extensive grazing. • Plan to monitor the breeding success and the use of space by the couples that develop in the intervention area. In 2011 the implementation of compensatory measures for ecological improvement and restoration at the Natural Park of International Douro and in the Valley of the Tavora River actually began. Such measures include habitat management measures for wild rabbits and red partridges (deforestation and sowing, among other measures) that will increase the number of individuals of these species, which in turn are prey species for birds. Additionally, extensive grazing will be fostered, which will also benefit the red partridges. Likewise, the construction and settlement of dovecotsaims to increase the food available for birds. LINE MOGADOURO MACEDO DE CAVALEIROS In 2011 the following compensatory measures were implemented: Measure 1 – Habitat management to recover the populations of prey species, which was aimed at improving the living conditions of the main wild prey species for the birds under study, the wild rabbit and the red partridge, through the implementation of management measures for habitat restoration, through the installation of mosaics of crops and water points within the eagle management territory in strategic locations and away from the lines; Measure 2 – Recovery and repopulation of dovecots, in which the intention was to recover and restocktraditional dovecots to increase the population of pigeons as prey available for couples of Bonelli’s eagle and golden eagle, in strategic locations and away from lines. Measure 3 – Monitoring the couples of Bonelli’s eagle and golden eagle present in the study area, mainly focusing on verifying the breeding success and the use of space by the couples of Bonelli’s eagle and golden eagle present in the study area. 147 ANNUAL REPORT 2011 03 CORPORATE GOVERANCE A wAVE OF RENOVATION Reflection of the national investment in the field of renewable energy, the Portuguese Government has given REN, through Enondas, the concession of the infrastructure which will make the production of electricity from ocean waves possible.
