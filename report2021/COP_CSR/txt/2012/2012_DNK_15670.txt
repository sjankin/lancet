CSR HIGHLIGHTS 2011 Responsible behavior is central to TORM’s business. Due to the risks associated with shipping, we maintain high standards in terms of safety and the environment. In recent years, we have increased focus on anti-corruption and supplier dialogue on CSR. In these areas, we find industry collaboration important to create sustainable progress. Social and environmental accountability is an important part of being a preferred carrier in our industry.
