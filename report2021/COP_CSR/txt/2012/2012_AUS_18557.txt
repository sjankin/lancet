But Net Balance is not just about undertaking sustainability projects for clients. We continue to be motivated by the passion for aiming to be a catalyst, helping to anticipate, and manage change. In this regard, The Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact continues to provide valuable insights that enable us and others to understand some of the critical issues driving the sustainability agenda. I am pleased to confirm that Net Balance reaffirms its support of the ‘Ten Principles’ of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and AntiCorruption. In our first Communication on Progress (COP), we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. Sincerely yours, Terence Jeyaretnam Director P +61 3 8641 6401 E terence@netbalance.com | W netbalance.com | S netbalance Level 4, 460 Bourke Street, Melbourne VIC 3000 | Mail: GPO Box 4558, Melbourne VIC 3001 Stay connected with us: NB COP to UNGC 1 Human Rights Human Rights Principles Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Net Balance supports the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our Code of Conduct particularly addresses the human rights issues of: • Forced and compulsory labour • Child labour • Bribery and corruption • Discrimination and harassment • Freedom of association of our employees • Health and safety of our employees • Fairness and respect at the workplace • Fair recruitment Principle 2 Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses Net Balance is a consulting business and none of our activities directly or indirectly impact human rights. We also have a ‘Procurement policy’ that highlights our support for purchase of ethical goods. Our Code of Conduct which addresses a number of human rights issues as stated above ensures that we are not in breach on any human rights standards. Assessment, Policy and Goals Description of policies, public commitments and company goals on Human Rights The Net Balance Code of Conduct guides how we conduct our business and is based on our values in action. It sets the standards of conduct expected from employees, partners and contractors. At the moment Net Balance does not have any specific goals related to human rights; however we encourage diversity at all levels and support a workplace culture in which all employees can develop on merit and contribute to their full potential. In addition, our Code of Conduct highlights our support and commitment to support and respect the protection of human rights. NB COP to UNGC 2 Implementation and Measurement of outcomes Description of concrete actions to implement Human Rights policies, reduce Human Rights risks and respond to human rights violations. In in the coming year we will work towards conducting human rights due-diligence aligned with the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights on our business and client sectors to investigate and evaluate human rights risks. We will report on the progress of the duediligence system next year. We have also actively supported and propagated the work of UN Special Representative Professor John Ruggie and the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights through a number of workshops and master classes that we have conducted for our clients and our staff. In addition in 2012, through our Net Balance Foundation we developed a disclosure report examining the human rights governance, risk management and reporting quality of companies in the ASX 100. The research shows that 90% of Australia’s large companies most exposed to human rights issues may have inadequate public disclosures and responses in place to mitigate associated risks. This report was prepared in collaboration with the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and Corporate Analysis Enhanced Responsibility (CAER). NB COP to UNGC 3 Labour Labour Principles Principle 3 Businesses should uphold freedom of association & effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining We recognise our employees’ rights to choose whether or not they wish to join an association and/or union consistent with local labour laws. We recognise the right of all employees to choose to belong to a union and seek to bargain collectively. Principle 4 The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Principle 5 The effective abolition of child labour We do not use or employ forced, bonded or child labour. Net Balance requires all recruitment to be consistent with our diversity and equal opportunity requirements as part of our overall Code of Conduct. As we are based in Australia, we abide by all Australian legislation which does not support forced or compulsory labour. Principle 6 Eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Net Balance requires all recruitment to be consistent with our diversity and equal opportunity requirements as part of our overall Code of Conduct. Net Balance conducts its business with respect, fairness and courtesy. We give equal opportunity for employment to all individuals, regardless of their race, religion, colour, national origin, age, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. Our fair treatment policy applies to all phases of the employment relationship, including:  Hiring, assigning, promoting, resigning and dismissing employees.  Providing opportunities for personal and professional growth and development.  Recognising success. Net Balance has zero tolerance of discrimination and or harassment, bullying and retaliation of any type. Each year we conduct an employee engagement survey. We received positive feedback on the levels of engagement and good progress has been made on improving understanding and support of the Company's vision and values. NB COP to UNGC 4 Assessment, Policy and Goals Description of policies, public commitments and company goals on Labour rights The Net Balance Code of Conduct guides how we conduct our business and is based on our values in action. It sets our commitment to standards of conduct expected from employees, partners and contractors. We consult on a wide variety of projects and recognise the importance of a diverse and balanced team. We have not yet developed a formal Diversity Policy. Implementation and Measurement of outcomes Description of concrete actions to implement labour policies, address labour risks and respond to labour violations. Net Balance has a Code of Conduct that covers diversity, equal employment opportunities, freedom of association and collective bargain and upholds our support for labour principles. At this stage, we are not looking at developing a separate labour policy dues to the size and nature of our business. Each year we publicly report on our company demographics including gender and age in our Sustainability Report. The diagrams below explore these in more detail. NB COP to UNGC 5 Environment Environmental Principles Principle 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Net Balance accepts the need for greater climate change action and we support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Principle 8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility At Net Balance we actively try to manage our environmental footprint. We have a number of initiatives in places to help us reduce our environmental impacts. Sustainability Committee In early 2011 we established a Sustainability Committee. The Committee is appointed by the Director’s team, and aims to be comprised of staff at all levels and across all company locations. Responsibilities encompass oversight and implementation of our sustainability policies and practices – including environment, transport and procurement. The Committee is also responsible for the production our annual sustainability report. While our environmental footprint is relatively small, we believe we still have a role to play in minimising our impacts where possible. The Committee encourages and assists our employees to walk the (sustainability) talk. By changing small actions at work, and carefully choosing new equipment when it is required, our staff can help ensure our company treads even more lightly on the Earth. Principle 9 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies At Net Balance we focus on this principle through the Net Balance Foundation. Our Foundation makes publicly available open source research, which enables us and others to understand some of the critical issues driving the sustainability agenda. Our research programs and publications seek to develop insight into the evolving corporate sustainability field. We strive to inform business and government about ground breaking and contemporary sustainability related issues and dilemmas, and disentangle sustainability for industry, government and community. We partner with industry leading research bodies to develop in depth and relevant research reports. NB COP to UNGC 6 Assessment, Policy and Goals Description of the relevance of environmental protection for the company (i.e. environmental risks and opportunities) Description of policies, public commitments and company goals on environmental protection Net Balance has a number of policies and procedures in place to manage our actions that can cause or environmental impacts. Environment Policy Our Environment Policy aims to reduce our negative environmental impacts. The policy is aligned to the values we try to instil in our clients. The policy ensures that we identify and manage our environmental risks and opportunities. It outlines behaviours in relation to waste, energy use, emissions avoidance, etc. Sustainable Transport Policy We aim to reduce travel wherever practical. When travel is necessary, our policy outlines a transport hierarchy that staff are encouraged to adopt. Sustainable Procurement Our Sustainable Procurement Policy applies to the purchase of goods and services required in the operation of our offices. The policy enables us to establish processes to identify and understand what the negative impacts associated with our purchasing are, and how to reduce them. Where possible we pursue the following:  Less is more (avoid unnecessary purchasing)  Minimise impacts (energy, water, emissions, ethics)  Identify opportunities to find innovative approaches that reduce our supply chain impact  Procure from those who share our values, and  Offset where possible. Implementation and Measurement of outcomes Description of concrete actions to implement environmental policies, address environmental risks and respond to environmental incidents Description of how the company monitors and evaluates environmental performance Each year Net Balance produces a sustainability report that highlights our environmental performance in areas of energy, waste, water and emissions. A continued focus on minimising our environmental footprint has yielded some excellent results, such as a reduction of 19 per cent in energy consumption and 32 per cent in greenhouse gas NB COP to UNGC 7 emissions per FTE as compared to last year. Whilst we experienced a 58 per cent increase in FTEs from 2009 to 2011, there was only a 19 per cent increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the total emissions per FTE dropped by 30 per cent over this three-year period (a drop of 32 per cent on the 2010 emission level). In 2011, we also saw a decrease in waste to landfill of more than 50 per cent, per FTE since 2010. We have reduced emissions associated with air travel by 30 per cent and 65 per cent fewer flights were taken between Melbourne and Sydney in 2011, compared to 2010. We believe this is due to the increased capacity in our Sydney office and more local servicing of our New South Wales clients. We aim to continue to explore ways to reduce emissions associated with travel. For 2011, we set ourselves 17 sustainability targets aligned with the results of our materiality analysis in 2010. The focus areas for these targets were Industry leadership, Strategic planning, People & culture, Internal sustainability, Corporate governance and Financial management. Only nine of these targets were fully achieved. Six were partially achieved and on track to be completed in 2012. Of the two targets that were not achieved, the first was ‘Have over 60% of our 2010 clients return in 2011’. We were only 6 per cent below this target, at 54 per cent, and this can be viewed as a good result given the global financial pressures during this period. It is also noteworthy that we experienced an increase of 40 per cent in client numbers in 2011. For additional information on our environmental performance, see our Sustainability Report which will be available on our website at ww.netbalance.com.au towards the end of the year. Other key achievements 2011 were  We celebrated ride to work day and have developed a new sustainable transport policy  We developed an office environment policy and became members of Green Collect  We developed a new procurement policy and celebrated fair trade fortnights with healthy, ethically sourced staff breakfasts In 2012 the Committee will establish formal terms of reference; identify a sustainability theme for each month to focus our efforts; expand its remit to cover social as well as environment sustainability; and have a representative member from each of our offices. NB COP to UNGC 8 Anti-Corruption Anti-Corruption Principles Principle 10 Businesses should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery At Net Balance we conduct business in an open and transparent manner. We are committed, in principle and in practice, to maximum transparency, consistent with good governance and commercial confidentiality. We have zero tolerance for corruption, bribery and extortion and do not directly or indirectly participate in party politics or make payments to political parties or individual politicians. Assessment, Policy and Goals Description of the relevance of anti-corruption for the company (i.e. anti-corruption riskassessment) Description of policies, public commitments and company goals on anti-corruption Our Code of Conduct sets our position on the issues of corrupt conduct including the offering of bribes to anyone. This applies to all our employees across all our offices, our clients, our business partners and our suppliers. Implementation and Measurement of outcomes Description of how the company monitors and evaluates anti-corruption performance We do not have a specific anti-corruption policy. However, we do manage these risks as part of our Code of Conduct. NB COP to UNGC 9
