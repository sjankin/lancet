Now, focus is on the five market segments of paints and coatings, plastic materials, feed and food, formalin technology and fuels markets. PAINTS & COATINGS As a key solution supplier for the global paints and coatings market, Perstorp´s offer covers everything from critical building blocks to high value specialties. For Perstorp´s future growth, focus is specifically on a number of high-growth sub-segments: water-borne polyurethane dispersions, UV curing resins PAINTS & and resins for low solvent coatings systems and the rapidly COATINGS expanding uses to coat trains, aeroplanes and plastic parts. Working in partnership with participants throughout the entire value chain, Perstorp enables coatings systems with low environmental impact and high performance to meet customer, end-user and regulatory demands. PLASTIC MATERIALS PLASTIC MATERIALS Plastic materials is a diverse segment covering Perstorp´s products for many types of plastics and composites. The products for foams and elastomers enhance the performance of many everyday items such as furniture, automotives and shoes providing better comfort, esthetics and durability. Perstorp´s plastic additives and plasticizers enhance and customize the properties of plastic end products, for example to make hard materials softer, soft materials more stable and brittle materials more durable. Perstorp is well positioned in this segment with strong concepts in environmentally preferred solutions and in safety driven end usages.

Perstorp´s uniqueness stems from having such complex, developed production trees; this complexity leads to competitive advantages regarding cost, flexibility and new product development. FEED & FOOD FEED & FOOD Improving nutrient content, inhibiting mould growth, antibacterial treatment and aiding digestion are just a few of the benefits of the feed additives, ensilage agents and preservatives that Perstorp manufactures from formic acid and propionic acid. Together they boost the productivity and quality of meat, milk and egg production – since long in Europe but now also in emerging markets. FORMALIN TECHNOLOGY & CATALYSTS FORMALIN TECHNOLOGY & CATALYSTS Perstorp’s world-leading Formox business supports customers with a unique long-term partnership model, covering the design and supply of formalin plants, the development and supply of catalysts and the offer of active technical support for all Formox customers. This enables cost-efficient production of high-strength formalin with high consistency, for significant advantages in all downstream applications, including boards and insulation for the construction industry, plastic and foam components for the automotive industry and stretch fibers for the textile industry. FUELS FUELS Legislation which is favoring biofuels, as well as the in­ creasing interest among customers, provides good growth opportunities for Perstorp’s biodiesel (RME). Perstorp is the largest producer of RME in Scandinavia producing high quality RME from rapeseed oil, for blending with up to 7% with fossil diesel and for use as a 100% renewable fuel for diesel driven vehicles. Perstorp also produces superior quality grades of RME, for example the Verdis PolarisTM is suitable for blending with fossil diesel in the Nordic climate. Perstorp also manufactures 2-ethylhexanol, used in fuel additives to help cleaner combustion and lower particle emissions.

The world is changing rapidly right now, and a changing world figures in 2011. The earthquake that hit Japan in March was means great opportunities for anyone who is prepared.

Despite a reduction in economic activity at the end of the year, consumers, industrial people – and Perstorp – remain optimistic. Huge investments are planned by government and local players in infrastructure and oil exploration, and the growth of the automotive industry and consumers’ increasing environmental awareness also continue to present lucrative business opportunities. The construction industry is also expanding again, due to lower interest rates. The outlook for 2012 is positive. Perstorp predicts sales to grow 10-12%, which is equivalent to 2-3 times GDP.

For the past few years, Perstorp's focus has been on Asia and, lately, South & Latin America – two important growth markets. 13 perstorp 2011 Sustainability – a matter of course Sustainability is a concept that pervades through everything Perstorp does. It is found in the mission, the vision, the values – and the very many large and small decisions people take every day. When talking about sustainability in business, we are often talking about environ­ mental work. In Perstorp's case, an important part of the business concept is to produce sustainable products, to increase use of renewable resources, and to develop as Sustainable solutions effective and environmentally friendly processes as possible. through innovative However, the sustainability concept is larger than this. It is founded on three chemicals important aspects – environment, society and economy. It's about taking care of the Perstorp's vision is to contribute to environment, of society around it, and the people employed – without neglecting the economic objectives. a better, more sustainable world through innovative chemical soluNew standards for social responsibility tions. We know that everything In 2011 Perstorp began the process of implementing ISO 26000, a guiding standard we do and how we do it has a based on social responsibility. At the moment, a preliminary study is underway to in­ direct impact on our planet. In vestigate which parts of the voluntary standards are important to Perstorp, and where honoring our commitment to susnew procedures and working methods are needed to ensure that the guidelines can tainability, Perstorp combines the actually be followed. power and creativity of science to In addition to the overall basic principle of socially responsible behavior, within deliver cutting-edge solutions that ISO 26000 there are seven specific core areas to work on, namely: satisfy customer needs, answer to Æ Organizational governance society's environmental demands Æ Human rights and offer continuous economic success. Æ Labour practices Æ The environment Æ Fair operating practices Æ Consumer issues Æ Community involvement and development Perstorp's ecological footprint One of Perstorp's stated goals is to maintain its competitive edge within sustainable products and systems. In 2011, Perstorp undertook extensive efforts to work out the carbon footprint (CFP) of the largest products – from cradle to grave. The values attached to the products – given as a number of kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents – are very low compared to other products on the market, and provide a useful basis when customers calculate their products' environmental impact. In order to further facilitate this, Perstorp also developed a tool that allows customers to calculate the impact of different modes of transport from Perstorp production sites to the customer. The methods Perstorp uses for Life Cycle Analyses follow the standards ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, and the standard for a product’s carbon footprint follow the standard ISO 14067. Each product's value is unique, specific to the production unit, and has an expiration date. For the value to be valid, it has to be certified by an external party. Perstorp has chosen to work with the SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden and also Det Norske Veritas. 14 ANNUAL & SOCIAL RESPONSIBILIT Y REPORT A full lifecycle analysis has also been conducted for five major products. It takes into account, in addition to the greenhouse We want to create a more sustainable effect, the acidification of forests and streams. society using our innovative chemistry, For Voxtar™, Perstorp's renewable Penta, while freeing us from dependence on oil. archaeological dating has also been con­ ducted, to show that its raw materials are completely renewable. Renewable raw materials An important part of sustainability is about a long-term move away from oil dependence, and finding new sustainable solutions in terms of both raw materials and processes. For Perstorp, Voxtar™ is a good example of a successful replacement of fossil raw materials with renewable ones in the existing process, without having to make major infrastructure changes. Perstorp is participating in a number of consortia working to develop effective methods of industrial biotechnology. “Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” The Bruntland Commission of the United Nations, March 20, 1987 15 perstorp 2011 Perstorp Performance System paying off In 2009, Perstorp started a program aimed at adopting a hands on way of achieving continuous improvements at its site operations. The vision for the program is to implement this methodology throughout the Group. Continuous improvements in operations The Perstorp Performance System – PPS – was launched at the Group´s two Swedish production sites in 2009. At the same time, plans were put in place for implementing the program at all Perstorp production units over a five-year period. In 2011, the results achieved at the four sites currently using PPS proved so impressive that a formal decision to drastically expand the program and include all functions throughout the organization was taken. Focused on safety PPS is not entirely different from other well-known performance systems such as Lean Manufacturing or Six Sigma. However, since safety is such a major factor at every Perstorp production site, safety serves as the very foundation for the entire PPS program. Standing on this foundation are nine pillars representing key aspects operations where Perstorp aims to achieve continuous improvements intended to result in not only improved performance, but also in improved safety. By promoting the idea of reducing defects, break­­ downs, waste, etc. to as close to zero as possible, the PPS approach leads to reduced costs, increased customer satisfaction and a cleaner, safer and more satisfying working environment. It involves day-to-day management systematically identifying the root causes of issues that affect performance, as a way to achieve and sustain operational excellence. Better results than expected While PPS provides the necessary methodology and tools, it is the on-site staff who determine the outcome. Thanks to the enthusiasm and determination of every­ one involved from all levels, PPS has produced very positive results with scores exceeding targets at all four Melany Dieterle Manager Logistics Administration sites where the program is now in use. Other indications that significant improvements are being made have been seen in KPIs used to monitor quality, customer satisfaction and workplace safety. For example, the CCR (Customer Complaint Rate) dropped from 12.95 complaints per 1,000 deliveries in 2010 to 10.6 in 2011 – an improvement of 18%.

And the LTAR (Lost Time Accident Rate) dropped by 19% in PPS sites today 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of a strong focus on safety as part of PPS. Perstorp and Stenungsund, both in Sweden, since 2009. A roadmap for going much further According to its original plans, Perstorp will launch PPS at its production sites in Gent Bruchhausen in Germany and Toledo and Warrington in 2012, and in Singapore, Castellanza and Waspik in 2013. in the US since end of 2010. More importantly, however, Perstorp’s Board of Directors approved a proposal at the end of 2011 to broaden the scope of PPS to extend far beyond site operations. This decision is highly significant as it calls for the PPS methodology and toolbox to be adapted Planned PPS launches for use in all other functions within the organization including sales, business, finance, 2012: Gent in Belgium and innovation and purchasing. Warrington in the U.K. A roadmap to steer the long-term project has already been drawn up and includes benchmarking the new areas, recruiting new PPS staff with experience from Lean 2013: Singapore, Castellanza in Italy Manufacturing or similar performance systems, training people within the organization and Waspik in the Netherlands. to be PPS practitioners as well as creating a whole new set of tools for each function. The new vision is for PPS to provide a harmonized way of working in all aspects of the company and to shape a new, harmonized company culture across all boundaries. 17 CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS ACIDS PIA

Increasing numbers & growing concerns MORE PERSTORP PRODUCTS WITHIN drive market THE PLASTIC MATERIALS SEGMENT With plastics penetrating such a wide variety of industries and Penta applications, the biggest market driver overall is greater demand Di-Penta due to population growth, generally in combination with rising 2-EHA living standards. In the end, more people with the means to buy PIA more cars, more packaged food and more consumer goods means more plastics. Greater wealth also leads to increased consumption of high-end goods, which require specialty chemicals such as caprolactones to ensure premium quality of the end product. Of course, these factors in turn drive the demand for initiatives that ensure responsible use of the earth’s resources, protection of the environment and consumer safety. The European chemical regulation, REACH, is one such example, which pushes for the phasing out of low molecular weight phthalates in 25 perstorp 2011 Europe. This also affects toymakers and other manufacturers elsewhere, whose goods are exported to the European market. ¡ SUB-SEGMENTS Another example is the implementation of increasingly rigorous fire regulations in some markets that places higher demands on Perstorp has identified a number of strategic subthe use and characteristics of flame-retardant plastics. segments within the market segment of plastic materials: PET Plasticizers – making the switch from DEHP Polymer additives One of the most widely felt trends today is the phasing out of Polyurethane foam DOP.

Other alternatives to DEHP for additional they are to be used. applications are being developed, including a 100% phthalatefree plasticizer currently undergoing market tests aimed at meeting future demands for non-phthalate plasticizers. This product will give customers a versatile and robust alternative and make Perstorp an even more important supplier. Elastomers – where caprolactones shine Customers working with cast elastomers, reaction injection molding and thermoplastic polyurethanes appreciate Perstorp’s high quality polyols, chain extenders and cross linkers. Many are also discovering the exceptional qualities of caprolactone polyols made from Perstorp’s Capa™ monomer. Capa™ polyols are highly versatile and deliver top performance in applications requiring materials that are both durable and elastic, e.g. printer rollers, mining screens, bumpers, advanced sports shoes, etc. Durability, UV resistance, low viscosity, fast cycle times as well as excellent flexibility and consistency, are among the many benefits that Capa™ provides. Perstorp is the world’s largest producer of caprolactones and, after opening a second production stream in 2011, the company can actively increase penetration in the highly attractive elastomers sub-segment. Plastic additives – removing lead & halogen Plastic additives is an area where recent developments from Perstorp have caught the attention of lots of existing and potential customers. Interest in two additives launched at the end of 2010, Holtac™ and Charmor™ PP100, grew immensely in 2011. Holtac™ is a stabilizer in calcium zinc heat stabilizer systems for PVC that enables lead-based stabilizers to be replaced without compromising performance. European manufacturers of stabilizers have agreed to completely phase out lead by 2015, and more and more manufacturers around the world are following their initiative. 26 ANNUAL & SOCIAL RESPONSIBILIT Y REPORT Charmor™ PP100 was developed to help manufacturers to meet market demands for better environmental profile flameretardant systems for plastics requested by major producers of The plastic materials segment continued consumer products in the electrical, electronic and transport its good overall growth rate in 2011, sectors.

Environmental & working environment costs In 2011, the Group's environmental and working environment-related costs amounted to SEK 191 (151.2) million, corresponding to 1 (1.3)% of Group sales. Costs for waste disposal amounted to SEK 83.1 (54) million. During the year, the Group spent approximately SEK 41.8 (36.2) million on wastewater treatment and around SEK 56.4 (55.5) million on environmental administration. These administrative costs include costs for environmental staff, maintenance of environmental management systems and external consultancy. Environmental liabilities Perstorp’s economic reporting is based on the “going concern” principle, which is reflected in how environmental liabilities are reported. The Group follows verdicts handed down by the authorities while acting proactively to prevent environmental impacts and reactively in the event of an environmental disturbance. Investments in environment, health & safety Total investments in the environment, health and safety amounted to SEK 103 million in 2011 (115.3). This amounts to 17.4 (14.3)% of the Group's total investments. The most extensive investments during the year have been the installation of new flue gas cleaning at the Perstorp site's steam power plant, expanded wastewater at the plant in Stenungsund and process changes at the site in Pont-de-Claix to reduce wastewater pollution.

Exceptional write down of certain assets related primarily to the Coating Additives business group is included. Earnings before tax amounted to SEK –1,386 m (-980). Aside from the negative impact on EBIT from lower earnings and higher levels of depreciation, there is an improvement due to a reduction in interest expenses following lower effective interest rates. In addition, an amount of SEK 1 billion of the parent com­pany’s loan was converted into equity at the end of the second quarter last year, which we are now seeing the full effect of. The net loss was SEK –1,713 m (–956). Also related to the asset impairments, a larger amount of deferred tax assets were written down in the period. In addition, a more restrictive approach continues to be applied to the build-up of further loss deductions. 56 ANNUAL & SOCIAL RESPONSIBILIT Y REPORT 57 perstorp 2011 Financial position Working capital amounted to SEK 1,481 m at year end compared to SEK 1,526 m at the end of 2010. There was a decrease during the last quarter coming from a high level at the end of the third quarter, driven primarily by a reduction in accounts receivables and lower levels of inventory. This positive operating cash flow coupled with a conversion of the parent company loan into equity of SEK 1.3 billion led to a decrease in net borrowings which amounted to SEK 11.2 billion at year end. Currency translation from the strengthening of the Swedish krona, as most net borrowings are in Euros and US dollars, also contributed to the reduction versus last year. Shareholders’ equity at the end of the year was SEK 978 m. Despite the conversion of a portion of the parent company loan, the equity was SEK 344 m less compared to the start of the year, reflecting the impact from the negative change in comprehensive result for the period. 58 ANNUAL & SOCIAL RESPONSIBILIT Y REPORT balance sheet SEK m Note Dec. 31, 2011 Dec. 31, 2010 ASSETS Fixed assets Tangible fixed assets 6 4,349 6,305 Intangible fixed assets 7 6,173 6,744 Financial fixed assets Deferred tax assets 23 414 793 Participations in associated companies 13 44 1 Other, minor holdings in companies – 64 Long-term receivable, associated companies – 17 Direct pension, endowment insurance 22 81 73 Other interest-bearing, long-term receivables 16, 21 1 2 Other interest-free, long-term receivables 16 34 31 Total financial fixed assets 574 981 Total fixed assets 11,096 14,030 Current assets Inventories 20 1,185 1,511 Accounts receivable 18 1,409 2,124 Operating receivables, associated companies 35 41 Tax receivables 42 34 Other operating receivables 18 199 388 Other current financial receivables 21 9 8 Total 2,879 4,106 Current investment – 3 Cash & cash equivalents 19, 21 453 395 Assets held for sale 32 2,787 – Total current assets 6,119 4,504 Total assets 17,215 18,534 SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY & LIABILITIES Shareholders’ equity Share capital (1,000 shares, par value of SEK 100 each) 0 0 Other capital contributions 5,652 4,276 Reserves –351 –341 Retained earnings –2,633 –1,674 Net earnings/loss for the year –1,714 –959 Sum 954 1,302 Non controlling interests 15 24 20 Total equity 978 1,322 Long-term liabilities Deferred tax liabilities 23 1,381 1,505 Direct pension 22 83 74 Pension liability, others 21, 22 376 379 Long-term liabilities, Parent Company 21 870 2,018 Long-term interest-bearing liabilities 1) 21 9,335 9,415 Other liabilities, provisions 24 112 88 Total long-term liabilities 12,157 13,479 Current liabilities Accounts payable 25 836 1,390 Tax liabilities 18 22 Other operating liabilities 25 951 1,147 Accrued interest expense 559 343 Other financial liabilities 21 942 831 Liabilities held for sale 32 774 – Total current liabilities 4,080 3,733 Total shareholders´ equity & liabilities 17,215 18,534 Contingent liabilities 27 179 180 Assets pledged 28 13,838 12,361 1) The amount includes expenses for loan financing in connection with Perstorp Holding AB’s acquisition of sub-groups in Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands.

The primary purpose of currency swap contracts of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. is to hedge the treasury’s currency risk exposure in different currencies. The contracts have therefore been classified in different portfolios depending on which category of currency exposure will be hedged. In general, the categories cover the treasury’s intra-Group borrowings and loans in different currencies with determined maturities as well as the daily borrowings and loans in currency accounts at various banks. The maturities vary, up to three months. Currency accounts are hedged with one-month maturities. 71 perstorp 2011 NOTE 3.

Reported values may have another actual outcome if other assumptions are made or circumstances change. The following particular areas can be distinguished where estimates and judgments are of importance to the amounts entered in the accounts and differences can have a significant effect on the Group’s earnings and financial position. Impairment testing of goodwill and trademarks: In accordance with the accounting principle described in point 2.10, impairment testing is currently performed annually through analysis of individual assets’/cash-generating units’ recovery value. A number of important estimates are made during this analysis, see note 7. Valuation of tax-loss carry-forwards: The valuation of tax-loss carry-forwards is based on an assessment that it will be possible to utilize these carry-forwards in the foreseeable future. Assessments are based on, among other matters, an assumption about future business opportunities and earnings capability. The outcome is often dependent on tax rules that are current or likely to come into effect. Tax-loss carry-forwards have been assigned values in, primarily, the Group’s companies in Singapore, Sweden and the UK. For booked values see Note 23. Pension benefits: The current value of the Group’s future pension commitments regarding defined-benefit pension plans is based on a number of assumptions in connection with the actuarial estimate. Changes in these assumptions may affect the reported value of the pension commitment. For further details, see chapter 2.12 and note 22. Perstorp’s financial accounts are based on the going-concern principle, which is also reflected in how any environmental liabilities are assessed. At the start of 2012 negotiations with the company’s senior lenders were concluded concerning a two-year extension of the company’s existing senior credits, see note 21. The Group’s ongoing activities are also reflected in how any possible environmental damage is assessed. The Group complies with decisions by public authorities and conducts measures both proactively to prevent environmental impact and reactively in the event that environmental disturbances arise.

Accordingly, the actual period of ﬁxed interest is 159 days. At the end of 2011, market valuation of the interest rate hedging contracts had a negative impact of SEK 4 (28) m after tax on the Group’s shareholders’ equity. In addition to these loans, loans from the Parent Company in Luxembourg amount to SEK 870 m, which have a duration of up to 10 years, but which are extended automatically during up to ﬁve periods assuming that none of the parties concerned terminate the agreement. The interest rate amounts to 10%. 80 ANNUAL & SOCIAL RESPONSIBILIT Y REPORT At the end of 2011 there was positive exposure in SEK concerning net assets per currency. This is because a large part of the intangible assets that existed when PAI partners acquired Perstorp was in SEK and in GBP due to the acquisition of the caprolactones business not being financed through loans in GBP, see below. Exposure of net assets in EUR and USD are negative because the Group has raised loans in both those currencies to a greater extent than that which corresponds to assets. D.

Market valuation of financial instruments The Group arranges its loans on market terms. For external loans, interest terms are based on underlying official market rates plus an interest margin. When these loans are not subject to organized trading, an objective market assessment is not possible. The fair value of financial instruments traded on active markets is based on listed market prices on the closing date. Assessment techniques, such as calculation of discounted cash flows, are used to establish fair value for remaining financial instruments. The fair value of interest swaps is calculated as the present value of assessed future cash flows. The fair value of electricity hedge contracts are established through the use of listed rates for electricity contracts on the closing date. The reported value, after provisions, of accounts receivable and accounts payable are judged to correspond to fair value, as these items are short term. 81 perstorp 2011 NOTE 22. PENSION OBLIGATIONS & COSTS The Group has both defined-contribution and defined-benefit pension plans. During the year costs for these plans had an accumulative effect on earnings of SEK 206 (202) m, of which SEK 173 (169) m is attributable to defined-contribution plans and SEK 33 (33) m to defined-benefit plans. Pension costs attributable to restructuring of SEK 11 (3) m are included in the accumulated amount. The distribution of costs in the income statement are as follows: A. Pension costs the income statement SEK m 2011 2010 Cost of sold goods 93 97 Sales and marketing overheads 36 34 Administrative costs 38 41 Research and development costs 13 12 Non comparable items 11 3 Net financial items 15 15 Total 1) 206 202 1) 11 13 Of which discontinued operations Defined-contribution pension plans There are deﬁned-contribution pension plans in most of the countries in which the Group is active. In the Swedish units, these mainly consist of state pension contributions and negotiated pensions for blue-collar workers. In the United States, such plans are called 401K and in Germany they are called Staatliche Rente and Pensionskasse, etc. The costs that are capitalized during the year attributable to defined-contribution pensions plans can be classified as follows: B. Pension costs, defined contribution plans SEK m 2011 2010 State pension plans 61 62 Other defined-contribution pension plans 64 56 ITP, insured through Alecta 48 51 Total, pension costs, defined-contribution plans 1) 173 169 1) 1 1 Of which discontinued operations Most of the Group’s Swedish companies have secured their obligations for old-age and family pensions via pension insurance with Alecta. In accordance with a statement by the Swedish Financial Accounting Standards Council, UFR3, this is a deﬁned-beneﬁt plan that covers several employers. For the 2011 and 2010 financial years the Group did not have access to information that enabled it to report this plan as a defined-benefit pension plan, so it is therefore reported as a defined-contribution pension plan. The surplus at Alecta may be divided between the plan provider or the insured. At year-end 2011, Alecta’s surplus in the form of its collective funding ratio amounted to 113 (146)%. The collective funding ratio equals the market value of Alecta’s assets, in percentage of the insurance obligations as computed in accordance with Alecta’s actuarial calculation assumptions; this does not comply with IAS 19. Deﬁned-beneﬁt pension plans There are deﬁned-beneﬁt pension plans in most of the companies and countries in which the Group is active. The main provisions for deﬁned-beneﬁt pension plans pertain to the Pension Registration Institute (PRI), Indemnités de Fin de Carriére (IFC) (France), Pensionszulage (Germany), pension plans for employees in certain currently divested units and specific pension insurance plans for senior executives in various countries. In the table below, the deﬁned-beneﬁt pension obligations are speciﬁed, divided into funded and unfunded pension plans. C.

The expected return is assumed to be 9.0 (9.0)% and 4.6 (5.0)% respectively, which is based on historic returns. The actual return on plan assets in 2011 was SEK –4 (29) m. In addition to the above, so-called direct pensions are included under assets and liabilities at SEK 83 (74) m. The asset is capital insurance, with assets and liabilities reported separately at gross amounts. Healthcare insurance is not included in pension commitments.

According to a special undertaking, the employment contract can be terminated by both the company and the President as of age 60. The period of employment-termination notice is one year if notice is served by the company and six months if it is served by the President. If the company terminates the President’s employment, the President will also receive severance pay corresponding to 12 monthly salaries. If organizational changes or other changes initiated by the owners results in signiﬁcant limitations on the President’s responsibility or authority, the President is entitled under certain circumstances to terminate his employment and be subject to the same employment termination terms as those that would have applied if the company had terminated his employment. Other members of Group Management are covered by an agreement regarding pension insurance schemes, the aim of which is to enable the executives concerned to retire at age 60.

Corp. Reg. No. 556667-4205. Report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of Perstorp Holding AB for the year 2011. The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included in the printed version of this document on pages 54–91. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the annual accounts and consolidated accounts The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards , as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors and the Managing Director determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor’s responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these annual accounts and consolidated accounts based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s preparation and fair presentation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinions In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 31 December 2011 and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act, and the consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts 92 ANNUAL & SOCIAL RESPONSIBILIT Y REPORT Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of 31 December 2011 and of their financial performance and cash flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We therefore recommend that the annual meeting of shareholders adopt the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the group. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have examined the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss and the administration of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director of Perstorp Holding AB for the year 2011. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company’s profit or loss, and the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for administration under the Companies Act. Auditor’s responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion with reasonable assurance on the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss and on the administration based on our audit. We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors’ proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss, we examined whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act. As a basis for our opinion concerning discharge from liability, in addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we examined significant decisions, actions taken and circumstances of the company in order to determine whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director is liable to the company. We also examined whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director has, in any other way, acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Malmö, June 29, 2012 PricewaterhouseCoopers AB Opinions Michael Bengtsson We recommend to the annual meeting of shareholders that the profit be appropriated in accordance Authorized Public Accountant Lead auditor with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Mats Åkerlund Directors and the Managing Director be discharged from liability for the financial year.
