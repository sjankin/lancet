Progress Report 2011 The LEGO Group Progress Report 2011 The LEGO Group Welcome to Progress Report 2011 This Progress Report 2011 and the Annual Report 2011 constitute the reporting commitments of the LEGO Group in 2011. The purpose of the Progress Report 2011 is to provide our stakeholders with a fair and balanced picture of our sustainability efforts in 2011. The report provides an overview of our activities, practices, goals and results. The Progress Report 2011 also serves as our annual communication on progress in sustainability, as required by the United Nations Global Compact. The report is the statutory statement on Corporate Social Responsibility according to section 99a of the Danish Financial Statements Act. The report is developed in accordance with the main reporting principles of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). And we are inspired by the voluntary standard AA1000 Accountability Principles drawn up by the Institute of Social and Ethical Accountability (AccountAbility). The basis of the report, the scope, and the materiality determination are all based on a dialogue with main stakeholders about issues that are material to them. For the 2011 report, we have applied the same model as we have used during the last three years for selecting sustainability content.

The LEGO Learning Institute is part of the LEGO Group and supports this mission by conducting research on how children can express creativity through systems of play and learning. The ambition is to bring knowledge and insight to new audiences, while at the same time generating helpful feedback to the people who design and build our play experiences. Over the years a profound understanding of how children learn and play has been accumulated. In 2011 the LEGO Learning Institute researched the At this workshop, participants studied the Future of Learning with leading experts in play, learnrelationship between play and brain activity. ing and children’s cognitive development.

In a project on Private Speech and Play, supported by the LEGO Foundation, a new study has initiated a series of experiments to evaluate how open-ended play stimulates children’s ‘private speech’. This research describes the relationship between what children are doing with their hands through play, and what they are thinking about when playing. This indication of ‘children speaking out loud’ when playing by themselves, signifies a the start of a process of self-regulation, which is important for cognitive development, school readiness and the general ability of children to manage their emotions and social behaviour, explains Bo Stjerne Thomsen, Senior Research Manager LEGO Learning Institute.

All LEGO play materials comply with the European and the US toy regulations. All play materials must as a minimum comply with all toy standards, national as well as international. Our ISO 9001 certified quality management system forms the basis for quality control and continuous monitoring. The system ensures quality through random sampling, including counting elements, building models and assessing moulding More than 800 school children took part quality.

We chose to join FSC because of the high level of trust it has internationally. In 2011 the LEGO Group was criticized by Greenpeace for using mixed tropical hardwood from a supplier in Indonesia. According to Greenpeace, mixed tropical hardwoods were found in one LEGO product, a book produced under licence by one of our licensing partners. We entered into a dialogue with Greenpeace and further developed our three-step plan: first to reduce Changing employee behaviour is an the impact of our packaging on the world’s forests important part of reducing waste. already put forward in our Progress Report 2010; second, to maximize the use of recycled packaging material; and third, to also ensure that all fibre, including Read more about the environment at any virgin fibre used, comes from FSC sources. http://aboutus.LEGO.com/sustainability point of view Greenpeace One of the world’s most bio-diverse habitats, the Indonesian tropical rain forest, is being pulped and turned into paper packaging. Driving this destruction is Asian Pulp and Paper (APP). Greenpeace’s investigation found tropical APP fibre in packaging from the LEGO Group. The LEGO Group reacted quickly. It had some clear advantages compared to the other companies. Firstly, it was already thinking in terms of reducing its paper use, to increase share of recycled and to only use certified virgin fibre. Secondly, because it makes most of its products in its own factories, it could quickly confirm that the use of rainforest fibre had been confined to license products. This direct ownership allowed the company to enact its new paper policy, while other toy companies took months investigating the required change.

The Mexican Green Team’s mission is to find ways to reduce energy consumption. During 2011 the team began by installing internal electricity meters. The meters provide the team with a detailed overview of where the factory needs to focus to reduce energy consumption. The collection of data from 2011 will be used for a new plan for energy reduction in 2012. Mexican employees, unused to the idea of reducing energy, weren’t sure at first why they needed to focus on energy consumption and many of them were not completely sure what to do. To engage his colleagues better the leader of the Green Team, Jesus Ramirez, arranged weekly meetings, each with a new topic, as well as training sessions. – The weekly meetings, information, and training have truly made a positive impact on my colleagues, because they now know exactly what targets we are reaching for and most importantly why! Now we are all committed to reducing energy and we get positive feedback from everyone, explains Jesus Ramirez. Jesus Ramirez, Leader of the Green-Team, Mexico 25 Employees In 2011 we continued our work towards our 2015 target to be among the top ten companies in the world for employee safety. We also worked to improve the well-being, job satisfaction and development of existing employees, focussing on empowerment and collaboration and we worked to integrate new employees.

Hands on Technologies is a distributor for LEGO Education products. The problem was that many less privileged children from townships had never seen LEGO® bricks before and did not know how to use them. – We have been able to constantly improve the learning with LEGO Charity boxes, e.g. by developing instruction material for teachers. The children are now able to build their future. We gave them 101 activities they can do with the LEGO bricks and general training, says Brent Hutchenson, MD Hands on Technologies and adds: – We see that when the children are playing with LEGO bricks they change their attitude and they have a desire to learn new things. Brent Hutchenson, MD Hands on Technologies, South Africa 34 The LEGO Group will continue to raise the bar to create the best possible products and experiences for our consumers.

The goal is to make the LEGO presence felt in the region and the projects focus on supporting and improving children’s lives, creativity and development as well as improving their leisure time and making hospital stays more bearable and enjoyable. Amongst this year’s projects are providing LEGO® bricks for hospitalized children; building better access to the grammar school in Kladno to allow disabled children in wheelchairs to attend classes; and furnishing the foster home in Ledce – including help to build a new PC room for the children with active participation of local LEGO employees. – Helping people, especially children, is the most beautiful of all work. There is no better reward than a child’s smile. It is easy to just donate money, but there’s no motivation.
