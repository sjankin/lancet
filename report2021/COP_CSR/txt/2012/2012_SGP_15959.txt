Immediate targets for this include: External Focus Resource Conservation – We recognise that our locations provide us with the opportunity to share with local communities, especially those in more rural locations, the importance and impacts of conserving resources.

Greening Communities – While we have planted 147,111 trees exceeding our ﬁve-year target of 136,000 trees, we look forward to planting even more trees while connecting with even more communities through the planting efforts.

Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2011 27 SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE We strongly believe our actions and inactions today significantly impact the future of our children and grandchildren. We share a responsibility to not only safeguard but also to enhance both our human and natural environments. We believe good businesses are also businesses who do good, and we invite you to join us in the ongoing journey in pursuit of sustainability. Banyan Tree Global Foundation Structure With the formation of Banyan Tree Global Foundation in 2009, the governance of the Banyan Tree’s Sustainability and CSR efforts was formalised under the Singapore-based Board of Directors for Banyan Tree Global Foundation including Chairperson Ms Claire Chiang, Co-Chairperson Mr Ariel Vera, and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer Mr Eddy See, and managed by Coordinating Director Mr Michael Kwee. Banyan Tree’s two full-time Group CSR Directors then jointly oversee the Sustainability/CSR teams onsite at each property. While not all resorts have full-time positions addressing Sustainability and CSR, all resorts do have a CSR Champion onsite who is the key contact point for sustainability. In some cases the CSR Champion is the resort’s General Manager, while in other cases it is either a full-time dedicated resource or it is a team member empowered by the resort’s General Manager. CSR General Committee First established in 2004, the Banyan Tree CSR General Committee is made up of all General Managers from each resort and key management associates of each resort, including the resort’s CSR Champion. In 2008, we formalised an onsite CSR Committee for each resort, coordinated by the respective CSR Champion in order to integrate all the departments at each property. This CSR General Committee functions as the network to share best practices and experiences while working towards fulﬁlling the CSR Strategy Committee’s and Banyan Tree Global Foundation Board’s directives.
