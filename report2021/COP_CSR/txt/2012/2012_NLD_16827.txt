Communication on Progress 2011 1.1 Introduction MDF Training & Consultancy (hereafter MDF) is pleased to submit the Communication on Progress (hereafter CoP) 2012 and again commit theirselves to make the Global Compact and its principles part of our strategy, culture and day-to-day operations. Because of internal challenges MDF applied for an extension period of 90 days. Therefore, the CoP 2011 covered the following period: March 2011-June 2012. The COP 2012 covers the period June 2012-June 2013 including reflections and reporting on the progress of 2011. 1.2 Reporting progress 2011 MDF started in 2011 as a Global Compact member and therefore found itself at the level of the learner platform, meaning among other aspects that MDF only focused at two principles for the period of 2011-2012: Human Rights and Environment. In this section a short overview is given of the outputs reached in relation to the mentioned principles. For more information on the current situation implementation and the measurement 2011, MDF refers to the COP 2011. 1.2.1 Human Rights Principles Indicators Output reached 2011 1.

Communication on Progress 2012 As the current situation for all principles is slightly the same as the current situation in 2011, MDF choses to only state which (follow-up) actions are planned to be carried out in 2012-2013 in relation to the four principles. Some follow-up actions as defined during the internal MDF assessment-process on Global Compact are planned for the long-term or for the third period of Global Compact (2013-2014). The reason for this is that MDF likes to focus the coming year more on internal processes than external processes. For example: human rights principles on community impact and particularly impact assessment and on suppliers. The same counts for certain external environment and anti-corruption indicators, such as encouraging continuous improvements of suppliers and partners concerning environmental impacts and anti-corruption policies. 2.1 Human Rights Principles # Points of interest Follow-up action Health, safety and security HU1A Health and safety systems Find out which persons have BHV; Define responsibilities in case of emergencies (fire, first aid kit) and share with staffHU 1B Protective equipment and training Discuss with management and staff how this relates to MDF and working abroead etc; Document security policy QMS.
