It is therefore very important for us to reflect on our lives and take stock of all activities of The African Centre for Peace Building-AFCOPB including success, challenges and failures. In the year 2010, Ghana has experienced two bi-elections which are very dear to my heart and interest AFCOPB. These two bi-elections (Atiwa and Akwetia) were characterized by reports and alleged violence and destruction in the various forms. We also witness the two major political parties, NPP and NDC accusing each other of being the driving force behind these incidences. These two situations as alleged were fully spear headed by the youth in the various constituencies. Bawku, Toubordom-Techiman, Karaga, Bopurugu, Yeji, among others also experience violence conflicts with the youth playing a key role. Throughout the year, there have been a lot of reports in the media of allegations of NDC youth locking up public offices and toilets on the notion that their “party-in-power” has not provided them with job. The recent post elections crisis in Ivory Coast and Nigeria, are yet another area of where the youth exhibited their youthful energies once again. All these conflicts claimed a lot of lives and properties which shows that young people around the world have often been the victims of war and conflicts. Their energies are source and of then used to front violent acts and conflicts. Annual Reports and Accounts for the Year Ended May 7, 2011 4 African Centre for Peace Building AFCOPB A large pool of young people do not need to be destabilizing , however if young people– particularly young men – are uprooted , intolerant, jobless, and have few opportunities for positive engagement, they represent a ready pool of recruits for ethnic, religious, and political extremists seeking to mobilize violence. In many developing countries, young people are coming of age in societies that lack stable government, economic, growth, or basic material and physical security. In such circumstances, youth often turn away from the authority and ideology of older generations and seek to mobilize their own generation in search of solutions. To restore society and redirect the energies of the youth, the Centre has developed a strategy to engender the spirit and culture of peace among the younger generation through the establishment of youth wings –The Peace Fellowship Network/Clubs in educational institutions across the country. Peace Fellowship Networks/ Peace Clubs We have established Networks in Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, University of Development StudiesWa campus, St. Prospers College-Ho, Gambaga Girls High, Royal Academy-Wusuta, Tanyigbe Senior High all with a total membership of 1023. The students will be involved in various programs, trainings and community projects that are developed on the ideology of peace. Some of the programs and projects to be embarked on include:  Essay and Debate competitions (local and international)  UN Peace Day Celebrations and Peace Week  International and National Leadership Conferences  Workshops and Seminars on the MDGs  Community Based Projects  Environmental and Health Campaign Annual Reports and Accounts for the Year Ended May 7, 2011 5 African Centre for Peace Building AFCOPB Press Releases  Ivory Coast On the post election crises in Ivory Coast, AFCOPB issues a press statement and maintain that i. The position of the international community (UN, AU and ECOWAS) thus supporting Mr. Qoatara did not help matters. At least as the UN supported Mr. Qouatara, the AU and ECOWAS should have remain neutral and call for mediation as Mr. Gbagbo refused to accept defeat hence leading to crisis. ii. the military intervention as proposed by AU and ECOWAS is not the solution to the problem and added if „two elephants are fighting is the ground that suffers‟ To guard toward the future occurrences of such situation, AFCOPB proposed that AU and ECOWAS should consider setting up an Independent Electoral Commission where in the situation that the fate of the citizen (local people) cannot be determined, then the International Electoral Commission comes in to conduct fresh elections.  Politics of Insult AFCOPB has noticed the growing „politics of insults‟ among the government and the opposition. This we call on the two parties not „to take politics as a venture of enmity‟ The Centre has development these projects some of which were piloted:  Rural Peace Project (piloted 2010)  Peace Village Project  Health Missions Project  Web for Peace Project (launch 2010 and ongoing)  Farm for Peace Project  Students Development Seminar  Peace Festival Secretariat  Peace To All  My Right: My Property  Peace Conference (July 2011)  Peace Education Certificate Programme  Free and Fair Project Annual Reports and Accounts for the Year Ended May 7, 2011 6 2011 ACTIVITIES NCCE Annual Constitutional Week (April 28-May 4, 2011) AFCOPB was invited by the NCCE and duly participated in the Constitutional week celebration of the NCCE Endorsement of GES (February 24, 2011) Teachers Without Boarders-USA in collaboration with AFCOPB has designed a programme to train Teachers, Staff and NGOs and Community Leaders in Peace Education Certificate Programme in Ghana. As part of the requirements, AFCOPB has applied for endorsement from GES. It is my pleasure to inform you that we have been endorsed by GES to i. Train teachers, Tertiary Students and community leaders in peace education ii. Carry Peace Education pogrammes in all schools in Ghana iii. Post Volunteer Teachers to assist in teaching and learning activities AFCOPB planned to have its First training in July 12-15, 2011 after a one day Peace Conference in Accra. The training will then be carried out in other parts of the country. Teacher Without Boarders has offered to fund the training programme upon AFCOPB meeting the last requirement of submitting CVs of the Training Facilitators. But unfortunately we have only had of Lecturers CV who expressed interest to facilitate the programme. African Centre for Peace Building AFCOPB 2011 ACTIVITIES i. VISIT OF MS. VIRGINIA COMOLLI January 20, 2011 marks an important day in AFCOPB as we received a visitor form the UK who is a Research Analyst at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, London. The meeting centered on exploring of avenues for partnership and collaboration between the two organizations. At the meeting, the Executive Director of AFCOPB, Mr. Emmanuel Senyo Kumedzina briefed the visitor on the activities of AFCOPB, successes and challenges. He also pointed out that the major challenge facing perhaps most African NGOs is funding. And was quick to add that the only way this problem can be addressed is when the Leadership of these organizations develop entrepreneurial ideas and programmes such as agriculture to generate internal funding other than relying on external donations. Ms. Virginia Comolli also briefed the leadership of AFCOPB on the activities of the IISS since its establishment in 1958. She presented ways in which AFCOPB can benefit from the Institute’s activities and programmes ranging from Research fellowships, conferences and publications. ii. STUDENTS DEVELOPMENT SEMINAR (MARCH 19, 2011) As part of our commitments to developing students, AFCOPB in partnership with LILITAN Research & Consultancy, Statistic Research Consult in Collaboration with Students Representative Council-SRC of Ho Polytechnic (Ho Poly) organized a Training Workshop for final year students on dissertation writing. The seminar aims at equipping students with effective research and data analysis Annual Reports and Accounts for the Year Ended May 7, 2011 8 African Centre for Peace Building AFCOPB skills; presentation at project defense among others.

WEB FOR PEACE PROJECT As part of information sharing and enhancement of communication tool, AFCOPB has designed the Web for Peace Project which seeks to develop and manage website for NGO's who do not have the skills and other resources to enable them acquired a website. It would also provide training for staff (s) of the subscribers who could manage the site after development. Since and project was launched in November 2010, we have designed website for five NGOsAnnual Reports and Accounts for the Year Ended May 7, 2011 9 African Centre for Peace Building AFCOPB Savana Signatures in Northern Ghana, Rioch Organization-in Haiti, International Young Leaders in Action of Kenya, Lean-on Foundation-Ghana. The Centre has noticed with great concern the low level of technology adaptation that still remains an issue among many Africans in this 21st Century. It is in this direction that the Centre seeks to bring web based technology to young NGO's in Africa which would enhance their access and determination of their works and other information to the general public. iv. RECRUITMENT OF ONLINE VOLUNTEERS Our major problem is funding. This has made all our ideas remaining with us and most of our staff on Voluntary part-time bases. Our inability to get grant is we lack the expertise for grants writing to meeting requirement of the grant makers. This situation is very worrying. It is in this direction that we have registered with the United Nations Online Volunteer Services to provide us the platform to recruit professionals in the field of grant writing and other areas. I am delighted to inform the Board that though the UN Online Volunteering Services we have recruited thirty three (33) Online Volunteers from USA, UK, France, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Ghana, China, Japan, India, Kenya, Uganda, Cameroon, Colombia, Germany who started work with us on April 15, 2011 writing grant proposal on: Farm for Peace Projects, Rural Peace Project, Health Missions Project, and Peace Festival Project. Annual Reports and Accounts for the Year Ended May 7, 2011 10 African Centre for Peace Building AFCOPB MAJOR PROJECTS IN 2010 A. COMMUNITY PEACE EDUCATION IN FARMING AREA (MARCH-APRIL) Farmers in the Mampong Municipality and Ejura-Sekyedumasse District Assemblies have been educated ion how to use dialogue in resolving their conflicts. The project also aims at providing education to the farmers on how to live in peaceful coexistence with each other. They were taken through number of conflict t situations that led to war and claiming lives, properties of people in Africa. In the evenings, videos r\of the wars situations are shown to them after which the video was interpreted in Twi (indigenous). The video was to create the awareness of the effects of war and violence on the human race in the world. In all, twelve communities (Sekruwa , Bonosu, Bosomkyekye, Aboantem, Ejura, Sekyedumase, Adujuen, Bayerenkontas, Mininqaso, Woraso, Sataso, Atonsuoja) in the two districts. These communities visited are dominated by settlers who have migrated from areas that are experiencing sporadic tribal conflicts. it therefore the wish of the Centre to educate the farmers not to migrates with those conflicts but they should be the thing of the p[ast and forgive each other as they come to settle in a different community. The farmers were also reregistered and provided with farm inputsherbicides, spraying machines, farm boots, and services of a tractor among others. This was done in partnership with ADPL Farming Scheme to improve their livelihood. Annual Reports and Accounts for the Year Ended May 7, 2011 11 African Centre for Peace Building AFCOPB B.

Challenges on the field as a volunteer 5. Dealing with people in conflicts areas 6. Dealing with rural folks Annual Reports and Accounts for the Year Ended May 7, 2011 15 African Centre for Peace Building AFCOPB 3.0 Field Observation 1. At Topare in the Upper West Region for instance the school has only one teacher thus the Headmaster. 2. It was observed that almost all the schools in our operational areas have no or little ICT facility and lack teachers. 3. Some of the Senior High Schools have difficulty accommodating the volunteers because the some of communities are not willing to assist. As one headmaster said „when I go to any person in the community now to ask for accommodation for the volunteers, they would demand for money-meanwhile GES has not made money available for that’-He said the unwillingness of the indigenous to support with accommodation and perhaps feeding is because they feel detached from the school due to the computerized system of placement of students which make most of their ward go to other schools very far from their and or had to resort to private schools nearer to them. Another headmaster out of frustration also said ’my regular staffs have no accommodation, how much more a volunteer’ 4. Many day-Senior high schools also face feeding problem. They cannot feed the volunteers because the school is not a boarding school and „who in the community would be willing to feed them-then it is going to be my pocket money, and I also do not have’a headmaster said. 5. Most Junior high schools that responded met all the requirements. 6. Most senior high schools that the community has influence or attached with the communities met the requirements. 7. Pupil are well vested in the conflict situation at the areas and therefore ask very technical question on how those conflicts can be resolved 3.1 Activities of Volunteers on the field i. Volunteers were reported to have performing (assisting with teaching and learning) up to expectations by some headmaster. Our visitations have also justifies this. ii. Some of the volunteers organized extra classes for the students free of charge iii. Some of the Volunteers organized „peace walk‟ to create awareness of effects of conflict Annual Reports and Accounts for the Year Ended May 7, 2011 16 African Centre for Peace Building AFCOPB iv.

Our major challenge is finance. This is a headache for as since volunteers are almost done with the service and we have no funds to transport them back home, their cost of certificate and stipend. Our coordination also has to come to a stand still due to finance. 2. The number of students that expressed interest in the progromme with its corresponding number of participated schools 3. Most of our volunteers do not have any peace education skills this made them enable to function as Peace Ambassador as required Annual Reports and Accounts for the Year Ended May 7, 2011 17 African Centre for Peace Building AFCOPB C.
