[ 1 Dean & Ling Executive’s Support for the UN Global Compact Dean & Ling Executive became a signatory to the UN Global Compact in January 2010. We are pleased to present this, our first Communication on progress under the United Nations Global Compact. On a day to day basis, Dean & Ling Executive encourages all of its employees to behave in a way that respects human rights: through their everyday interactions, by becoming self aware and more concerned about the impacts that their behaviours have on other individuals and their communities, and by looking after their own mental wellbeing. In addition, we are committed to educating both the clients and candidates with whom we come into contact with, about the importance of these behaviours in the workplace. We believe that our commitment to a professional services consulting focus, as opposed to a transactional focused, differentiates us from our competitors. This commitment is further reflected in our Vision (2.1) and our Values (3.4). Dean & Ling Executive will continue our support for the UN Global Compact and commits to the initiatives and principles identified and detailed in this document. Ian Hackett Managing Director DEAN & LING PTY LTD 9 January 2012 2 5 ! [ 2 Who Are We? Dean & Ling Executive is an Australian owned specialist executive search and selection recruitment consulting business with national and international reach. Our three areas of specialisation are Accounting, Banking & Finance and Legal. The business was established in Melbourne in 2006 and now operates from offices located in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. With the consultancy support of En Masse (www.enmasse.com.au) Dean & Ling became a signatory to the UN Global Compact in January 2011. 2.1 Our Vision To lead the recruitment industry as trusted advisors who add tangible value through our expertise, authentic approach and focus on quality. 3 5 ! [ 3 Our Progress in Relation to the UNGC’s Principles 3.1 Human Rights This year, Dean & Ling Executive has engaged En Masse to act as a consultant to our business. Our ongoing relationship with En Masse exposes us to numerous training opportunities and updates on laws in relation to human rights issues in the workplace. All of our employees have participated in En Masse’s Human Rights Launch Pad – an on-line training program that teaches people in workplaces the skills to actively respect and promote human rights. All of our employees have also undertaken a half day’s training with En Masse covering: • Introduction to human rights in the Australian workplace context; • Anti-discrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity in the recruitment context; • The values underpinning human rights at work; • Sexual harassment and bullying at work – current trends; and • Dealing with clients who contravene anti-discrimination laws and values. As a result of this training, we have embedded these human rights principles into our core business activities. Example A: The following section has been incorporated into our candidate interview proforma. Workplace Behaviour Training Completed and Responses: EEO General: Bullying: Harassment: Discrimination: 4 5 ! [ All candidates are interviewed in relation to their understanding of these areas of human rights at work. We utilise this interview procedure in order to help raise awareness about the most common issues that limit or interfere with people’s human rights in Australian workplaces, as well as to help our clients identify opportunities to provide further training to their staff in these areas. Example B: The following two additional questions have been added to our standard reference check questionnaire. 1. How would you describe his/her concern for other people’s wellbeing in the workplace? 2. How would you describe his/her involvement in activities that benefit the community? Are you able to provide any examples? Dean & Ling Executive believes it has a responsibility to pass on the knowledge it has in relation to workplace human rights and is committed to acting as a conduit between our clients and candidates in relation to these human rights. 3.2 Labour Our values of ‘Generous, Kind & Authentic’ underpin everything we do and say. We are proud that we have never had any employment related convictions and are committed to an ongoing working environment free from discrimination and bullying. The following excerpts have been taken from our ‘Policies & Processes’ manual. Inappropriate Behaviour in the Workplace NOTE If a Dean & Ling Executive employee feels that he/she has been discriminated against, harassed or victimised, he/she must speak with the relevant Managing Director. 5 5 ! [ NOTE Anyone who is found to have engaged in discrimination, sexual harassment or victimisation/bullying may be subject to disciplinary steps, which can include an apology, counselling, transfer, dismissal with notice, or immediate dismissal. Discrimination Discrimination means treating someone unfairly or unfavourably because of a personal characteristic such as their: • age • breastfeeding • carer status • disability • employment activity • gender identity • industrial activity • lawful sexual activity • marital status • parental status • physical features • political belief or activity • pregnancy • race (including colour, nationality • ethnicity and ethnic origin) • religious belief or activity • sex • sexual orientation • personal association with someone who has, or is assumed to have, any of these personal characteristics. :Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Vic). Discrimination can be direct or indirect. Direct discrimination is treating one person less favourably than another because of particular attributes, such as race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, disability, medical record, impairment, marital status, pregnancy, potential pregnancy, family responsibilities, criminal record, trade union activity, political opinion, religion, national extraction or social origin. An example of direct 6 5 ! [ discrimination would be deciding not to employ a person because that person is from a particular ethnic background. Indirect discrimination is treating everyone the same but in a way that ends up being unfair to a specific group of people. An example of this is where the design of a workplace prevents a person with a disability from accessing the equipment needed to do the job. Sexual Harassment Under the Equal Opportunity Act, sexual harassment is against the law. Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that could make a person feel offended, humiliated or intimidated. Sexual harassment can be physical, verbal, visual or written. Dean & Ling Executive aims to create a working environment which is free from sexual harassment and where all employees are treated with dignity, courtesy and respect. As an employee you must: • not engage in sexual harassment; • not act in a manner which encourages an environment in which sexual harassment is likely to occur; • not treat differently an individual who has made a complaint of sexual harassment; • not make false accusations of sexual harassment; • offer support to anyone who is being sexually harassed and let that individual know where they can get help and advice; and • maintain complete confidentiality if providing information during the investigation of a complaint. Employees who spread gossip or rumours will be in breach of this policy and may also expose themselves to a defamation action. Management must: • monitor their direct working environment to ensure that acceptable standards of conduct are observed at all times; • model appropriate behaviour themselves; and • promote the principles of Dean & Ling Executive’s sexual harassment policy within their work area. 7 5 ! [ Victimisation / Bullying Dean and Ling Executive does not tolerate victimisation or bullying in the workplace under any circumstances. Dean & Ling Executive employees must not: • engage in bullying; or • act in a manner which encourages an environment in which bullying is likely to occur. Flexible Work Practices Dean & Ling Executive is committed to providing a flexible workplace and where possible, to accommodate the changing needs of employees. 3.3 Environment Dean & Ling Executive is committed to a sustainable future through the adoption of environmentally responsible policies and practices. As part of this commitment, we acknowledge our responsibility to reduce the impact that our business operations will have on the environment. We have implemented the following environmentally friendly services and policies: • Recycling of consumables • Recycling of in-house paper • Double sided photocopying whenever possible • Purchasing of recycled paper • Turning off of equipment when not in use • E-Xmas cards in lieu of sending paper cards and making a donation to charity. In past years we have supported the Starlight Foundation. This year we are supporting The Scarlett Foundation – www.thescarlettfoundation.org.au 8 5 ! [ 3.4 Anti Corruption Our Values In addition to Dean & Ling Executive’s externally espoused values, we have a set of internal operating values, against which all major decisions are made, and internal relationships are managed. In accordance with these values, it is expected that employees will make decisions that are determined to be generous and kind to each other, and authentic in their approach to individuals and to the business. Honesty is integral to this, and all of Dean & Ling’s staff are provided with regular performance reviews that incorporate client and candidate feedback – this helps us to ensure that our people are accountable for their honest dealings with all relevant parties. Dean & Ling Executive is committed to conducting business with each other, their clients and their candidates according to the following values: Generous, Kind & Authentic: • Generous with our time, effort and knowledge • Kind and respectful to each other, our clients and our candidates • Authentic in everything that we say and do Quality: Quality recruitment professionals, quality processes, quality service, quality outcomes. 9 5 !

Relationships: We build sustainable, long term partnerships. Maturity: We treat people as we would like to be treated. 10 5 ! [ 4 Conclusion Dean & Ling Executive is proud of the progress it has made in its first year as a signatory to the UN Global Compact and look forward to the many exciting opportunities that we have identified to make further progress towards the UNGC’s 10 Principles during the next year of our signatory status. 11
