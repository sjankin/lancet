SUPPLIERS AND CUSTOMERS 22 SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY Corporate Social Responsibility 2011 CONSOLIDATING AN ENDURING COMMITMENT Textil Santanderina’s 2011 t program has allowed us to consolidate several important projects that began during previous years. That is the case of the Estrat Project for Sustainable Management of Textil Santanderina Industrial Discharge, whose aim is to reduce consumption and guarantee wastewater recycling. This is a strategic action for accelerating changes towards an advanced, more efficient and environmental-friendly production process through a research project developed by the Centre for Industrial Technology Development (CDTI). We must bear in mind that 2011 has been marked as a year of global crisis, which has also deeply impacted our specific sector. In Textil Santanderina we face this situation with determination and responsibility and we are well aware that our ability to do so mainly lies within our growing commitment towards sustainability. It is this compromise that has allowed us to firmly attach to our obligations and our company ethos in the face of an extremely demanding and changing global scenario. -3Corporate Social Responsibility 2011 RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTANINABILITY TEXTIL SANTANDERINA CSR POLICY In 2011 we presented a Progress Report which was received vey favourably.

Our priority in environmental policy is to reduce our environmental impact. To achieve that aim, several actions have been put forth to save energy, minimize emissions, optimize water consumption, reduce polluting discharges and improve waste management. In Textil Santanderina we firmly believe that the struggle for a better, environmental-friendly future must begin today. INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHORIZATION The Integrated Environmental Authorization granted in April 2008 [Number AAI/042/2006] by the Regional Ministry of The Environment of the Government of Cantabria certifies that all our activities and processes strictly comply with the current European human health and environmental regulations. -5Corporate Social Responsibility 2011 ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGICAL PLAN 2010-2012 STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENTAL PLAN GOALS & MEASURES ACHIEVED DURING 2011 Goal Energy Savings Developing innovative projects that help prevent pollution and Continuous monitoring of consumption. improve working and health conditions while producing high quality and design textile products that fully address and satisfy Optimized energy efficiency systems for our clients’ demands. compressed air.

This way the noise pollution generated at the covers’ emission points is considerably reduced in order to comply with the protocol of good practices and improvements stipulated by the Integrated Environmental Authorization. Modernization of facilities: The replacement of the indigo dyeing machine warp has improved the performance of the looms, and the reduction of breaking warp threads has resulted in the following improvements: Reduction of both glue consumption and costs Reduction of pollution of wastewater discharges Improvements within security and working environment CONSUMPTION 2009 2010 2011 Electricity consumption (Mwh) 21.850 22.729 20.716 Automotive fuel consumption (t) 17 15 25 Non-automotive fuel consumption (t) 170 107 161 Natural Gas consumption (m3N) 13.780.220 13.931.540 12.038.627 -7Corporate Social Responsibility 2011 ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION Applying technological innovation to our processes and products is the best way to advance towards sustainability. Bearing this in mind, we attended the 2011 International Exhibition of Textile Machinery (ITMA), held in Barcelona, where we got to know the latest developments for the textile sector and acquired new equipment. As a result of this we have increased production whilst reducing our environmental impact. In 2010 the Centre for Industrial Technology Development (CDTi) approved the R&D project for Sustainable Management of Discharge from the Textil Santanderina Production Process. The project, to be carried out within 24 months (most of them corresponding to 2011), encompasses three main action lines for developing new technological solutions aimed at: minimizing wastewater and pollutant load through the development of new manufacturing processes that require smaller quantities of chemicals; improving the quality of the final waste in the purification process; and implementing water recovery and recycling systems throughout the production process. -8Corporate Social Responsibility 2011 ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY PURIFICATION Textil Santanderina has its own Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (ETARI) since 1989. The plant allows for an integral water cycle usage which returns, in optimum condition, previously used water to the production process. In 2011 we treated 3,274 tones of sludge generated during the purification process, this resulted in a 30% reduction of sludge ton per cubic meter of purified water. This year, the total of 671,794 m3 of water treated in our plant have been delivered to the general network Purification Plant. 2008 2009 2010 2011 m3 80000 70000 60000 50000 40000 30000 20000 10000 JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC -9Corporate Social Responsibility 2011 ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY WASTE Throughout the production process of Textil Santanderina, different HAZARDOUS WASTE 2009 2010 2011 types of waste are generated which are later separated, stored and managed in the most appropriated way.

HUMAN RESOURCES THE VALUE OF PEOPLE One of the key aspects of our Corporate Social Responsibility ethos is the great value we attach to the people involved throughout the entire business process. Every employee, client, collaborator or citizen is, above all, a human being, who deserves respect as such and whose interests and needs must always be taken into account. No social or business activity can do without these principles. Applying all the measures required by the Corporate Social Responsibility Program while keeping Textil Santanderina’s leading position in the market would not be possible without a human team of professionals who are strongly committed to self-improvement and excellence. 12 Corporate Social Responsibility 2011 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY. HUMAN RESOURCES STAFF & TRAINING Textil Santanderina workforce is made up of 340 people, 40 % of which work in the Quality Control and R&D departments, and 20 % within Management and Administration, giving priority to the concept of delivering “service” over “manufacturing”. From a HR perspective, this structure requires an active policy aimed at promoting, sustaining and developing a workforce who identifies with the company’s corporate culture and project. Training is a central aspect of our business strategy.

HUMAN RESOURCES OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY Textil Santanderina had already made occupational health and safety a top priority long before this became a core element of the UN Global Compact. Our health and safety program is aimed at the identification, assessment and control of the risks associated to the production processes. In 2011 it has been reinforced by a Health Monitoring Service, which provides employees with medical examinations as well as information and advice for both general and occupational health. This year, 85 % of the staff received a medical examination. This year’s program also included numerous health and safety training activities (data display on screens; handling of chemicals; posture education, etc.); risk assessment of different tasks; and external and internal audits on workplaces and ergonomics. 14 Corporate Social Responsibility 2011 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY.
