Several global working groups have been launched, which have worked on safety plans and conducted audits. A working environment survey completed in 2011 showed that man­ agement requirements relating to safe­ ty, communicated through clear exam­ ples of measures, have a positive effect on employees. This is an example of a healthy organisational culture. In the Sarpsborg operation, personal safety is integrated at all levels. This is a key aspect of the BF 2010 reorganisa­ tion process.
