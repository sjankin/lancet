The report is a key communication tool, part of our commitment to openness and accountability. The report is thus intended to serve as our Communication on Progress (COP) report to UN Global Compact and ensures compliance with section 99a of the Danish Financial Statements Act regarding corporate responsibility reporting. DLH’s Annual Report and CSR Report complement one another, as the former provides an insight into the group’s financial statements while the CSR report provides an overview of non-financial statements material to our business.

In 2010, we aligned our CSR strategy with the principles of UN Global Compact and further developed our CSR policies. In 2011, we worked on the development of a new and innovative Good Supplier Programme, which is the group’s supplier riskassessment tool. As we strengthen our CSR work, our reporting will benefit from improved progress measuring and performance communication. Reporting Scope and Boundary Unless otherwise noted for specific data, the report addresses all DLH’s sales, procurement offices and warehouse facilities worldwide. For a list of facilities, please see p. 102-103 on the Annual Report. The report also addresses our relations with suppliers with regards to the implementation of The Good Supplier Programme. The CSR Report 2011 has the same content structure and design of the previous year’s report. Stakeholders will therefore be able to follow progress easily. 6 Corporate Social Responsibility 2011Improving due diligence Our business relies upon wood STRATEGY & We operate globally and source wood from tropical, temperate and boreal forests, whose ENGAGEMENTS preservation is important for the future of the entire global community. Therefore we have a social and environmental responsibility for promoting sustainable forestry.

Our CSR strategy rests on three pillars: the Environmental Policy, the Social and Human Rights Our Values Policy and the Business Integrity Policy. At DLH, we conduct our daily business with respect for social and ethical values, as illustrated in our These policies are framed within the principles of “House of Values”. UN Global Compact. The backbone of DLH’s Environmental Policy and Social and Human Rights Policy is the Good Supplier Programme (GSP), which is a tool used to collect and evaluate information on how suppliers produce, process and trade timber. CSR Governance 2011 Having aligned our CSR policies with UN Global Compact principles in 2010, this year we have sought to find ways to better embed CSR into sourcing and distribution (the group’s core business operations). Therefore, the CSR & Responsibility forms the roof of our global and Environment department was integrated into the multicultural company. Therefore it is the group’s Global Sourcing unit after having been a staff ambition not only to strengthen its position as a function for many years. global leading wholesaler of timber and timber products, but also to be a leader in the wholesale “Since we no longer own forest and production of timber and timber products manufactured in activities, our CSR work must set focus on the accordance with environmental and social supply chain.

Track Record has extensive experience in traceability and due diligence and specializes in the development of web-based solutions for supplier and product risk-assessment for companies with complex supply chains like DLH. DLH sources timber from a vast range of countries and works with over 800 suppliers. Track Record is assisting in the development of an effective and innovative web-based GSP to manage the group’s international supply chain. DLH participates in EUTR Stakeholder Meeting In April 2011, DLH participated in the Second EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) Stakeholder Meeting held in Brussels. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss best options for risk assessment and risk mitigation procedures in the framework of the regulation. DLH was able to provide direct input as well as exchange views with representatives of the EU commission and other participants. For more information on EUTR, please visit EU’s website.

SGS-COC-001100 9 Corporate Social Responsibility 2011Improving due diligence ENVIRONMENT The world’s forests Every year large areas of tropical forests are being converted to commercial agriculture due to the increasing demand and rising prices for food, plants oils and biofuels. Deforestation is thus one of the major contributors to climate change accounting for 18% of global carbon emissions. Illegal and destructive logging activities also threaten the conservation of forests. But forestry activities, if conducted in accordance with local laws and international environmental standards, do not contribute to deforestation. Well-managed forests are forests that can continue to perform the numerous valuable services they provide to the global community: climate regulation, natural carbon sinks, biodiversity protection and contribution to the livelihood of 1.6 billion people. 2011 was declared the International Year of Forests by United Nations. The theme chosen for the year was ‘Forests for People’ to highlight the interdependence between people and forests, and the responsibility we all have in ensuring that they are well-managed and conserved. Therefore, ensuring that the timber we source has been legally harvested constitute one of the major challenges of our business. Our overriding goal is to contribute to the conservation of the world’s forest and battle against climate change by promoting legality and sustainable forest management. We explain how in the following paragraphs. 10 Corporate Social Responsibility 2011Improving due diligence Our Suppliers Quick Facts about DLH’s Environmental Policy on Suppliers  All our suppliers must commit to and comply with DLH’s environment policy.  In countries where there is a potential risk of non-compliance with this policy, we implement the Good Supplier Programme (GSP, which is the group’s risk-assessment tool. Participation in GSP is a pre-requisite for becoming a DLH Supplier.  In some supply countries, as a result of a country risk assessment, we have taken extra measures to avoid unacceptable wood. In other cases, we have stopped sourcing completely. The current list of countries with special sourcing guidelines includes Brazil, Burma, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa), Liberia, Malaysia (Sarawak), Nigeria, Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Sierra Leone.  We will work with our suppliers on knowledge sharing and capacity building. We will use our position as one of the market leaders in certified tropical hardwoods in order to support them in achieving VLO and FSC certification.  DLH will investigate the origin of all timber originating in risk countries. Origin is defined by DLH as the forest in which the timber has been harvested. DLH’s Environmental Policy can be found in the CSR Section on our website or downloaded from here. The Good Supplier Programme The Good Supplier Programme –also known as GSPis a tool used to collect and evaluate information on the origin, legality, verification and certification of the timber and timber products we source. GSP serves as a riskassessment tool covering all tropical countries as well as Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and China. More than 500 suppliers participated in the programme in 2011. GSP 2011 GSP 2012 In 2011, 99% of all purchases from risk countries Since the introduction of the first GSP ten years were covered by GSP a 3% improvement from ago, the tool has proven to be a very valuable tool the previous year. The three-point improvement is for knowing and understanding our suppliers. In significant in terms of purchasing volume covered 2010, DLH adopted a new corporate strategy, by GSP despite being below the group’s target of divesting itself of production activities whilst 100%. We aim at fulfilling the target next year. focusing business on sourcing and distribution. The new strategy requires more effective supply chain DLH had information on the origin of 92% of all management and therefore we began working on timber procured from risk countries covered by the revision of the current GSP. GSP. The result shows a 5% improvement from the previous year but it is below the target of 95% In May 2011 we partnered with Track Record for 2011. Gathering information on the origin of Global, a company that provides support to timber -understood as the forest of harvestbusinesses with regard to supplier and product risk continues to be the group’s major challenge. This assessment. Track Record is assisting in the is mainly due to the recent divestment of forestry development of an innovative web-based system activities and the number of current suppliers with for the new GSP. long supply chains. By focusing on supplier due diligence, we expect that the new GSP will enable The web-based system will enable the collection, DLH to soon meet the target. management and evaluation of data from suppliers in a more accurate and efficient manner. It will also facilitate data sharing between DLH offices and data updating. The new GSP is more comprehensive with regard to data gathering and risk assessment. It covers origin, legality, verification, certification and working conditions, and it will serve as the basis for a thorough evaluation of suppliers based on DLH social and environmental criteria. 11 Corporate Social Responsibility 2011Improving due diligence Why launching GSP 2012?

The success of this target is dependent on many factors, few of which we have any influence on. We therefore cannot set a fixed deadline for when we will reach this target.  Promote greater uptake of certified products. Over the last decade, DLH’s ambition has been to be a leading supplier of tropical hardwoods originating in well managed forests. Since 2000, DLH has been Chain of Custody certified and has, therefore, been permitted to trade in certified timber. Since 2008, DLH has also been Generic Chain of Custody certified and has, therefore, also been able to trade in timber with third-party verification of legal origin and legal compliance claims. Purchases of verified and certified timber Fig.1: Total Timber Purchases In 2011, 31% of all procured timber (volume) Third-party verified and certified was third-party verified or certified.

FFD Annual Review 2011 is available here. Nonetheless, for an international timber wholesaler like DLH, carbon emissions from international transport are relevant. Although the group does not have direct operational control over transport routes, we believe it is important to monitor and disclose the transport footprint to our stakeholders. DLH’s total transport carbon footprint 2011 adds up to approximately 81 kg /CO2 per cubic meter of timber traded.

Approximately 50% of our sourcing activities are conducted in countries considered of risk. Therefore it is our responsibility to ensure that we do not directly or indirectly benefit from, contribute to, endorse, or in any way facilitate violations. 2011 was a milestone year for business and human rights. In June, the UN Human Rights Council endorsed the “Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights”, written by the UN Special Representative John Ruggie. Shortly after, the Guiding Principles were incorporated into the revised OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the revised International Finance Corporation (IFC) Sustainability Policy and the corresponding Performance Standards, and the ISO 26000. In Denmark, the Danish Government introduced a bill for the creation of a ‘Liaison and Grievance Institution’ which will seek to mediate and resolve disputes involving Danish Companies alleged to have violated the newly updated OECD guidelines. Therefore, the Guiding Principles have become a global reference framework for the management of business and human rights challenges. As stated by John Ruggie, the “appropriate response by an enterprise to the risk of contributing to human rights abuse through its supply chain is for it to conduct due diligence on its supply chain relationships to identify risks of actual and potential adverse impacts, and to prevent or mitigate both risks and impacts where they arise”1. In light of these events, DLH aims at being able to conduct more systematic human rights due diligence within the next few years with the aid of a new and improved GSP, which is the group’s supplier risk assessment tool. 1 Ruggie, John. 2010.

Corrupt practices have also negative effects on business, as they undermine the rule of law by distorting competition and creating unfair business environments. Advancing anti-corruption policies can be challenging for global companies due to cultural differences. Nonetheless the abuse of entrusted power for private gain is unacceptable in all cultures and societies. In view of this, DLH is committed to work for the advancement of ethical practices and against corrupt practices. We will do so by building awareness through the implementation of our Business Integrity Policy. 20 Corporate Social Responsibility 2011Improving due diligence Our Policy In 2011, DLH focused on ensuring the sustained communication procedures to monitor the implementation of the Business Integrity Policy implementation of the policy. launched the year before.

This new development is part of the group´s growing CSR commitments, which began in 2010 with the alignment of the CSR policies with the principles of UN Global Compact. With the new European Union Timber Regulation entering into force in 2013, the 2008 amendments to the US Lacey Act, and the Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights endorsed by UN in 2011, new guidelines have been defined for responsible business. They consider due diligence to be the appropriate action that responsible companies should exercise in order to manage and mitigate environmental, social and human rights risks. With the implementation of the new GSP in 2012, which will serve as the basis for improved supplier due diligence, DLH will be better equipped for the time ahead. It is our goal that the new GSP will help the group consolidate its market position as the preferred supplier of responsible timber. 22 Corporate Social Responsibility 2011Improving due diligence GRI INDEX TABLE This report follows the Global Reporting Initiative Report, as well as their correspondence with the (GRI) guidelines G3, application level “C”.
