As such, corporate social responsibility is part of our ethos. We believe that corporate success and a healthier world are interdependent, that is why we support a healthy, educated workforce, and adhere to environmental sustainability and transparent governance best practices. These beliefs closely align with the principles laid down in the United Nations Global Compact. Taking our participation to heart, we are naturally renewing our support, as we have done for the past 6 years. In 2011, a significant step was reached with the development of a brand new Human Resources strategy focused on increasing the health and well-being of our employees and improving communication across the company. In this time of change, we focus on our employees more than ever, as they are our most valuable asset and are a continuous support in helping us pursue our objectives, whether in the business or in the social arenas. With regards to corporate governance, we have fully embraced Cigna’s commitment to legal compliance, integrity and ethical conduct by further aligning and strengthening our business ethics strategy. We have, among other initiatives, reaffirmed our anti-corruption stand throughout the enterprise, both internally and externally with all our partners. Our core activity is helping people wherever they are. Our core value is doing things the right way. We remain committed to being a sustainable and ethical company and we do so by embracing the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. Wouter Reggers Managing Director Vanbreda International Sphere of influence 4 1. Sphere of influence 1.1. Operations Vanbreda International has over 50 years’ experience in designing, implementing and managing cross-border employee benefits and health insurance programmes for private, public and not-for-profit organisations. These include companies with expatriate staff and offices in different countries and continents, intergovernmental organisations, diplomatic staff and foreign trade representatives as well as non-governmental organisations. As a provider of insurance products, services and solutions, we are aware of the impact that our activities have on society, both nationally and globally. The United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative report ‘Insuring for Sustainability’ (UNEP FI, 2007), rightfully mentions that “the insurance industry is a strong lever for sustainability due to its size, the extent of its reach into the community and the significant role it plays in the economy.” By enabling economic actors to take risks and protect their assets, insurance stimulates investments and innovations. By providing financial protection against death and disability risks and annuities for retirees, insurance reduces the pressure on the public sector. By analysing risks, insurance signals danger and provides risk management advice. Last but not least, by investing collected premiums, insurance directly contributes to the economy.1 “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.2 Transnational corporations and other business enterprises shall respect economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights and contribute to their realization, in particular the rights to development, adequate food and drinking water, the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, adequate housing, privacy, education, freedom of thought, conscience, and religion and freedom of opinion and expression, and shall refrain from actions which obstruct or impede the realization of those rights.”3 Since our foundation, we emerged as a company with an ever-increasing global reach. For our clients, we play a role in helping them implement their employee benefits strategy in line with their financial targets. We service over 430,000 people residing and working all over the globe. By providing global access to health care we touch upon and influence their daily lives and those of their families, wherever they work and live. In addition to affecting our client’s HR and business strategy and financial performance, and their employees’ wellbeing, we play a key role in the lives of our employees and their work environment. Our client services are being taken to heart, day in day out, by 460 people.4 The majority work from our headquarters in Belgium while others are based in our offices in the United States of America and Malaysia. We also have sales offices and local representations in Italy, Switzerland, Kenya, South Africa, Chile and the United Arab Emirates. 1 UNEP FI, 2007. 2 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 25. 3 UN Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights, article 12. 4 Number of Vanbreda International employees on 30 June 2012, representing 421.89 full-time equivalents. Sphere of influence 5 1.2. Our commitment to acting in a socially responsible way We are committed to acting in a socially responsible way. Our commitment is reflected in systems and initiatives that benefit all our stakeholders. We strongly believe in business ethics. We support and pursue international principles and standards regarding human and labour rights, environmental protection and ethical business conduct.5 Not only do we adhere to the United Nation’s Global Compact principles, but we also subscribe and live up to the Diversity Declaration of the Flemish Chamber of Commerce. In addition, in the wake of our acquisition by Cigna, we are in the process of integrating Cigna’s CSR policy. Aimed at creating a healthier world for plan members, employees, partners, investors and the communities we serve, it focuses on 4 impact areas: promoting wellness, developing leaders, expanding opportunities and embracing communities. Moreover, we comply with all legislation and regulations that have a bearing on our activities and we act responsibly beyond what is legally required. Our adherence to the UNGC principles demonstrates that we strive to be a socially responsible service provider and employer. We translated all of our engagements into our own specific set of commitments. Based on the principles of the ‘Triple Bottom Line’ (People, Planet and Profit) they represent our intentions with an eye to organisational as well as societal success. 5 We refer to: • the UN Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights; • the International Labour Standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO); • the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development; • the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; • the UN Convention against Corruption; • the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Sphere of influence 6 Vanbreda International is a Major Sponsor of UNICEF Belgium For many years, Vanbreda International has sponsored UNICEF by making a donation for each customer satisfaction survey fully completed by our clients. Thanks to this contribution we are officially recognised as a ‘Major Sponsor’ of UNICEF Belgium. Education and gender equality At the end of 2010, UNICEF Belgium and Vanbreda International renewed their partnership for another three years: 2011-2013. Vanbreda International’s annual donation is now allocated to a basic education and gender equality project in the DRC. DRC is a country in permanent state of emergency where political instability, poverty and child labour do not allow for the development of an education system. 1 child out of 2 does not go to school. UNICEF has set itself the target of sending 100% of the children to primary school by 2015. In order to improve schooling and instil associated values such as health, hygiene and protection, UNICEF has developed a 3-fold strategy: • support to early childhood education and sponsorship of young children by older ones; • development of basic education through continued training of teachers, rehabilitation of school buildings, etc; • stimulation of teenager involvement through training sessions about HIV/AIDS, drugs or citizenship. In all 3 programmes, special attention is given to the gender equality issue. The project has been very successful so far, as the attendance objective for early childhood centres has already been exceeded! Valuing our clients 7 2. Valuing our clients We want to ensure easy and affordable access to health care worldwide and reduce barriers to health care and protection wherever possible. At the same time, we raise plan members’ awareness of the cost of health care plans and how they can contribute to keeping these costs down. In addition we foresee measures and mechanisms to deter and detect insurance fraud. Our solutions are designed to enable staff covered by a health insurance or wider employee benefits programme to optimally benefit from the plan’s advantages. By upgrading and fine-tuning these plans and by launching new products and services, we continuously improve the plan and product experience and cost impact. Our effort towards continuous improvement is reflected in our ISO certification, which we obtained in 1998 for employee benefits claims handling.6 Ever since, this certification was renewed every three years. The latest re-certification was awarded in 2010. Between July 2010 and June 2012 four successful follow-up audits were conducted.7 Management responsibility n t pla ac Client’s Resource Analysis & management improvement Client’s requirements satisfaction c h ec do k Product realisation Input Output Product As an ISO certified company we have a fully maintained quality management system in place that is based on quality design in the business process (PLAN), execution of the business process in accordance with quality guidelines as described in the quality handbook (DO), monitoring of the output with measurable and significant quality criteria (CHECK) and constant process improvement (ACT).8 6 Certificate no BE98/01053 SGS European Quality Certification Institute E.E.S.V. 7 Based on the ISO standard ISO 9001:2008. 8 For more information on ISO, see www.iso.org. Valuing our clients 8 2.1. Improving access to health care We have a significant impact on the extent to which our clients’ employees and their families are covered against health risks. When designing our health care plans we take into account local specificities and cultural diversities, therapeutic freedom and cost effectiveness. To provide sound advice on how coverage can be improved for plan members, we monitor medical expenses, invest in relevant surveys and closely monitor emerging health care needs. 2.2. Regular assessment of health care needs Every year we perform a detailed analysis of each client’s medical claims history. These analyses can reveal new cover needs that had not yet been included in the health care plan. In such cases, we will advise our clients to adjust their plans to better meet the health care requirements of their employees and their families. At the same time, the analyses of the plan experience helps to raise awareness about the cost of the plan both for employers and employees. 2.3. Monitoring medical expenses When reimbursing medical claims to health care plan members we always assess whether the expenses made are justified. First of all, we verify whether the treatment itself was justified, taking into account the underlying diagnosis. Secondly, we assess whether the expenses comply with levels that are reasonable and customary in the country where the treatment was given. These assessments require a continuous follow-up of health care developments and related costs worldwide. We are supported in this effort by our global network of 169 medical correspondents based in 103 countries. 2.4. Increased ‘medicalisation’ of Vanbreda International Vanbreda International is specialised in health insurance services to expatriates worldwide and is trying to meet an increasing customer demand for health management and advice. Making our Medical Board a top priority confirms our strong global position and presence when it comes to our knowledge of regional medical cultures, the follow-up of reasonable and customary expenses, case management and the detection of possible fraud. Apart from the medical consultants based in our headquarters in Belgium, our Medical Board also includes medical consultants from all continents: Europe (Italy), America (Chile and Brazil), Asia (Malaysia, the Philippines, India and Afghanistan) and Africa (Senegal). 2.5. Solid case management capacities In 2011, our reinforced team of case managers successfully assisted more than 1,000 patients and their families a 17% increase compared to 2010 throughout their hospitalisation or other major treatment. Case management is two-fold. On the one hand, case managers provide clinical support by looking for alternative treatments options that enhance the patients’ comfort and well-being. They keep close contact with the patient throughout the hospitalisation or treatment, with personal visits or by performing ‘comfort calls’. Whether in the field or in our Service Centres, our case managers call or visit the patient and/or family members to ensure that the hospitalisation or treatment is running smoothly, provide information and answer possible questions. On the other hand, in consultation with the patient and treating doctor(s), case managers discuss the length of stay and negotiate case-specific rates (on top of the ones already agreed with our Provider Relations department). Their efforts in 2011 helped our clients save more than 2 million EUR out of a total of 18 million EUR. Valuing our clients 9 2.6. Surveys on specific topics Our clients expect our advice to be well-founded and realistic. To this end, we make use of our extensive database of medical information to make analyses and organise surveys on specific topics such as preventive care, disease management, the impact of ageing on health care costs, trends in disability management and return to work policies and other topics. We work closely with specialised institutions and academics to perform these surveys. As we place our members at the centre of our activities, processes and developments, we perform an ongoing satisfaction survey to ask our members for input on what they find important and how we can improve ourselves. To keep a high response rate and make the completion of the survey as easy as possible, we have published it on an online platform. Plan members receive an invitation either by e-mail or by paper and in both, we ask them to complete the survey online so all respondent data are available online in real time. The survey is sent out to a 5% random selection of members having claimed with us and can be completed in 6 languages. 2.7. Our 10 principles of Customer Care Keeping our customers satisfied is key to pursue our current service level. We have defined 10 principles of Customer Care to remind us of our commitment to our customers every day. They are built around 3 key values: Respect, Responsiveness and Reliability. These principles are implemented in every department and carried out in every activity we engage ourselves in. Our 10 principles of Customer Care 1. We treat customers with respect and dignity by being courteous, helpful and honest. We make sure not to discriminate on whatever basis. 2. We empathise with our customers, treating them how we wish to be treated ourselves. 3. We handle requests with care and we treat information in confidence. 4. We make sure to respect timings and deadlines. We deal with inquiries, handle complaints and correspond within the timescale agreed. 5. We prefer personal and direct communication. We transfer calls directly to the right colleague. 6. We listen to our customers and take into account their personal needs & issues. 7. We provide accurate and complete information in the customer’s preferred language. We explain decisions and give advice in a clear and knowledgeable manner. We acknowledge and respond rapidly to complaints. 8. We ask our customers for feedback on our services (via our client satisfaction survey) in order to continually improve the quality of service we provide. 9. We ensure that the quality of services and products is at the best possible level. 10. We train our staff appropriately so that they can provide the high standards of quality service Vanbreda International stands for. Valuing our clients 10 2.8. Proximity to clients In recent years, Vanbreda International has made substantial investments to be close to where its clients and customers are by opening additional sales and claims processing offices, hiring local representatives and extending its international network of medical correspondents. Today, we have local offices, sales and/or local representatives in Italy, Switzerland, Kenya, South Africa, Chile and the United Arab Emirates. With Claims Processing Offices in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Antwerp (Belgium) and Miami (USA), we are present in three time zones so that our customers globally have the best possible access to us for communication and smooth claims handling purposes. Because we find it essential to offer our plan members a physical presence, we regularly organise visits in their various locations all around the world. Our local representatives continuously travel around the greater area they are in charge of to give presentations on various aspects of the health insurance plan and hold individual appointments with plan members. Such visits can also be performed by headquarter-based staff from other departments such as the Account Management team, Customer Services or Provider Relations. 2.9. Access to Cigna USA health care provider network In 2011, thirteen new clients were granted access to our Cigna proprietary provider network in the USA. This effort results in improved customer service for plan members seeking care in the USA: they now have access to a network of 750,000 US providers without any administrative changes as Vanbreda International remains the single point of contact for all care, in and outside of the USA. Access to the Cigna US network also resulted in significant cost savings for both plan members and clients. Disease management project for HIV/AIDS patients It has always been a top priority for us and our clients to provide HIV/AIDS patients with optimal health care access without concerns for the financial aspect, confidentiality or stigmatisation. With this in mind, we initiated a pilot project with one of our clients in April 2010 in 9 African countries. It consists of disease management in close cooperation with the patient’s treating physician, and of psychological and treatment advice. Following a positive assessment conducted in 2011, it was decided to turn the pilot project into a programme in 2012 as it delivers successful results for both patients and our client, their employer. Every day, we interact with identified patients directly, guiding them and granting them access to the best possible (proactive) medical care. We actively follow-up and manage patients’ health, by monitoring lab results and controlling the intake of medication. This positive evaluation encourages us not only to further enhance and expand the project, but also to use the lessons learnt in the broader context of the development of a global disease management program in the coming years. Valuing our clients 11 2.10. Affordable health care – the importance of a global provider network Our Provider Relations department manages and monitors the worldwide Vanbreda International network of health care providers. This network grows with the needs of our clients, new and existing ones. Providers who sign up to our network agree to apply direct payment for our plan members and/or preferential rates for the health care services they provide. In June 2012, Vanbreda International had concluded 8,454 direct payment and/or preferential rate agreements with health care providers worldwide. This is an increase of 2.3% compared to last year (8,262 agreements on 30 June 2011). The maintenance and further development of such a provider network would not be possible without optimal relationships with and proximity to providers worldwide. To achieve this, we largely invest in face-to-face contact between our Medical Network Managers and providers. In 2010 and 2011, we visited 1,280 health care providers in 63 countries. The importance of Vanbreda International’s direct payment agreements Direct payment agreements ensure that we pay hospital bills – as well as medical bills for outpatient care – directly and promptly to the health care provider. This service facilitates access to health care as it reduces out-of-pocket expenses for plan members and thus the impact on their financial situation. Furthermore, Vanbreda International has obtained preferential rates from many providers, an added means of keeping health care costs under control. This has a positive impact on the aggregate claims expenditure and limits premium and contribution increases for health care plan members and their employers. Number of health care providers we have an agreement with All Providers June 2012 300 > 3.000 30 > 300 5 > 30 1 >5 Valuing our employees 12 3. Valuing our employees Introducing a new HR strategy: ‘Healthy Careers… Healthy Returns’ In line with our mission, we help our employees improve their health, well-being and sense of security (as we do towards our clients) through our Human Resources mission entitled ‘Healthy Careers…Healthy Returns’. ‘Healthy Careers... Healthy Returns’ encompasses an integrated People Strategy that covers the breadth and depth of employee experiences, career management and development, performance, and rewards. It is at the core of our overall business strategy. Our People Strategy components are: Career we focus on development and retention of talent. Returns we offer monetary and non-monetary rewards and our compensation is differentiated among employees based on responsibilities and performance . Culture we stand for a work environment that includes the beliefs, values, norms, and management style of our company. Life we show commitment to employees’ health, well-being and security, with a strong focus on wellness. Throughout this chapter we demonstrate how we implement this strategy with initiatives that keep our employees healthy and happy. 3.1. Taking care of our employees’ well-being Our employees are at the heart of our activities and they represent our most precious asset. We consider their wellbeing of paramount importance. “Transnational corporations and other business enterprises shall provide a safe and healthy working environment as set forth in relevant international instruments and national legislation as well as international human rights and humanitarian law.”9 Our policies are aligned with international principles as well as national legislation in Belgium, the USA and Malaysia. We established a prevention policy, aimed at taking care of the physical and mental health of our employees and calling upon every employee to help ensure his/her own health, safety and well-being and that of his/her colleagues and to maintain a clean and environmental-friendly workplace.10 The means to put these ideas into practice are based on a combination of labour regulations and practical provisions, targeted at promoting physical and mental well-being. 9 UN Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights, article 7. 10 Vanbreda International’s prevention policy is laid out in its Policy statement on well-being. Valuing our employees 13 Physical well-being • Employees’ safety New employees are informed about our safety guidelines, and how to identify, evaluate and appropriately act upon dangers and risks. We stress the importance and regularly remind employees of order and tidiness guidelines. One of these is the ‘clean desk’ policy, as an orderly workplace is a first condition to prevent accidents and provide easy access to fire extinguishers and emergency exits. Unfortunately, not all accidents or injuries can be avoided, which is why we work in close cooperation with an external service for work-related accidents. Each incident is evaluated and results in an improvement of preventive measures whenever possible. Employees are encouraged to report defects, complaints and suggestions for improvement via dedicated communication channels. The following table includes the number of employee accidents at work and on the road to work for the last five years. None of these accidents resulted in permanent working incapacity or death. Year Accidents at work Accidents on the road to work 2011 2 8 2010 0 7 2009 0 4 2008 2 10 2007 2 5 Vanbreda International organises fire drills for the fire intervention team, and the people in charge of evacuation and first aid on a regular basis. Every month, all alarm signals are tested. After each fire drill a performance report is drawn up and discussed with the Committee for Prevention and Safety at Work. • Business Continuity Plan In order to be able to respond to all kinds of disasters (accidents, emergencies, threats, etc.) without stopping our operations we have designed and implemented a Business Continuity Plan. In 2011, we conducted a successful simulation test with focus on the communication chain. • Internal medical service An Occupational Health Physician (OHP) and nurse are present at our offices once every two weeks. The OHP examines new employees, follows up on prolonged sickness and gives all staff working with computer screens a sight test every three to five years. He is also responsible for the annual influenza vaccination campaign. The OHP is available for employees who wish to consult him about work-related medical complaints. From the age of 40, all employees are entitled to a complete medical check-up every 3 years. • Non-smoking policy Our labour regulations include a smoking ban in all offices. • Preventive alcohol and drug use policy As from 1 April 2010, a preventive alcohol and drug policy was included in the labour regulations for our Antwerp headquarters because work-related alcohol and drug use is a possible factor that can negatively affect the safety, health and well-being of the employee and his or her environment. Valuing our employees 14 Moreover, it might also have a negative impact on the productivity and the work-quality and, as such, on our image as a company. Mainly, this policy has been established as a means of prevention. In its commitment to provide its employees with a safe and productive workspace, a similar, strict approach towards ‘substance abuse’ has been implemented by Vanbreda International LLC for the Miami offices. Health risk assessment In order to help our employees assess their health status and encourage them to make progressive changes to improve their health and well-being, we have given them access to an online health risk assessment program. All employees were invited to take a personal and confidential survey on their nutritional, sleep, sports habits and their stress level. After the assessment, they received a detailed report with feedback as well as practical tips. To accompany them on the road to improved lifestyle, tips are also regularly published on our Intranet. • Ergonomics We attach great importance to ergonomics. The following extract from our ISO quality manual reflects this concern: “Creating a pleasant working environment is a key element at Vanbreda International. The Workplace Health and Safety Adviser ensures that all employees are able to work in the best possible conditions.” To eliminate ergonomic risks, Vanbreda International invests in high-quality ergonomic office furniture for all employees. Our Internal Department for Prevention and Safety at Work gives general as well as personalised advice on preventive measures. Additionally, Vanbreda International has hired an ergonomist who visits our headquarters six times per year. • Promoting physical exercise We encourage our employees to stay fit and practice sports. Employees who come to work by bike are financially rewarded with a bicycle allowance of 0.21 EUR per kilometre. Alternatively, Antwerp employees can make use for free of the bike-sharing system of the city of Antwerp as the company pays for their yearly subscription. Our ‘Plan S’ is a yearly company-wide initiative to encourage our employees to improve their physical condition. Within the framework of the Sports Plan, we took a number of initiatives for the employees of our headquarters (Antwerp): − We took part in ‘Bicycle day’, an initiative organised by the city of Antwerp to encourage people to leave their car at home and go to work by bike; − In May 2012, all employees of Vanbreda International and their family members were invited to sign up for the ‘Race for the cure’, a 3km walk or a 6km run organised on 30 September by ThinkPink Belgium, a charity that works towards breast cancer awareness. Vanbreda International helps participants in their preparation for the race by offering free subscription to a 10-week training programme coached by professional athletes. • Cafeteria To support a more comprehensive approach to our employees’ health and fitness, we decided to offer more than just sports programmes. The menu in the cafeteria of our Antwerp office is both healthy and diverse including fresh fruit every day and fresh soup that are free of charge. Our employees can also choose from a wide variety of salads, sandwiches, pastry and desserts. Valuing our employees 15 Mental well-being • Protection of personal integrity In line with international and national law, we have set up a specific procedure to protect employees against violence, bullying and sexual harassment at work which is applicable in our offices worldwide. We included the complaint procedure in our labour regulations, whereas a personal confidant was installed who can be contacted by possibly victimised employees. • Company Policies Although we are confident that everyone is aware of the applicable laws and regulations, we have decided to include them in our company policy. Divided into 2 separate documents: compliance and ethics, on the one hand, and travel, expenses, entertainment and gifts policy, on the other hand, our company policy is published on our Intranet for easy access by all employees. • Sustainable work–life balance “Everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay”.11 In support of this principle, our labour regulations and collective labour agreements allow several possibilities to improve our employees’ work–life balance. Depending on local labour practice, laws and legislation, these include options such as flex time, a choice of part-time packages, and time credit/career breaks. • Employee Assistance Programme Vanbreda International offers all its employees and their family members professional counselling, resources, referrals, and information to help them face short-term personal issues. Employees and their family members can call 24/7 for free in case they have work, family, health, legal or financial issues and can be referred to a specialised counsellor for further phone or face-to-face counselling. All contacts with the EAP provider are voluntary and strictly confidential. • Social events In order to create a good working atmosphere, we uphold a tradition of organising social events on a regular basis such as company parties, team-building activities, family days and cultural events. This tradition is an integral part of our company identity. 11 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 20. Valuing our employees 16 3.2. Valuing our employees’ point of view Freedom of association and collective bargaining We endorse the international principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining as described in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights. “Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests. Transnational corporations and other business enterprises shall ensure freedom of association and effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining by protecting the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organization concerned, to join organizations of their own choosing without distinction, previous authorization, or interference, for the protection of their employment interests and for other collective bargaining purposes as provided in national legislation and the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organization.”12 We encourage an open and constructive dialogue between employer and employees. In line with the relevant national legislation13, our internal regulations describe the composition and duties of the Works Council. ‘Your voice matters’ – engagement survey Our ability to perform successfully as a company depends on how effectively we engage, develop and deploy our people. In order to assess our employees’ engagement, a company-wide survey was conducted in September 2011 by the Gallup institute and followed by an action plan coordinated and monitored by our HR department. The results showed a high level of engagement from our staff, who pointed at quite a lot of strengths: employee retention, pride in our products and services, job security, ability to maintain a healthy work/balance, etc. To act on areas of improvement, it was decided to work on 2 levels: • at the team level: the results of each team were shared with each manager who discussed them in turn with his/her team and drew an action plan. • at the corporate level: actions have already been taken in the first semester of 2012 to promote open communication throughout the company as well as individual recognition. ‘Get Connected’ sessions are regularly organised to bring staff members from various departments together. A quarterly company newsletter has been launched as well as a recognition programme (see 3.3. Recognition programme). The feedback we have received so far about these initiatives is very positive and encourages us to go even further. 12 UN Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights, article 9. 13 Bedrijfsorganisatiewet (1948), Royal Decree of 15 May 2003 and of 27 November 1973. Valuing our employees 17 3.3. Aiming at being an attractive and equal opportunity employer “Transnational corporations and other business enterprises shall ensure equality of opportunity and treatment, as provided in the relevant international instruments and national legislation as well as international human rights law, for the purpose of eliminating discrimination based on race, colour, sex, language, religion, political opinion, national or social origin, social status, indigenous status, disability, age – except for children, who may be given greater protection – or other status of the individual unrelated to the inherent requirements to perform the job, or of complying with special measures designed to overcome past discrimination against certain groups.”14 We support international standards on equal employment and remuneration opportunities. Consequently, we aim to provide fair remuneration and growth opportunities, and to foster diversity. A fair and competitive remuneration package for everyone “Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.15 Transnational corporations and other business enterprises shall provide workers with remuneration that ensures an adequate standard of living for them and their families. Such remuneration shall take due account of their needs for adequate living conditions with a view towards progressive improvement.”16 We apply a remuneration policy based on objective criteria such as responsibilities, skills, expertise, experience and personal performance. We provide a broad package of fringe benefits to all employees. Depending on local legislation and ‘good employer’ practice, this may include group insurance (pension/death), health care benefits and protection against work incapacity. Salaries and fringe benefits are being determined without taking into consideration or discriminating against gender, religion, ethnic background or physical handicap. Every individual staff member is entitled to transparency concerning his or her remuneration package. We will use appropriate means to offer this transparency, such as a correct and detailed employment contract, staff rules, collective bargaining agreements, internal communication vehicles such as an intranet, and personal benefit statements. Recognition programme In order to acknowledge employees who embrace our values and demonstrate a level of excellence that is above and beyond the normal scope of their jobs, a comprehensive recognition programme was launched at the beginning of 2012. It is our way of letting them know that we appreciate their hard work, dedication, and commitment to the goals of our organisation. The various awards put in place aim to single out those who perform excellently on a monthly, quarterly and yearly basis and also enable staff members to acknowledge one another’s achievements. For example, they can use ‘Thank you’ e-mail templates to individually thank a colleague and can also publish a message on a company website on a monthly basis. 14 UN Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights, article 2. 15 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 23. 16 UN Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights article 8. Valuing our employees 18 Training and personal growth Continuous learning opportunities are an important motivator and a condition for job satisfaction. We attach great importance to the professional and personal development of our employees. Each new employee completes a training schedule aimed at acquiring the knowledge and skills required in several fields (commercial, technical, administration, communication). Employees with new responsibilities or in need of developing additional skills receive appropriate internal or external training. All types of training are registered, monitored and evaluated. In 2011, Vanbreda International organised a total of 1,115 training days, which corresponds to 2.5 training days per employee. We especially invested in in-house language courses offered throughout the year (except for the school holidays) during lunch time. Participants can choose between English, French, German and Dutch (for the employees who do not have Dutch as their native language). Apart from language training, computer skills and medical terminology remain important focus points in our training offer. The table below shows the total number of hours of training of our headquarters’ staff for the calendar year 2011: Hours per training type 8,396 General training 853 Study leave Company system 2,357 Study leave Legal sytem 662 Management training 460 Network 30 PC training 318 Seminar / teambuilding 192 Language training 1,468 Skills 1,427 Technical training 629 • Education Savings Account Since the academic year 2008-2009, Vanbreda International has decided to intensify its investment in up-skilling its management. Every academic year, each management staff member receives a credit on his/her personal Education Savings Account, which (s)he can spend on his/her professional development. The balance of this budget can be transferred to the next academic year. • Selecting the best people, regardless of nationality, ethnic background, age, gender or physical condition “Transnational corporations and other business enterprises shall ensure equality of opportunity and treatment, as provided in the relevant international instruments and national legislation as well as international human rights law, for the purpose of eliminating discrimination based on race, colour, sex, language, religion, political opinion, national or social origin, social status, indigenous status, disability, age – except for children, who may be given greater protection – or other status of the individual unrelated to the inherent requirements to perform the job, or of complying with special measures designed to overcome past discrimination against certain groups.”17 17 UN Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights, article 2. Valuing our employees 19 Equal remuneration “Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.”18 We endorse the collective labour agreement19 regarding the equal remuneration for male and female employees. This agreement is an integral part of our labour regulations. The principle of equal remuneration implies that, for equal work of equal value, every difference regarding the sexes is abolished. In practice, this means that we have committed ourselves to making sure that the company’s performance review system does not lead to discrimination. Fostering diversity We commit ourselves to fostering diversity among our employees and not to discriminate based on gender, age, nationality or ethnic background. At the end of 2011, we employed people of 26 different nationalities. Worldwide, 460 people work for Vanbreda International. Vanbreda International’s age structure as from 30 June 2012 is as follows: Age bracket Number of employees < 20 years 1 20 – 29 years 145 30 – 39 years 181 40 – 49 years 100 50 – 59 years 33 We signed the Diversity Declaration of the Employers’ Platform for Diversity, a collaborative initiative of UNIZO (Union of Independent Entrepreneurs), VOKA (Chambers of Commerce) and VKW (Employers’ Organisation). Our company agrees with the basic principles of the Declaration and is making every effort to implement them within the organisation. Specifically, our commitments are as follows: • We seek to make our personnel policy as objective as possible. We achieve this by ensuring that: the recruitment and selection process focuses on the competencies of candidates and offers equal opportunities to everyone; • training and developmental opportunities are the same for everyone; • the salary policy is non-discriminatory; • people of foreign origin, people with a work handicap and older employees, etc. can also apply for jobs and be hired. • We evaluate how we formulate vacancies and which recruitment channels we use to reach a diverse group of candidates. We make the selection interview and the practical tests objective. • We do not comply with discriminating conditions that are imposed by clients or other external parties. • We demand respect for all employees and do not tolerate discrimination between colleagues on the basis of origin, age, gender and sexual preference, etc. • Both inside and outside the company, we make people aware that we are a member of the ‘Employers’ Platform for Diversity’. 18 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 23. 19 CAO no 25 of 15 October 1975, modified by the CAO no 25 b of 19 December 2001. Valuing our environment 20 4. Valuing our environment “Transnational corporations and other business enterprises shall carry out their activities in accordance with national laws, regulations, administrative practices and policies relating to the preservation of the environment of the countries in which they operate, as well as in accordance with relevant international agreements, principles, objectives, responsibilities and standards with regard to the environment as well as human rights, public health and safety, bioethics and the precautionary principle, and shall generally conduct their activities in a manner contributing to the wider goal of sustainable development.”20 We comply with the ecological requirements determined by international principles, Belgian environmental legislation and the ‘Welzijnswet’ (Law on Well-being). We have translated this commitment into systems to prevent, minimise and compensate any harmful impact on the environment. This includes initiatives at employee and company level. 4.1. Raising employees’ awareness When joining our company, employees are informed of our environmental policy and their individual responsibility to comply with it. Sorting waste On top of the 4 separate bins for the collection of recyclable waste placed in 2010 within reach of every employee, Vanbreda International employees in Antwerp have been using environmentally-friendly drinking cups since December 2011. Plastic cups have been replaced with biodegradable cups that decompose within 6 weeks and can be thrown away in the organic waste bin. This has resulted in a 13% decrease in drinking cup usage. For optimal waste collection, we have drafted guidelines on how to sort and minimise waste and regularly remind all employees of these guidelines. Saving natural resources Employees are explicitly encouraged to save energy by turning off lights and electrical devices whenever possible, using heating and ventilation moderately, and avoiding waste of water. By means of financial and practical incentives, employees are encouraged to come to work by bike or public transport, or to carpool. The following table displays Vanbreda International’s annual consumption of natural resources: Resource 2011 2010 2009 2008 Electricity 942,000KWh 967,000KWh 1,004,500 KWh 935,800 KWh Gas 729,000 KWh 774,000 KWh 728,600 KWh 698,600 KWh Tap water 4,000 m³ 3,500 m³ 3,000 m³ 3,800 m3 The increase in gas consumption between 2009 and 2010 is mainly due to the exceptionally hard winter of 2009/2010. In 2011, we managed to bring our electricity consumption further down by 2.6% and our gas consumption by 5.8%. We provide the Belgian government with an annual environmental report on our performance in terms of waste production as well as emission and energy consumption (Integraal Milieujaarverslag – IMJV). Environmentally-friendly cleaning products Since March 2012, the catering company running the Vanbreda International cafeteria has been using ‘green’ cleaning products bearing the EU Ecolabel. 20 UN Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights, article 14. Valuing our environment 21 Ecology Vanbreda International receives ‘CO2 Neutral’ Certificate Since 2006, Vanbreda International has implemented an increasing number of measures to live up to its commitment of achieving CO2 neutrality. For the calendar year 2011, we obtained a CO2 offsetting for the compensation of each of the 1,775 tonnes of in-house CO2 emissions. Not only is this certificate the result of our financial support to a CO2-reducing project in Northern India (see project description below), but also by implementing the following green measures: • the promotion of carpooling and the use of public transport and bicycle for commuting; • the installation of an energy-saving warmth regulation system for heating and cooling; • the use of a passive cooling technique with a night cooling system by ventilation; • the installation of automatic lighting timers in the hallways. • the use of green electricity in the Antwerp building since December 2009, which prevented an amount of 213 tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2011 (12% of our actual emissions). CO2 offsetting: financing of a CO2-reducing project in Rajasthan, North India Our staff frequently travels by air to visit clients and health care providers worldwide. Moreover, we create considerable CO2 emissions through our daily business activities at our offices, our fleet and our employees’ commuting. As a socially responsible company, we decided to offset all our CO2 emissions in 2006 by investing in a CO2-reducing project and are still doing so. Countering our CO2 emissions means that for each ton of CO2 discharged, we invest in a biomass project in India the amount of money needed to produce an equal reduction in CO2 emissions. This project produces renewable energy from sustainably grown biomass from local agricultural products, such as rice husk, cotton stalk and paddy straw. Not only does this conversion generate ‘green’ power, but it also contributes to the local economy. The project creates CO2 emissions reductions of ca 50,000 tons annually. It has received the official UNFCCC21 certificate. 21 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: www.unfccc.int Our ethics 22 5. Our ethics We strive to set an example of ethical and transparent business conduct by taking initiatives in favour of ethical conduct of employees, fighting corruption and money laundering and discouraging insurance fraud. With regard to business ethics, Vanbreda International is at the forefront of implementing and maintaining best corporate practices. It is deeply committed to creating and upholding a culture of ethical behaviour across the company. These efforts are supported by formal procedures as well as regular checks and balances to make sure ethical behaviour is not only a mindset, but also properly secured through a formal system. Both culture and procedures are kept alive through training and awareness actions. In the past year, we have worked further on our best practices and especially focused on the development and implementation of a comprehensive anti-corruption policy. 5.1. Additions to the company code of conduct Our labour regulations describe our general commitment regarding attitude and conduct at work. New employees are clearly informed of these guidelines. In 2011, the code of conduct was reinforced with the following policies and measures: • a Whistleblowing policy was implemented to help employees report information that may be evidence of misconduct. • data security was reinforced with the introduction of locked paper bins for confidential documents that are regularly collected and disposed of by a specialised company. 5.2. Fighting corruption Vanbreda International is committed to the highest standards of business ethics and integrity. That’s why we have implemented a comprehensive anti-corruption program involving our staff as well as all our business partners, existing and potential ones. All parties commit that they: • will not promise, offer, make nor accept any bribes (including payments of money or any other assets, gifts or other objects of value) whatsoever in order to improperly influence decisions or actions or obtain any improper advantage whatsoever; not directly nor indirectly; • will uphold all laws that apply and which are relevant to countering bribery and corruption, regardless of whether those laws refer to government officials, political parties, candidates for political office, public organisations or persons, and/or private organizations and persons. Raising awareness among our staff All our employees are requested to take a 45-minute online training detailing the various aspects of our anticorruption policy, with concrete examples. Regular policy reminders are published on the company’s Intranet as well as information on all actions taken towards our business partners. Raising awareness among our business partners We expect from all our business partners and clients that they share our commitment and that they support our relentless efforts of conducting business ethically throughout the world. We have thus inscribed our commitment in all contractual documents from the Terms and conditions of our products to group insurance contracts and agreements with brokers and health care providers. We have also published our commitment on our corporate website at www.vanbreda-international.com. Our ethics 23 5.3. Fighting money laundering We comply with Belgian Anti-Money Laundering Legislation, which complies with the relevant European Union directives. The legislation imposes a number or rules with a view to preventing money laundering. Internally, we have drafted a detailed policy document as well as operating procedures that will guide and enhance our continuous efforts in that area. 5.4. Fighting insurance fraud Health insurance, especially in an international context, is typically prone to fraud. Medical insurance fraud is a serious offence, which leads in the long run to other medical plan members becoming the major victims. To protect our clients’ financial interests we developed a detailed anti-fraud policy aimed at preventing, detecting, investigating, reporting and recovering fraud. Vanbreda International has been a member of the European Healthcare Fraud and Corruption Network (EHFCN) since July 2009, an international non-profit organisation that aims at reducing fraud and corruption in health care throughout Europe. Preventing fraud and raising awareness We maintain close working relationships with a worldwide network of health care providers, whom we have thoroughly screened in terms of quality and trustworthiness. In addition, we count on health care plan members’ sense of responsibility to avoid fraudulent activities. We appeal to them to counter malicious practices and to work towards a balanced and financially healthy medical insurance plan. We guarantee strict confidentiality and a thorough investigation of each individual complaint. Detecting fraud During the processing of health insurance claims, various checks are performed with the goal of minimising the risk of unjustified reimbursements. We assess each claim on the basis of what is typical, customary and reasonable in terms of treatments as well as costs. Thorough training and geographical specialisation enable our Claims Analysts to recognise possible deviations at an early stage. We will contact the health care provider directly if necessary. Investigation by our Fraud Investigation Unit During and after the processing of a claim, a fraud investigation may be opened by our Fraud Investigation Unit. Its role is essential in order for us to increase our knowledge through practical experience of fraud problems tackled and to ensure that future preventive measures are up to date with the reality of the fraud risks that we face. It closely cooperates with the Medical Claims Units where possible as fraud monitoring is an important part of the claims handling process as well and where new fraud files often will be initiated. The team can also rely on international networks to keep informed of all new health care fraud trends and techniques.
