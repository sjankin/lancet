KYOCERA CSR Report 2012 2 Top Management Message Contributing to the advancement and development of humankind and society through practice of the Kyocera Philosophy Correct application of the concept, “Do what is right as a human being” At the heart of Kyocera Group management is the corporate philosophy known as the Kyocera Philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of fair business based on ethical, moral and social standards that people should uphold throughout life. Ultimately, it comes down to one criterion for making decisions: “What is the right thing to do as a human being?” To realize our corporate philosophy, Kyocera developed a unique management control method known as the Amoeba Management System. With this system in place, Kyocera promotes a management method in which all employees can participate. Furthermore, Kyocera believes in highly transparent corporate activity with timely disclosure of information to customers, employees, shareholders, investors, business associates, and all other stakeholders. For the Kyocera Group, CSR is tantamount to the practice of the Kyocera Philosophy — the heart of Kyocera Group management. We believe practice of the Kyocera Philosophy builds mutual trust with stakeholders, and contributes to sustainable growth for the Kyocera Group, as well as the overall development of society. We will continue to engage in corporate management through practice of the Kyocera Philosophy. Addressing social issues through business operations The Kyocera Group is primarily engaging in business development in two areas that we see as growing markets. One is the information and communications market. This market is expected to see increased global use of smartphones and higher-speed networks. The other market is the environment and energy market, which is being spurred by a rising awareness of global environmental protection. The information and communications market not only requires quality and safety, but user-friendliness is also essential for product development. Products must be accessible and satisfactory to people of all ages, regardless of gender or disability. For example, the Kyocera Group has developed a smartphone with a unique feature that uses sound and vibrations to transmit the voice of the other person through the display screen. This enables users to hear easily in train stations and other noisy environments. Mobile handsets designed specifically for the needs of children and elderly people are also being commercialized. The Kyocera Group is committed to meeting the needs of society and developing products that satisfy a wide range of customers. In the environment and energy market, we are developing Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS). The combination of solar power generation and storage batteries enables efficient use of energy in homes. The Kyocera Group is also becoming involved in the utility-scale solar power generation business. Additionally, we have begun selling solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Kyocera’s fine ceramic components, featuring outstanding heat resistance and durability, are used in the cell materials at the heart of this product. The Kyocera Group will continue to address social issues through business, and thereby contribute to development of a sustainable society. Accelerating the global development of our business The Kyocera Group must further strengthen its management foundation and accelerate the global development of its business. These are necessary goals in order to compete globally and maintain high growth. Therefore, we continue to work on further cost reduction as well as the streamlining and capacity expansion of existing production bases. At the same time, we are promoting measures such as the establishment of new production bases in Vietnam and elsewhere, and reexamining ways of procuring materials. Moreover, the Kyocera Group strives to undertake business activities rooted deeply in local communities. In addition to abiding by the laws and regulations of individual countries, the Kyocera Group places great importance on respecting the diversity of local practices and cultures. The Kyocera Group participates in the United Nations Global Compact, a global platform for supporting fundamental principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. We remain dedicated to earning yet greater trust from our stakeholders. We will be very pleased if this CSR report gives you a better understanding of the Kyocera Group’s CSR activities. Your ongoing support of our operations is greatly appreciated, and we welcome your opinions.

With “What is the right thing to do as a human being?” as its most essential criterion, the Kyocera Philosophy expounds the significance of commitment to fair management and operation in compliance with the most fundamental human ethics, moral values and social norms. What is the Kyocera Philosophy? Basic Ideas of the Kyocera Philosophy The Management Rationale of the Kyocera Group is: “To The Kyocera Group believes that decisions should always be provide opportunities for the material and intellectual growth made through reason and based on the idea of “What is the of all our employees, and through our joint efforts, contribute right thing to do as a human being?” as the basic criteria to to the advancement of society and humankind.” The “material achieve compliance with public morals. and intellectual growth” that we aim for includes the pursuit The criterion of “What is the right thing to do as a human of economic stability, and entails the pursuit of mental riches being?” is based on the fundamental ethical and moral as a human being, in the shape of life with purpose and job values of the natural goodness of human beings: “Don’t be satisfaction through self-fulfillment in the workplace. greedy,” “Don’t cheat people,” “Don’t lie,” and “Be honest” Additionally, the steady refinement of our technology are teachings we all received from our parents as a child and allows us to provide the world with wonderful products one represent the most basic principles of humankind. after another, and thereby contribute to the advancement of We believe that when making decisions and taking action science and technology.

The guidelines for action in pursuing the Management Rationale are set out in the Kyocera Philosophy. As a state of ■■ Kyocera Philosophy Pocketbook mind for leading wonderful lives, we are striving day by day to practice the Kyocera Philosophy. A copy of the Kyocera Philosophy Pocketbook is distributed to each employee at Kyocera. Employees use various opportunities to apply the principles in the Pocketbook, and Origin of the Kyocera Philosophy to independently learn and practice the Kyocera Philosophy. In In 1959, with the generous support of the people around April 2011, we published the Kyocera Philosophy Pocketbook them, company founder Kazuo Inamori and seven other II, which summarizes additional important points of the colleagues established Kyoto Ceramic Co., Ltd.

Starting with a meager amount of capital, translated into multiple languages to aid penetration of the the company had no imposing office building or elaborate Kyocera Philosophy in bases overseas. machinery in the beginning. All it had were fellow colleagues who shared the joys and sorrows and formed a close bond as members of one big family. Inamori then decided to base the management of the company on this bond of human minds. This is because he believed that while human minds are extremely changeable, they are also most dependable once the minds are bonded by strong trust. Later, Inamori encountered many difficulties in managing Kyocera, but he overcame them each time believing in the strong bond of human minds. Kyocera Philosophy was thus born as he debated his life and work.

KYOCERA CSR Report 2012 6 Feature Article No. Promoting safe and comfortable lifestyles with people-friendly products Japanese society is undergoing rapid changes such as a declining birthrate and an aging population, changes which will affect future generations. Notions of “convenience” and “comfort” are also changing in a way that reﬂects the demands of the new generation. User-friendliness is evolving from a uniform concept to a diverse one. Under these changing values, what type of convenience and comfort will satisfy people everywhere? By continually examining people’s lifestyles and society from prospective standpoints, Kyocera undertakes development aiming for user-friendly products. Smartphone & Simple Mobile Phone both equipped with Smart Sonic Receiver technology for high-quality audibility in noisy environments Kyocera has launched a smartphone and a basic feature mobile phone equipped with the Smart Sonic Receiver technology. This unique function uses both sound and vibration to transmit the voice of the other party. By making the display vibrate, the Smart Sonic Receiver clearly transmits the voice of the other party through sound and vibration. In conventional phones, the other person’s voice is difﬁcult to hear unless the earpiece is placed next to the ear. With the Smart Sonic Receiver, however, there is no need to worry about correctly positioning the device against the ear as the whole screen transmits sound. Moreover, by covering the ear with the screen face, the phone can shut out external noise and provide high quality audibility even in noisy environments. Kyocera continues to be actively involved in introducing user-friendly products that are easy to operate and satisfy the needs of diverse customers. URBANO PROGRESSO Simple Mobile Phone K012 “Aquala” — a coating technology contributing to increased longevity for artiﬁcial hip joints (Minister Received the 25 Advanced Technology Award th of Economy, Trade and Industry Award (Japan)) Sponsored by Fuji Sankei Business i In artiﬁcial hip joints, friction wears down the joint components with long-term use, generating powder which can cause immune responses in nearby cells. This may lead to a loss of natural bone around the artiﬁcial hip, resulting in a loosening of the joint. A loosened joint requires additional operations to replace components. To enable patients to live in comfort for a long period of time, it is necessary to prevent the loosening of joints and extend the longevity of the artiﬁcial hip. In response, Kyocera Medical Corporation has developed a technology for an original coating which resembles the surface structure of joint cartilage. This coating technology, “Aquala,” uses a biocompatible polymer that features strong afﬁnity with cells and surrounding structures. Thus, Aquala has dramatically reduced the generation of An artiﬁcial hip joint with Aquala coating friction powder, mitigating post-operation loosening. This technology is expected to extend the longevity of artiﬁcial hip joints. 7 KYOCERA CSR Report 2012 Mobile phones which assist care giving for elderly people and children from afar We want to protect our precious children from crime and accidents. Our “mamorino 2” mobile phone is designed to help families realize this wish. To make it usable even for small children, its functions are limited to calls, e-mail and GPS. However, “mamorino 2” also has a number of special features that enable families to watch over their children from afar with peace of mind. These include location tracking, which provides notiﬁcations of the child’s location; and movement history, which shows where the child has been throughout the day. Furthermore, since April 2012, Kyocera has been providing a specialized mobile phone — the “mamorucchi” — with a neighborhood security system. This is a crime-prevention system being employed by elementary schools in Tokyo’s Shinagawa Ward. Based on the “mamorino 2,” the specialized “mamorucchi” is used in the district to help ensure the safety of children. User Comments “My child ﬁnished his third year of elementary school and gained “I saw the mamorino in a store and talked with my husband about more opportunities to partake in extracurricular classes and it.

It was a good decision that we can feel assured about.” (Mother, 30s, part-time worker) (Mother, 30s, part-time worker) As the population in Japan ages, the number of elderly people who live alone is rising year by year. To ease the concerns of the families of solitary senior citizens, Kyocera developed the “Mi-Look.” This mobile phone has a pedometer with various functions for watching over the user. The phone is equipped with a pedometer notiﬁcation, and a safeguard sensor notiﬁcation. As many elderly people are less than enthusiastic about carrying mobile phones, Kyocera undertook development with this in mind and examined ways of drawing a clear distinction with conventional mobile phones. Developers visited areas with many senior citizens and conducted surveys. These efforts led to the development of the Mi-Look, a device enabling family members to unobtrusively look out for their elderly loved-ones, even from afar. Printers / MFPs designed for easier use by people with disabilities and senior citizens Kyocera Document Solutions Inc. manufactures printers, multifunctional products (MFPs) and other products that are user-friendly for people with disabilities and senior citizens. Throughout the development processes, from product planning and design to manufacturing and sales, we conduct research on product improvement for increased usability based on perspectives of diverse customers, including people with disabilities and senior citizens. For example, developers undertake various practical experience and veriﬁcation tests with the purpose of realizing greater functional convenience and better design. Such measures include putting on heavy kits that assume the physical constraints certain elderly people face, and operating the products while constrained to a wheelchair. The products resulting from such research incorporate universal designs that offer user-friendliness to people with all kinds of requirements.
