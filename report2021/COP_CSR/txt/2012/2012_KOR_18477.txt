Lotte Shopping has built its firm presence as the leading retailer of Korea, continuously delivering extraordinary growth since it was founded. Now, Lotte Shopping aims to achieve yet another goal of becoming a “Respected, Global Sustainable Company.” Along that journey, diverse interest and demands of stakeholders will remain vitally important in guiding us towards the aspiration. We will always stay close to the voice of our stakeholders with a promise of mutual growth for the future. CEO Message “Together with all our shareholders, we will share our dream of becoming a global sustainable company.” At Lotte Shopping, we manage our business with a focus on sustainability, aspiring to deliver a rich and happy life for all our stakeholders including customers, employees, suppliers and local communities. We firmly believe that our pursuit for sustainability management will ultimately serve as the driving force for maximizing corporate value and creating continued growth for Lotte Shopping. Last year was another good year for Lotte Shopping as we continued to achieve remarkable results amidst global economic crisis and prolonged recession. We have consolidated our basis as a global retailer through new store openings, business diversification and overseas expansion. In response to global climate change, we have dedicated our effort to reducing our carbon footprint while operating green stores and broadening eco-friendly product offerings. Furthermore, we expanded communication channels and introduced systematic support programs to drive shared growth with our suppliers. In recognition of such accomplishments in 2011, Lotte Shopping was chosen as the Retail Super Sector Leader for two consecutive years by Dow Jones Sustainability Index World (DJSI World), while having been represented in the DJSI World for three years in a row. We also ranked 4th global retailer in department stores among Forbes Global 2000 a ranking published by a world-renowned economic journal Forbes. Lotte Shopping has thus reaffirmed its position as a top-tier company in global retail business. With an aspiration to move beyond the progresses made thus far, Lotte Shopping will push ahead further to take on greater responsibility that befits our status as a global retailer, seeking continuous change and innovation along the way. We will strive to pursue a balance between financial gains and social and environmental performance, while keeping ourselves focused on our goals and progresses, and incorporating the outputs in the sustainability report as transparently as possible. We ask for your keen interest and active engagement in our dedicated endeavors for challenging ourselves to grow into a sustainable enterprise.

Last year, we announced our product revolution to offer customers with more socially valuable merchandise. Guided by our determination, we developed differentiated product series such as ultra-cheap “Tongkeun (broad-minded)” and high-quality “Sonkeun (unsparing)” products, designed to seek shared growth with smaller and medium enterprises (SMEs). In addition, significant progresses have been made in various aspects of social contribution and environmental management—e.g., we became the first retailer to receive the “Green Management System” certification, launched the “Happy Dream Volunteers” involving all executives and employees, and were named No. 1 department store by the National Customer Satisfaction Index (NCSI). To address the social issue of mutual prosperity in particular, Lotte Mart worked to build strong partnership with the suppliers to lay a platform for shared growth in Korea and beyond. We launched a Lotte Mart outlet in Luyuan, Jilin Province of China in September 2011, thus becoming the first Korean distributor that celebrated the opening of the 200th global store. With multiple stores in operation in three countries China, Indonesia and Vietnam, Lotte Mart has truly reshaped itself as a global retailer that represents Korea. Going forward, Lotte Mart will continue to strive towards excellence by focusing on the quantitative growth in scale and qualitative growth in efficiency. We will also exert leadership in promoting environmental management, shared prosperity as well as social responsibility as a beloved corporate citizen. We sincerely ask you for your continued interest and encouragement for our efforts to truly enrich your lives. 4 LOTTE Shopping Sustainability Report 2012 “Lotte Super will be in forefront of creating an eco-friendly culture in the distribution industry.” Established in April 2000 as a supermarket division of Lotte Shopping, Lotte Super has since achieved sustained growth.

In this sense, Lotte Shopping carries out its ethical Management and social responsibilities for partner companies to the fullest while sparing no efforts to help them understand its sustainability management policies and participate in its corporate sustainability management activities. Building Partnership with Suppliers for Sustainable Growth | Lotte Shopping introduced the “Supplier Sustainability Management Guideline” in a bid to strengthen the foundation for sustainable growth with its suppliers. Based on ten principles of the UN Global Compact, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Labor Organization Convention, the guideline includes basic requirements of global standards on human rights, labor, environment, health and ethics that should be observed for sustainable prosperity of both Lotte Shopping and its suppliers. To attract attention of suppliers and encourage them to implement sustainability management in a more practical manner, the company inserted a clause on “Sustainability Management Agreement” in its contract form. We will help our suppliers observe this guideline. Supply Chain Risk Analysis | At Lotte Shopping, we analyzed the supply chain risks of 564 major suppliers of Lotte Department Store and Lotte Mart in the category of economy, environment and society, the triple bottom lines of sustainability management, and then classified them into six groups ranging from no-risk to high-risk. Analysis showed that no supplier belonged to high risk group but risks in the environmental scope were relatively high compared to those in the economic and social scopes. This was mainly due to our appraisal method. That is, stricter global standards were applied to the appraisal of environmental risks such as the ISO 14001 certification, the greenhouse gas emission management certification, and the HACCP certification. Based on these results, we will do our best to take preventive and improvement measures through continued appraisal and control of supply chain risks.

The following describes practical limitations and difficulties encountered during this assurance engagement for Lotte Shopping. Assurance was conducted taking into consideration the following circumstances. There were limitations involving site visits due to multiple sites Lotte Mart operates, which totals 532 sites. (Number of sites visited for the assurance is 44 with the minimum number of site visits is 23 as mandated by the Guidelines) • Difficulties of reviewing the specifications due to the inability to print out the 5000-page-long specifications from NGMS • Difficulties in maintaining consistency in specifications, due to differing site circumstances and principles for developing specifications across the affiliates Assurance Opinion The materiality threshold for this assurance is ±2.5%, and we present our assurance opinion as appropriate, as Lotte Shopping meets the key criteria as required by the guidelines in regard to organizational boundary, sources of emissions, emission factor, net calorific value and emission calculation, etc. Overall Conclusions The specifications of Lotte Shopping provide clear identification on all activities and sources of emissions while providing precise explanation about all sources of emissions that are excluded. In addition, calculation methods for emissions are clearly defined, and excluded emission sources are fully explained in detail. Moreover, clear and sufficient justification and supporting evidence are presented to describe the methods used for emissions calculation, and the equation used and application of factors and tiers all fulfilled the criteria as required per the Guidelines. Therefore, we conclude that “Verification of 2011 Greenhouse Gases Emissions” of Lotte Shopping” is “appropriate.” March 31, 2012 Song Jong-Chul CEO & President, Korea Quality Assurance 88 LOTTE
