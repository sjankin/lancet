The arrival of new players in the world of telecommunication has led to a profound rethink of the way we are required to operate, but we have faced the new competitive environment with awareness of the values that make us unique. In the four years just ended, we have worked tirelessly to cut costs and improve the competitiveness of our commercial offerings, for the benefit of customers and the market. We have dealt responsibly with the staff redundancies foreseen by the business plan, implementing solutions agreed with the social partners that have minimised the impact on employees. Thanks to the consolidation and relaunch of activities in Brazil and Argentina, we have been able to rebalance our presence in foreign markets, recovering the strong international vocation that Telecom Italia had in the past. Through a careful management of company’s operations we have rebalanced the ratio between debt and cash generation, bringing it back to normal levels. We have developed a constructive dialogue with the Authorities, promoting innovative solutions that fulfil requirements in terms of ensuring protection and equality of treatment between our sales division and alternative operators. We have continued to act incisively with regard to compliance and behavioural practices, transforming our organisational architecture in order to build more effective control systems. Responding to customer needs remains the main priority in the Group's business strategies and the results achieved in terms of improving satisfaction indexes reward the efforts made, although we believe we can do even better. All of this has been done because we believe that a sustainable company is a company that takes into high consideration its own impacts on the whole system with which it has to interact in every corporate decision it makes. And it is precisely with the aim of increasing the level of awareness of the importance of these aspects in the decision-making process that we have launched a sustainability training plan dedicated to all employees, which will continue throughout 2012. This is a concrete knowledge development tool based on an e-learning platform and on themed virtual classrooms aimed at creating a common and shared knowledge base within the Group. Constant attention to technological innovation and process management improvement has allowed us to increase our energy efficiency and produce significant results, including a 6.3% reduction in electricity consumption and a 6.2% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Our commitment to supporting the values of sustainability has allowed us to achieve important national and international acknowledgements, including our inclusion in all the major global sustainability indexes. We continue to support the United National Global Compact through our involvement in the Italian network and our reporting of the progress achieved in applying the ten principles. 1 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 3 In the near future, our Group will be required to make important strategic choices, the effects of which will extend over the medium to long term. When evaluating choices of this magnitude we need to consider the interests of today as well as those of tomorrow, assessing their sustainability from all points of view. In developing next generation networks, for example, we have opted for an architecture which, in addition to being economically efficient, is also a solution that allows the greatest energy savings to be achieved. In the future, companies and Public Administrations will increasingly be opting for innovative Smart Service solutions that allow the most efficient use of resources, while at the same time ensuring a reduction in environmental impact and an improvement in citizens' quality of life. Telecom Italia intends to play a leading role in this context. In less than five years, our Group has changed. Its expectations, prospects, behaviour and fundamental values have changed and its commitment to doing business responsibly has strengthened, in the belief that this is a prerequisite for the success of the Group in the long term. Franco Bernabè (President & CEO) 4 Letter of Introduction to the Corporate Social Responsibility Report, Signed by Giovanni Stella, Telecom Italia Media Group Vice Chairman and Managing Director2 In 2011, the considerable work done by the Telecom Italia Media Group over the years allowed it to continue to build an increasingly strong identity in the economic backdrop in which it operates and reach significant milestones in a constantly changing and highly competitive marketplace. La7 enjoyed considerable growth in 2011, both in terms of audience share and advertising sales. La7 ended the year with average audience share of 3.85%, marking an increase of approximately 25% compared to the previous year, its best result ever, proof of the editorial choices made for an increasingly demanding and selective part of the television audience. MTV was most affected by the change in the television scenario relating to the viewing of music channels, which saw an explosion of media offerings (e.g., Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) that have changed the habits of the public, and of the youth segment in particular. Accordingly, the channel embarked upon a process of transformation, taking up the challenge of change. After reporting a decline in revenues in 2011 due to the discontinuation of the Dahlia TV channels, at year-end, the Network Operator achieved the goal of full rental of its multiplexes thanks to the arrival of new customers, laying the foundation for considerable growth in 2012. Important steps forward were also taken from an industrial standpoint by continuing with the conversion to digital and enhancing the efficiency of the broadcasting network throughout the country, in full harmony with the switch-off calendar. Progress was also made in the area of technological innovation, with continuing experimentation with the evolving new standard for digital terrestrial TV (DVBT.2), further expansion of the technological fleet used to produce and manage content created directly by La7 in high definition, and additional testing of 3D technology. New developments on the Web included the launch of a new channel, La7-Youtube, while the mobile market saw development of La7 programming (such as TGLa7) through the market of themed apps. In pursuing its business objectives, our Group has continued to devote considerable attention to its stakeholders, with the aim of ensuring that they are fully satisfied by focusing on sustainable communication in all of its forms: from editorial content to technological innovation, the wellbeing of the company’s workforce and social awareness-raising. I would like to draw attention in particular to the significant technological changes made in order to produce content in high definition, thus ensuring a high level of quality of the product aired thanks to the use of highly professional staff and equipment: from the implementation of specific lighting systems that allowed considerable energy savings to the use of supporting materials with a smaller environmental impact and a high degree of reusability and thus a lesser amount of hazardous materials to be disposed of. Although the socioeconomic backdrop remained rather complex, our Group continued to ensure that its employees have all the tools they need to enhance their individual growth processes and supported them in establishing company awareness with which they can identify, starting with the principles enunciated by the Code of Ethics, which is inspired by the Global Compact — principles that our Group has adopted since 2004, thus confirming its commitment to becoming a socially responsible enterprise. 2 Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Annual Financial Report, Sustainability Section, page 88: http://www.telecomitaliamedia.it/sites/telecomitaliamedia.it/files/Annual_Financial_Report_2011.pdf 5 I am convinced that a great deal may still be done and that this will depend not only on market conditions, but also the enthusiasm created by the results achieved and, to an even greater extent, the goals that the Group ambitiously sets for itself, thus creating a virtuous cycle of increasingly exacting demands by stakeholders and the Group’s increasingly close focus on meeting those demands. Giovanni Stella 6 1) Strategy, Governance and Engagement Criterion 1: Key aspects of the company’s high level sustainability strategy in line with Global Compact principles. Criterion 2: Effective decision-making processes and systems of governance for corporate sustainability. Criterion 3: Engagement with all important stakeholders.

In Telecom Italia we believe that the balance between these three dimensions can be achieved only by taking into account the expectations of all those we are involved with, our stakeholders , whose opinions and requests we carefully listen to. We group our stakeholders into eight categories: customers, suppliers, competitors, institutions, environment, community (external stakeholders), human resources and shareholders (internal stakeholders). Stakeholders may have different expectations: the main challenge is to satisfy their requirements, even when they differ from one another. 3 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/en/sustainability/our-approach/our-model/being-sustainable.html 7 Reporting (Introduction/2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report)4 “THE REPORTING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE APPROACH” Scope and criteria In accordance with the principle of materiality, unless otherwise stated, only (Telecom Italia Group) subsidiaries included in the consolidated accounts that have revenue greater than 300,000 euros and more than 40 employees, excluding discontinued companies and non-current assets held for sale, are taken into consideration in the sustainability reporting. In accordance with the triple bottom line5 approach, the company's economic and financial data has to be analysed and represented together with the environmental and social results. Only an overall analysis of company performance including all three dimensions can provide stakeholders with comprehensive information and allow interests to be balanced in a way that guarantees the success and survival of the company in the medium and long term. For this reason, the Group has included sustainability data in the Consolidated Financial Statements since 2003, pre-empting the implementation of European Directive 51/2003, which was transposed in Italy by Legislative Decree no. 32 of February 2, 2007. The Sustainability Report is based on a multi-stakeholder approach involving the joint analysis of actions taken in respect of the main stakeholders with whom the Company interacts. It is drawn up on the basis of a system of around 200 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) relating to all the areas in which the Company has a major impact and measuring its capacity to respond as well as the degree to which it has achieved the established objectives. The KPIs are defined on the basis of: • the analysis of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), an international organisation which has developed universally applicable guidelines for drawing up the sustainability report, in order to facilitate comparisons between companies; • the demands of stakeholders; • the questionnaires sent out by the leading rating agencies for the purpose of admission to the stock market sustainability indexes; • the experience gained over the 15 years during which the Company has performed this activity. The KPIs are managed on the CPM system, a dedicated application, in a similar way to that in which financial reports are drawn up. Accountability 1000 and Global Compact The Telecom Italia Group Sustainability Report is based on the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard (APS 2008), adopted as of the 2009 Financial Statements, and set out below: • inclusivity: identification of the stakeholders and their expectations, and development of involvement strategies aimed at improving the Company's sustainability performance; • materiality: identification of the important issues for the organisation and its stakeholders; • responsiveness: a description of the initiatives carried out by the Company to meet the expectations of stakeholders. The Telecom Italia Report's compliance with the AA1000 standard is verified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. …. 4 Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Group Sustainability Report (chapter: Introduction/Reporting: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 5This approach was defined for the first time by John Elkington in 1994 in the article “Towards the sustainable corporation: Win-win-win business strategies for sustainable development . California Management Review 36, no. 2: 2: 90-100. 8 References and Governance (Introduction/2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report)6 The Telecom Italia Group operates with the conviction that business activities must be conducted in a way that considers the expectations of stakeholders, in keeping with the principles established by internationally recognised standards. In defining and implementing its sustainability strategy and programmes, the Group is inspired by the guidelines issued by the main global guidance and standardisation organisations in the field of Corporate Responsibility. The System of Sustainability Management also takes into account the principal reference regulations and international standards: • European Commission directives, recommendations and communications; • the OCSE guidelines directed at multinational enterprises; • ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 quality and environmental management system certifications; • the principles of the Conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) on respecting the fundamental rights of workers; • the Social AccountAbility 8000 standard (SA 8000), aimed at promoting respect for human rights and working conditions by companies and their supply chains; • AA1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard (APS 2008) drawn up by AccountAbility, an international organisation which promotes collaboration between stakeholders, and lays down standards and guidelines on matters of sustainability. The APS 2008 establishes the principles that a company must respect in order to define itself as accountable, which are covered in the § Reporting; • ISO 26000 guidelines for private and public organisations of all sizes. In July 2004, Telecom Italia Media endorsed the principles of the Global Compact. Codes, Charters and Values (Introduction/2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report)7 The undertakings given by the Group to its stakeholders are expressed in a system of Charters and Codes available in the sustainability section of the telecomitalia.com website. In the belief that the success of the company cannot be separated from business ethics, the Code of Ethics sets out the objectives and values of the Company's activities in respect of the main stakeholders with whom the group interacts. Respecting the Code is a requirement for statutory bodies, managers and employees of all the companies of the Group, as well as for collaborators and third parties in business relationships with the Group, within the boundaries of their respective competence, functions and responsibilities. …. Furthermore, in order to comply with the various resolutions of the Italian communications authority regarding quality, the relevant websites state the objectives set for the year for the individual services (fixed and mobile voice services, Internet access services, IP-IPTV pay-per-view television services, call centre services for customer support)…. The other commitments undertaken by the Group are contained in the following documents, which are available in the sustainability section of the Internet site: 6 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 7Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Group Sustainability Report (chapter: Appendix/Objectives) http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 9 • Social responsibility in the Telecom Italia Group on compliance with labour standards within the Group, with particular reference to child labour, forced labour, health and safety, freedom of association, discrimination, disciplinary procedures, working hours and pay; • Relations with suppliers in Telecom Italia Group’s procurement process , which governs the negotiating ethic of the Group (transparency, the separation of roles, fairness and traceability) and the requirements that Telecom Italia demands of its suppliers in the area of working and environmental standards; • Green Procurement Policy , which is intended to minimise the environmental impact directly attributable to the Company and its suppliers in the context of the procurement process; • Self-Regulation Code for Mobile Services , Self-Regulation Code for TV and Children , Code of Conduct for Premium Services , Self-Regulation Code for Commercial Communication , a series of codes relating to the protection of children and consumers; • Self-Regulation Code on Sports Information and Self-Regulation Code on the Reporting of Legal Disputes in Radio and Television Programmes ; • Telecom Italia Group Guidelines on Voluntary Contributions to the Community , which govern the ways in which the Group makes investments in favour of the communities in which it operates; • Code of conduct for the confidentiality of OLO (Other Licensed Operator) Data , which ensures the proper handling and confidentiality of data by the departments that supply services to other operators; • Telecom Italia Group Guidelines for Responsible Marketing , which outline the principles followed by the Group to ensure honest, transparent and fair business practices in addition to those contained in the Charters and Codes mentioned above. The System of Values adopted by Telecom Italia is the benchmark for the conduct of all those who work for the Group, creating a sense of belonging to a single organisation. The various corporate processes and systems for staff development, rewards, assessment and training are inspired by the Charter of Values, in order to steer individual behaviour in a consistent way throughout the Group. Focus on the customer To consider the customer as the main employer, and customer satisfaction as the core value. To be ready to listen to both internal and external customers, and to take steps to anticipate and respond rapidly to emerging requirements. Taking responsibility To participate in the achievement of tangible results and to accept delegation as an opportunity, without referring problems to management that are within the individual’s sphere of competence.

To meet needs and problems and handle multiple, sketchy inputs, working out timely and practical solutions. 10 Integration To work together with team spirit, minimising disputes and maximising the effectiveness of the exchange of information and professional contributions, working towards a common goal on behalf the company and the Group. Transparency To ensure ethically-correct business conduct; to maintain internal and external relations that are correct and honest, favouring the circulation of information. Professional excellence To continuously improve one’s own abilities, taking responsibility for one’s own professional growth in order to contribute to the success of the company and the Group. The Code of Ethics (Telecom Italia web site/Sustainability/Codes and Policies/Code of Ethics)8 The Code of Ethics is the apex of the entire corporate governance system: it is our charter of values, and provides the body of principles serving to ensure an ethically-oriented conduct of business based on transparency, correctness and fairness. The Code of Ethics, gradually adopted by all the Group companies, sets the rules and principles of business activity with reference to the major stakeholders with which Telecom Italia interacts daily: shareholders, the financial market, customers, suppliers, competitors, institutions, the community, and employees. In the same way as all the other corporate governance instruments, the Code of Ethics is constantly reviewed and compared with changes in the regulatory framework, reference standards, and operational and market practices, with account also taken of the feedback from the monitoring of departments’ compliance by the person in charge of internal control. The Code of Ethics of Telecom Italia is at the basis of the so-called Organizational Model 231 , i.e. a model of organization and management adopted pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, 9 aimed at preventing offences that can result in liability for the Company . ….

Communication of non-financial performance (Introduction/2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report)12 In the context of the Alliance between the European Commission and companies launched in March 2006 with the aim of turning Europe into a centre of excellence in CSR, a “Sustainability and nonfinancial performance assessment laboratory has been set up, of which Telecom Italia has been a co-leader. Following a wide-ranging consultation process involving companies, investors, academics, representatives of the European Commission and stakeholders in Italy and abroad, the laboratory launched an advanced communication model for non-financial performance. On the basis of the opinions expressed, the model identified six priority areas (Human Capital, Customer Relations, Community, Innovation, Environment and Corporate Governance) in which companies and investors are both interested, and in respect of which, therefore, the high quality reporting of financial information by companies is valued by the financial markets and taken into consideration for the purpose of valuations. For further information, see the website launched by the laboratory investorvalue.org. 11 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitaliamedia.it/sites/telecomitaliamedia.it/files/CodiceEtico_100910.pdf 12 Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Group Sustainability Report (chapter: Introduction/Reporting: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 14 During 2011, the laboratory's work continued in the context of a collaborative venture project launched by CSR Europe and EABIS (European Academy for Business in Society), in which Telecom Italia plays a leading role together with other big companies and international organisations. The project has the dual purpose of: • identifying a small number of concise sustainability performance indicators shared with the financial community (analysts, asset managers, banks and funds); • sharing the best practice used by companies to measure and manage non-financial performance.

How Telecom Italia Group identifies its stakeholders (Telecom Italia web site/Sustainability)14 In Telecom Italia the stakeholder identification process is based on the following phases: 1) deep analysis of business processes 2) for each process all the interested parties are identified (people/associations/organizations involved in the activity analyzed) 3) grouping the parties in homogenous categories…. 4) identification of the so-called “sub-stakeholders” among the principal parties of stakeholders. 13 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/documents/Sostenibilita/en/approach/CSR_Europe_GA_2011_Nazzaro_fin al.pdf 14 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/documents/Sostenibilita/it/OurApproach/How%20we%20identify%20our% 20stakeholders.pdf 15 2) United Nations Goals and Issues Criterion 4: Actions taken in support of broader UN goals and issues.

Strategy (2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report/The Community)16 The intention of the companies of the (Telecom Italia) Group is to contribute to the economic wellbeing and growth of the community by supplying efficient and technologically advanced services. Consistent with these objectives and the responsibilities assumed towards the various stakeholders, the Group companies see research and innovation as priorities for growth and success. As private entities requiring cost-effective management, (Telecom Italia) Group companies take the social impact of telecommunication services into account in their decision-making activities, responding to the needs of the community, including the weakest members of society. The (Telecom Italia) Group looks favourably on and, where appropriate, supports social, cultural and educational initiatives aimed at the advancement of the individual and the improvement of living conditions.

Over 100 major international companies subscribe to the LBG, which was founded in 1994 and is the global gold standard for the classification of voluntary contributions made by companies in favour of the Community. In accordance with the LBG model, in order to measure and represent the Group's commitment to the community, the contributions disbursed have been subdivided into three categories (Charity, Investments in the community, Initiatives for the community), adopting the customary pyramidshaped representation, which places initiatives of a charitable nature at the top and initiatives which in addition to being of benefit to the Community are in the commercial interest of the Company at the bottom. For further information regarding the LBG model and its investment classification criteria on the 3 levels, see the sustainability section of the telecomitalia.com website and the lbgonline.it website. … The criteria used to assign the contributions to the various levels of the LBG pyramid (Telecom Italia web site/Sustainability: Our Stakeholders/Our Support to the Community/ Relations with Communities/Criteria for measuring)20.

The Community (2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Annual Report, Sustainability Section)21 The Telecom Italia Media Group has decided to prioritize activities in which its know-how and skills can bring value added to the community. Nevertheless, the Telecom Italia Media Group also strives to sustain social causes, supporting initiatives designed to publicize the importance of environmental respect and protection as well as those aiding the community. Again in 2011, Telecom Italia Media resumed its campaign for the environment, the most important commitment of which involves World Environment Day on June 5. We have raised public awareness through a multi-platform offer: La7 and its website www.la7.it have emphasized the importance of the event with broadcasting the special platform “Allarme Italia – Viaggio nel paese delle emergenze”, a documentary on Italian environmental emergencies which relates the problems suffered and the efforts taken to improve the territory and crowned by success. Telecom Italia Media has also sponsored the “Pink Tie Ball” initiative of the Susan G. Comen Association, which supports breast cancer research, and has made a donation in its favor. As has been the case for some years now, it was decided to turn to the Peter Pan Onlus (Italian non-profit social organization), making a contribution to the construction of accommodation for families who do not live in Rome and come to the city for their children affected by cancer to receive treatment. This was done through a donation linked to the creation of Christmas cards distributed during December. The donation made by Telecom Italia Media Broadcasting to the Associazione Lega del Filo D’Oro had the same aim — in exchange for the contribution it produced Christmas greetings cards with the logos of the TIMB and the Association. 21 Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Annual Report, Sustainability Section (chapter: The Community): http://www.telecomitaliamedia.it/sites/telecomitaliamedia.it/files/Annual_Financial_Report_2011.pdf 19 An essential e contribution by MTV Italia which has become an instrument for raising awareness a w with its audience: a  MTV EXIT: (89 airinggs from February 14 to March 14 ) — a social ccampaign promoted by MTV M Internattional againsst human trafficking, featuring the videoclip “W When will I fe eel love” by the Black Iris Collective e.

THE FOLLOWING CONTENT WAS SHOWN ON CHANNEL LA7d:  SOS TATA – episode 4 (May 8) SOS Tata targets families with children under-12, where the parents are completely controlled by their young and disobedient charges (who are real pests!) and issue a cry for help to keep them in line and regain control of their lives. The families participating can use the services of a specialized nanny, with years of experience in child rearing and education, that help the parents in the most problematic areas of their children’s growth. After receiving the cry of help from parents, a team of three nannies decides which one of them is best equipped to solve the specific problem. The selected nanny then goes to live with the family for a week. At first, the nanny merely observes the family dynamics; after a period of observation, she becomes an active participant, giving advice and setting rules to achieve harmony in the home. The intervention of the nanny is aimed especially at mothers and fathers, with recommendations and strategies to encourage them to make changes in situations of greatest difficulty. The nanny delivers advice and rules to follow both for the parents and the children. The show aims to provide real assistance and points to ponder, in a light and friendly atmosphere.  SOS TATA – episode 14 (May 8) Nanny Lucia, the veteran of the group who has participated in the show since its first season, is back to pay a visit to the Guerra family five years after her first visit to see how things are going.  1) MIKE (May 8)  2) SE CI DOBBIAMO ANDARE ANDIAMOCI (May 8)  3) IO PARLO!

A sort of post-adoption manual which will be very useful to people who have recently adopted, are about to adopt, are thinking about adoption, have friends or relatives who have adopted or simply enjoy the emotional stories such as these. “Mamma ha Preso l’aereo un anno dopo” is a follow up on the road which will involve Barbara di Cursi (psychologist, expert in adoption, and mom to Matteo, 4 years old) and Michele Randone (volunteer general practitioner at CIFA and adoptive father to two Cambodian children) travelling Italy in a car and commenting and relating the stories of these families.

IO VOTO CONTRO LA VIOLENZA: to respond to the violence of the black blocs in the demonstration of the indignados (the “outraged”) in Rome on October 15, MTV decided to create a campaign against violence, the follow-on to “Io Voto”. “Io Voto contro la violenza” is a campaign that reminds young people of the importance of taking part in the social and political life of our country in a peaceful and non-violent manner. The campaign is based on adverts with the testimonies of musicians and young people, and online activities on the Io Voto blog and MTV’s social media. To launch the campaign, the history of MTV NEWS “IO VOTO” (see above) was rescheduled, and specially re-edited to promote non-violent participation with the title “Io Voto contro la violenza”. The Io Voto contro la violenza campaign started on Tuesday October 18, tacking on to the individual artist idents (which were already programed as the Io Voto campaign) a voiceover referencing the Rome events of October 15 and an invitation to vote against violence. The artists were asked to post their testimony regarding the initiative and in the week from October 17 to 23 they answered and posted videos and articles on the blog: J-Ax, Max Pezzali, Grido, Zero Assoluto, Negramaro, Daniele Silvestri, Nina Zilli and Giorgia. The video posts also included Mattia Calise and Cecilia (protagonists of the MTV NEWS “Io voto contro la violenza” stories). In addition, 9 video idents of outraged youngsters were recorded and produced, and then posted in the Blog’s video section. 4 of these were aired in rotation on all the network’s channels from October 31 to November 7 and 5 articles were also posted in blogs linked to the topic. The broadcasts were divided as follows. During the campaign’s launch from October 18 to November 15 MTV ONE saw 467 broadcasts overall with an average of 16 broadcasts a day (including Artisti Io Voto revised with voice over Io Voto contro la violenza and “ragazzi contro la violenza” idents) MTV MUSIC: 537 total broadcasts with a daily average of 18 broadcasts a day; MTV HITS: 467 total broadcasts with a daily average of 16 broadcasts a day; MTV CLASSIC: 467 total broadcasts with a daily average of 16 broadcasts a day.  MTV NEWS Socially relevant stories: LIBIA: I RAGAZZI E LA RIVOLUZIONE: the youth of Benghazi talk about the revolution and their desire for democracy and freedom.

Human Resources (2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Annual Report, Sustainability Section)29 The Telecom Italia Group’s Code of Ethics is based on the Global Compact promoted by the United Nations and sets forth a large number of principles pertaining to Human Resources, such as health and safety at the workplace, respect for employees’ rights, the enforcement of equal opportunity policies and the promotion of professional growth. The Telecom Italia Group also follows the OECD guidelines as well as the ILO principles (International Labor Organization). Telecom Italia Media acknowledges the central role of Human Resources, respects workers’ rights, ensures safety at the workplace and protects employees’ health.

Strategy (Human Resources/2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report)30 The Telecom Italia Group companies recognise the centrality of Human Resources, knowing that the principal factor in the success of any business is the professional contribution of the people who work in it, within a framework of openness and mutual trust. The Group companies ensure health and safety in the workplace and believe that respect for workers’ rights in the conduct of economic activity is a fundamental principle. The management of the workforce aims to guarantee equal opportunities and to promote the professional growth of each individual. Health and Safety (2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Annual Report, Sustainability Section: Human Resources)31 The Risk Assessment Document required under the statutory framework regulating workplace safety constitutes the main point of reference on health and safety matters for all Telecom Italia Media Group companies. First and foremost, the document analyses the risks to which employees are exposed as a result of their professional activities as well as offices layout. The document then identifies appropriate riskcontainment measures, both already implemented and to be implemented, which are aimed at maintaining an adequate level of safety. Lastly, the document lays down a timetable for the implementation of the new risk containment measures recommended in the document itself. Risk Assessment Documents are prepared by all Group companies and therefore cover all the employees of the Group. Risk analysis of the working environment and work methods and processes has not revealed any specific risks or hazards. The aforesaid risks are always addressed in the periodic updates of the aforesaid Risk Assessment Documents which, together with the Emergency Plans and evacuation ground plan, are subject to revision at pre-established intervals. As always, Telecom Italia Media S.p.A. has collected all certifications of sets, audio, video and electrical systems, etc., thus maintaining a high standard of safety in both its internal and external television productions. Regular medical visits, at precise intervals, continued relating to the risks identified in the work environments and particularly for Telecom Italia Media Broadcasting’s high-frequency engineers who every year undergo eye tests, cardiology visits with phonometric examinations and blood tests. Numerous improvements were carried out in 2011 on technological installations and office premises. In particular, almost all the air processing systems in the Via Novaro and Via della Pineta Sacchetti sites were constructed from new or completely overhauled, with the aim of improving air quality and climate control in company premises, to the full benefit and comfort of people accessing them on a daily basis (employees and visitors, as well as the numerous guests taking part in television programs). 30 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 31 Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Media Group, Sustainability Section, chapter: Health and Safety, page 94: http://www.telecomitaliamedia.it/sites/telecomitaliamedia.it/files/Annual_Financial_Report_2011.pdf 33 In addition, radical refurbishment has been carried out at the Via Novaro site involving the editorial areas of the entire premises, with the aim of improving workstation ergonomics (these have all been built from scratch) and making the time spent by employees in these areas more amenable and comfortable. The work will continue during 2012 particularly at the Via della Pineta Sacchetti site, as well as in the new office facilities acquired in the vicinity of the Via Novaro TV production center. Finally, 2011 saw the update of the “Operating Procedure for the management and correct and secure use of the company’s IT resources and services provided to users”, which can be viewed on the Intranet site dedicated to company Information Security: http://security.la7.it. The procedure refers to all users of the company’s IT systems, employees and external consultants and provides guidance on the correct and secure use of internal IT systems and services: PCs, notebooks, printers, e-mail, Internet browsing, WiFi networks, etc. The aim is to ensure that they are used securely, as well as to avoid unwitting actions by users or external IT attacks, in order to safeguard the principles of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information resources. Safeguarding privacy and personal data protection (2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report/Customers)32 “PRIVACY ISSUES HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A WIDE TRAINING PROGRAMME” In order to ensure personal data protection (Legislative Decree 193/03, known as the Privacy Code ) in the performance of its business activities, Telecom Italia has equipped itself with an organisation model that assigns central departments the responsibility for supervising correct application of the regulations in this sector at Group level. In this context, when it establishes or acquires new companies, the Parent Company provides the necessary support to identify and carry out the formalities required to comply with the relevant legal and regulatory provisions. Legal provisions and the instructions of the Italian Data Protection Authority are transposed by constantly updating the Group's regulations and policies. The System of rules for the application of privacy regulations in the Telecom Italia Group is particularly significant in this respect. It establishes the provisions and operating instructions needed to carry out the relevant formalities. In order to ensure the dissemination and correct application of these rules, intensive training activities were also carried out in 2011, in a series of 42 meetings involving around 1,400 managers and representatives of central and peripheral departments. The purpose of this programme was to disseminate a privacy culture and provide the organisations involved with the operational tools needed to reconcile the pursuit of business objectives with respect for laws and regulations. This programme mainly involved a number of Customer Operations, Consumer, Business and Top departments of the Company, including some outsourcers and commercial partners in the “push” consumer and business sales channels, focusing also on their Sales departments. Additional specialised activities related to the processing of telephone and electronic data transmission traffic and the procedures for verifying personal data security measures. During the course of 2011, Group policies regulating the technical requirements regarding the security of IT systems that handle personal data were also reviewed amongst others. With regard to the handling of customers' personal data, Telecom Italia performed the technical and procedural adjustments required to implement telephone marketing campaigns in accordance with 32 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 34 the new legal requirements (Law 166/2009 and Presidential Decree 178/2010), which allow all users listed in the directory of subscribers to be contacted by telephone without the need for prior consent, for the purpose of sending advertising material, direct sales, market research or business communications, subject to the right of users to object to telemarketing by registering on the Public Register of Objections, which has been in operation since February 1, 2011. The effective application of the regulations is monitored through a control system based on regular self-assessment procedures by those responsible for handling the data, and on sample checks carried out by the relevant central departments, based on procedures and methodologies prepared with the contribution of the Group’s auditing firm. Finally, pursuant to rule 26 of appendix B (technical rules regarding minimum security measures) of the Privacy Code, Telecom Italia declares that it has drawn up a Security Programme Document [Documento Programmatico sulla Sicurezza (DPS)] for 2011. This document describes the technical and organisational criteria adopted for the protection of shared, sensitive and judicial personal data handled with computerised tools, as well as the training plan for data handling staff. Privacy (2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Report, Sustainability Section)33 The website www.la7.it also features the full text of the Privacy Policy regulating the disclosure of operating procedures through which Telecom Italia Media protects the privacy of customers/users who consult the website www.la7.it owned and operated directly by Telecom Italia Media. The site also links to a list of the company’s privacy managers as required under current regulations. Reporting complaints and breaches (Telecom Italia web site/Sustainability/Our vision/Codes and policies)34 The governing bodies of all Telecom Italia Group companies, their managements and all those who work for them, as well as collaborators and third parties in business relationships with the Group, are required to observe Telecom Italia’s Code of Ethics within the scope of their respective powers, functions and responsibilities. I. Complaints Telecom Italia enables its stakeholders to report various kinds of problems, including those connected with the Code of Ethics, through three procedures: Reports to the manager responsible for Internal Control The manager responsible for internal control has a role in ensuring respect for the principles and values expressed in the Code of Conduct and Ethics, by handling reports from employees, collaborators, consultants, employers and third parties in business relationships with the Group on violations of laws or regulations, of the Code itself, and of internal procedures, as well as irregularities or negligence (including accounting), and promoting the most appropriate resulting initiatives, including the proposal to impose sanctions. > More on the reports to the responsible for internal control in the Report on Corporate Governance, page 1935. 33 Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Media, Sustainability Section, page 91: http://www.telecomitaliamedia.it/sites/telecomitaliamedia.it/files/Annual_Financial_Report_2011.pdf 34 Please, see the following web sites: http://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/en/sustainability/our-approach/codes-policies/reportspenalties.html ; 35 Please, see the following web site: http://2011annualreport.telecomitalia.com/attachments/report_CGR_eng_2011.pdf 35 Reports to the Board of Statutory Auditors/Audit Committee36 In implementation of the obligations which fall on the Board of Auditors in its capacity as Audit Committee to the Company, the Board of Auditors has adopted since 2005 a specific procedure for the receipt, retention and treatment of ‘whistle blowing’ reports it receives. These ‘whistle blowing’ reports may consist of: • ‘statements of violation’ from shareholders concerning what is considered to be improper behaviour, • ‘complaints’ or notifications, from anyone, shareholders or otherwise, concerning alleged anomalies, irregularities, misconduct or, more generally, any problem or issue which is thought to merit investigation by the control body, • ‘complaints’, from anyone, concerning ‘accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters’, • ‘concerns’, which may be submitted anonymously, from employees of the Company or the Group, concerning ‘questionable accounting or auditing matters’. In the period from 25 February 2011 to 29 March 2012, two complaints under Article 2408 of the Civil Code were made to the Board of Auditors. > Further information is available in the Telecom Italia’s 2011 Annual Report (page 438). Furthermore, between 25 February 2011 and 29 March 2012 the Board of Auditors received 23 “reports” (or groups of reports, treated as units in the case of several communications from a single individual, even if at separate times), which complained, for the most part, of technical service issues and failures of a commercial, accounting and administrative nature. The Control Body investigated these complaints appropriately, with the support also of the Group Compliance Officer, but no irregularities to be reported to the Shareholders’ Meeting have emerged to date (ref. Report to the Board of Statutory Auditors, Telecom Italia’s 2011 Annual Report, pages 438-439). Procedure for complaints to the Supervisory Board for behavior involving the risk of offences pursuant to Law N. 231 Employees and external collaborators shall report to the Supervisory Board any violation or suspected violation of the Organisational Model. The reporting shall be made exclusively in nonanonymous form. The Companies and Supervisory Board shall protect employees and external collaborators form any prejudicial effect that might derive from reporting. The Supervisory Board shall ensure that the identity of the reporting persons remains confidential, save for the requirements of the law. The persons in charge of departments shall report to the Supervisory Board any behaviour related to the risk of offences under Law 231, regarding operational processes coming within their jurisdiction, which they have discovered directly or through information from their collaborators. The persons in charge of the departments that officially receive information, also from judiciary police departments, regarding violations and/or offences with risks of corporate impact, shall report these to the Supervisory Board. In order to ensure the concrete implementation of the rules set forth in the Organisational Model, specific e-mail addresses have been provided and made available on corporate intranet for sending reports to the Supervisory Board having jurisdiction. II. Measures taken In 2011, with regard to Telecom Italia SpA staff, a total of 13 disciplinary measures were taken for conducts which violated the Code of Ethics. The following cases were involved: 36 Please, see the following web sites: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/documents/Governance/en/codes_principles_procedures/Complaints_proc edure_15.07.05.pdf http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/documents/Governance/en/codes_principles_procedures/Procedura_gesti one_segnalazioni_ENG.pdf 36 • activities in conflict/competition with the company • private use of corporate materials, facilities or services; • falsification or alteration of documents or equipment for undue advantages; • improper acceptance or demand for financial compensation from the customer. As for relations with suppliers, in 2011, 121 applications for registration in the Telecom Italia’ Supplier Register have been rejected due to the lack of compliance with items contained in Law 231. 37 UN Global Compact 2nd Principle: Business should ensure that they are not complicit in the human rights abuses. Social Responsibility in Telecom Italia (Telecom Italia web site/Sustainability/Our vision/Environmental and Social Policies/Social Policy)37 The commitment of Telecom Italia Group to respect and uphold human rights and labour standards is stated in its Code of Ethics38 and in the Group Organizational Model39, in accordance with the ten principles of the UN Global Compact concerning human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and fight against corruption.

Strategy (2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report:/Suppliers)42 Within the Telecom Italia Group, the procurement process is aimed at the acquisition of products and services under the best possible market conditions, at the same time guaranteeing the prerequisites of quality, safety and respect for the environment. The procurement process is based on a competitive comparison of the technical/economic offerings of suppliers who are selected on the basis of well-founded company procedures at Group level and bearing the hallmark of ethical dealings. The Group is committed to guaranteeing the quality of the procurement process and its continual improvement, in the light, too, of sustainable procurement, by obtaining the respective certification of quality. General matters (2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report:/Suppliers)43 The selection, assessment and control of Telecom Italia Group’s suppliers, for high risk procurement sectors, involves a pre-contractual qualification stage in which the economic/financial and technical/organisational characteristics are assessed. Verification of these characteristics leads to inclusion in the register of suppliers. The Group requires every supplier to make a commitment, on behalf of the company in question and any authorised sub-contractors, collaborators and employees, to observe the principles of ethics and conduct contained in the Group’s Code of Ethics. Registered companies which have received purchase orders normally undergo checks during the supply period, including incoming quality control (a requirement for the acceptance and use of the purchased goods) and monitoring of the vendor rating (systematic assessment of the supply). The Supply Chain & Real Estate (SC&RE) department is split into purchasing divisions that focus on specific sectors, so as to provide accurate responses to the requirements of internal customers and stakeholders. These expectations are constantly monitored through surveys of both internal customers and suppliers in order to verify the quality of the services delivered. More information related to the stakeholder Supplier is reported in the chapter “Value Chain Implementation” of this Communication On Progress. 42 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 43 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 39 Results and 2012 Commitments (Suppliers/2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report)44 Subject 2011 commitments Status 2012 commitments Maintaining TI Group's • Maintaining the SC&RE department's ISO SC&RE ISO 9001 9001 certifications and the ISO 14001 certifications and the ISO ISO 9001, ISO certification for infrastructure purchasing 14001 certification for 14001 and ISO and the service unit facility, extended to the infrastructure purchasing Achieved 50001 same department's real estate activities. and service unit facility certifications • Obtaining the ISO 50001 certification for activities, extended to the the Energy Purchasing & Management same department's real department. estate activities.

These channels are distinguished by their capacity to bring to this rather complex target audience topics of important social relevance, using a language and communication methods designed to engage them completely. La7 and La7d’s program schedules are also available on channels 7 (La7), 107 (La7+1), 507 (La7HD), 29 (La7d), 229 (La7d+1) and 529 (La7d HD) on the channel list, whilst MTV Italia’s schedules are available on the following channels: 8 (MTV: Music Television), 108 (MTV: Music Television+1), 67 (MTV+), 156 (MTV Classic), 157 (MTV Hits), 256 (MTV Classic+1), 257 (MTV Hits+1), 267 (MTV+ +1), 508 (MTV: Music Television HD), 555 (MTV Hits HD), 556 (MTV Classic HD) and 567 (MTV+ HD). It is important to consider the huge innovative boost that TI Media provides to its viewers, who can reach the main channel’s programs in HD and thus enjoy a high quality signal. The distribution of television content is also ensured on platforms other than the specific television channel, thanks to applications that allow programs to be enjoyed through “non linear” program scheduling. The Web Channel is covered primarily through the La7.it website (www.la7.it) which presents detailed information and extracts of La7 and La7d complete programming. Actual mini-websites dedicated to each new production are created when television seasons are launched, offering numerous tools for interacting with the public, as well as sections dedicated to videos. Live streamed events also gather important feedback allowing users to make live commentary and communicate with one another and with those responsible for La7 productions. A very important target for interaction with viewers was achieved in 2011 when the ‘Social Connect’ function was introduced giving the opportunity to users, who are active on the La7.it website, to interconnect with their friends on Facebook and Twitter. 43 Implementation n of the Web b TV channe el continuess through La a7.TV (www.la7.tv), which shows, over o the Internet and d in full-scre een televisioon quality, the original programmin p ng produced and broadccast by La7 L and La7 7d, allowing users to enjjoy content aired over the past seve en days at any a time of day.d The TV Web Channel C atures highly developed technologgies that ensure high quality in the fea tran nsmission off its contentt and are alsso ahead off its major competitors c thanks to thhe use of Fllash Videeo technologgies (Adobe)) and MPEG4 4-based enccoding tools..

Thanks to an n exclusive partnership agreeme ent signed in Deccember 2010, La7 is th he first broadcaster in Ittaly to havee its own completely bra anded channel, 44 with personalized graphics and specific functions for all programs and with all the editorial content of the television channel, in its two La7 and La7d versions. This means that the opening page for La7’s YouTube channel, featuring a flash widget allowing the promotion and direct access to the television shows, represents a useful and easy-to-navigate information platform for users since it is implemented in continuity with the network graphics (e.g., TgLa7, Piazzapulita, Italialand, Invasioni Barbariche, etc.). The result is a platform inside YouTube that allows La7 to give extra service to its public and cover the most important video portal in the world in an original way. *** TI MEDIA broadcasts La7 channel in Standard Definition (SD) on the channel 7 of the Digital Terrestrial. Moreover, TI Media launched an experimental phase about a year ago in which it began to broadcast (on channel 507) the La7 programs in HD Upscaled quality. The SD content is submitted to a process that artificially increases the resolution and therefore the quality. As from September 2011, a new phase of experimentation will begin where La7 will start to air programs in the prime time slots in HD Native. It will be an absolute innovation in Italy. This important change was implemented thanks to the collaboration of the entire television technological chain. The “revolution” began a few years ago with an important road map and increasingly growing investments. The first step was the conversion of the Production Center aimed at creating programming in full-HD 1080p format (1920x1024). Gradually all the equipment along the technological chain was replaced, from the filming systems to broadcasting apparatus. Replacements concerned, in particular, cameras, sorting matrix, satellite receiving systems, fiber optic receiving systems, recording systems, graphics systems, video servers, monitors, editing and storage systems. The wiring of the entire system was also realized in a 3G configuration. Video signal production with these new methods will also allow produce and broadcast the audio signals in multi-channel format, from stereo to Dolby Digital, 2.0 and 5.1. One of the most critical and important phases of this evolution was the HD upgrade of all the broadcasting systems or: replacement of the satellite and fiber optic receiving systems, the sorting matrix, the Play Out Engine systems, the recording and control systems, and the storage and management of audio signals in Dolby Digital. A number of very important innovations were introduced in the second half of the year as regards the productions carried out in our Rome Production Center in Via Novaro. The native HD transmission of prime-time programs such as “Ottoemezzo” and “In Onda”, using our technical facilities already set up for this essential changeover. The quality level has risen significantly due to this innovation. 45 Virtual set designs have been tried out inside Television Studios and used, in this initial phase, by the “Atlantide” and “Prossima Fermata” programs. The space freed up from the old stage sets has meant that additional daily discussion programs have been able to be introduced in the studio, optimizing space and resources and increasing productivity. The chain allowing video-recorded services to be implemented has been finalized and upgraded; in fact, the process, apart from in exceptional circumstances is carried out completely in File format, an essential requisite for obtaining a completely tapeless supply chain. In this context training courses have been planned and carried out both for technical and production personnel on the new platform for managing ingestion flows, editing, research and archive consolidation. There has been a significant increase in support for our Web platforms with the publication in real time of news and other information programs. Work has been started on constructing the Production Center’s new IT Center, with the consequent rearrangement and optimization of working areas in the via Umberto Novaro production center. Finally a number of staff posts have been consolidated to ensure the continuity of news-related activities. Regarding shooting at external television Studios, all productions are carried out in Full HD, using selected partners with a high international profile. The television cameras and optics used, the fully HD production chain with redundant structures and the signal’s transfer via fiber optics or satellite with band supporting the enormous quantity of HD data combine to ensure that our programs reach the viewer in the best quality possible among unencrypted TV broadcasters. Programs such as “Piazza pulita”, “L’Infedele”, “Invasioni Barbariche” and the Crozza, Dandini and Paolini shows confirm our network’s success, not only due to the wealth of content but also, undoubtedly, to the sharpness of the images and perfect visual definition. Particular mention should be made of lighting system construction since HD recording requires technical lighting devices and solutions that can only be provided by highly professional personnel and equipment. In addition, the new LED technology technical lighting equipment allows significant energy saving compared to the past when incandescent lamps were used. External filming, through the ENG troupes, also ensure very high quality levels. Our main programs and shows such as “Missione Natura”, “Atlantide”, “La Valigia dei Sogni”, etc. include standard HD broadcasts, using very high-performance technologies and recording on media such as XDCam discs or memory cards that ensure high quality and virtually no critical aspects. The environmental impact is also reduced due to the fact that they can be reused and so there is a reduced quantity of hazardous materials (tapes) to be disposed of. There are continued troupe-related economic savings thanks to the ongoing attention paid to this issue. Hugely important changes have taken place in the Broadcasting Area overall. The operating Area dedicated to Broadcasting has been completely restructured, so that playout is possible for Full HD programs. The restructuring concerned Group and third party channel playout, teleporting, signal distribution, tape acquisition, quality control, third party warehouses with related flow and resource optimization. In this context particular attention was paid to setting up new playout channels; a new third party channel (CanalOne) has been purchased; the Broadcasting’s IT Center has been completely redone, with cabling already in line with a future changeover to 3G featuring fiber connections with a significant saving on the material used. 46 So all the equipment has now been changed over to native HD, whilst keeping the old SD formats fully compatible both in transmission and reproduction terms; this area has also seen significant progress in the changeover to the tapeless system, where magnetic tapes are not used for viewing, editing, playout and conservation of images; this new workflow will produce significant savings both in terms of materials purchases (tapes), and their storage, and the disposal of materials that are no longer suitable. *** Following the switch-offs which took place in 2010 Telecom Italia Media Broadcasting’s three multiplexes achieved coverage of the Italian population of 90.1% (Timb1), 94.2% (Timb2) and 75% (Timb3), respectively. The analog coverage of channel La7, following the above switch-offs, reaches 21.1% of the population, whilst the MTV channel reaches 20.2%. In 2011, the analog network management service continued for the La7 and MTV networks solely in the national territory were the switch-off has yet to take place. TIMB 1 TIMB 2 TIMB 3 Advertising Self-Disciplinary Agreement (2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Annual Report, Sustainability Section)46 The Advertising Self-Regulatory Code by the Advertising Self-regulatory Institute (IAP) was first issued in 1966 and is now in its 53rd edition (effective as of November 21, 2011). The Code is aimed at enforcing the principle that while commercial communications play a particularly useful role in the economic process, it must meet certain public service requirements, especially in light of its influence on consumers. The Code defines the activities that fail to meet the aforesaid 46 Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Media Sustainability Section, page 90: http://www.telecomitaliamedia.it/sites/telecomitaliamedia.it/files/Annual_Financial_Report_2011.pdf 47 requirements, albeit without conflicting with the applicable laws, and lays down the rules and regulations with which all forms of advertising must comply, as far as customs and communications activities are concerned. The Agreement is binding for users, agencies, advertising and marketing consultants, managers of advertising vehicles of all kinds and all those who have accepted it directly or through an association. Telecom Italia Media is a party to the Agreement through the association FRT. Self-Regulatory Code on Sports and the Media (2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Annual Report, Sustainability Section)47 The Code on Sports and the Media, aimed at the self-regulation of information regarding sports, was signed on July 2007 by the major public and private broadcasting companies and all broadcasters’ associations, the Journalists’ Association, the Italian Press Federation, Italian Athletic Press Union and the Italian Newspaper Publishers’ Federation. The parties to the Code undertake to spread the positive values of sport, condemn, in the public opinion, violence relating to athletic events, especially football, and not to transmit messages that may incite or legitimize acts of violence. Self-Regulation Principles and Procedures for Product Placement (2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Annual Report, Sustainability Section)48 In November 2010, pursuant to Article 40-bis, paragraph 5, of Legislative Decree No. 177/05, Telecom Italia Media S.p.A. and MTV Italia S.r.l., along with their respective advertising agencies, Cairo Communication S.p.A. and MTV Pubblicità S.r.l., adopted documents that lay out the general principles and methods of implementation to be observed by the companies and their respective agencies when placing products in programming produced or commissioned by the above companies in accordance with the cited legislation. Voluntary Self-Regulation of Reporting on Ongoing Legal Proceedings in the Broadcast Media (2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Annual Report, Sustainability Section)49 In accordance with the provisions of the Self-Regulatory Code governing reporting on ongoing legal proceedings in the broadcast media, signed on May 21, 2009 by Telecom Italia Media and the representatives of RAI, Mediaset, the associations of local broadcasters FRT and Aeranti Corallo, the National Press Federation and the National Order of Journalists, a committee was formed on December 17, 2009 to investigate possible violations of the Code and implement any corrective measures. The Code’s objective is to temper the right to information concerning legal proceedings with the respect for inviolable personal rights through the observance of the principles of objectivity, thoroughness and impartiality. Our relations with Institutions (Telecom Italia web site/Sustainability: Our Stakeholders/Institutions) 50 The Telecom Italia Group is determined to continue its collaborative and transparent relations with national and supranational institutions in order to facilitate dialogue on matters of mutual interest and to ensure the Group’s viewpoint is faithfully represented. 47 Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Sustainability Section: http://www.telecomitaliamedia.it/sites/telecomitaliamedia.it/files/Annual_Financial_Report_2011.pdf 48 Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Sustainability Section: http://www.telecomitaliamedia.it/sites/telecomitaliamedia.it/files/Annual_Financial_Report_2011.pdf 49 Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Sustainability Section: http://www.telecomitaliamedia.it/sites/telecomitaliamedia.it/files/Annual_Financial_Report_2011.pdf 50 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/en/sustainability/stakeholders/institutions.html 48 The key stakeholders of the Telecom Italia Group are: • the central national institutions: Parliament, Government, Ministries, Public Administration; • local institutions and their representative associations: Regions, Provinces, Municipalities, Comunità montane , the National Association of Italian Municipalities (ANCI), the Union of Italian Provinces (UPI); • the Italian Communications Authority (AGCOM), the Italian Competition and Market Authority (AGCM) and the Italian Data Protection Authority; • European and international institutions: the European Commission and its regulation committees, the Council and the European Parliament, BEREC (Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communication), the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development); • the United Nations (UN): particularly the Global Compact, UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme), UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), ITU (International Telecommunication Union) and the other UN agencies (e.g. UNHCR). Our relations with Competitors (Telecom Italia web site/Sustainability: Our Stakeholders/Competitors)51 The (Telecom Italia) Group’s companies are committed to promoting fair competition, which is considered to be in the interests of the Group and of all market operators, customers and stakeholders in general. They promote and participate in initiatives and projects with competitors, as well as in technical round tables and activities organised by trade associations. … Our activities with Competitors (Telecom Italia web site/Sustainability: Our Stakeholders/Competitors/Our relations with Competitors)52 … Telecom Italia and Telecom Italia Media are founding members of the HD Forum, which pursues the objective of promoting and disseminating high definition technology in Italy. Membership of the Forum allows the company to keep abreast of the activities of competitors (particularly Sky, Mediaset and Fastweb) in the field of high definition and the promotion of initiatives addressing regulation and standardisation issues. TI Media, as a member of the Presidency Committee, is part of the Radio and Television Federation, which brings together 150 local TV and radio broadcasters and is a member of DGTVi, together with Rai, Mediaset and D-Free. A representative of TI Media sits on the Board of Directors of DGTVi. Telecom Italia Media has a 3.33% shareholding in Auditel and has a representative on the Board of Directors and another on the Technical Committee. Auditel is the only body recognised in Italy for audience figures, even among advertising agencies, who determine the value of advertising slots on individual television channels based on the “data” recorded by Auditel. TI Media participates in the work of the CNID (Italian National Digital Committee) which brings together all the representatives of the digital market value chain and is chaired by the Minister for Economic Development, alongside two deputy chairmen (an AGCOM Commissioner and the Chairman of DGTVì). The Committee operates through four separate groups in as many areas: Network Technology and Development; Monitoring and Data; Communications and Customer Assistance; Specific Problems in the Public Broadcasting Service. In 2002, TI Media and MTV subscribed to the self-regulation code for TV and minors, as part of which a committee for the protection of children on TV was established with responsibility for verifying fulfilment of the undertakings given under the Code. TI Media has been elected as the 51 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/en/sustainability/stakeholders/competitors.html 52 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/documents/Sostenibilita/en/stakeholders/competitors/Our%20activities% 20with%20competitors_2011.pdf 49 broadcasters’ representative and is therefore a privileged observer in respect of institutions for the purpose of maintaining a constructive dialogue with the sector. As of August 2009, Tivù, a company in which TI Media has a 3.5% stake, began to provide commercial services for unscrambled programme broadcasting by satellite with the aim of promoting a single platform for terrestrial digital and satellite services (Tivùsat). With regard to the free satellite platform, we can report that 1,300,000 cards had been activated as of the end of December 2011. With regard to the self-regulation code on the reporting of legal disputes in radio and television broadcasts, a committee was set up in December 2009 to identify any potential infringements of the code and to take the appropriate corrective action. The objective of the Code is to reconcile the right to information about legal proceedings with respect for the inalienable rights of the individual, by observing principles of objectivity, completeness and impartiality. The Italian Competition and Market Authority (AGCM) (Telecom Italia web site/Sustainability: Our Stakeholders/Competitors/Our relations with Competitors)53 In the context of competition and consumer protection measures, Telecom Italia Group interacts with the Antitrust authority both in a preventative way and during proceedings launched by it. For prior information purposes, in addition to responding to the requests regularly submitted by the Authority in performing the tasks assigned to it by Law 287/90 and the Consumer Code, the company's departments periodically organise meetings for the exchange of information. The objective is to facilitate understanding of the development of the market and the effects on the Authority's area of responsibility, in order to ensure transparency. The areas in which prior information is provided include the development of the Group’s offer, the company’s position on strategic issues such as the development of the access network and Net Neutrality, the development of the criteria adopted for pricing in the markets in which the Company is in a dominant position, and the technical and economic characteristics of certain offers disputed by competitors. In the event of dispute proceedings being launched, the Group presents its case in the appropriate forums, in some cases presenting the Authority with undertakings that will reduce the alleged anticompetitive aspects at the centre of the proceedings. After having assessed these undertakings, the Authority may make them compulsory and end the proceedings without imposing any financial penalty. Within the Company there are preventive controls on processes with potentially significant impacts in Antitrust terms such as, for example, the drawing-up of marketing plans, the development of contracts, conditions for the provision of telecommunication services, the development of the company’s information systems. The controls are aimed at ensuring that the operational management of the processes take into consideration these potential impacts. In order to raise awareness and disseminate a correct approach in this respect, a management training programme launched in 2010 on the application of competition rules was completed in 2011. AGCOM (2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Annual Report, Sustainability Section)54 The Company’s Intranet site features a link to the AGCOM website so as to allow for immediate, easy consultation of all sector-specific regulations and resolutions. For an update on AGCOM’s activities that have an impact on the Company, refer to the Telecom Italia Media Group's Report on Operations, specifically the section concerning the Regulatory Framework. 53 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/documents/Sostenibilita/en/stakeholders/competitors/Our%20activity%20 with%20AGCM_2011.pdf 54 Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Sustainability Section: http://www.telecomitaliamedia.it/sites/telecomitaliamedia.it/files/Annual_Financial_Report_2011.pdf 50 Shareholders (2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Annual Report, Sustainability Section:)55 In 2011, the Telecom Italia Media Group continued its commitment to bring constant and timely financial communication, ensuring transparent and reliable reporting on the consolidated financial results of the Group and the individual companies (La7, MTV, TIMB), in accordance with the interests of analysts and rules established by the Authorities in charge at the government and financial market surveillance bodies. Towards this end, information and data are made available to the public through press releases and the publication of institutional documents both print or online (compulsory and optional quarterly operating and financial statements — such as the Sustainability Report — and documents providing information on general meetings and specific transactions effected on the market). Given the increasing use of computerized communications, Telecom Italia Media has continued to update its website www.telecomitaliamedia.it, which features a section dedicated exclusively to investors. The information is updated in real time and relates, among other things, to the company’s structure, shareholder body, stock market performance, major corporate events, past operating and financial data, annual and quarterly financial reports. The subjects Corporate Governance Rules and Sustainability are dealt with in separate sections of the website. During the course of the year, institutional meetings with the financial community (analysts, national and international institutional investors) have been organized. In particular, quarterly conference calls and attendances at group and one-to-one meetings with national and international Funds, combined with the day-to-day dealings with all the financial analysts and institutional investors, through direct and telephone meetings, so as to discuss matters significant for the purposes of their analyses and management of the equity investment. Strategy (2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report: Shareholders)56 The (Telecom Italia) Group companies are fully aware of the importance of supplying accurate information about their activities to the market, investors and the Community in general.

Child protection (2011Telecom Italia Sustainability Report: Customers)79 The Telecom Italia Group’s companies have undertaken numerous initiatives in order to protect children from content that may harm their psychological and physical development (e.g. content that is violent, racist, offensive to religious sentiment, pornography etc.). The Telecom Italia Group adopts precise guidelines for classifying and checking distributed content. These cover both the content offered directly by Group companies and content owned by third parties offering their own services on space acquired within Telecom Italia's portals. These guidelines are regularly updated to take account of new codes, standards and platforms. In Italy, in accordance with current regulations and codes of conduct signed by the Group, filtering systems and procedures are implemented aimed at preventing children from accessing adult content on all the Group's service platforms (IPTV, web TV, generalist portals, WAP services, television broadcasters). … Furthermore, the Telecom Italia Group has adopted an organisational model in accordance with Legislative Decree 231/2001, which defines the tools required to oversee and anticipate offences, particularly the dissemination of child pornography, as well as to ensure the organisational/disciplinary management of computer crimes. For this purpose, Telecom Italia has fielded resources, technologies, processes and instruments to prevent and combat “abuse”, meaning any activity committed in violation of the rules of conduct and legislation that governs the use of network services, digital systems or means of communication in general. … Protection of Minors (2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Annual Report: Regulatory Framework (extract from)80 (2011 updating) The Romani Decree (2010) has extended the scope of application of the protection of minors in particular by extending the Code of Conduct adopted by analogue broadcasters to all broadcasting platforms and all services (therefore including free to air channels, pay channel and on demand audiovisual services).

In line with Telecom Italia Group policies, the managerial incentive system (MBO) was launched involving the most highly regarded managers and professionals, with the aim of guiding them towards the Company’s short-term strategic objectives. In 2011, the system covered all Senior Managers and about 75% of Middle Managers. The 2011 incentive plan was based on three types of objectives: • economic/financial objectives of the Telecom Italia Group (common for all), represented by the “TI Group Net Financial Position” and “TI Group EBITDA”; 67 • economic objectives of the Telecom Italia Media Group, represented by the “EBITDA”, with a “threshold” value relating to Sales to Third Parties; • specific objectives, relating to the role covered and responsibilities assigned. Quantitative parameters were primarily used when assigning specific objectives.

In order to ensure the effective and sustainable management of operational processes characterised by particular environmental impacts, Telecom Italia has equipped itself with an Environmental Management System (Sistema di Gestione Ambientale SGA) which is ISO 14001 certified. … Application of the procedures is verified by means of internal audits of company departments and external companies. Relevant stakeholders (The Environment/2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report)96 The environment stakeholder representative is identified as the future generations who are entitled to live in a world that is not compromised by the negative effects resulting from the development of previous ones. The interests of this collective person are identified in the demands made by: • national and international environmental organisations; • national and supranational institutions; • the community in general, particularly in the areas in which Telecom Italia operates; • industry associations and non-profit organisations dealing with issues relating to the environment. These include the following in particular: CSR Europe, European Academy of Business in Society (EABIS), European Telecommunications Network Operators’ Association (ETNO) in ETNO Telecom Italia chairs both the Association and the “Sustainability” working group -, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT), International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Telecom Italia is attentive to the demands expressed by stakeholders interested in protecting the environment and has developed various channels of communication with them, including AVoiComunicare, the Festival of Science, the Venice Future Centre and the dedicated pages of the Group Intranet/Internet site, in addition to formal and informal meetings with these stakeholders. 95 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 96 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 71 Telecom Italia also promotes and in some cases coordinates national and international projects on this issue. Atmospheric emissions (2011, 2010, 2009 Telecom Italia Group Sustainability Reports/The Environment/Environmental performance) 97 Atmospheric emissions98 Greenhouse gas emissions by Telecom Italia and the Group consist almost exclusively of carbon dioxide and are due to the use of fossil fuels for heating, transport, electricity generation, purchase of electricity produced by third parties and staff travel (for business trips and commuting between home and work). In addition to these, dispersals of hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons (HCFCs and HFCs) from air conditioning plants are also considered and converted into kg of CO2 equivalent. As with the classification of energy consumption for atmospheric emissions use is made of the Global Reporting Initiative GRI Version 3 guidelines, which refer to the definitions of the GHG Protocol, distinguishing between direct emissions (Scope1: use of fossil fuels for vehicles, heating, power generation), indirect emissions (Scope2: purchase of electricity for industrial and civil use) and other indirect emissions (Scope3). Unless otherwise stated, the atmospheric emissions recorded in this Report have been calculated based on the latest coefficients made available by the GHG Protocol99; emissions in previous years have been recalculated based on these coefficients in order to allow comparison. The situation related to Telecom Italia Media Group is reported below: ATMOSPHERIC EMISSIONS % Changes Telecom Italia Media Group 2011 vs 2011 vs 2011 2010 2009 Total CO2 emissions under Scope1 GRI kg 782.352 4,80 -10,25 Total CO2 emissions under Scope2 GRI kg 9.731.831 -13,19 -17,18 Total other CO2 emissions under Scope3 GRI kg 211.897 N/A N/A Total CO2 emissions kg 10.726.080 ** ** (**) value not calculated since 2009 data on CO2 emissions under Scope3 GRI was not available. 97 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 98Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 99 Emissions relating to the consumption of electricity purchased in the Italian market have been calculated by using the latest coefficient (2008) calculated by the GHG Protocol which considers the national energy mix equal to 398 grams of CO2/kWh. For Argentina a similar coefficient has been calculated and published by the Secretaría de Energía de la Nación Argentina. The coefficient is equal to 541 grams of CO2/kWh. For Brazil, the average coefficient for 2011 has been used, which has been calculated and published by the local Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Innovação. The coefficient is equal to 29 grams of CO2/kWh . 72 Climate change (2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report: The Environment)100 The subject of climate change has moved from the agenda of the scientific community, which has identified the impact on human life, to the international political agenda, which is trying to find methods which the various countries can agree upon to control its most negative effects. The subject was also discussed at the latest summit in Durban (United Nation Climate Change Conference UNFCCC COP17) with the aim of limiting the global temperature increase to +2°C, restoring carbon dioxide emissions expected in 2100 to pre-industrial level(101. There are many market drivers that increase the importance of carbon management for companies: operating costs, energy costs, the growing economic impact of carbon management (the telecommunication sector is not currently part of the emission trading schemes(102)), brand reputation issues and the risks associated with the energy supply. In addition to these, there is the financial risk connected with the physical impact resulting from climate change, competitive positioning, the demands of investors and the expectations of customers. The requirement for effective carbon management is governed by additional drivers that depend greatly on the specific market, including the expectations of employees, talent turnover and retention systems for particularly prestigious positions. All of this makes carbon” management strategic for companies, will tend to increase its importance in the coming years and will require increasingly strong integration with the business as of now, becoming a long-term priority. …. The Group's approach to the fight against climate change is based on three synergic levels of action: • reducing its own direct and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases; • limiting the emissions of other sectors and customers in general by supporting virtualisation and the provisions of services that promote new ways of working, learning, travelling and living; • contributing to disseminating a culture based on a correct approach to environmental issues inside and outside the company. Reducing emissions The environmental impact of Telecom Italia Media in terms of CO2 emissions is determined, as shown in the preceding paragraphs, by direct emissions from the use of fossil fuels, indirect emissions through the procurement of electricity and other indirect emissions due for example to home-work commuting and air travel by staff. Electromagnetic emissions (The Environment/Environmental performance/2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report)103 The actions of the Telecom Italia Group on the subject of electromagnetic emissions are essentially: • careful and proper management of its equipment during its entire life cycle, in compliance with current regulations and internal standards of efficiency and safety; 100 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 101For more detailed information go to: unfccc.int/2860.php. 102The emissions market is an administrative tool used to control emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases internationally by listing the emissions themselves and trading emissions quotas between states: European Directive 2003/87/EC establishes a system for trading greenhouse gas emissions quotas in order to allow the undertakings given in the Kyoto Protocol to be fulfilled more effectively using an economically efficient tool (Emission Trading Scheme – EU-ETS). As of January 1, 2005, the carbon dioxide emissions market (EU-ETS) formally came into force, involving production sectors with high levels of CO2 emissions. European companies operating in the sectors specified in the directive will be required to limit their emissions according to the requirements of their national allocation plans for two reference periods: 2005-2007 and 2008-2012. 103 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 73 • deployment of, and constant research into, the latest technological instruments for checks and controls. Systematic monitoring has continued of the levels of electromagnetic emissions in the installations of La7, MTV and Telecom Italia Media in order to guarantee that legal limits are respected and high safety standards are maintained. For the Telecom Italia Media Group in particular, such monitoring is related to electromagnetic field levels for protection of the population and the levels of exposure of workers. According to the checks carried out in Italy, the electromagnetic emissions generated by La7 and MTV are well within legal limits. …. 74 UN Global Compact 8th Principle: Business should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility.

The Internal Control System includes the Organisational Model pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231 of June 8, 2001, aimed at preventing offences such as corruption, extortion and corporate offences. Sustainability issues are subject to the supervision of the Committee for Internal Control and Corporate Governance, which performs guidance and control of sustainability activities in general, including projects conducted by the Telecom Italia Foundation, to ensure they are consistent with the Group’s ethical values. Risk Management (2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report:/Shareholders)119 In order to ensure a global approach to risk management, the Telecom Italia Group has adopted a process inspired by the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework120. This is a corporate risk governance tool used to identify, assess and manage risks. At the heart of the system is the Group Risk Management Committee which is chaired and coordinated by the head of the “Administration, Finance and Control & International Development” department and is made up of: • the Managing Director Domestic or Director President TIM Brasil or Chief Executive Telecom Argentina or Vice President and Managing Director Telecom Italia Media, depending on the matters being dealt with; • the heads of the Legal Affairs, Human Resources and Organization, Supply Chain & Real Estate, Security departments; • the Group Compliance Officer; • the head of the Risk Management department within Administration, Finance and Control & International Development. The head of the Risk Management department coordinates the Committee. Heads of other departments are involved depending on the specific matters being dealt with. The Committee meets every three months (or when specifically required) and is intended to govern the Group risk management process based on the ERM approach, which is designed to ensure the operational continuity of the company's business. This approach involves: • an assessment of the risk profile by management, covering both business processes and strategic objectives; • risk mapping with a specific focus on the ones deemed to be most significant; • the establishment of inter-departmental working group defined by the Risk Management Committee for the implementation of dedicated mitigation action plans and control Key Risk Indicators. The process is updated on an annual basis (or more frequently) at the discretion of the Risk Management Committee. During 2011: 118 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 119Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Group Sustainability Report: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 120Enterprise Risk Management, 2004 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 87 • the stages required by the ERM 2010 cycle were completed, creating a more mature risk management process, defining action plans for the main risks and monitoring these using a quarterly risk dashboard; • the 2011 ERM cycle was launched; • the Group's 2011 corporate risk profile was defined (excluding Telecom Argentina) which involved completing the analysis phase and part of the evaluation phase (risk assessment and allocation). The subsequent phases are expected to be completed during 2012; • in September, the Group Risk Management Committee approved the updated version of the Telecom Italia Group Risk Management Guidelines and the Enterprise Risk Management in the Telecom Italia Group organisational procedure, which are intended to provide Group companies with a reference tool for day-to-day risk management activities and to regulate the ERM process. Corporate Governance (extract) (2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report: Shareholders)121 Internal control and corporate governance committee∗ “THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE OVERSEES CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACTIVITIES” The Committee for internal control and corporate governance, present in the governance structure of the Company since 2000, has the following consultative and advisory functions. The Committee: • assists the Board and, upon request, the Managing Directors in performing their duties related to the Company's internal control system; • evaluates the work plan prepared by the internal control manager, who sends its periodic reports (on a quarterly basis, with updates each time with respect to the most significant results of the activities performed) to the Committee; • assesses, together with the Company heads of administration and the executive in charge of preparing the company’s accounting reports, having consulted the Statutory Auditor, the correct application of accounting principles and their consistent application within the Group for the purpose of preparing consolidated financial statements; • evaluates the work plan submitted for review and the results described in the report and any letter of suggestion from the Statutory Auditor; • reports to the Board on its activities at each following Board meeting, and on the adequacy of the internal control system upon approval of the annual financial statements and half-yearly report. The Committee also, • keeps a watch on the effectiveness of the statutory auditing process, on compliance with the procedure for carrying out transactions with related parties, and on the observance and periodic updating of the corporate governance rules; • expresses its opinion on the appointment, revocation and conferment of powers to the internal control manager and the executive in charge of preparing company’s accounting documents; • defines the procedure and timing of the “board performance evaluation”; • performs other duties assigned to it from time to time by the Board of Directors. In particular the Board at its meeting following the Shareholders' Meeting of April 13, 2011 assigned to the Internal Control and Corporate Governance Committee the function of high-level supervision 121 Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Group Sustainability Report: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 88 in the matter of corporate social responsibility. The composition of the Committee, as well as information on its activities in 2011, can be found in the full text of the Report. …. ∗…the process of bringing the internal Company rules into line with the amendments to the Self-Regulatory Code of Borsa Italiana, introduced on December 5, 2011, is in progress. Organizational model pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001 “THE ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL 231 IS AIMED AT PREVENTING OFFENCES THAT CAN RESULT IN LIABILITY FOR THE COMPANY” The internal control system is complemented by the so-called Organizational Model 231 , i.e. a model of organization and management adopted pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, aimed at preventing offences that can result in liability for the Company. This Organizational Model is comprised of: • the Code of Conduct and Ethics of the Telecom Italia Group, where the general principles (transparency, fairness, loyalty) that guide the Company in the organization and conduct of business are indicated; • the general principles of internal control tools to provide a guarantee with regard to the objectives of efficiency and operational effectiveness, reliability of financial and management information, compliance with laws and regulations, safeguarding of assets against possible fraud; • the principles of conduct , which consist of specific rules for relations with representatives of public administration and for all fulfilments and activities of a corporate nature, and • the internal control checklists that describe business processes at risk of crime, any crimes committed in relation to them, the preventive control activities aimed at avoiding the related risks. The internal control schemes have been compiled in accordance with the following basic principles: (i) the separation of roles in undertaking the principal activities involved in business processes; (ii) the traceability of decisions, to allow for identification of specific points of responsibility and the motivations for the decisions themselves; and (iii) the objectification of the decision-making processes, so that decisions are not to be purely subjective considerations, but based on preestablished criteria. The Organizational Model is a dynamic instrument, which affects the corporate operation, which in turn must be constantly checked and updated in the light of feedback, as well as the evolution of the regulatory framework. During 2011, it was therefore subject to updating and refinement; in particular, an internal control checklist was introduced aimed at preventing the risk 231 resulting from the inclusion of environmental crimes in the category of offences relevant for the purposes of Organizational Model 231. The amendments were drafted by a managerial committee called Steering Committee 231, and prepared by the Supervisory Board. The latter (supported in its activities by appropriate offices) oversees the operation and observance of the Organizational Model and reports on it to the Board, to the internal control and corporate governance Committee and the Board of Auditors. About the composition of the Supervisory Board please refer to the full text of the Report that includes information about the following topics: • Appointment of statutory auditors • Executive responsible for preparing the corporate accounting documents • Risk management and internal control system relating to the financial reporting process • Interests of Directors and transactions with related parties. 89 Reports to the manager responsible for internal control in Telecom Italia (2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report:/Human Resources/Listening activities and projects)122 Pursuant to article 7 of the Code of Ethics and Conduct, the Whistleblowing Procedure , published on the intranet and updated during 2010123, is applicable to all Telecom Italia Group companies. Administered by the manager responsible for internal control in Telecom Italia, this procedure ensures the receipt, analysis and handling of reports on matters concerning the internal control system, company information, fraud and other matters (violations of the Code of Ethics, mobbing practices, theft, security etc.). Reports may be submitted in any form (in hard copy, electronically, by fax, etc.) by employees (including top management), associates, consultants, freelance workers, as well as third parties who have business relations with the Group. Each report is analysed and the outcomes of the proceedings are conveyed to the top management of the company, to the statutory control bodies and to the company departments concerned, ensuring complete confidentiality for the individuals making the reports. Report of the Board of Statutory Auditors to the shareholders’ meeting of Telecom Italia S.p.A. pursuant to article 153 of legislative decree 58/1998 (2011 Telecom Italia Annual Report)124 … 13. The internal control system is a set of rules, procedures and organizational structures that, through a process of identifying, measuring, managing and monitoring the principal risks, allows the sound, fair and consistent operation of the company in line with the pre-established objectives. …. The oversight role of the internal control manager is directed towards expressing an assessment in terms of reasonable certainty about the capacity of the internal control system to impact on the actual achievement of the objectives assigned to individual company structures (effectiveness profile), taking account of the rational use of resources for their realization (efficiency profile) in the light of the (qualitative/quantitative) risk factors present and the probability of their affecting the achievement of those objectives. For the purposes of an overall assessment of the internal control system, the Manager takes as a methodological reference for his interventions the following components of the CoSo Report125: • “Control environment” and “Information and Communication”, which have a significant impact on, inter alia, oversight of the compliance and auditing methodologies, dissemination of the control culture and consolidation of the ethical values of the business; • “Risk assessment” and “Control activities”, which require a process of identifying and managing audit projects, as well as oversight of the compliance of processes and business operations with applicable laws and internal procedures of reference; • Monitoring , which requires the continuous performance of activities to control the business areas at the greatest risk, aimed at determining the effective overcoming of the weaknesses reported. 122 Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Group Sustainability Report (chapter: Human Resources: Listening activities and projects/Reports to the manager responsible for internal control in Telecom Italia): http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 123 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/documents/Governance/en/codes_principles_procedures/Procedura_gesti one_segnalazioni_ENG.pdf 124 Please, see the following web site (page 445 and the “Section Two”/page 452): http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/investors/Annual_Reports/2011/TelecomItaliaGrou pAnnualReport2011.pdf 125 Control model developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations (CoSO) of the Treadway Commission. 90 The Board of Auditors closely supervised the internal control system adopted by the Company and the Group, evaluating its adequacy, also through periodic meetings with the Manager responsible for internal control and with the audit and compliance structures, the statutory auditor, interviews with management and with the head of Enterprise Risk Management, joint meetings or attendance at meetings of the Committee for Internal Control and Corporate Governance and by acquiring documentation. Up until 31 December 2011 the role of internal control manager was assigned to Telecom Italia Audit & Compliance Services S.c.a r.l., represented by its Vice Chairman (ex Chairman) and General Manager, Federico Maurizio d’Andrea. In August the Boards of Directors of Telecom Italia and Telecom Italia Audit & Compliance Services approved a plan for merger by incorporation of the latter into the former, in accordance with the policy of reviewing the control governance structures of the Group, which concentrates activities and expertise in the matter of internal controls in the Parent company. The process of incorporation of Telecom Italia Audit & Compliance Services concluded with the drafting of the deed of merger in December 2011 and the incorporation consequently took effect from 1 January 2012. In its meeting on 1 December 2011, given this process of integration, and in substantial continuity with the pre-existing situation, the Board of Directors of Telecom Italia assigned the role of internal control manager to Mr. D’Andrea, as Manager of the Audit Division of the Company. Favourable opinions were expressed on this choice by the Board of Auditors and the Committee for Internal Control and Corporate Governance. The Board of Auditors has monitored the activities of the internal control manager, noting a positive evolution (in the various contexts) of the elements that make up the internal control system, and the fact that most of the improvements identified have been implemented by the management within the timescales specified. In general, audits have found that the principal improvement processes have regarded projects on network quality, further strengthening the security of the systems and network, commercial processes and oversight of subsidiary companies. In addition the audits have triggered improvements in the Group procedures system. In this context the Board of Auditors has also noted the overall assessment of the internal control system expressed by the internal control manager, which is reported in full below: “With reference to the specific operational contexts analysed, and considering the system weaknesses of various intensity identified by the audits on the one hand, and the regular (and practically integral) implementation of the defined improvement actions on the other, I believe that the current internal control system, as a whole, has reduced risk profiles to a level that is physiologically acceptable for the correct functioning of the processes. …. 91 7) Value Chain Implementation Criterion 21: Implementation of the Global Compact principles in the value chain. The Code Of Ethics (Telecom Italia web site/Sustainability/Codes and Policies/Code of Ethics)126 … Article 4 – Relations with Stakeholders … 4.2 ter Suppliers Group companies are committed to ensuring that purchasing procedures are directed to obtaining products and services at the best conditions available on the market, while simultaneously meeting quality, security and environmental requirements. Suppliers Policy in the Purchasing Process of the Telecom Italia Group (Telecom Italia web site/Sustainability: Our vision/Codes and Policies/Environmental and Social Policies/Relations with Suppliers in Telecom Italia Group’s purchasing processes)127 1. Introduction The Purchasing process of the Telecom Italia Group (“Group”) is aimed at the procurement of products/services allowing global cost optimization and meeting at the same time the Group’s standard requirements of quality, safety and respect for the environment. 2. Ethical negotiation …all Group’s corporate processes are carried out in observance of the law of the Countries in which the Group’s companies act and of the principles stated in the Code of Ethics. The purchasing process is carried out in conformity of the following principles. Transparency of rules and decisions … Besides a positive outcome concerning technical-organizational requirements, in order to take part in tenders potential suppliers must confirm in advance both their commitment and that of any authorized sub-supplier, subordinate or employee, in observance of the ethical behavioural principles of the Group’s Code of Ethics; at the same time the supplier is requested to declare that there are no pending legal proceedings, protests or other prejudicial acts related to its company and/or to its Legal Representatives/Directors, serious administrative sanctions, included those on Accident Prevention and Sanitary Conditions in the workplace issued by the relevant Inspection Offices. Consistently with the Organizational Model, a specific procedure disciplines the cases of exception to the principle of making a tender between qualified suppliers; these cases must be justified, documented and approved by the relevant organizational level. Separation of roles … 126 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/en/corporate/sustainability/our-approach/codes-policies.html 127 Please, see the following web site for the whole policy: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/documents/Sostenibilita/en/Policies_ENG/Suppliers_EN_22.12.09.pdf 92 Fairness The Group does not intend to obtain competitive advantages from suppliers deriving from irresponsible behaviour: its employees are requested to entertain relationships with suppliers on the basis of objective criteria and the Group is committed to promote the principles of legality, transparency, fairness and honesty. Each Group’s employee must separate its own interests from those of the Group; in particular it is prohibited to: ask, accept, offer or guarantee, directly or indirectly, a personal advantage related to the negotiation, assignation and execution of a supply contract, violate the secrecy of the information obtained by the suppliers for purposes that are not connected with one’s duties, use any suppliers’ confidential information to gain competitive advantages and use it in an opportunistic manner to maximize the results of the negotiations to one’s advantage or to the advantage of a specific competitor, provide the other competitors with information about the identity of a tenderer or about the contents of its bid. Tracking of purchasing acts … 3. Commitment to sustainability The Group commitment to promote the safeguarding of the environment, the respect of human rights and labour standards, as well as the fight against corruption is stated in the Code of Ethics and in the Organizational Model. Coherently with these values, the Group promotes and asks its own suppliers and, through them, its sub-suppliers, to respect the following principles and laws in force in the Countries in which these Stakeholders operate. Workers’ rights child labour: the Group’s companies do not employ nor provide any kind of support to the employment of people under the age of 18, with local exceptions to the rules. In any case no individual under 18 shall be employed in dangerous or night work. forced labour: all work or service not voluntary and extracted under the menace of any penalty or demanded as a means of repayment of a debt is forbidden; moreover, no personnel is requested to lodge a “deposit” upon commencing employment with the company. discrimination: the Group’s companies shall not engage nor support discrimination in hiring, remuneration, access to training, promotion, termination or retirement based on race, caste, national origin, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, union membership, political affiliation or age. In compliance with laws in force the Group’s companies shall not allow any behavior that is sexually coercive, threatening, abusive or exploitative. disciplinary procedures: concerning the hypothesis of disciplinary actions to be applied to personnel, the Group’s companies shall not engage or support the use of corporal punishment, mental or physical coercion and verbal abuse. working hours: the organisation of working hours complies with laws in force and with agreements negotiated with the workers’ Organisations on the subject, including the weekly day off and overtime. freedom of association and right of collective bargaining: all personnel whatever the level/qualification are entitled to form and join trade unions for the protection of individual and collective interests. The Group’s companies acknowledge the role of union representatives, who are not subject to any discrimination, and ensure, for union activities, the appropriate retribution for leave of absence and the means to communicate with personnel in the workplace. 93 remuneration: as far as minimum standards and payment modes are concerned, wages paid by the Group’s companies to personnel meet collective bargaining provisions. Any deduction from wages due to disciplinary purposes is made in compliance with collective bargaining provisions. The wages sheet delivered to personnel shall clearly detail all items composing remuneration. The Group’s companies do not undertake contracting arrangements that are unlawful or avoid fulfilling obligations under applicable laws. health and safety: the Group’s companies assure full compliance with law provisions concerning health and safety in the workplace, aimed at preventing possible accidents and injury to health arising out, of or associated with working activities. The Group’s companies, in compliance with laws in force, shall appoint special representatives responsible for health and safety and for the implementation of any measure needed to ensure them. Upon employment all personnel receives an appropriate health and safety training. The Group’s companies ensure the observance of requisites concerning cleanliness and safety provided by laws in force. development and employability: Telecom Italia believes that developing people’s skills and talents is good for both suppliers and buyers, and thus it recommends its suppliers to ensure the implementation of adequate initiatives for the development of their human resources. Telecom Italia requires total compliance with local labour laws and norms, as well as an approach to industrial relations based on the utmost respect of all involved social organizations. Finally, Telecom Italia believes that all enterprises, which are economical and occupational agents, have the possibility of contributing to the achievement of a high social welfare. Protection of the environment The Group uses suppliers that have demonstrated to respect the environmental provisions in force in the countries in which they act and, in particular, it excludes from its own Group Qualified Suppliers’ List those who have been sanctioned from competent local authorities with reference to environmental issues. The Group is committed to promote the environmental performance improvement of its own suppliers, as well as the adoption of solutions allowing the improvement of the environmental impact of the supplied products and services, among which: the optimization of energy consumption, the reduction of dangerous materials, the reduction of emissions, the increase of recycled or reused materials, the best waste management. 4. Control system … With reference to the safeguarding of the environment and to health & safety in the workplace for national suppliers: during the controls linked to the suppliers’ qualification phase, the Group systematically verifies whether the payments due to the welfare system (insurance, accident prevention, etc) have been made and a risk assessment has been provided and whether a Safety General Plan is in force. The supplier is also requested to declare the regularity of its own position regarding social security and health and safety law provisions, as well as sanctions coming from the Inspection Offices for the Prevention of Accidents and Sanitary Conditions in the workplace; concerning some types of companies implementing Tlc’s network infrastructures and the related sub-suppliers, whenever the work involves greater risks (i.e. diggings, installations on pylons), thorough controls are carried out on the provisions related to the use of Healthy Devices, training to prevent accidents, medical controls to verify professional suitability and to waste disposal management; concerning high environmental risk companies (i.e. dischargers, scrappers), with reference to Legislative Decree 22/97 (so-called Ronchi decree and further amendments and/or integrations), the availability of the required institutional authorizations, of material in/out recordings (waste 94 accounting books, waste identity forms) are controlled, as well as the percentage of recycled materials versus waste handed over to dumps. Similar controls will be implemented concerning foreign suppliers, too. … According to a model of risk assessment, measured on the basis of specific drivers (i.e. technological complexity, innovation, safety purchasing volumes, safety, environmental impact), the supplies of products/services with greater risk are: accepted if the conformity controls carried out by the Group’s staff yield positive outcomes; subjected to a monitoring of vendor rating evaluating the quality of the contractual relationship (technical commercial and administrative). Conformity controls, such as those included within vendor rating monitoring, also provide evidence on requirements connected to environmental protection (i.e. management and waste disposal of building yards) and to the job’s health safety (i.e. adoption and observance of building yard Security Plans, correct use of Personal Security Devices); such evidence contribute to the overall supplier evaluation. Should the evaluation outcome be under preestablished thresholds, a contractual action (penalties, reduction of supply volumes) is taken, leading in very serious cases to the exclusion from the Group Qualified Suppliers’ List. Suppliers can signal any violations of the above mentioned principles and procedures; the Statutory Auditors of Telecom Italia is the competent company unit to receive such reports (email address: collegio.sindacale@telecomitalia.it or audit.committee@telecomitalia.it). Communications will be dealt with due confidentiality; appropriate details and evidence are required on facts and persons involved. Any data transmitted by suppliers and referring to identified or identifiable persons will be used by Telecom Italy only to answer to suppliers’ enquiries and will be communicated to others only if necessary for that purpose. Any treatments of transmitted data will however be carried out in observance to provisions of Legislative Decree 196/03 on the matter of personal data protection. °-°-°-° References related to the Value Chain Implementation: • 2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Annual Report: o Suppliers, • 2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report/Suppliers: o Sustainability initiatives, o Involvement initiatives, • Telecom Italia web site/Sustainability: Our Stakeholders/Our Suppliers/Selection, Assessment and Controls: o Sustainability Controls. Suppliers (2011 Telecom Italia Media Group Annual Report)128 Telecom Italia Media guarantees its internal clients and external stakeholders that the procurement process is aimed at the acquisition of products and services under the best possible market 128 Please, see the following web site, related to the 2011 Telecom Italia Media Sustainability Section, chapter Suppliers, page 114: http://www.telecomitaliamedia.it/sites/telecomitaliamedia.it/files/Annual_Financial_Report_2011.pdf 95 conditions, while also observing the prerequisites of quality, safety and respect for the environment. In order to achieve this goal, it draws on the management and coordination provided by Telecom Italia to all Group companies, which also include the criteria for approving suppliers, rating vendors and acting transparently in dealings with suppliers. › The qualification process The qualification can be of three types, each preliminary to the next: basic (turnover, safety and civil liability, respect for environmental policies, etc.); operating and financial (examination of financial statements with consequent evaluation of the specific ratios); technical and organizational (effective capacity to produce/supply the product/performance/service). During the qualification process, suppliers are also asked to commit to principles related to human rights, labor, and the environment contained in the “Global Compact” promoted by the United Nations upon which the Code of Ethics of the Telecom Italia Group is based. The qualified parties are inserted in the Suppliers’ Register of the Telecom Italia Media Group per commodity category. The procurement policy of the Telecom Italia Media Group is based on competition between qualified Suppliers on the basis of parameters of purchase cost, procurement times and quality of the supplies. As regards sub-contractors an analogous checking process is carried out — although simplified with respect to that for suppliers — and the outcome of this process conditions the authorization to subcontracting agreements for technical and organizational work (actual ability to produce/supply the product/work and render the service). Certification of sub-contractors is normally the responsibility of the Company Protection and Prevention Service, in full compliance with applicable provisions of law governing safety and hygiene in the workplace (request to view the Consolidated Workers Register, in compliance with the requirements set out in Legislative Decree No. 81/08, the Ministerial Decree of March 10, 1998 — fire-prevention rules — and Legislative Decree No. 106/09). › Vendor Rating The quality of the supplies/services is controlled by way of a specific “Vendor Rating” for the product/performance/service on the basis of the technical, commercial and administrative valuations. In special cases third-party audits are carried out. EQ controls, according to the type of Product and Service, can be made:  before delivery/provision at the suppliers premises and/or at the premises of their authorized subcontractors;  at certified test laboratories (usually in the early stages of the products supply or following critical issues emerged in the field);  on site during the stages of products/systems commissioning or service provision. In addition to controls on Products and Services, audits are carried out on suppliers that apply for qualification or subcontracting, on products/processes identified as non-compliant during operation and with regard to the subject of Corporate Social Responsibility (e.g., environment, health, safety). The controls take place both at a centralized level at the moment of the qualification of the Supplier, and by the individual Telecom Italia Media Group companies during the life of the contract. › Transparency 96 The transparency of relationships with the suppliers is guaranteed by way of: submitting the results of the Vendor Rating to suppliers in order to coordinate actions for improvement; submission to each Supplier can be omitted in critical cases (e.g., audits in progress or completed, or more generally incorrect behavior); it may be omitted even if requested by supplier; communication of the control system by way of documents annexed to contracts and in which are contained all the aspects relative to the specific monitoring; online tenders through the Telecom Italia Corporate website with the possibility for Suppliers to know in real time their performance and the final outcomes; insertion of elements relative to conduct which the Suppliers must fulfill in terms of health and safety, respect for the environment, etc. in documents annexed to the procurement tenders and relative specifications. Sustainability initiatives (2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report/Suppliers)129 The main initiatives implemented in 2011 are listed below. • The process that establishes the activities aimed at improving the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) of the supply chain has been redesigned by introducing a more comprehensive system of elements used to assess the sustainability of suppliers during the qualification stages, incoming quality and vendor rating. The most significant aspects of the process include: • the creation of a self-assessment questionnaire for new suppliers during the qualification phase. The questionnaire was developed according to the main requirements contained in the relevant standards for responsible corporate management relating to respect for ethical values and to safeguarding the environment (including SA 8000, Global Compact and ISO 14000) and to the best industry practices. The questionnaire will be updated periodically to reflect the results and evolution of the qualification process; • the classification of suppliers based on the potential risks associated with their sustainability performance, using a specific method which considers the socio-environmental and business continuity aspects associated with the purchase markets to which the suppliers belong, classified according to parameters such as relevant geographical area, potential impact on the environment and the company of suppliers activities and of the products/services supplied throughout their life cycle, impact on the reputation of Telecom Italia as a customer. A matrix has been constructed that relates the spending in the specific purchase market with the risk index calculated on the basis of the parameters described, which has allowed purchase markets to be subdivided into four categories, identifying the most critical ones in terms of sustainability130. Suppliers belonging to the most at risk categories will undergo CSR audits carried out by staff from the company or specialised third party companies. These audits will be repeated periodically, non only to monitor and ensure the implementation of corrective action, but also if results are positive, in order to verify that the standard of performance found by auditors is being maintained. The activities described are intended to promote the improvement of sustainability performance throughout the supply chain and to identify a category of sustainable purchases (sustainable procurement). The whole process is expected to come into full operation in 2012. For 2011, an experimental questionnaire was sent out to around 70 significant suppliers identified by the method 129 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 130 The four categories are the following: AA = high ESG risk, high-spending, AB = high ESG risk, low-spending, BA = low ESG risk, highspending, BB = low ESG risk, low-spending. Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/tiportal/en/sustainability/stakeholders/suppliers/selectionassessment-controls.esg-risks.html 97 described above, which allowed around 44% of orders made in 2011 by the Domestic Business Unit to be covered. • In December 2011, the ISO 9001:2008 certificate of conformity of the “Quality Management System” was confirmed for the Group's entire SC&RE department, with specific recognition for the initiatives taken in the field of sustainability. The certification required 27 department processes to be mapped, identifying 155 performance indicators that allow the management of services supplied to internal clients and suppliers to be monitored and improved. Furthermore, the ISO 14001 certification was confirmed for the facility and real estate service unit and infrastructure purchases. • Application continued of the green procurement policy established in 2009, which contains guidelines for establishing the environmental requirements of products/services purchased. … With a view to ensuring the ongoing improvement and greater involvement of suppliers, questions regarding the green procurement policy, and supplier adherence to the principles set out within it, have been included in the annual satisfaction survey. Involvement initiatives (2011 Telecom Italia Sustainability Report/Suppliers)131 • The new suppliers' portal (Vendors Hub) was launched during the year to improve communication and optimise operational processes, applying social networking systems to a business context. Suppliers are able to access a private area to view important data and events connected to their relationship with Telecom Italia and manage all their own details, thus improving the smooth operation and transparency of the relationship. The Vendors Hub also includes a public area containing information for potential suppliers. Documentation is exchanged electronically (e.g. offers, purchase orders, contracts, qualification documentation, surveys), thus reducing the environmental impact resulting from the use of paper and transporting of documents. The Vendors Hub has also been used to manage the selfassessment questionnaire. • For the fifth year in a row, the Group’s main suppliers have been involved in satisfaction surveys regarding the Supply Chain & Real Estate department and, more generally, Telecom Italia. The online questionnaire, consisting of 27 questions, remained active for 3 weeks. The survey involved 1,132 suppliers with access to the Vendors Hub with a 48% response rate. The overall assessment of the supply relationship with the Telecom Italia Group achieved a score of 73/100, which is consistent with 2010 and shows a consolidation of the improvement recorded by the previous survey and the generally positive trend in the level of satisfaction recorded since 2008. The analysis of the distribution of satisfaction among the various classes shows an upward trend in the percentage of suppliers who state they are satisfied or very satisfied . • The two e-communities set up in previous years for suppliers in the civil infrastructure and network operations sectors, aimed at improving dialogue mainly regarding social and environmental sustainability, remain active. The activities of the e-communities mainly take place through a platform known as “TelecHome”. Developed in Web 2.0 logic, it contributes to the exchange of information and experiences within the e-community, in order to:  integrate the best operational practices adopted in specific subject areas;  publish the results obtained, in terms of the environmental/social certifications attained;  support voting campaigns on various initiatives. Sustainability Controls (Telecom Italia web site/Sustainability: Our Stakeholders/Our Suppliers/Selection, Assessment and Controls)132 131 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/dam/telecomitalia/en/archive/documents/sustainability/sustainability_reports/2011/ReportS ustainabilityENG.pdf 98 Suppliers are subject to a number of checks on their sustainability performance. Some checks are carried out together with other general audits, for example: • during the qualification stage, potential suppliers are subject to economic screening, product/service screening, but also to controls on compliance with environmental and labor norms, as well as on their position concerning Law 231 (on bribery and other offences). At this stage, the supplier must commit itself to the principles of the Code of Ethics of Telecom Italia; • in the process of vendor rating, during and after delivery of service/product, aspects of health and safety and compliance with environmental norms are rigorously evaluated. This evaluation is then taken into account of in the supplier's overall rating. A low rating is contractually tied to penalties and may, in some cases, result in the termination of the contract. Other controls are specific to certain aspects of sustainability: • in the qualification phase the supplier is expected to answer a specific questionnaire on its sustainability performance; • audits on Health and Safety and on Environment are carried out regularly (by Telecom Italia's department which is also responsible for Health, Safety and the Environment within Telecom Italia) on specific types of suppliers which are considered at risk (for example, network suppliers); • specific environmental audits are carried out for suppliers involved in Telecom Italia's processes covered by the environmental certification; • audits conducted within a project, of which Telecom Italia is a member and which includes several other European telephone operators (Joint Audit Committee), whose aim is to control suppliers operating in developing countries directly at their sites, on the management of social and environmental aspects. In all cases, should the audit yield non-conformities, a process is run for the management of the non conformity, including a second audit to verify the closure or the mitigation of the non conformity. 132 Please, see the following web site: http://www.telecomitalia.com/content/tiportal/en/sustainability/stakeholders/suppliers/selectionassessment-controls.sustainability-controls.html 99 8) Transparency and Verification Criterion 22: Company’s profile and context of operation.

We have carried out the limited assurance engagement of the Sustainability Report of the Telecom Italia Group (hereafter the “Group”) as of 31 December 2011 (hereafter the “Report”), following the verification procedures summarized in paragraph 3 to this Report. The Board of Directors of Telecom Italia SpA are responsible for the preparation of the Report in accordance with the Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness principles included in AA1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard (2008) (AA1000APS 2008), issued by AccountAbility (Institute of Social and Ethical Accountability), as described in the paragraph “Reporting”. The Board of Directors of Telecom Italia SpA are responsible for the definition of the Group objectives with regard to the sustainability performance and reporting results achieved. The Board of Directors are also responsible for the identification of the stakeholders and of the significant aspects to report, as well as for the implementation and maintenance of appropriate management and internal control processes concerning data and information included in the Report. We are responsible for the preparation of this Report on the basis of the work performed. 2. Our work has been conducted in accordance with the principles and guidelines established, for a limited assurance engagement, by the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. These principles require the compliance with applicable ethical principles (Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants of the International Federation of Accountants), including professional independence. It also requires that our work is planned and performed with the aim of obtaining a limited assurance, rather than a reasonable assurance, that the Report is free of material errors. Furthermore, our work has been conducted taking into account, consistently with the AA1000 AccountAbility Assurance Standard (2008) (AA1000AS 2008), those aspects relevant for the valuation of the reliability of data and information on sustainability performance detailed in Appendix 1. A limited assurance engagement of the sustainability report consists in interviews, primarily with company’s personnel responsible for the preparation of the information included in the sustainability report, in the analysis of the sustainability report and in other verification procedures. 3.

In particular, we held meetings and discussions with Telecom Italia SpA, Telecom Italia Media SpA, TIM Participaçoes SA, Telecom Argentina SA and HR Services Srl management representatives selected on the basis of a quantitative and qualitative risk analysis, in order to achieve a general understanding of the information, accounting and reporting system in use to prepare the Report, as well as of the internal control processes and procedures supporting the collection, aggregation, processing and transmission of data and information to the department responsible for drawing it up; • meetings and discussions with Telecom Italia SpA, Telecom Italia Media SpA., TIM Participaçoes SA, Telecom Argentina SA and HR Services Srl management, in order to understand and evaluate the processes utilized to comply with the Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness principles included in the AA1000APS – 2008 standard; • analysis, on a sample basis, of the documentation supporting the Report in order to obtain the evidence of processes in place, confirm the reliability of data and information obtained in the above-mentioned meetings and discussions and regarding the sustainability performance, as included in Appendix 1; • verification of the engagement of stakeholders, through: o analysis of the most relevant aspects arisen and documented in internal minutes and comparison with data and information included in the Report, o meetings and interviews with some employees to understand their awareness on the sustainability reporting process; • obtaining a representation letter, signed by the legal representative of Telecom Italia SpA, relating to the completeness and reliability of the Report and of the information and data included in it, as well as to the compliance with the principles referred to in paragraph 1. A limited assurance engagement is less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement carried out in accordance with ISAE 3000 and, as a consequence, it provides a lower level of assurance that we became aware of all the significant events and circumstances that a reasonable assurance engagement could have identified. As far as data and information concerning the sustainability report of the prior year, presented for comparative purposes, are concerned, refer to the assurance statement we issued on 28 March 2011. 4. Based on the procedures carried out, nothing came to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability report of Telecom Italia Group as of 31 December 2011 is not in compliance, in all material respects, with AA1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard (2008), as stated in the paragraph “Reporting” of the Report, and that the sustainability performance included in Appendix 1 is not reliable. 110 Turin, 16 April 2012 PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory SpA Paolo Bersani (Partner) This report has been translated from the original, which was issued in Italian.
