This system is connected Terminals (NMTs) with the radar of the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority so that correlations can be made based on the actual flight track information. Since the airport opening, Noise Abatement Procedures have been defined for the reduction of noise levels in the residential areas around the airport and along flight paths in collaboration with the civil aviation authority and other state entities, airlines and representatives from the local communities. Further to our goal of active stakeholder engagement, we organise regular meetings to bring together all relevant stakeholders. In 2011, meetings with 9 airlines were held on noise issues in order to promote awareness and discuss proposals. In addition, since December 2011, the landing of noisier aircraft – marginally accepted Chapter 3 aircraft as well as military aircraft – does no longer take place on the eastern runway 21L in order to further reduce the noise nuisance in Artemis. Further information on this– issue is also available in the Company’s annual environmental bulletin, Care for the Environment. Since noise exposure is one of the primary environmental aspects impacting residents in the vicinity of the airport, we have established and operate a dedicated telephone line, the “We Listen” line, and Chart 5.4.2 Average Noise Levels per Noise Monitoring Terminal (NMT) NMT 2010: Lden dB(A) 2010: Lnight dB(A) 2011: Lden dB(A) 2011: Lnight dB(A) 2 57.6 48.7 48.0 30.9 3 64.3 55.9 59.8 41.2 4 65.0 57.9 58.4 50.3 5 63.5 55.1 55.9 37.8 6 60.3 52.8 52.6 41.2 7 64.4 57.3 51.9 44.4 8 65.0 56.6 48.5 37.5 9 67.9 60.3 56.0 41.9 10 61.3 52.6 27.6 0.0 Lden and Lnight are calculated as defined in Government Decision 13586/724 GGG 384Β, 28/3/2006.

Transparency is an integral part of our commitment. It is for this purpose we engage, for the 5th consecutive year, in an independent third party assurance of our disclosures, continuously seeking adding value through the identification of improvement areas. The benefits of such a process are unquestionable: carefully planned improvements well absorbed by the organisation, enhanced disclosures serving stakeholder interests, leading to consistent recognition of AIA to be among the leading companies in CR within Greece and among international airports. This year’s assurance engagement with KPMG Advisors A.E. has served well the purpose intended. The process verified our adherence to contemporary sustainability standards and provided us with an expert independent view documented in the Assurance Report and the “Notes from Management Interviews”. As this year we applied elements of ISO26000 for the first time, we found the respective recommendations by KPMG to be constructive. The detailed Company Management Report will give us insight on how to improve particular aspects and how well we stand in comparison with our peers. AIA’s Management acknowledges the input provided by KPMG and recognises the yielding improvement potential. Our Materiality Analysis has been significantly improved over the last years. KPMG’s recommendations for additional feedback from our stakeholders are well received and in line with our CR Strategy. We build transparency and credibility in our reporting, remaining consistently firm to our commitments for improving stakeholder perception of our sustainability perspective and performance.
