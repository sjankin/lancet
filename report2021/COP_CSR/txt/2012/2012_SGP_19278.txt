GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE This Report is in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3.1 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, which is the global standard and most widely used framework for transparent reporting about environmental, social and governance performances. It is based on the Application Level B+ and GRI Construction and Real Estate Supplement which was published in September 2011. The Report includes the Company’s management approach to integrating sustainability into its policies, structure and daily operations. It provides an account of its sustainability performance, focusing on its sustainability strategies and practices, highlighting the economic, environmental and social aspects of the Company’s activities and developments across its properties in Singapore and overseas. We have increased the coverage of GRI performance indicators from 37 to 51, spanning all six indicator categories, namely Economic, Environmental, Society, Labour, Human Rights and Product Responsibility. It also includes among these, ﬁve out of eight sector-speciﬁc disclosures and performance indicators that are considered as core for the Construction and Real Estate sector. REPORTING PERIOD AND SCOPE This Report covers Keppel Land’s operations and initiatives in Singapore, where the Company is based as well as in selected overseas countries such as China, Vietnam and Indonesia, where our presence and earnings contribution are greatest. The period covered by this Report is the same as the ﬁnancial year of the Company (January–December 2011). Where possible, we have provided up to ﬁve years of historical information so that there is sufﬁcient basis for measurement and comparison. The Sustainability Report is published annually. We have also formulated our statements taking into account the clauses of ISO 26000 and the 10 universal principles of the United Nations Global Compact. This Report supplements our 2011 Annual Report which can be found at www.keppelland.com.sg/ar2011. Through this Report, we demonstrate our commitment to keep our stakeholders including our employees, customers, investors, business partners and community members abreast of our corporate social responsibility (CSR) developments.

Located on Keppel Island within the Keppel Bay precinct, the marina continues to raise the bar in marina management with its outstanding berthing facilities as well as environmental efforts. WORLD-CLASS BERTHING FACILITIES Marina at Keppel Bay complements the premier and intimate waterfront lifestyle experience for homeowners in Keppel Bay, boaters from the region as well as visitors to Keppel Island with its premium berths, ﬁne dining experience and warm hospitality. Opened in 2008, it is the ﬁrst marina in Singapore to be fully designed and built by specialist Bellingham Marine. With the addition of two new state-of-the-art 3 piers in February 2011, the berthing capacity has been increased from 122 to 168 berths to accommodate yachts including superyachts of up to 280 feet. Fitted with the most advanced concrete ﬂoating pontoon system, Marina at Keppel Bay makes its mark as Singapore's ﬁrst and only marina to offer individual pontoon berthing system for superyachts. Its reputation as a world-class destination continues to spread internationally, especially following the launch of its iPhone application in October 2011. Since then, awareness of the marina has extended to countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Latvia, Switzerland and United Arab Emirates. With its premium features and berths, the marina is well-placed to tap on the rising demand for quality berthing space in Asia. Marina at Keppel Bay also continues to be the choice location for international events such as the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race in January and Asia’s largest and most prestigious boat show, Boat Asia in May 2012. Keppel Land Limited 62 Sustainability Report 2011 GREEN MARINA 2 Marina at Keppel Bay became the ﬁrst marina in Asia to receive the Green Mark Gold Award from the Building and Construction Authority of Singapore in 2011. Incorporating the latest in green technology, the marina features a reticulated vacuum sewer pump-out system to ensure that sewage from vessels are not discharged into the water, individual advanced metering system to monitor power and water usage, and direct fuel access via a dedicated fuel dock. Boaters are encouraged to install four-stroke instead of two-stroke engines on their vessels to reduce exhaust pollution. They also have to use biodegradable soaps and detergents 4 when cleaning their vessels. Motion sensors, ﬂow-regulator taps and low-capacity water systems are installed at common areas within the clubhouse to reduce energy and water consumption. Toilets and changing rooms within the marina have also been installed with environmentally-friendly ionisers to reduce the use of aerosol 1.

Marina at Keppel Bay offers internationalgrade berthing facilities that are sought after by the boating community. 3. Marina at Keppel Bay continues to be the choice venue for international events such as the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race. 4. Measures are in place to ensure that waste water from vessels are not discharged directly into the marina. Sustaining Growth Environment – Singapore 63 Sustaining Growth Environment – Singapore Showcase: Marina at Keppel Bay sprays to prevent odours, mould and 1 pests. The marina also uses paints that are low in volatile organic compounds and odour for walls and equipment. These paints contain fewer chemicals, making them more eco-friendly than other commercial paints. Within the carpark, energy-efﬁcient LED lights keep the area well-lit, while sensors keep carbon monoxide levels within acceptable levels, thereby reducing the need for mechanical ventilation fans. The carpark also features a 300-sm vertical green wall with specially selected vines – Thunbergia grandiﬂora and Vernonia ellipta – to reduce the amount of light and heat reﬂected from the concrete. This signiﬁcantly reduces the amount of heat trapped in the carpark. The green features at the clubhouse as well as food and beverage outlets at Marina at Keppel Bay are expected to achieve overall savings of 14.3% in energy consumption, resulting in annual savings of more than 305,000 kWh or close to $61,000, and the reduction of 152.5 tonnes of carbon emission.

Management and Stakeholders of Keppel Land Limited Ere-S Pte Ltd was commissioned by Keppel Land to provide assurance that the content of its Sustainability Report 2011 is accurate and truly reﬂects Keppel Land’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts. The assurance engagement was conducted at the corporate headquarters in Singapore from March to May 2012. SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES The assurance encompasses Keppel Land’s operations in Singapore and its overseas subsidiaries as indicated in the sustainability report for the period January to December 2011. We assessed ﬁgures and statements on CSR initiatives, strategy, policies, procedures, key performance indicators, management systems and associated processes. The assurance engagement was executed in accordance with a Type 2 assurance of the AA1000 Assurance Standard (AA1000AS 2008), which consists of: A. Evaluating the sustainability systems and processes using the inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness criteria of the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles (AA1000APS 2008); and B. Evaluating the reliability of the disclosed performance information and the relevant data collection processes. For this, we used the GRI G3.1 report quality principles. We provided a moderate level of assurance with desktop review, management-level data veriﬁcation and evidence gathering from internal sources. We did not execute multi-level research to determine materiality issues and stakeholders relevant to the company. Information not related to sustainability and already supported by existing documents, such as the Annual Report, did not form part of the assurance engagement. This information includes all or part of the organisation proﬁle, corporate structure and corporate ﬁnancial and economic performance, technical descriptions of buildings, equipment and production processes. RESPONSIBILITY AND INDEPENDENCE The responsibility of Ere-S was to execute the assurance engagement, prepare the assurance report and this assurance statement for the management of Keppel Land alone and for no other purpose. The management of Keppel Land was responsible for the preparation of the sustainability report and all statements and ﬁgures contained within it. This is the third year that Ere-S has been commissioned to provide assurance on Keppel Land’s sustainability report. We were not involved in the development of the report and the disclosed management processes, neither have we been engaged for other projects with Keppel Land. Ere-S’ activities are independent of Keppel Land and contain no other ﬁnancial interest in their business operation. Our assurance team for this engagement comprised a certiﬁed sustainability assurance practitioner and an environmental auditor with experience in CSR and sustainability reporting. Their work was executed in accordance with Ere-S’ assurance code of conduct, which can be found at http://www.ere-s.com/assurance-code-of-conduct. Independent Assurance Statement 115 Independent Assurance Statement METHODOLOGY We reviewed the drafts of the sustainability report to identify the elements to be audited. Statements and data sets were classiﬁed according to the relevant data owners and the type of evidence required for the veriﬁcation process. Interviews were held with managers and data owners from over 10 departments and units, including Keppel Land China and the Marina at Keppel Bay, Jakarta Garden City and Tianjin Eco-City projects. Some of the overseas data owners were interviewed via conference calls. Speciﬁc questions on the adherence to AA1000 principles were asked during the interviews and evidence of the relevant information, data collection methods as well as information on the underlying processes were collected and evaluated. Veriﬁed information included internal publications, policies, reports, data sheets, certiﬁcates, pictures, video, invoices, minutes of meetings and emails. For some elements, we looked at press releases and websites of external parties. We also interviewed a limited number of individuals from diverse stakeholder groups to conﬁrm the relevant communication and engagement approaches. We chose the interviewees from each group among a list of contacts provided by Keppel Land. FINDINGS On the basis of our review and a moderate level of assurance, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability framework of Keppel Land does not adhere to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles. In addition, the ﬁndings of the assurance engagement provide conﬁdence, within satisfactory limits, that the reported performance information gives a reliable and fair representation of the Keppel Land sustainability proﬁle and is supported by comprehensive and veriﬁable data and underlying management processes. OBSERVATIONS Since the last reporting period, we have found further improvements in the sustainability-related processes, stakeholder engagement and performance measurement of Keppel Land. These are evidenced at management levels and include: – Health and safety measures, including training of personnel and audits, have been reinforced throughout all operations and business units of the company; – Additional environmental and life-cycle requirements and targets have been included in the design and construction processes of new developments; – More comprehensive communication and feedback channels, such as the safety perception survey, have been implemented for employees, business partners and customers; and – Additional performance measurements on key business units and projects and more deﬁned disclosure on indicators, such as energy use and carbon emissions, have been undertaken. We also commend the creation of Keppel Land’s CSR Committee and the initiative to align business practices with ISO 26000 guidelines on social responsibility. We have found evidence of implementation of the initial phase of the alignment programme, such as workshops and gap analysis involving managers from multiple business units. Keppel Land Limited 116 Sustainability Report 2011 A. EVALUATION OF THE ADHERENCE TO AA1000 ACCOUNTABILITY PRINCIPLES Inclusivity – How the organisation engages with stakeholders and enables their participation in identifying issues and ﬁnding solutions. Engagement processes are strong with Keppel Land’s employees, shareholders, business partners and clients. These processes include surveys, group and personal meetings as well as online channels for communication and feedback. The intensity and scope of Keppel Land’s awareness and engagement programmes have signiﬁcantly increased in the ﬁelds of safety and, to a lesser extent, the environment, since the previous reporting period. This progress is even more accentuated at subsidiary level, as evidenced by the new overseas safety hub in Vietnam, and the global safety survey and additional health and safety sharing sessions held at overseas units and projects. Engagement is still limited within communities, where interaction essentially takes the form of philanthropy and is carried out on a project basis. Other than for regulatory, safety and environmental issues, we have not found evidence of stakeholders’ consultation in the early stages of a development project. Although we recognise the difﬁculties in ﬁnding reliable and independent partners, especially in overseas countries, we believe improvement will also be driven by further engagement of stakeholders’ representatives in decision making. Materiality – How the organisation recognises issues that are relevant and signiﬁcant to it and its stakeholders. We have found evidence of processes that identify and prioritise material issues within Keppel Land’s operations and boundaries. Signiﬁcant evidence includes the ISO 26000 gap analysis initiated in 2011, the integration of additional safety and environmental criteria in the design phase, and the addition of sustainability-related questions in surveys targeted at employees, clients and partners. Through the work of the new Sustainable Design Unit, the recent integration of environmental considerations into the risk assessment template for new property projects, and the ISO 26000 alignment, we expect to see the deﬁnition and implementation of additional management processes and criteria on speciﬁc material issues and stakeholder concerns. These should be further expanded through the business operations and subsidiaries of Keppel Land, and also comprise topics not comprehensively covered yet, such as human rights and community impact. Responsiveness – How the organisation responds to stakeholder issues and feedback through decisions, actions, performance and communication. Response processes, such as group meetings to share and discuss the results of the organisational climate survey, and various online tools for information and feedback, have been further strengthened for Keppel Land employees. This year, we have found more evidence that these processes are being equally applied at the corporate ofﬁce and at key overseas units. Similarly, the new safety roadmap resulting from the global safety survey represents another indication of good response to concerns of multiple stakeholder groups. We have, however, found little evidence of actions taken in response to concerns of stakeholder groups other than investors, clients, business partners and governments. For example, more data on actions taken in regard to supply chain workers and communities surrounding overseas projects should be made available. For this, particular focus on these groups is recommended when redeﬁning material issues and expanding the scope of performance measurement. Independent Assurance Statement 117 Independent Assurance Statement B. EVALUATION OF THE DISCLOSED PERFORMANCE INFORMATION The content of Keppel Land’s Sustainability Report 2011 shows a satisfactory level of compliance with the requirements of GRI G3.1 quality principles. Signiﬁcant improvements over last year’s report include the coverage of additional material topics and indicators as well as extended disclosure of performance data from overseas units and projects. Despite some format changes, the performance data remains comparable with previous versions of the report and with industry ﬁgures. From the work undertaken, we have found the report content to be accurate, with evidence for all identiﬁed elements. Some minor errors were detected and recommendations were provided regarding the improvement of statements and the insertion of additional information to provide a clearer and more material disclosure. The reporting team followed the majority of our recommendations and the ﬁnal version of the sustainability report was checked by us to conﬁrm that all necessary corrective actions had been taken. Moving forward, we recommend adding more information and indicators to highlight areas of weak performance. Similarly, a greater standardisation of performance disclosure for both corporate headquarters and overseas business units, especially in the people section, will also improve the quality of the sustainability report. The above ﬁndings and additional suggestions for improvement have been presented to the management of Keppel Land in a more detailed assurance report.
