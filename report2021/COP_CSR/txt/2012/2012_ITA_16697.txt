You have been informed that, with my mandate as Chief Executive Officer coming to an end, I have decided not to seek re-election to the post for another three years; you have also been informed that Alberto Bartoli has been proposed for the position. You will therefore forgive me if I use this brief letter to outline some personal reflections, after so many years at the helm of this ship, which I leave in a strong and solid state, albeit in a general environment that has become very difficult, to the extent that it cannot be predicted and dealt with using the tools of previous times, certainly not those that existed when I joined the company in 1969, then as a young manager of the Technical Department. We have gone through, and are still going through, an era that has seen monumental changes, which have not, however, found us unprepared, as we have always worked towards long-term sustainability, and not for fleeting and short-lived success. For this, our thanks must first of all go to Giuseppe Saleri, who has championed the creation of shared value over the family’s interests, in strict compliance with 4 market regulations and the separation Introduction between ownership and management. This has been the main direction we have pursued over these years. A direction in which I am sure the Group will continue, through the proposal to the shareholders’ meeting of the directors who have shared in the logic, objectives and practical implementation of this paradigm. In 2011, the Sabaf Group recorded sales revenue of €148.6 million, down 1.5% on the figure of €150.9 million in 2010. After a satisfying start, the market progressively entered a new phase of weakness, with a consequent drop in sales. The household appliance market has been hit hard by the weakness of the economy, and has seen a progressive slowdown in demand in our traditional core markets (Italy and Western Europe). In contrast, sales in Eastern Europe and South America registered solid growth. These are markets on which Sabaf began some time ago to establish a presence for the long term, and are the areas that have been prioritised in its internationalisation strategy. In Brazil, a facility has already been operational for some years, while in Turkey, a new production unit is set to come on stream by the end of 2012. Profitability in 2011 was negatively affected by the significant rise in commodity prices, which could not be fully passed on to sales prices, and by the non-optimal use of production capacity, which is directly linked to the weakness in demand. The financial structure remains sound, with a modest level of debt, another indicator of the health of a company that in the last few years has been able to invest more than EUR 10 million a year in new products and processes, exclusively self-financed. To sustain our margins, we have mainly leveraged on product and process innovation. The ability to work across the whole supply chain, which in our case also includes the design and construction of manufacturing and assembly machines, remains one of Sabaf’s strengths in which it must continue to invest in the future, building on the technical expertise and professionalism of individual members of staff. For us, this is what it means to put people at the centre of our strategy. It is no coincidence that during this period of serious crisis that continues to affect the western world, Sabaf has been able to respond promptly to these difficulties, registering even significant reductions in volumes without this leading to a loss in competitiveness. From this viewpoint, we must be optimistic about the future: more innovative products, such as light alloy valves and special burners, to which for some years we have continuously directed the bulk of our efforts in research, have now been launched, and we expect further positive results from these in the future. We are world leaders in this area: the result of desire and passion, two elements that have always protected us from every storm and enabled us to overcome every obstacle. The international environment is difficult, but it is even more so for our competitors, which don’t have our know-how, our ability to affect every detail, even beyond technical literature, because in this area, if I may say so, we wrote the book. And if we’re required to speed up further in the future, a little like Lewis Carol’s Alice, who has to run to stand still, we are undoubtedly well-equipped Introduction for the race, even though we must not forget that to run fast, we must be trained, efficient and prepared. We have the muscles, the brain, the tools and the expertise to do it better than anyone else. Over the last few weeks, I have received expressions of esteem, friendship, respect and thanks from all kinds of people, some of 5 whom I knew personally, others who only revealed themselves to me on this occasion. Let me just say that I am proud to have over these years led a company of men and women, each of whom has entrusted their hopes, their life plans, their ambitions and their future to Sabaf. When I look at them, I understand how important is the road that we have taken, how our successes are the successes of everyone, a region, a community, not just a brand or a product. It is them who I would like to thank first and foremost, and I urge my successor to continue to think of them any time that a decision must be made concerning the present or future of this company. At times, these decisions will seem to some to run counter to their needs, their interests, their portfolio. This happens when the objective is long-term sustainability, when it is necessary to maintain the health of the entire body, sacrificing a small interest to the bigger interest of the entire community. I would like to end with a quote from a US president who had to govern a very different reality to this one, in no less difficult and tempestuous times. In 1953, Dwight Eisenhower said: “This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.” It is a maxim that I would like us to always keep in mind. Thank you.

Advocating the idea of work and relations with stakeholders as “the passion for a project founded on common ethical values in which everyone recognises themselves” is not only a moral commitment, but also a real guarantee of enhanced exploitation of intangible assets (intellectual capital).

Trend corE MarkEts In Western Europe, which accounts for about half of the end-user market for Sabaf products, the level of saturation reached by cooking appliances (i.e. the number of households owning such appliances) is close to 100%. Purchases of new appliances are therefore mainly replacement purchases. Moving house or the purchase or refurbishment of a home are often occasions for the purchase of a new cooking appliance. The market trend is therefore directly influenced by the general economic trend and, in particular, by households’ disposable income, consumer confidence and housing market trends. Conversely, in other markets the saturation level is often much lower. Faster economic growth rates and a more favourable demographic trend than in Western Europe create huge opportunities for groups such as Sabaf that are able to work both with multinational household appliance manufacturers and with local manufacturers. A diverse ecosystem will also be resilient, because it contains many species with overlapping ecological functions that can partially replace one another. When a particular species is destroyed by a severe disturbance so that a link in the network is broken, a diverse community will be able to survive and reorganize itself... In other words, the more complex the network is, the more complex its pattern of interconnections, the more resilient it will be. 30 Fritjof Capra 3 corPoratE govErNaNcE, rIsk MaNagEMENt, coMPlIaNcE aND rEMuNEratIoN 31 corPoratE govErNaNcE ovErvIEw the desire to comply consistently with best practice in relation to corporate governance represent the subsequent steps taken by Sabaf towards compliance of its corporate governance system with a model whose benchmark is that directors act in the Company’s interest and in view of creating value for shareholders and other stakeholders.

In 2011, the Group recorded sales revenue in line with that of 2010. Confirming the trend in place in the last few years, light alloy valves are gradually replacing brass valves; the net effect on valve sales has however been negative. Sales of burners registered moderate growth. Average selling prices, which were slightly higher than in 2010, were not sufficient to offset the impact of higher commodity and energy prices. Business volumes were also not sufficient to guarantee adequate absorption of fixed costs, and all profitability indicators therefore show a decline compared with 2010: EBITDA came in at €24.6 million, equivalent to 18.5% of sales (€30.7 million in 2010, 23.3% of sales), EBIT was €12.9 million, or 9.7% of sales (vs. €20.7 million in 2010, 15.6%), and net profit was €11.1 million, equivalent to 8.4% of sales (€13.2 million in 2010, 10%). The actual cost of the main raw materials (brass, aluminium alloys and steel) was approximately 20% higher compared to 2010. The impact of the cost of labour on sales fell slightly, from 20.9% in 2010 to 20.6% in 2011. rEcoNcIlIatIoN bEtwEEN ParENt coMPaNy aND coNsolIDatED sharEholDErs’ EQuIty aND NEt ProfIt for thE PErIoD Pursuant to the CONSOB memorandum of 28 July 2006, below is a reconciliation statement of the results of the 2011 financial year and Group shareholders’ equity at 31 December 2011 with the same values of parent company Sabaf S.p.A.: 31.12.2011 31.12.2010 Shareholders’ Shareholders’ Description Net profit Net profit equity equity Net profit and shareholders’ equity of Sabaf S.p.A. 11,122 108,463 13,246 106,519 Shareholders’ equity and net result of consolidated 2,390 41,989 4,402 43,617 companies Elimination of consolidated equity investments’ (1,128) (34,231) (853) (35,034) carrying value Goodwill (1,129) 5,473 0 6,602 Equity investments booked at net equity 0 5 0 0 Intercompany eliminations: Dividends (2,718) 0 0 0 Other intercompany eliminations (18) 124 72 142 Group net profit and shareholders’ equity 10,775 121,823 16,867 121,846 EQuIty INtErEsts hElD by MEMbErs of thE boarD, 82 by statutory auDItors, by MaNagINg DIrEctors aND by Report on operations EXEcutIvEs wIth stratEgIc rEsPoNsIbIlItIEs Pursuant to Article 79 of CONSOB’s Issuers Regulations, below is a list of Sabaf S.p.A.’s equity interests held by directors, statutory auditors and executives with strategic responsibilities.

However, given that there are various elements of uncertainty implicit in realising this plan, it was considered preferable to prepare a multi-scenario analysis, which contemplates the following three hypotheses: a “best estimate” scenario, that is the most probable scenario, which considers 100% of new production flows; a “steady state” scenario (or “worst case”), which completely excludes new production flows and hypotheses the continuation of the present state; an intermediate scenario, which incorporates the realisation risk and considers only 75% of flows related to new production. The impairment test was conducted on a prudential basis, considering this last scenario.

The 2012-2016 plan projects a gradual recovery in sales and profitability.

The Board of Directors cannot therefore rule out that, in the future, the final profitability figure may diverge from that set out in forward data, requiring further write-downs of the equity investment. Given the uncertainty of any process estimating future events not dependent on variables that can be controlled, the directors will systematically monitor the actual balance sheet and income statement data of the subsidiary to assess the need to adjust forecasts and at the same time reflect any losses in value.
