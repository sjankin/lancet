HMC’s corporate philosophy and activities are deeply rooted in sustainability and all HMC members including myself are dedicated to promoting sustainability. Humanity is facing a number of serious challenges including energy shortage, climate change, depletion of natural resources and an ever increasing polarization of society. These challenges have significant impacts on businesses at many different levels. However, although the challenges pose threats they also present new opportunities. In this light, sustainable business management can serve as an engine for future growth by encouraging and stimulating us to tackle these challenges in a proactive and innovative manner. We need to invest in the protection of our ecosystem and to tackle other environmental problems which left alone could have a significant negative impact on our livelihoods. This is especially true for the automobile industry considering the large amount of resources that are used and the emissions associated with the manufacture and use of automobiles. Automobile manufacturers therefore, are striving to achieve ‘sustainable mobility’, both as a moral obligation and as something which is imperative to our business. In addition, we will continue to make improvements in vehicle performance, safety and affordability. HMC has set the realization of sustainable mobility as its ultimate goal and created a growth strategy for achieving this goal. We have been making significant investments in the development and commercialization of green vehicles. In 2011, we released the Sonata hybrid in both the North American and Korean markets. Additionally, we successfully conducted demonstration programs for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and electric vehicle. HMC will continue investing in green vehicle development and we aim to produce a much larger number of them in the very near future. In 2011, our annual global sales hit the four million mark as our investment in green vehicle technology increased. HMC has a long way to go but I firmly believe that these record high sales figures are proof that we are getting closer to achieving our vision to ultimately become a truly ‘beloved car company’. Strategy for The healthy growth of a corporation can only be achieved through organic collaboration with stakeholders, based on mutual Sustainable Growth trust. Therefore, HMC manages its business focusing on the mutual benefits of key stakeholders including customers, investors, employees, suppliers and local communities. In fact, we have placed responsible business management as the core of our sustainable growth strategy. We would never have come this far without your continued support. I would like to ask for your feedback and continued support in the future. Thank you.

In fact, creating a greener automobile is one of our highest priorities as we are faced with multiple environmental challenges including climate change and depletion of natural resources. Recognizing the seriousness of the issues we are facing, HMC is investing in the development of green vehicles, green production technologies and other environmental technologies that not only meet regulation standards but fulfill our responsibility for our children and future generations. 32 46 49 52 Climate Change Recycling Hazardous Materials Air Quality 03 Environment The 2011 Average CO2 emissions of HMC new passenger vehicles sold in the EU A growing number of countries are introducing ever tighter standards on greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent a global crisis caused by climate change. For example, the European Union introduced a strict CO2 emission standard on new passenger vehicles in 2012. HMC has been making significant efforts to reduce CO2 in all stages of the vehicle life cycle including production, operation and recycling. As a result, HMC succeeded to reduce the average CO2 emissions of new passenger vehicles registered in the European Union region in 2011 to 132g/km, a 28.6% reduction against the 1995 average CO2 emissions 28.6% of 185g/km, thanks to improvements made in fuel efficiency.

As a result, the advancement of science and technology has led to the development of a lifestyle with a level of convenience never before thought possible. However, more than two centuries of industrialization has also had a significantly negative impact on the environment. For example, the increased mining of natural resources has led to the depletion of energy resources which has become a serious issue for the future. Moreover, greenhouse gases from the operation of power plants, the use of automobiles, deforestation and other human activities has accelerated potentially dangerous climate changes according to the consensus of the international scientific community. As such, industrialization which helped many nations to obtain economic wealth, has brought with it some serious negative consequences. Among the consequences, climate change is the most serious threat. However, the release of other pollutants into the air, water and soil are also leading to serious problems. These environmental problems are becoming so serious that they are undermining our very survival. Machine The development of alternative green technologies, not just the improvement of existing technologies, is required to effectively tackle the global environmental problems of climate change. Since most of the greenhouse gases which are emitted and rgy cause climate change are manmade, the keys to tackling the climate change crisis lie in the development of alternative green h energy technologies to fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. The development of alternative energy is important because their Ene Tec supply is in decline and also because the extraction and use of fossil fuels is causing serious problems in many parts of the n o log y world including the polarization of economic wealth and even in some places military conflicts. The development of alternative Existence / Value Balance and / Expansion of harmony with energy sources and technologies powered by them is key to the restoration of our ecosystem, the long-term survival of function mankind humanity and even world peace. Hazardous Understanding the situation at hand, HMC is seeking to create a new paradigm in automotive technology development that Air pollution Materials will lead to the production of much greener vehicles and production technologies beyond regulation standards. The announcement of HMC’s environmental management philosophy and policies was designed to strike a balance between ‘Humanity’, ‘the Environment’ and ‘Society’. It was intended as the first step in the transition from a passive response to Human Nature regulation compliance to proactive environmental management. In addition, HMC began investigating what role automobiles can play in mitigating the relationship between mankind and nature. The ultimate goal of this investigation is to find a new role for automobiles as a green medium that can restore the relationship between human and nature, rather than the current situation where the automobile has a detrimental impact on the The automobile can be the environment while only serving human needs. Although it may be an impossible goal, HMC is committed to sustaining means by which we reconcile investment in the development of green energy and technologies to lead to a new era of clean alternative energy in the near the relationship between future. nature and humanity Our research areas include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants associated with the lifecycle of automobiles, the advancement of hybrid electric powertrain and the development of commercially viable electric vehicles and Envi ronmentally-friendly fuel cell electric vehicles, which will bring us closer to maintaining harmony between nature, humans and machines. HMC believes in the potential of automobiles to become a mediator that reinstates balance between nature and mankind.

We are constantly working to reduce GHG emissions not just at our production plants but at all operating sites including sales offices, service centers and research centers. 1,562,658 30,083 On April 14th 2010, the Korean government passed a new law the ‘Basic Law on Low Carbon Green 1,541,927 29,711 1,372,228 Growth’. The government also set a national target for reducing GHG emissions, by 30% by 2020 26,459 and introduced ‘GHG-Energy Target Management Scheme (TMS)’ to control GHG emissions from 17,821 large emitters. The TMS is a ‘top-down’ emissions reduction system which forces GHG reductions to achieve the 2020 target. Domestic HMC agreed its first target for reduction of GHG emissions and energy use with the Korean 721,132 government in 2011 and successfully delivered the agreed reduction despite a challenging business 654,889 12,673 554,211 10,724 environment, abnormal weather conditions and oil price fluctuations.

According to the GHG data, calculated using governmental guidelines and verified by Lloyd Register Quality Assurance Ltd., the total GHG emissions from HMC’s domestic operation sites was 1,541,927 tons in 2010 and 1,562,658 tons in 2011. The number of vehicles produced in 2011 increased by 8.5% to 1,892,254 units from 1,743,378 in 2010. Therefore, GHG emissions per vehicle produced decreased by 6.6% from 0.884 ton in 2010 to 0.826 ton in 2011. The GHG emissions from three production plants, Ulsan, Asan and Jeonju, accounted for 85.9% of the total emissions. The remaining 14.1% of the GHG emissions were from energy use at buildings including R&D facilities, service centers, headquarters and sales offices. In 2011, the proportion of direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions was 35.8% and 64.2% respectively. This is due to a heavy reliance on electricity supplied from the national grid in the manufacturing process of automobiles. According to our assessment, total GHG emissions from overseas production plants located in the U.S., China, India, Turkey, the Czech Republic and Russia increased 2.5 times from 285,000 tonsCO2 in 2007 to 721,132 tons-CO2 in 2011. This is due to increased production volumes at our overseas plants and to the addition of new production plants. 40 41 HMC 2012 sustainability management Economy Environment Society Appendix Sustainability Report GHG emissions reduction activities at production plants HMC has established a five-year plan (2011~2015) to reduce GHG emissions associated with production plants.

Development of NOx reduction technologies Among the pollutants in diesel exhaust, soluble organic fraction in CO, HC and PM are all cleaned by the oxidation catalyst. Most of the PM in the exhaust is removed by the DPF. However, the solution for achieving a 56% reduction in NOx emissions compared to Euro 5 level, as required by the Euro 6 standard, is still under development. We have strengthened our NOx reduction technology research including the development of the Lean NOx Trap (LNT), and a Low Pressure EGR System (LP EGR) for diesel engines.

The number of employees in China and India increased even more significantly to 15,420 up by 19% compared to 2010. Local hiring is expected to increase further as our overseas production and sales activities increase. Our overseas operations are making a positive contribution to local communities by creating jobs and stimulating local economies, with the added benefit of enhancing HMC’s brand image. 2 Promoting Diversity On the surface, rapid globalization has turned the world into several economic blocks where universal qualities are respected and similar goals are pursued. However, HMC recognizes that there still exists a strong need for personnel affairs policies which respect different lifestyles and cultures. Attracting talent from diverse backgrounds is a matter of strategic importance because the development of the right vehicles for different markets requires innovative ideas from people who understand each market. It is practically impossible for employees from a single culture and similar background to come up with innovative ideas that work for peoples of different cultures and tastes. Recognizing this, HMC is striving to create a corporate culture which respects diversity and creative thinking. 58 59 HMC 2012 sustainability management Economy Environment Society Appendix Sustainability Report ▒ FEMALE EMPLOYEE STATUS Increasing local hires and increasing the proportion of females are some of our key policies in promoting diversity within HMC.

Participants were provided with opportunities 2009 2010 2011 sites for working mothers. to introduce themselves to allow recruitment officers to assess their qualifications and whether their talents matched with HMC’s current needs. Students were also provided with opportunities to meet with HMC staff from specific areas, to enable their talents and interests to be discussed and assessed. We have also implanted a number of innovative recruitment programs overseas. For example, the Global Top Talent Forum is a unique recruitment program where participants are briefed on HMC’s research activities and achievements, followed by interactions to identify students with a strong interest in automotive research and adequate capacity to be part of HMC’s work. HMC also has a number of programs for the early identification and hiring of talented students including local scholarship programs, ‘the H Innovator’ internship program and global scholarship programs. The global scholarship program has a special significance because the program provides financial support to students in emerging economies. The program also has the practical benefit of securing top local talent as a part of HMC workforce. We are continuously trying to diversify our recruitment channels and methods to attract top talent as we hope to lead the transformation of recruitment culture in Korea. For example, HMC was one of the first companies to utilize social network services to advertise job opportunities. Increasing performance-based pay Implementation of standardized employee evaluation system Performance evaluation and compensation scheme has to be designed to boost job satisfaction and foster personal development, and to be managed in a fair and transparent manner. HMC’s reward scheme has strengthened the links between business performance and rewards, ensuring that employees are fairly evaluated and rewarded in respect of their achievements. We have also established a standardized job performance evaluation system for increased transparency and fairness. 60 61 HMC 2012 sustainability management Economy Environment Society Appendix Sustainability Report Employee rights support programs We are currently operating an employee complaint review committee and an employee complaint counseling office to ensure the speedy resolution of all issues.

HMC management fully recognizes the freedom of association, the right to organize, and the right for collective bargaining. A large number of HMC employees who work at domestic sites are members of the HMC Labor Union. Employee representative bodies are also in place at our overseas operation sites. The Labor-Management Consultation Committee represents union members at Hyundai Motor India (HMI), and the Public Assembly of Beijing Hyundai Motor Company (BHMC) represents BHMC employees. The employees of Hyundai Motor Manufacturing in the Czech Republic (HMMC) have formed a union which has become a member of the large Czech metal workers union, OS KOVO. A management-labor council is also in place where matters such as collective bargaining, the settlement of collective agreements and review of employee suggestions are discussed.
