OOur key focu us areas for the t 2008-201 12 cycle are as follows.

We keeep a close ey ye on perform mance to enssure that we’re using ourr resources as a y can, and haad set out to achieve redu eefficiently ass we possibly uctions of 5% % in energy eevery year between 2008 and 2012; and up to 20 011 we were e well on couurse for meetting o our target;. The T nature of o our busineess has chang ged significa antly in the ppast year with tthe result that we may have to adjustt our energy y reduction ta argets until ttechnology aallows us to be able to make m the scalee of energy savings s that we w had origiinally aanticipated. E Energy use in our buildin ngs fell by a lmost 4% between 2008 8 and 2011 – that’s desp pite aan increase in i total floor area. Lookiing at normaalised values,, i.e. compariing energy use u o on a like-for--like basis in n terms of flooor area, energy use has fallen f from 1157MJ/m2 in n 2 2008 to 151MJ/m2 in 2011. A margi nal increase in energy usse between 22010 and 20 011 rrelates to an n increase in refrigeration n units withiin the footprint of our exxisting buildings. Communiication on Progress P 201 12 7 BBetween 200 06 and 2011 1, our total caarbon footprrint (taking in nto account bbuildings annd ttransport) reeduced fromm 70,102 tonn nes to 48,730 tonnes – th hat’s a drop of 30%. This is tthe result of improved en nergy managgement and a switch to a renewable eelectricity pprovider. WWe are also working w witth our retail p partners to champion c en nergy efficienncy at store level. l TThis has led to electricityy savings of 2 20% in somee stores. Sustainable dessign is now an a iintegral featu ure of Musgrrave new stoore design an nd store refurbishments.. New stores bbuilt to our energy-savin e ng specificatiions are at leeast 30% more energy efficient tha an ttwo years aggo, and we aiim to increasse that efficieency differen ntial to 50% by 2020 (thiis eexcludes stores which arre transferrin ng brand namme from other groups). PPackaging g & waste WWaste avoidance and minimisation aare the preferred optionss when it com mes to dealinng wwith waste. Our advance ed waste min nimisation and waste ma anagement pprogrammes ccontinue to deliver d posittive results: wwe achieved a 48% redu uction in thee total amounnt of wwaste generaated in Musg grave betweeen 2006 and d 2011, with a notable falll-off of 25% % in tthe last year. FFor waste which cannot be avoided, Musgrave aiims to maxim mise recovery ry and recycling. OOur Group reecycling rate e now standss at 92%; thaat is up from m 63% in 20006 (and 53% in 22002). By 2011, 2 the amount of wastte going to laandfill has de ecreased to almost one ettenth of whaat it was in 2006. 2 Consisstent with maature waste managemennt systems, 201022011 data sh how a 'platea au' effect as oour waste reecovery activvities reach nnear-maximu um iimpact. LLogistics AAs large tran nsportation fleet f operatoors, we recoggnise the env vironmental iimpact of ou ur bbusiness opeerations. We e try to avoidd or minimise journeys wherever w wee can. Our aadvanced route planning g and schedu uling systemss achieve optimum efficiiency. We ha ave aalso investedd in driver trraining to furrther improv ve fuel efficie ency. Communiication on Progress P 201 12 8 WWe aim to ‘bbackhaul’ from suppliers wherever we w can this means m plannning our ccollections and a deliveries to avoid tr ucks returniing empty to depots. Afteer delivery to t sstores, vehiccles collect go oods from w wholesale sup ppliers to ma aximise capaacity on returrn jjourneys, theereby reduciing emission ns by taking supplier s vehicles off the rroad. We ha ave aalso added ‘ddouble deck’’ trailers to oour fleet, whiich increasess the capacityy of each ddelivery vehhicle by 58%.. WWe are comm mitted to red ducing vehiclle-related CO O2 emissionss. Our total flleet emissionns rreduced by 4,341 tonnes of CO2e in n 2011 versu us 2006. The e distance trravelled by our ffleet increased by 2% be etween 2010 0 and 2011, related r to an increase in tthe number and ggeographical spread of ouro stores. LLooking at our normalise ed CO2 emisssions, i.e. CO2 emissions relative to thhe number of ccases sold (aa measure off our businesss output), reesults are alsso extremelyy positive: we e aachieved a 10% 1 reductiion between n 2006 and 2011 (CO2e em missions weere reduced from f 00.220 kilograams of CO2e per case sol d in 2006 to 0.198 in 2011). We cann attribute th his ssuccess to teechnical upgrrades to our fleet, as well as strategicc backhaul, ddynamic sscheduling and a driver tra aining. BBeing a go ood neighb bour IIt’s importannt that we acct as good corrporate citizzens to our neighbours inn the commu unity we strive too operate acccording to th hese principlles: 1. Keepp nuisance to o an absolutee minimum, before people even thinkk of complaining. 2. Inforrm people ab bout our devvelopment pllans, so they can contribuute to them. 3.
