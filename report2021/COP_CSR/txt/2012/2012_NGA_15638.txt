UN Global Compact Communication on Progress KNEWROW RESOURCES In March 2010 KNEWROW RESOURCES joined the UN Global Compact – the world’s most extensive initiative for corporate social responsibility. As a voluntary, multi-stakeholder initiative, the UN Global Compact brings together all relevant actors – government, business, labour and civil society – to advance universal principles in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption. By joining the Global Compact, we wish to demonstrate our continuing commitment to advancing the ten principles of the Global Compact in our policies, programmes and business operations. This is our first Communication on Progress to Global Compact . It covers calendar year from 2010 to 2011. Below we have given brief descriptions of the Company’s policies, programmes, agreements and activities that help promote the principles of the Global Compact. The activities are organised under the principles of the Global Compact that they apply to. Being a very small organisation, we are able to report the few activity carried out in each Area of the Principle, while we intend to do more in the future Company Name: KNEWROW RESOURCES D ate: MARCH 21, 2012 Unit (if applicable) Address: ROAD 22, HOUSE 1A, OWODE HOUSING ESTATE, APATA, IBADAN OYO STATE.

We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the Global Compact is the annual submission of a Communication on Progress (COP) that describes our company’s efforts to implement the ten principles. We support public accountability and transparency, and therefore commit to report on progress annually according to the Global Compact COP policy.

The code presents a set of guidelines to ensure that the Group and its employees avoid corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery A brief description of our Processes or Systems: As part of its good corporate governance practices, the Company gives employees the opportunity to be whistleblowers. If an employee has any knowledge of irregularities, they must be reported. The Company wants to establish and maintain an environment that encourages the free flow of information. This also applies to the security of employees who report a suspicion and protection against retaliatory measures towards them. Reports and questions that are received through the whistleblower system are therefore treated confidentially. Actions implemented in the last year / planned for next year: Since 2010, the company has always taken part in any organised workshop that has to do with Anti-Corruption, most especially those organised by the UN Global Compact Network in Nigeria. Measurable Results or Outcomes Finally, we have established a function to assist the management in ensuring that the Company complies with laws, regulations and ethical standards. 5 How do you intend to make this COP available to your stakeholders?
