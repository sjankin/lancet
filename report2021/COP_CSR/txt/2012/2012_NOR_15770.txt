In the first phase of the program, TOMRA has prioritized the head office in Norway and the major markets of Germany and USA. In 2011 TOMRA acquired Odenberg Group, a leading provider of optical sorting and processing technology for the fresh and processed food industries. Odenberg’s products maximize yield and recovery, while at the same time reducing waste and minimizing energy and chemical usage. This leads to better business and a better environment.
