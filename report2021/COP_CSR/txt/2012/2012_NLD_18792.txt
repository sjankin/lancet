Amsterdam RAI was one of the 25 finalists nominated by Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf for the Green TOP 100; a prize awarded to the greenest company in the Netherlands for which over 150 companies from various sectors had registered. The nomination served as recognition that Amsterdam RAI is indeed a frontrunner in its sustainable initiatives and performance.

During the recertification audit the auditor was especially impressed with our compliance with legislation and regulations, our sense of responsibility with regard to noise and transport emissions, our waste management and energy consumption (and particularly the many changes made to further reduce consumption), and the broad focus on CSR. Amsterdam RAI was also commended for its waste separation processes: ‘One of the best operational waste separation processes in the business.’ [7 ] RAI Sustainability Report 1.3 Stakeholders Amsterdam RAI always strives to find the Satisfied clients new methodology not only looks at the right balance between the various interests In 2011, Amsterdam RAI established new satisfaction of clients at specific times but of our stakeholders within our operational research methods to measure client also at the relative importance of the management.

[ 27 ] RAI Sustainability Report Interview Katelijn Wilhelmy (Communication Manager) Creating internal awareness for charities continues to be a challenge ‘In late October ten RAI employees travelled to Kenya together with some 90 other mountain bikers to participate in the Kenya Classic for AMREF Flying Doctors. Six days to bike 350 kilometres in the shadow of the Kilimanjaro. AMREF Flying Doctors is one of the two charities I have dedicated myself to since I started working at Amsterdam RAI. This difficult physical and mental challenge was an opportunity for me to see what we actually achieve in Africa: Creating a better health for everyone. A great many colleagues were involved in the preparations and the event, and the project contributed hugely to the awareness among RAI employees. And, of course, it resulted in a great contribution to AMREF Flying Doctors.’ Focus Charities and the future Amsterdam RAI’s charity policy is clearly focused on two In the past Amsterdam RAI has worked hard to create a specific charities, but an increased focus within CSR within the substantial internal awareness regarding charities. Our next organisation would be a positive development.

Based on our experience with joint activities in recent years and on our mutual expertise and quality, we are happy to continue this collaboration to realise a joint goal: Better living conditions and better health in Africa. AMREF Flying Doctors Established in 1957 in Kenya as ‘Flying Doctors’, AMREF has developed into the largest African health organisation. Its goal is to structurally improve the health of vulnerable communities in Africa and help them escape poverty. In the Netherlands AMREF Flying Doctors is active in fund­ raising and ensuring responsible use of these funds for AMREF’s work in Africa. The organisation also forms a basis for and attracts attention to improving health in Africa. Indicated as an ‘institution for general benefit’ (ANBI), it has the CBF hallmark and ISO certification. Over the years, Amsterdam RAI has contributed its knowledge and tools to various fundraising activities for AMREF Flying Doctors. In addition to financial contributions this involved space, technology and personnel which helped keep the organisation’s spending in the Netherlands to a minimum. The financial contributions from Amsterdam RAI went to the AMREF programme ‘Better health and living conditions in Mtwara’ (Tanzania). With Kenya Classic this project, which runs until April 2012, A unique and successful project organised for the first time this year was the Kenya Amsterdam RAI supports a water and Classic.

We believe that a good relationship with the ‘neighbours’ is of great importance, and therefore listen to the local residents and try to prevent any form of inconvenience. In addition to this sports event, Godson Maro, programme manager for AMREF in Tanzania, held a lecture for the international exhibition teams to increase the awareness of AMREF’s work among RAI employees.

Whether Amsterdam RAI is on track is currently hard to determine. In practice it turns out to be difficult to define in the purchasing ‘green products and services’. In 2011 Amsterdam RAI therefore started to further chain define procurement with the intention of making it more measureable. There are many initiatives that contribute to procurement within Amsterdam RAI. These are mainly individual initiatives, however, on the article or goods group level. A major example is signing the Convenant for the Cleaning and Window-washing Sector which includes agreements on good working conditions for the cleaning staff. Further professionalization is needed to develop a structure, draw up frameworks Amsterdam RAI took a major step in sustainable and make procurement more measurable. purchasing when it signed a contract with one of our The latter is essential to monitor our biggest suppliers, the cleaning and window-washing progress and change course when needed. sector.
