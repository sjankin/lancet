This year, we transitioned to a web-based presentation of our full annual data. We are also providing an abbreviated, printed companion piece. This decision was made to provide the best possible access to information for our stakeholders, most of whom access this material via our website. We hope you will enjoy this more dynamic and data-rich reporting format. Through this report, we hope to convey how we sustainably conduct our business, since living as a global citizen is at the core of who we are as a company. We look forward to developing a dialogue with our stakeholders and welcome your feedback.

This report does not address the performance of our joint ventures, third-party manufacturers, suppliers, or contractors. However, as our commitment to global citizenship evolves we are increasingly holding all suppliers/vendors, partners, and franchises accountable to our policies and procedures concerning safety, health, and sustainability. This report addresses the full range of material economic, environmental, and social impacts of the organization, within the boundary of the report as described in the GRI Index. The basis for reporting on facilities does not significantly affect comparability from period to period. There were no effects of any restatements of information identified in this report. We have also included 2012 information to add clarification to some of the described 2011 activities. Green Product Marketing and Zero Waste at the Pleasanton, California site have been externally assured. Our Board of Directors have the ultimate responsibility for approving the strategy, goals and resources for sustainability, including but not limited to the areas of ethics, environment, labor and human rights. As part of our performance process, the Board annually reviews the status and progress of key sustainability initiatives. In addition, this report includes communication on our progress toward the principles outlined by the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). In 2011, Life Technologies continued our support of the ten principles of UNGC with respect to human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption.
