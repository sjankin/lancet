Gilles Benoist Chief Executive Officer CNP Assurances_ The lifetime insurer_ 1 Corporate Social Responsibility at the Group Our sustainable development commitments CNP Assurances’s sustainable development process is based on identifying stakeholders and the social value-added delivered by our business. CNP Assurances has always upheld human rights and citizens’ rights, in line with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and has always complied with the labour standards of the ILO and the national labour laws in each host country. In pledging our support for the Global Compact in 2003, we reaffirmed our commitment to respecting its fundamental principles, combating corruption and protecting the environment. In 2010, following the example of CNP Argentina and Caixa Seguros, CNP UniCredit Vita also pledged support for the Compact. In 2009, we played an active role in launching the Association Française de l’Assurance’s sustainable development charter. Our commitments under the charter are to meet core social responsibility challenges in the insurance industry, including helping to reduce social vulnerability and to combat climate change, support economic development and promote socially responsible investment. In 2011, CNP Assurances adopted the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), ushering in a new phase in its commitment as a responsible investor. 2 CNP Assurances_The lifetime insurer_ A SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYER All Group companies share four basic principles: • Respect for human rights. • Freedom of association and the effective recognition of the The ten principles of right to collective bargaining. the Global Compact • Support for employees throughout their careers.

In all, these programmes have planted 17 hectares of trees in the Atlantic Forest. Reforesting promotes biodiversity, protects water resources and preserves the soil. It also creates carbon sinks in areas previously used for dairy farming, an activity that is largely responsible for deforestation. By reforesting, farmers can become forest “stewards” without losing the income they would otherwise enjoy from dairy farming.

CNP Assurances_ The lifetime insurer_ 41 Auditor’s review report on selected social and environment indicators published in the 2011 CSR report of CNP Assurances This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditor’s review report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers. The review report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. A t the request of CNP Assurances and in our capacity as the Group’s Statutory Auditors, we have performed a review for the purpose of enabling us to express moderate assurance on a selection of social and environmental indicators published in the Group’s 2011 CSR Report. The selected environmental indicators were as follows: • Water use • Electricity use • Gas use • Heating use (as supplied by the CPCU district heating network in Paris) • Fuel use • Paper use in internal operations The selected social indicators were as follows: • Number of employees • Percentage of employees under fixed-term contracts • Percentage of women employees • Age pyramid • Number of new hires under permanent or fixed-term contracts • Total separations • Percentage of part-time employees • Absenteeism (including and excluding maternity leave) • Number of workplace accidents • Number of training days These social and environmental indicators were prepared and compiled under the responsibility of the Sustainable Development Department in compliance with the standards for collecting annual corporate social responsibility data used by CNP Assurances and available from this department.Our responsibility, based on our review, is to express a conclusion on these indicators. 42 CNP Assurances_ The lifetime insurer_ Nature and scope of our work We carried out our work in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We performed the procedures described below to obtain moderate assurance that the selected environmental and social indicators are free from material misstatement. We did not perform all of the procedures required to obtain higher level of assurance. Our procedures were as follows: • We assessed the reporting procedures used by the Group with regard to their relevance, reliability, objectivity and understandability. • At the Group level, we performed analytical procedures and verified, on a test basis, the calculation and consolidation of the social and economic data used to produce the indicators. These analyses were supported in particular by interviews with persons in the Sustainable Development department responsible for preparing and applying the procedures and consolidating the data. • We performed our audit at CNP Assurances, whose scope includes the legal entities of CNP Assurances, CNP IAM, Previposte, ITV, and CNP International. The scope used for water and energy use included the facilities in Paris, Angers and Arcueil, but excluded offices outside the greater Paris region. Within this scope: – We interviewed the persons in charge of preparing the data to verify that the procedures were properly understood and correctly applied; – We performed detailed assessments, on a test basis, to verify that the selected data had been correctly calculated and were consistent with the supporting documentation. CNP Assurances accounts for 89% of the Group’s consolidated electricity use, 40% of its water use and, for the social indicators, 67% of its workforce. To assist us in performing these procedures, we called on our teams specialised in sustainable development. Conclusion Based on our review, no material irregularities came to light causing us to believe that the reviewed environmental and social indicators were not prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the standards for collecting annual corporate social responsibility data used by CNP Assurances and applicable in 2011.
