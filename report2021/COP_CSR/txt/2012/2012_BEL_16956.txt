SNCB Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2011 Destination better About... …the UN Global Compact Network The United Nations Global Compact is a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption: • Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. • Principle 2: Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. • Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. • Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. • Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labour. • Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. • Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. • Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. • Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. • Principle 10: Businesses should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery. Endorsed by chief executives, the Global Compact is a practical framework for the development, implementation, and disclosure of sustainability policies and practices, offering participants a wide spectrum of workflows, management tools and resources — all designed to help advance sustainable business models and markets. Overall, the Global Compact pursues two complementary objectives: 1. Mainstream the ten principles in business activities around the world. 2. Catalyse actions in support of broader UN goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. With these objectives in mind, the Global Compact has shaped an initiative that provides collaborative solutions to the most fundamental challenges facing both business and society. The initiative seeks to combine the best qualities of the UN, such as moral authority and convening power, with the private sector’s solution-finding strengths and the expertise and capacities of a range of key stakeholders. The Global Compact is global and local; private and public; voluntary yet accountable. (Source: UN Global Compact) 2 …a COP When joining the Global Compact, companies make a commitment to issue an annual Communication on Progress (COP), a public disclosure to stakeholders (e.g., investors, consumers, civil society and governments) on progress made in implementing the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, and in supporting broad UN development goals. The COP is the most important expression of a participant’s commitment to the Global Compact and its principles. (Source: UN Global Compact) …the scope of this report This COP is limited to SNCB; it does not report on the activities of its sister companies Infrabel and SNCB Holding, nor its subsidiaries and its participations. …the reporting year All actions described in this report took place in 2011 (unless otherwise stated). The data also refer to 2011. How to read this report? The report is built around three sections. The first section describes the profile of SNCB, its strategic challenges and its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy. You will also read about SNCB’s corporate governance approach. The following sections explain our CSR efforts towards our four main target groups: our customers, our employees, our stakeholders and society. In the final part of the report you will find an overview of our fleet and the details of our reporting methodology. 3 Table of contents 2011 Highlights 5 CEO’s message 6 Organization 7 SNCB’s approach to CSR 19 Committed to meeting our responsibilities Responsibility towards our customers: improve quality of our service 22 Responsibility towards our employees: anchor sustainability into corporate culture 36 Responsibility towards our stakeholders: operate cost-effective services 51 Responsibility towards society: contribute to a sustainable mobility 59 Fleet overview 72 Reporting methodology 78 4 2011 highlights PEOPLE Operational safety (page 24) 66.5% of our trains are equipped with the automatic train control system TBL1+ Assistance to Passengers with Reduced Mobility (PRM) (page 26) +/81,000 support interventions PLANET Sustainable mode of transport (page 27) 36,993 tons of CO2 emissions from passenger train operations saved compared to 2010 Energy efficiency (page 44) 24% lower fuel and natural gas consumption in our workshops between 2005 and 2011 (weather corrected) PROFIT & PERFORMANCE Passenger growth (page 28) 229.2 million passengers transported Productivity and efficiency (page 48) BeLEAN project launched at Ostend and Salzinnes workshops PEOPLE PLANET PROFIT & PERFORMANCE Prime Sustainability Rating awarded by Oekom Research (SNCB Group) (page 21) 5 CEO’s message A 2010 global survey of 766 CEOs by Accenture and the UN Global Compact showed that 93 percent of CEOs consider sustainability critical to their company’s future success. Even against the background of a global economic downturn, sustainability is acknowledged as a source of cost efficiency and revenue growth. Since its establishment in 2005, SNCB has recognized the importance of business sustainability. Business sustainability is regarded as managing the ‘triple bottom line’. According to this principle – summarized as the three ‘P’s (people, planet, profit) – a company must not only have an eye for creating economic surplus value, but also for social and ecological aspects. This approach is a perfect fit for SNCB: enabling and providing sustainable mobility has been its core business for decades and conforms in every respect to the triple bottom line criteria. Nowadays, opting for the train is indeed equivalent to opting for the planet: trains are a low-carbon transport mode, offer a safe transport alternative, provide green employment and help solve congestion. In short, the train is an instrument that can and must contribute to the solution of a great many mobility issues. In the coming years, SNCB also wants to continue to play the sustainability card in its business operations. The various responsibilities in this area are enormous: improve the quality of our service for our customers, integrate sustainability in the corporate culture for our employees, operate cost-effective services for our stakeholders and contribute to a sustainable mobility for society. In this first SNCB COP report you will learn more about the initiatives SNCB took in 2011 to assume its corporate social responsibility, according to the commitment SNCB made when joining the UN Global Compact and its local Belgian Network in June 2011. SNCB supports the UN Global Compact principles and will continue to keep them in mind whilst implementing its business objectives.

SNCB Mobility is expected to provide its passengers with a comprehensive range of national connections together with a number of destinations just across the Belgian borders. The fares are set up in such a way as to promote home/work travel, home/school travel and mobility of the socially underprivileged. Given the fact that passenger revenues cannot cover all costs, expenses for national passenger transport are co-financed by the government. The public service obligations SNCB has to fulfil in order to receive this government compensation are described in a management contract (the so-called ‘contrat de gestion’). The domestic passenger rail market is currently not open to competition, so SNCB is the sole operator on the domestic passenger rail market in Belgium.

SNCB does not receive government financing for its commercial activities (which are open to competition). International trains are operated by SNCB Europe, SNCB’s international passenger division. The high-speed trains Thalys, TGV (SNCF), ICE (DB) and Eurostar provide the international traveller with comprehensive service to the largest cities in our neighbouring countries. In the competitive international passenger traffic market, SNCB Europe cooperates with Thalys, DB and SNCF. Since September 2010, Eurostar has become an independent train operating company (Eurostar International Ltd.) which operates high speed traffic between Belgium and the United Kingdom.

Freight Services is SNCB’s division that manages the freight stations. Freight Services conducts tasks such as shunting and marshalling in the freight stations. The other freight activities are provided by SNCB Logistics NV/SA. SNCB Logistics NV/SA has been an independent branch of SNCB and SNCB Holding, operational as railway operator for freight transport since 1 February 2011. SNCB Logistics and its subsidiaries offer services on freight axes and in market segments such as steel and container transport. The majority of the subsidiaries are responsible for commercializing freight transport. Their activities also include container transport, inland shipping and sea transport. The activities of SNCB Logistics and its subsidiaries are not covered in this report. In order to ensure that its activities function effectively, SNCB is also responsible for purchasing, maintaining, managing and financing its rolling stock. The SNCB Technics department operates a range of workshops across the country for maintaining and managing rolling stock.

As a public law company, SNCB fully endorses this endeavour to raise awareness and improve the effective management and control of its activities. In the framework of its public service tasks, SNCB must be accountable to the State and its customers, the train passengers. In terms of Corporate Governance rules, SNCB concentrates on the reference code imposed by Royal Decree of 6 June 2010 (Belgian Statute Book of 28 June 2010), except for explicitly different definitions from the Act from 21 March 1991 regarding the reform of some economic governmental companies.

The number of Executive Directors is determined by the Board of Directors. They are appointed by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Managing Director and after consultation with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. Their appointments can be revoked by the Board of Directors. The members of the Executive Committee have full power to carry out their roles within the SNCB. Linguistic parity is respected. The members of the Management Committee* are invited to meetings, together with the managers of the three departments under the responsibility of the Managing Director (Strategic and Legal Affairs, Central Support (Human Resources) and Public & Corporate Affairs). The Executive Committee usually meets once a week. In general terms, the Executive Committee is responsible for day-to-day management and for representing the company with regard to this management, as well as for executing Board decisions. It also has responsibilities delegated to it by the Board and others imposed by law, such as negotiating the management contract. * This Committee was created by decision of the Executive Committee on 4 January 2005. The Board of Directors, meeting on 16 April 2007, ratified its agreement with the Committee’s composition and decided that the managers of the three departments under the responsibility of the Managing Director (Strategic and Legal Affairs, Human Resources and Public & Corporate Affairs) should attend its meetings. 17 I Chapter 1: Organization Monitoring bodies In addition, SNCB also encompasses monitoring The Government Commissioner verifies that College of Commissioners bodies such as the Government Commissioner thev law, the statutes and the management In all independent public companies, control and the College of Commissioners. contract are observed.

The UN approved this request so that SNCB is a fully-fledged member of the Global Compact Network. With this, SNCB underscores that it endorses the principles of the Global Compact and that these principles systematically constitute part of the business strategy. Together with 61 other Belgian companies, SNCB forms part of the local Belgian Global Compact Network.

SNCB Group has been awarded a “Prime” sustainability status. This means it ranks among the world’s best companies within the rail transport and logistics sector and fulfils the industry-specific minimum requirements defined by Oekom Research (best in class). 21 I Chapter 2: Corporate social responsibility CHAPTER 3 improving the quality of our service Introduction In recent years, SNCB has seen an enormous increase in the number of passengers and has invested heavily in new trains, better service and in its employees. This has not yet produced the desired results: the quality of service took an unacceptable step backwards and is currently insufficient for a number of essential indicators such as punctuality. It is therefore essential that SNCB assumes its responsibility towards its customers by improving the quality of its service. One of the challenges for the coming years is to focus the operating structures even more on the needs of the customer and in this sense to streamline the level of quality the customer desires and the organization. SNCB’s vision concerning quality translates into the motto that the company launched in 2009 and on which all employees work day in day out to effectively achieve it: destination better! 23 I Chapter 3: Responsibility towards our customers People Increasing Since 2005, management has pursued a strategy which emphasizes the following fundamental Roll-out of TBL1+: plan vs. actual (% of fleet) operational safety objectives: Actual Plan Safety, always a priority • Increasing the level of safety in the short-term 100% Passenger safety is a top priority for SNCB.

At the end of 2011, 22% of new rolling stock was equipped with ETCS. 25 I Chapter 3: Responsibility towards our customers Improving train accessibility The accessibility of rolling stock remains one of SNCB’s constant focal points. This will become Target even more important in future because of population ageing. That is why in the long-term SNCB gradually increase number of trains that can would like to enable passengers with reduced mobility (PRM) to use the train with no or limited accommodate wheelchairs external assistance. Schedule In order to reach this goal, wheelchair accessibility to rolling stock should improve. In line with not defined this, 76 multifunctional M6 double-deck carriages have been taken into service in the past few years, 19 of which in 2011. These passenger cars have lowered access doors and offer increased Situation 2011 space. Trains that are easy to access are not only advantageous for passengers with limited mobil22.5% of all SNCB trains can accommodate ity, but also for passengers who carry a child’s pram, suitcase or bike with them. By the end 2011, wheelchairs 22.5% of all SNCB trains were able to accommodate wheelchairs. Status Expanding services for passengers with reduced mobility Passengers with reduced mobility (PRM) are able to make use of a system of mobile teams which provide assistance in stations where no or insufficient numbers of staff are available. This service is called “B-for-You Assistance”. Target gradually expand and optimize services for This assistance is provided in 114 stations, from the first to the last train of the day, seven days a passengers with reduced mobility week if a request is submitted to the Call Centre at least 24 hours in advance by internet or telephone. In addition, PRMs can be driven by taxi to one of these 114 stations from the 17 stations Schedule where no assistance is available. In 2011, SNCB Mobility employees officially provided assistance not defined about 81,000 times to PRMs (of which 30.750 requests via the Call Centre, the other requests via the station).

SNCB 27 I Chapter 3: Responsibility towards our customers Profit & Performance Improving punctuality For several years, the punctuality of train traffic has been under pressure. Despite strict followup of delays and an analysis of the problem, in recent years SNCB has made little progress. Punctuality is the result of a complex interplay of factors that have been put under pressure by the robust growth of the number of passengers, more intensive use of the railway network, infrastructure works and the age of the trains. Punctual driving is a vital concern for SNCB. Delays are the greatest annoyance of the customers and do not benefit the image of the company. With the punctuality action plan, SNCB, in collaboration with Infrabel, wants to win the battle against the clock. The action plan contains more than 100 measures in 6 different areas such as transport planning and scheduling, rolling stock…. These measures should have positive impact on punctuality in the short and medium-term. 28 I Chapter 3: Responsibility towards our customers Punctuality: we are working on it!

Between 2000 and 2011, SNCB transported up to 58% more passengers (from 139.9 mil. passengers in 2000 to 221.3 mil. passengers in 2011).

According to the Planning Bureau, this growth will even outstrip the total growth of mobility. The long-term challenge for SNCB, therefore, will also consist of accommodating the expected growth of demand in a timely and effective manner.

In order to gauge subjective customer satisfaction, SNCB Mobility has developed its own tool: the quality barometer. The customer’s perception of quality is evaluated on the basis of the quality In 2011, modernization of the SNCB fleet was barometer. effectively accomplished.

To this end, SNCB employees serve to formulate an answer to the challenges of tomorrow which are situated within each pillar of the triple bottom line. Against the background of increasing interculturalism, a crooked age pyramid (nearly half of SNCB employees will reach natural retirement age in the coming ten years) and onrushing liberalization, more and more attention will also have to be paid to increasing productivity and accentuating care for the environment. 37 I Chapter 4: Responsibility towards our employees People Encouraging diversity Number of employees/age SNCB wants to profile itself as a company 1,600 where diversity is important. Staff regulations do guarantee equal treatment of all employees, 1,400 but in order to provide a better response to 1,200 the changing social context, in 2006 the three companies of the SNCB Group implemented a 1,000 diversity policy. This diversity is manifested at different levels: sex, origin, handicap, educa800 tion level and age are criteria that SNCB wants to take into consideration. Respect for every600 one and appreciation for every employee are important in this. 400 The importance of diversity is also clearly 200 illustrated by the recruitment campaigns (at the level of the SNCB Group). The message is 0 simple: every function is open to everyone who 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 meets the requirements, irrespective of age, sex, origin…. This situation creates a double challenge: train maintenance. For freight cars, competition Age attracting a sufficient number of recently eduhas been active for a few years, but evolution is cated and motivated staff, and at the same time also likely for passenger equipment. It suffices SNCB has a disproportionately large number ensuring the transfer of knowledge from the to look at the Netherlands, where various train of older employees in service, many of whom old to the new generation.

About 60% of all staff is older than 45. 38 I Chapter 4: Responsibility towards our employees Women At the end of 2011, SNCB employed 2,157 women. The railways used to be a male bastion (explained by the fact that some rather technical jobs have long been regarded as jobs for men), but female employees are gaining ground: their numbers have increased by 40.80% since 2005. Number of women per job category (end 2011) Train guards 738 Administrative staff 674 Station staff 418 Train drivers 158 Workshops 48 Number of female employees 3,000 2,025 2,157 2,000 1,793 1,917 1,532 1,516 1,598 1,000 0 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 39 I Chapter 4: Responsibility towards our employees On 1 April 2011, SNCB organized a ‘Ladies Day’ for the sixth time. By organizing these ‘Ladies Days’, SNCB encourages its female employees to further develop their ambitions. On this day, women from various personnel categories can participate in a variety of workshops and discussions about their function and experience within the company. This year there were workshops around the themes of stress resistance, assertiveness, awareness of interaction and reaction, and so on. The discussions addressed themes such as “The perception of women within SNCB” and “Railway employee, a job for women?”. In conclusion, it is not insignificant to mention that SNCB makes no distinction between men and women when it comes to remuneration of its employees 40 I Chapter 4: Responsibility towards our employees Foreigners Reclassification The number of foreign employees is very difPeople who can no longer carry out their ficult to ascertain. This is due to the fact that, regular role for medical reasons can continue on the one hand, an exact definition of ‘foreign’ to work within SNCB thanks to a reclassification has yet to be provided and, on the other hand, system for personnel within the company.

Amendments to the Personnel Statute in 2007, however, formalized accessibility to statutory roles for any member of the European Economic Area and Swiss subjects. There are no restrictions at all regarding nationality for nonstatutory positions. At the end of 2011, SNCB employed 107 people of non-Belgian nationality (0.54% of all employees). 41 I Chapter 4: Responsibility towards our employees Fighting SNCB currently has 180 individuals who are ready to support their fellow train guards.

Finally, the Regional Joint Commission is responsible for the issue in terms of local personnel. They monitor the evolution of employment at a regional level and also consider local conditions in terms of performance and break times, holidays and special employment schemes. They investigate proposals and complaints from personnel in relation to prevention and protection at work and the organization of work in general. 43 I Chapter 4: Responsibility towards our employees Planet Reducing energy consumption in our workshops The rising demand for energy and the need to limit CO2 emissions requires that more attention is paid to energy efficiency. In its management contract with the State, SNCB is committed to help ensure that energy consumption in the buildings of the entire SNCB Group is reduced by 7.5% by 2012 and no less than 20% by 2020. SNCB has a good number of projects running in order to reach this objective. All workshops are subjected to an energy audit. These audits lead to an action plan for each workshop to limit energy consumption. Specific measures which have arisen from this are, for example, installation of air curtains, renewal of lighting and heating, implementation of combined heat and power…. And it has been a big success, as between 2005 and 2011 the company already succeeded in using approximately 19% less energy in its workshops! Consumption of fuel oil and gas (weather corrected) even decreased by 24%* in this period. Reduction of non-traction energy consumption (weather corrected) 2% 0% Target -2% reduce energy consumption of workshops -4% by 7.5% by 2012 and 20% by 2020 SNCB-Group (vs. 2005) -6% -8% Schedule -10% 2012 -12% -14% Situation 2011 SNCB -19% (vs. -1.9 SNCB-Group) -16% -18% Status -20% * Figures for 2011 include SNCB Logistics NV/SA to enable a correct comparison with base year 2005. 44 I Chapter 4: Responsibility towards our employees Reducing water use in our workshops Water is a precious resource, for nature as well as humanity. It must therefore be used sensibly. SNCB is striving to reduce the use of mains water, to use more rainwater, to limit discharge of hazardous waste products into the waste water and improve recuperation of waste water after treatment. The maintenance centres for the trains, including the ‘train-washers’, are the greediest consumers of water. In the maintenance centres, water is mainly used for sanitary facilities, showers, cleaning workshops, train-wash installations and filling the train water reservoirs. Rainwater is also increasingly being used for flushing toilets, cleaning workshops and washing the trains. Given the significant rise in water prices, the capture and use of rain water is economically interesting, however it is not free. Investments must be made in the infrastructure in order to capture it, and an internal distribution network with pipes and pumps must be installed.

Associations and official bodies which influence the policy of the railway operator are among the key stakeholders of SNCB. Our stakeholders constitute an important target group in this report. Through its financing mechanisms via the government, the railway in our country requires substantial financial contributions from the community. It goes without saying that it is expected from a company like SNCB that in exchange for this, it provides a balanced and high-quality offering of train services and in this pays great attention to adequate management of operational costs. 52 I Chapter 5: Responsibility towards our stakeholders People Developing a new train offer In 2011, SNCB Mobility ran approximately 3,700 domestic passenger trains on every workday and approximately 1,900 every weekend day. • trains that ensure punctual and fast intercity/ interregional connections (IC/IR trains); • trains that ensure local connections (L); • rush hour trains or extra trains (P) • trains on suburban connections in and around Brussels, as an intermediate step towards realization of a regional express network or RER (CR); • tourist trains which must accommodate season-related needs (T).

SNCB is also ready to enter into dialogue with local authorities or clients in order to, for instance, discuss the consequences of a change to the timetable or to provide more explanation about recurring problems on certain connections. Target engage stakeholders through informational meetings Schedule yearly about 4 meetings with key stakeholders Situation 2011 3 meetings organised Status 54 I Chapter 5: Responsibility towards our stakeholders Planet Promoting intermodality SNCB focuses on new technologies in order to 520,000 season ticket holders (commuting address the challenges of intermodality. train tickets and school train tickets) will make use of the new chip card.

SNCB season ticket holders will receive the first instalment by mid-2012. Starting in mid-2013, season tickets will only be created and renewed as a chip card. It is estimated that some 55 I Chapter 5: Responsibility towards our stakeholders Steering environmental planning Transport by train holds multiple ecological advantages. One of the less commented trump cards of the railway system is the use of space. In comparison to car transport, rail needs three times less space to transport an equal number of passengers. This makes railways particularly interesting for densely populated areas. Railways are a perfect tool in the development of a sustainable environmental planning. Urban planners can take into account the presence of stations to concentrate industrial sites or new city areas, avoiding the use of open space for new constructions. SNCB can stimulate the development of industrial or living areas by creating new services or stations. A good example was the opening of the “Noorderkempen” station in a rural, but rapidly developing area without any train services, on the newly built high speed line between Antwerp (Belgium) and Breda (the Netherlands). Actually it daily serves about a thousand commuters, but SNCB expects this number to grow in the near future. The service helps to reduce congestion on the saturated Antwerp – Breda highway in the region, which is an important transit axe for international transport. 56 I Chapter 5: Responsibility towards our stakeholders Profit & Performance Increasing profitability SNCB suffered heavily between 2008 and 2010 under the consequences of the economic crisis Target and under the sharp increase of a number of significant costs, such as energy costs. It is of espositive EBITDA sential importance to SNCB to reduce these losses as quickly as possible in order to guarantee a sustainable future for the company. Schedule 2015 For this reason, the Board of Directors of SNCB in October 2011 approved a plan to achieve a positive operating cash flow (EBITDA by 2015). Between 2012 and 2015, SNCB will implement a Situation 2011 number of reorganization measures, all with a view to the social importance of its activities and EBITDA of -107.7 mil. € without unconditional dismissals. Status The measures are aimed at more rational and more productive functioning. A limited number of staff members who are made redundant in a natural manner will not be replaced. Furthermore, a number of general costs such as consultancy, ICT, publicity, rent and cleaning of buildings will be reduced. Finally, the train offering will also be streamlined: starting at the end of 2012, 193 trains with a very low covering cost will be removed (approximately 5% of the total offering). An alternative will be offered for affected passengers. 57 I Chapter 5: Responsibility towards our stakeholders Progress indicators Stakeholders 2008 2009 2010 2011 Number of annual informational meetings 3 3 4 3 with key stakeholders Profitability 2008 2009 2010 2011 EBITDA (mil. €) -108 -288 -126 -107.7 58 I Chapter 5: Responsibility towards our stakeholders CHAPTER 6 contribute to a sustainable mobility Introduction As one of the country’s largest employers, we make a vital contribution to the economy, investing millions of euros. We keep employees and families moving and we provide an essential public service for many people. We also play an essential role in contributing to sustainable mobility: the train is a safe, climate friendly, increasingly quiet and congestion-free mode of transport. 60 I Chapter 6: Responsibility towards the community People Offering safe mobility The train is intrinsically a very safe means of transportation. In 2008, 2009 and 2011, no passengers died in accidents of which SNCB Fatalities and seriously injured per billion passenger km in Belgium was at the cause. In 2010, 19 people lost their (Source: FPS Economy, 2009) lives in a tragic train accident near Buizingen. The worst accident prior to Buizingen was the one in Pécrot in 2001, where regrettably 8 50.56 people died. 50 These figures do not take into account collisions at level crossings, suicides or accidents to be blamed on one’s own carelessness. Suicides, for instance, take a great toll: an average of 90 people every year take their own lives by committing suicide on the tracks. The train’s high level of safety is even more 25 apparent from a comparison with road traffic. In 2009 (the most recent year for which figures are available), there were 7.17 deaths per bil113 Train lion passenger kilometres, while the number Road of seriously injured rose to 50.56 (source: FPS 7.17 Economy).

Road transport accounted for 71% of all CO2 emissions from European transport, railways for only 1.8%. Between 1990 and 2009, CO2 emissions from European transport grew by nearly 28%: all transport modes – except railways – have increased their total emissions. (Source: International Energy Agency – International Union of Railways, 2012) EU27 CO2 emissions from fuel combustion by sector (Source: IEA – UIC, 2012) Transport Transport 31.2% Road 71.0% Electricity and Heat 37.8% Rail 1.8% Agriculture, forestery and fishing 1.5% Navigation 14.3% Manufacturing 13.2% Aviation 12.3% Residential 11.3% Other Transport 0.5% Other 4.9% 63 I Chapter 6: Responsibility towards the community Change in CO2 emission from fuel combustion per mode between 1990 and 2009 (Source: IEA – UIC, 2012) In Belgium, passenger rail has a market share of 80% 7% but accounts for only 1% of all CO2 emissions of road transport. But it is not because the train is today a very CO2-friendly means of transport that we can rest on our laurels tomorrow. The European 40% Commission wants to have a sustainable system of transport in Europe by 2050 and with this is aiming at a massive reduction of emissions of greenhouse gasses. The train can play a major role in this. That is why the railway Rail sector has set ambitious long-term targets for 0% CO2 reduction: Road Aviation Navigation • target 2020: European railways have committed to the reduction of specific CO2 emissions from train operations by 30% compared to 1990; -40% • target 2030: European railways have committed to the reduction of specific CO2 emissions from train operations by 50% compared to 1990; Target • vision 2050: European railways will strive -50% CO2 emissions per passenger-km from train operations compared to 1990 towards carbon-free train operation by 2050. Schedule SNCB actively contributes to help realize 2030 these objectives. Between 1990 and 2011, specific CO2 emissions in passenger transport Situation 2011 decreased by no less than 56%. The decline -56% is even so strong that the European target of -30% was already reached in 2005 and the Status target of -50% in 2008. 64 I Chapter 6: Responsibility towards the community Reducing noise impact Noise disturbances as well as vibrations are Directive 2002/49/EC relating to the manageimportant issues when it comes to sustainment of environmental noise, the theme of Target able transport.

Without the train, the flow of traffic to and from Brussels would indeed come to a standstill. SNCB thus offers employers ready-made formulas with which they can convince their employees to opt for the train, thereby avoiding daily traffic jams on the roads. 66 I Chapter 6: Responsibility towards the community Third-party payer agreement If companies agree to close a third-party payer contract with SNCB, their employees can then travel with the train at no charge. The employer commits to pay 80% of the journey railcard and the federal government contributes the remaining 20%. This formula has existed since 2005 and is a great success. The number of third-party payer agreements almost doubled between 2008 and 2011! Contractual ticket on line Thanks to this formula, companies can purchase and print their own tickets for their employees. It is an easy way to have tickets available quickly. And it is the ideal formula for occasional train trips by employees or clients. At the end of the month, the employer receives a detailed invoice of all tickets ordered. The growth figure of this formula is impressive: in 2011, about 34% more tickets were sold than the year before. 67 I Chapter 6: Responsibility towards the community Providing value for money In 2011, SNCB invested 686.7 million euros, 40.7% more than in 2010. That money went primarily for new trains. The last 19 M6 double-deck carriages were delivered in 2011. The influx of Type 18 locomotives started in 2011 after homologation of the machines in June. Furthermore, in the area of passenger equipment, modernization (M5, Break-power cars) and installation of TBL1+ are important investment items. For future equipment purchases, SNCB is currently developing a project in which the entire life cycle cost is taken into consideration as an award criterion. The life cycle cost of the rolling stock will hereby be divided into different cost categories in which energy consumption and environmental cost (e.g. noise) are given a place. SNCB continues to work on a thorough renewal of its management tools with the introduction of ERP-related applications. These include information management, customer relations management (CRM) as well as personnel applications, such as more optimal registration of activities in the workshops. The workshops also receive more resources, on the one hand for renovation works, on the other hand for investments in new workshops. The Charleroi workshop, for instance, is being expanded with a new maintenance hall.

In 2011, a total of 908 new employees were recruited. About 98% of all SNCB employees work on a permanent basis (statutory basis). An employee that is recruited on a statutory basis does not sign an employment contract but falls under the remit of the personnel statute that sets out the legal terms and conditions of the statutory employee. The personnel statute encompasses definitions which relate to recruitment, remuneration, holidays, various rights and obligations, social advantages and pensions etc. 69 I Chapter 6: Responsibility towards the community Progress indicators Climate friendly mobility 2008 2009 2010 2011 Specific CO2 emissions from passenger trains 27.5 26.5 26.8 22.8 (g/passenger-km) CO2 emissions from electric 246,900 238,244 248,613 205,188 passenger trains (tons) CO2 emissions from diesel passenger trains (tons) 38,951 37,661 35,263 41,695 Total CO2 emissions from passenger trains (tons) 285,851 275,905 283,876 246,883 Safe mobility 2008 2009 2010 2011 Fatalities per 100 million passengers 0 0 8.1 0 Noise 2008 2009 2010 2011 % of rolling stock in compliance with TSI noise 14% 17% 18% 21% Congestion 2008 2009 2010 2011 Numbers of Railease users 46.332(*) 108.084 61.238 93.691 (*) product launched mid 2008 Number of third-party payer agreements 3.091 3.954 5.391 5.907 Number of contractual tickets online 126.678 151.133 172.263 230.317 Investments 2008 2009 2010 2011 Amount invested (Mil. €) 357 432 407 687 70 I Chapter 6: Responsibility towards the community Workforce (situation end of year) 2008 2009 2010 2011 Total number of employees (FTE) 20,216 20,118 19,542 18,896 Permanent employees (FTE) 19,880 19,701 19,116 18,493 Temporary employees (FTE) 336 417 426 403 Breakdown by job category (FTE) Train guards 2,596 2,618 2,552 2,480 General services 3,032 2,956 2,955 2,863 Station staff 4,512 4,195 4,008 3,670 Train drivers 4,094 4,414 4,170 4,063 Workshops 5,982 5,935 5,857 5,820 Total number of recruited employees 1,058 948 659 908 71 I Chapter 6: Responsibility towards the community CHAPTER 7 Electric locomotives T11 Construction year: 1985-1986 Max. speed: 140 km/h T13 Construction year: 1997-2001 Max. speed: 200 km/h T18-19 Construction year: 2011-2012 Max. speed: 200 km/h T20 Construction year: 1975-1977 Max. speed: 160 km/h T21 Construction year: 1984-1988 Max. speed: 160 km/h 73 I Chapter 7: Fleet overview T23 Construction year: 1955-1957 Max. speed: 130 km/h T26 Construction year: 1964, 1969-1971 Max. speed: 130 km/h T27 Construction year: 1981-1984 Max. speed: 160 km/h T28 Construction year: 2007-2009 Max. speed: 160 km/h Diesel Railcars AM41 Construction year: 2000-2002 Max. speed: 120 km/h Number of seats first class: 12 Number of seats second class: 138 74 I Chapter 7: Fleet overview Electric railcars Thalys “PBKA” Construction year: 1997-1999 Max. speed: 300 km/h Number of seats first class: 120 Number of seats second class: 257 AM00 Construction year: 1962-1966 Max. speed: 130 km/h Number of seats first class: 28 Number of seats second class: 152 AM05-06 Construction year: 1966-1979 (refurbished between 1999 and 2011) Max. speed: 140 km/h Number of seats first class: 28 Number of seats second class: 150 AM “Quadruple” Construction year: 1975-1979 (refurbishment starts in 2012) Max. speed: 140 km/h Number of seats first class: 56 Number of seats second class: 302 AM03 “Break” Construction year: 1980-1985 (being refurbished since 2009) Max. speed: 160 km/h Number of seats first class: 32 Number of seats second class: 221 75 I Chapter 7: Fleet overview AM09 “Sprinter” Construction year: 1986-1989 Max. speed: 120 km/h Number of seats first class: 40 Number of seats second class: 137 AM96 Construction year: 1996-2000 Max. speed: 160 km/h Number of seats first class: 45 Number of seats second class: 167 Carriages I6 Construction year: 1977-1978 Max. speed: 160 km/h Number of seats first class: 54 Number of seats second class: 66 I10 Construction year: 1987-1988 Max. speed: 160 km/h Number of seats first class: 66 Number of seats second class: 86 I11 Construction year: 1996-1997 Max. speed: 200 km/h Number of seats first class: 60 Number of seats second class: 80 76 I Chapter 7: Fleet overview M4 Construction year: 1979-1984 (refurbished between 1996 and 2009) Max. speed: 160 km/h Number of seats first class: 72 Number of seats second class: 104 M5 Construction year: 1986 (being refurbished since 2009) Max. speed: 140 km/h Number of seats first class: 142 Number of seats second class: 146 M6 Construction year: 2001-2011 Max. speed: 150 km/h Number of seats first class: 124 Number of seats second class: 140 77 I Chapter 7: Fleet overview CHAPTER 8 SNCB established a Corporate Social Responsibility report in line with the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact.
