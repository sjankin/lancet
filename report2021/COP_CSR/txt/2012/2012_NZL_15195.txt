All incidents, regardless of their impact, are included in the calculations. The most frequent injuries are those caused by cuts. In the long term, the Zumtobel Group is aiming to reduce the TRI rate to 10. Currently, targeted TRI rate is 13. The LTI rate (Lost Time Injuries or number of working days missed due to injuries per million hours worked) is measured in order to differentiate between industrial accidents having various degrees of seriousness. Industrial accidents are taken into account if they involve more than eight hours off work. Measures such as employee training, improvements in protective clothing, upgrading of installed machinery, etc. are constantly being taken in order to improve occupational safety. The Tridonic NZ is continually making investments to improve working conditions. By preventative and corrective actions throughout the year, Tridonic NZ is targeting to reduce the number of injury rates for the upcoming year. Tridonic NZ provides a safe and healthy workplace. We are dedicated to maintaining a productive workplace by minimizing the risk of accidents, injury and exposure to health risks. In addition, Tridonic NZ arranges following to keep their safe & healthy workplace for everyone: ¾ Influenza Vaccination at the beginning of winter each year. ¾ Hearing Test for all employees from New Zealand certified organization & further hearing aids support – guidance for whom having hearing loss. ¾ Safe Material Handling Procedure training session by ACC (Accident Compensation Corporation, NZ) approved Trainer to avoid back injury at work place. ¾ Fire Extinguisher Refresher course for trained representatives. ¾ Monthly Hazards review & training. ¾ Refresher courses for Forklift Truck Operators.

Tridonic NZ is committed to working with and encouraging our sub-contractors to uphold the principles in this Policy and to adopt similar policies within their businesses. The Policy includes the following components: • Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining The Company respects our employees’ right to join, form or not to join a labour union without fear of reprisal, intimidation or harassment. Where employees are represented by a legally recognized union, we are committed to establishing a constructive dialogue with their freely chosen representatives. Tridonic NZ is committed to bargaining in good faith with such representatives. • Forced Labor Tridonic NZ prohibits the use of all forms of forced labour, including prison labour, indentured labour, bonded labour, military labour or slave labour. • Discrimination at work place Tridonic NZ values all employees and the contributions they make and has a long-standing commitment to equal opportunity and intolerance of discrimination. We are dedicated to maintaining workplaces that are free from discrimination or physical or verbal harassment on the basis of race, sex, colour, national or social origin, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, political opinion or any other status protected by applicable law. The basis for recruitment, hiring, placement, training, compensation and advancement at the work place is qualifications, performance, skills and experience. • Work Hours and Wages Tridonic NZ compensates employees competitively relative to the industry and local labour market.

The Zumtobel Group will not tolerate any working conditions which contravene international legislation and regulations.The same standards are expected of the Zumtobel Group’s business partners. 6.3 MISUSE OF ALCOHOL AND DRUGS Alcohol and other drugs can severely impair employees’ ability to think clearly and carry out their tasks effectively and efficiently. They reduce productivity, and – more important still – they can endanger Zumtobel Group employees and their working environment. All Zumtobel Group employees are therefore strictly prohibited from misusing drugs, alcohol and other intoxicating substances during working hours. 22 23 Page 13 of 37 6.4 SEXUAL HARASSMENT This principle applies equally to all business relationships with external third parties, for example customers, suppliers, consultants, dealers and other business partners of the Zumtobel Group, Sexual harassment can take a wide variety of forms, including for example explicit sexual including its competitors. advances, humiliating comments, jokes, offensive language or lewd gestures.

We assume responsibility for the environment, society and, above all, our customers. Our ecolution strategy sets new sustainability standards that go far beyond just environmental protection. TRIDONIC Group helps its customers identify the ideal solution for greater sustainability and efficiency. Energy savings of up to 80 percent can be achieved with lighting management systems and digital dimmable ballasts. Control of the luminaries is demand-led, governed by presence sensors and daylight levels. As part of TRIDONIC’s “ecolution” sustainability strategy, the “ecosim” simulation toll compares different lighting technologies based on life cycle costs, energy profiles and life cycle assessments. This way, the cumulative costs of various solutions can be mapped over several years, helping to define amortization periods and environmental impacts. Product quality is the top priority for us and is constantly monitored. As part of our Lean Six Sigma philosophy, we also operate a continuous improvement process and adopt a zerodefect approach. Our processes are constantly improved and systematically monitored, and the effectiveness of implemented process and quality improvement measures are followed-up through continuous reviews. In the event of any deviation, we instigate corrective measures and monitor their effectiveness. This ensures that resources are used in a sparing, costconscious manner throughout the entire life cycle of products, environmental pollution is prevented to the greatest possible extent and risks are minimized. This allows us to guarantee customers the very highest product quality at all times. The Tridonic Group is determined to make its contribution to climate protection not only by developing innovative products – as a manufacturing company it is also constantly mindful of the need to achieve the biggest possible reductions in emissions. The Tridonic Group’s environmentally relevant emissions include carbon dioxide (CO2), dust and noise. Measures in the Tridonic Group to cut CO2 emissions are based primarily on optimising material and energy requirements in the manufacturing process and optimising transport logistics.

Our businesses are against all forms of Corruption: New Zealand does not have any one single agency tasked with fighting corruption. Unlike many other countries it has not seen the need to create an Independent Commission against Corruption. Rather it has a number of agencies that focus on the different elements in the fight against corruption. Some of these agencies have their focus on the more positive task of reinforcing values to ensure that New Zealand maintains a corruption free environment; others focus on the enforcement of the laws and the rules. Transparency International (www.transparency.org) is the global civil society organisation, leading the fight against corruption. Transparency International’s mission is to create change towards a world free of corruption. Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) was first launched in 1995; it has been widely credited with putting the issue of corruption on the international policy agenda. The CPI ranks almost 200 countries by their perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys. New Zealand is keeping its No.1 position with least corruption nation and very clean image in public sector for consecutive 6th years in row. (Year 2006 to 2011) (http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi) Background: Tridonic NZ defines corruption as ‘the abuse of a position of trust in order to achieve improper financial or other advantage’. We are aware that corporate corruption can take many forms such as: x bribery, price-fixing agreements, facilitation payments x money laundering x inappropriate favours, hospitality or gifts The Zumtobel Group’s Corporate Values, Code of Conduct and Corporate Policies are binding for all the Group’s employees. These lay the foundation for taking the right decisions and acting in a fair, trustworthy and unprejudiced fashion towards both colleagues and business partners. Tridonic NZ is part of a the Zumtobel Group’s Code of Conduct which contains detailed regulations on corruption (refer to Attachment D) which all employees must observe as well as other sensitive issues such as: x Sponsorship x political and charitable donations Page 29 of 37 14th February 2012 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY     x and relations with the authorities Objective: We believe that “Corruption is the abuse of entrusted power for private gain”. It hurts everyone whose life, livelihood or happiness depends on the integrity of people in a position of authority. Tridonic NZ will not condone any form of corruption. Briefly, the giving or accepting of undue advantage and other forms of corruption, along with the damage caused by such misconduct worldwide, are a serious issue in today’s legal, economic and political environment. For this reason, in September 2004 the Zumtobel Group of which Tridonic NZ is a member, made a clear commitment to introducing anti-corruption regulations for all business dealings, transactions and processes in all Zumtobel Group companies worldwide of which Tridonic NZ is a member. As an active participant in the World Economic Forum’s “Partnering against Corruption Initiative” (PACI) the goal of the Zumtobel Group of which Tridonic NZ is a member, is to actively combat the various forms of corruption in international and national business dealings. Target: Do note, as an international company, we currently have an independent 3rd party audit carried out on a yearly basis. Fraud and corruption is an important component of this audit. Nevertheless, we will try and further improve by identifying key areas which might be susceptible to fraud and corruption in our business and rectify it. In the Zumtobel Group we will not tolerate any form of corruption; regardless of the value or nature of the advantage this involves (cash, benefits in kind, etc.).

Page 34 of 37 4 CORRUPTION 4.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES Bribery, the giving or accepting of undue advantage, and other forms of corruption, along with the damage caused by such misconduct worldwide, are a serious issue in today’s legal, economic and political environment. For this reason, in September 2004 the Zumtobel Group made a clear commitment to introducing anti-corruption regulations for all business dealings, transactions and processes in all Zumtobel Group companies worldwide. As an active participant in the World Economic Forum’s Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) the Zumtobel Group’s goal and duty is to actively combat the various forms of corruption in international and national business dealings. The following provisions govern transactions or situations involving Zumtobel Group employees or external third parties acting on behalf of the Zumtobel Group. The Zumtobel Group cannot, however, accept any responsibility or liability whatsoever for corrupt conduct on the part of external third parties (e.g. suppliers, customers, etc.). 4.2 BRIBERY For the purposes of this Code of Conduct, the Zumtobel Group understands as bribery the • offering • promising • giving • demanding, or • accepting of financial or other advantage to or from • public officials • politicians, political parties and/or their representatives, or • other external third parties in order to obtain or retain business or to secure any other improper advantage in the conduct of business. The Zumtobel Group expressly prohibits its employees from engaging any form of bribery, regardless of the value or type of benefit involved (cash, benefits in kind, etc.). Employees who fail to observe this prohibition will face strict disciplinary measures and/or civil/criminal proceedings. If Zumtobel Group employees are subjected to attempted bribery or suspect an attempt at securing inappropriate influence by an external third party, they should contact their supervisor or the Ethics Officer immediately. 12 13 Page 35 of 37 4.3 FACILITATION PAYMENTS 4.5 CHARITY DONATIONS In contrast to bribery, “facilitation payments” are made in order to expedite the performance Donations to charitable institutions must be approved by the Zumtobel Group Executive Board of legal and routine activities by public officials (e.g. customs procedures, the routine issuing of entry if any of the following apply: documents at airports, etc.).The sums involved are generally very small (a few Euro). • the sum donated is greater than EUR 5,000 • the donation is made to globally active organisations, e.g. UNICEF, Amnesty International, In some countries such facilitation payments to officials are standard practice. Nonetheless they Médecins Sans Frontières, etc. are generally illegal – and in any case they contravene the ethical principles by which the Zumtobel • the donation relates to major (global) disasters (e.g. earthquakes, floods or similar) or other Group’s activities are governed. For this reason, in the Zumtobel Group no facilitation payments events which may be of relevance to the Zumtobel Group as a whole. are made. All other charitable donations should be handled within the framework of the relevant budIf Zumtobel Group employees are requested to make facilitation payments, they should in all get and the relevant policies and regulations. cases inform their supervisor or the Ethics Officer – after the fact, if no other option is available.The aim in this case is to make such practices transparent and verifiable. 4.6 SPONSORSHIP 4.4 GIFTS, HOSPITALITY, The Zumtobel Group pursues a very active policy of arts sponsorship which is to be impleESTABLISHING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS mented within the framework of Group strategy, the relevant policies and regulations, and approved marketing and communications budgets.The following points should always be observed: The Zumtobel Group prohibits the offering or receipt of gifts, hospitality or other benefits, if • the sponsorship contribution should not exercise any influence over future decisions taken by the the aim of these offerings is to influence business transactions in an improper and unethical way, or recipient (e.g. the awarding of contracts) even if they could merely create an impression of such improper influence. • all sponsorship contributions should be verifiable and fully documented. As part of the Zumtobel Group’s commitment to maintaining good relationships with its busiIn addition to arts sponsorship, the Zumtobel Group also provides special support for the creaness partners, employees may accept or present occasional modest gifts or hospitality (e.g. invitation tion of training and employment opportunities for people with disabilities.

The principles outlined in this paragraph also apply when establishing new business relationships. 14 15 Page 36 of 37 4.7 POLITICAL DONATIONS 4.9 RELATIONS WITH THE AUTHORITIES Donations or other payments to political parties, whether they are made directly or indirectIn most countries around the world there is strict legislation governing the acceptance of gifts ly, are prohibited. or bribes by the authorities. Employees are free to engage in private political activities provided: Employees of the Zumtobel Group may not promise, offer or give to public officials any cash • these private political activities are legal payments or similar with the intention of securing preferential treatment or exercising improper influ• all private political activities take place outside working hours ence on official decisions. • no resources belonging to the Zumtobel Group are used for these private political activities • the private political activities have no negative impact of any kind on the Zumtobel Group. 4.8 MONEY LAUNDERING People and organisations involved in criminal activities (such as drug dealing, bribery, fraud, extortion, etc.) often attempt to “launder” the proceeds of these activities in order to conceal them from the authorities or disguise them as legitimate income. In most countries of the world money laundering is prohibited by law. The Zumtobel Group is committed to full compliance with all applicable legislation against money laundering. For this reason, the Zumtobel Group only enters into business relationships with reputable customers or other business partners who are exclusively engaged in legitimate businesses and whose funds derive from legal sources. Consequently, all Zumtobel Group Divisions must ensure that they do not accept any revenues which have any connection with money laundering activities. In cases of doubt, a careful investigation must be conducted (in accordance with the principles of due diligence – see Glossary) in order to gather as much information as possible about the relevant business partner. If there is any suspicion or indication that a business partner is engaged in money laundering or other illegal activities, the Ethics Officer must be contacted immediately. 16 17 Page 37 of 37
