The payment profile for insurance liabilities is based on non-discounted values and applies to life insurance and non-life insurance. The note shows the effect on income on the change in market interest rate of 1 per cent, for fair value risk and variable interest rate risk. Fair value Insurance liabilities related to the life insurance businesses are discounted in the financial statements and show the present value at the end of the reporting period. The claim reserves are not discounted in the non-life insurance financial statements. risk is calculated on the change in fair value of interest-bearing instruments if the interest rate had been 1 per cent higher at the end of the period. Variable interest rate risk indicates the change in cash flows if the interest rate had been one per cent higher over the year being reported on. The total of these reflects the total impact on profits that the scenario of one per cent higher interest rate would have had on the Group. Seen overall, the interest rate risk is limited for the Group since a high proportion is invested in long-term bonds and lending with fixed interest rate at amortised cost, which does not have an impact on income when there is change in the market interest rate. In addition the fixed interest rate exposure on lending and borrowing in the banking operation is hedged through derivatives that swap fixed interest over to variable interest. The hedging is reflected in the financial statements through the rules on fair value hedging. 78 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 1 note S t O T H E A C C O U N T S g R O U P 79 Note 12 Currency risk Note 12 Currency risk, contd. 31.12.2010 Statem. of fin. pos. items excl.

The Group has a high-quality lending portfolio with limited credit risk and all-time low losses. The Group mainly provides housing morgate loans for less than 80 per cent of the value of the object to be bought, loans to local government and loans with guarantees from the authorities. Housig mortgages make up about NOK 8.7 billion. There is very little lending diversified by sector since a very large proportion of the lending is aimed at the public sector. The risk of concentration that this suggests is nevertheless not much of a real risk to consider in as much as the loans are backed by government/local government guarantees that carry a particularly low risk in relation to the opposite party. 86 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 1 note S t O T H E A C C O U N T S g R O U P 87 Note 17 Subordinated loan capital and hybrid Tier 1 securities Note 18 Hedge accounting 31.12.2011 Changed value in 31.12.2011 Loan amount Book value NOK million Nominal value hedged risk Book value NOK million Currency NOK 31.12.2011 Due date Hedged object Borrowings 1 Hybrid Tier 1 securities -984 -161 -1 145 October 1997 JPY 9 500 554 742 Perpetual April 2006 EUR 300 2 372 2 401 Perpetual Hedging instrument Total subordinated loan 2 926 3 143 Combined interest and currency swap 984 161 161 April 2004 JPY 15 000 984 1 145 Perpetual Total hybrid Tier 1 984 1 145 Hedging effectiveness as at 31.12.2011 100 % Hedging effectiveness through the year 100 % Total subordinated loan capital and hybrid Tier 1 securities 3 911 4 288 Hedged object 31.12.2010 Loan amount Book value Hedged object 1: Lending fixed interest in NOK 5 008 156 5 165 NOK million Currency NOK 31.12.2011 Due date Hedging object 2: Covered bonds in NOK 2 750 -64 2 686 Borrowings1 Hedging instrument October 1997 JPY 9 500 554 685 Perpetual Hedging instrument 1: Interest rate swap lending fixed April 2006 EUR 300 2 372 2 415 Perpetual interest in NOK 4 994 -168 4 825 Total subordinated loan 2 926 3 100 Hedging instruments 2: Interest rate swap borrowing in NOK 2 750 70 2 820 April 2004 JPY 15 000 984 973 Perpetual Hedging 1: Total hybrid Tier 1 984 973 Hedging effectiveness as at 31.12.2011 -93 % Hedging effectiveness through the year -93 % Total subordinated loan capital and hybrid Tier 1 securities 3 911 4 074 Hedging 2: JPY 9 500: The interest on the loan is fixed at 4.0 per cent p.a.

The risk that KLP would not have adequate liquidity to cover current liabilities and current operations is very small since a major part of the Company’s assets is liquid. KLP has significant funds invested in the money market, bonds and shares that can be sold in the event of a liquidity requirement. KLP’s liquidity strategy involves the Company always having adequate liquid assets to meet KLP’s liabilities as they fall due without accruing significant costs associated with freeing up assets. Asset composition in KLP’s portfolios should be adequately liquid to be able to cover other liquidity needs that may arise. KLP Kapitalforvaltning has the routine responsibility and reports on the Company’s liquidity. Internal parameters have been established for the size of the liquidity holding. KLP’s risk management unit monitors and reports developments in the liquidity holding continuously. The Board determines an asset management and liquidity strategy for KLP annually. The liquidity strategy includes parameters, responsibilities, risk measurement and an emergency plan for liquidity management.

The note shows the effect on income on the change in market interest rate of 1 per cent, for fair value risk and variable interest rate risk. Fair value risk is calculated on the change in fair value of related instruments if the interest rate had been 1 per cent higher at the end of the period. Variable interest rate risk indicates the change in cash flows if the interest rate had been one per cent higher over the year being reported on. The total of these reflects the total impact on profits that the scenario of one per cent higher interest rate would mean. Seen overall, the interest rate risk is limited for KLP since a high proportion is invested in long-term bonds (hold-to-maturity bonds) and lending with fixed interest rate at amortized cost, which do not have an impact on income when there is change in the market interest rate. 138 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 1 noteS t O T H E A CCC O U N T S 139 Note 10 Currency risk, contd.

Write-downs of premium receivables -2 -1 Total 602 272 ¹ This category comprises municipal business management in addition to state and local government owned enterrises. ² This category mainly comprises private enterprises with limited liability and non-profit organisations. The Group’s premium receivables are primarily in regard to the public sector and the credit risk is considered low. In addition the main group pension/public sector industry is linked to the “Transfer agreement for the public sector”. This transfer agreement has a security scheme intended to help to secure pension KLP has a high quality lending portfolio with limited credit risk and historically low losses. KLP mainly provides housing mortgages covering less than rights accrued with employers who cease to exist or do not pay premiums when due in accordance with detailed rules. The Group may thus apply for cover 80 per cent of the value, loans to municipalities and loans with public sector guarantees. Loans secured b y housing mortgages make up NOK 6.4 billion (including accrued interest). There is very little sector diversification on loans granted by KLP since a very high proportion of the loans are aimed at the for unpaid demands in this industry from the security arrangement if the demand falls within the security arrangement’s regulations. public sector. The concentration risk this indicates is nevetheless not very realistic since the loans are covered by public sector guarantee, which implies a particularly low counterparty risk. 144 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 1 noteS t O T H E A CCC O U N T S 145 Note 14 Shares and equity fund units 31.12.2011 NOK million Number Market value NOK million Number Market value Note 13 Shares and holdings in enterprises in the same group and associated companies NORWAY ATEA ASA 254 279 15 OE on Book value Profit/ Equity Book value BOUVET ASA 380 400 26 Office and business Holding first Acquisition 31.12.

The estimated recoverable sum is calculated by estimating future earnings with book value. This resulted in the following assessment: Hedging instrument Combined interest and currency swap 984 -11 -11 NOK million 31.12.2011 31.12.2010 Book value before write-down 89 132 Hedging effectiveness as at 31.12.2010 100 % Recoverable sum 54 72 Hedging effectiveness through the year 100 % Write-down 35 60 The hybrid Tier 1 securities loan is hedged against changes in interest rates and exchange rates through purchase of a combined interest rate and currency swap (CIRCUS). The hedging is recognised in accordance with the rules on fair value hedging, which inter alia mean that the hedging is carried out The write-down is included as part of insurance-related administration costs in the income statement. by an external party, that a formal earmarking and documentation of the hedging arrangement is entered into, and that it is expected to be very effective and that this is continuously reviewed, and that the recognition is carried out as described below. In practice the hedging involves a swap of currency terms (JPY 15 b against NOK 0.984 b) and interest terms (fixed interest at 5.07 % against NIBOR +2.6475 %) on the borrowing and the combined interest and currency swap respectively. The hedging effectiveness is measured by looking at the change in fair value of the hedged object and the hedging instrument. The hedging effectiveness equals 100 %. The hedging effect is valued retrospectively each month and is then considered effective if the change in fair value between hegded object and hedging instrument lies within the bracket 80 % to 125 %. Fair value hedging means that the hedged value development of the hedged object is taken to income. Correspondingly the value change on the hedged instrument is taken to income. The aim of the hedging arrangement above is to hedge the hedged object with a hedging instrument in which the hedging instrument's terms give negative correlation in relation to the hedged object: this significantly reduces or eliminates the effect on income. If the hedging ratio is 100 % the net effect on income of the hedged object and the hedging instrument will be 0. KLP uses hedging widely but the majority of instances are ordinary financial hedging. The above item is the only one in which hedge accounting is used. The aim of financial hedging is the same, i.e. to reduce or eliminate the effect on income the hedged part of the hedging arrangement represents Since the value change of the hedged object and the hedging instrument is approximately 100 per cent negatively correlated, the profit/loss effect on the hybrid Tier 1 securities loan will be approximately nil.
