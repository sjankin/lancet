E. Progress Report Period covered by Progress Report From: 2010 To: 2011 Declaration of constant support As already mentioned in our subscription to the Global Pact in 2008, its ten principles have become part of our strategy, culture and day-to-day business. Human rights, labour rights, the environment and the struggle against corruption are of the utmost importance to Meliá Hotels International, and that is why we have made the principles of the Global Pact one of our four public commitments. These four commitments represent a merger of the external dimensions of sustainability and corporate social responsibility with the operational and internal dimension, due to the actions plans that we have to introduce to maintain our commitments. All four focus on continuous improvement. In this, our second Progress Report, we renew our commitment to these principles. We believe we have significantly improved in several areas, but we know there is still much work to be done, and we are confident that, with time and perseverance, we will become much more than just a leader in our industry. We will become an example of a sustainable and profitable business.

Measurement of results Included within the SAVE project is a series of water-saving measures which not only lower consumption but also mean energy savings due to the lower volume of hot water circulating. Total water consumption in 2011 in the 166 hotels participating in the SAVE project was 7,763,447 m3, compared to 3,503,699 m3 in 2010 in the 130 hotels in Spain. The volume of water saved in 2011 was 274,188 m3, compared to the 266,797 m3 in 2010.
