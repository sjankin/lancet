ENIGMA UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2012 STATEMENT OF CONTINUING SUPPORT ENIGMA SECURITY SOLUTIONS LTD CONTINUES TO SUPPORT AND PROMOTE IMPORTANT RESPONSIBLE INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT GROUP OF COMPANIES Enigma UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2012 Statement of Continuing Support Enigma Security Solutions Ltd continues to support and promote important responsible initiatives such as the UN Global Compact Glen Webley Chief Executive Officer THE UN GLOBAL IMPACT and SUSTAINABILITY Issued July 2012 Chief Executive’s statement “For Enigma, becoming a more sustainable business goes hand in hand with the ten principles of the United Nation’s Global Compact”. Our past performances2010 and 2011 Through the enthusiasm of our people and the strength of our leadership teams Enigma was able to establish itself as a force in the drive for sustainability and compliance with the UN Global Compact principles. In respect to Enigma’s sustainability programme we continued to progress and integrate with ISO 9001:2008, OHSAS 18001:2007 ISO 14001:2004 and Achilles; all of which enhanced our reputation and significantly contributed to our business success. As part of our community engagement, we made arrangements with a Registered Social Landlord and Regenerations Charity which enabled many disadvantaged people to gain valuable employment training and certification via our training partner. In both 2010 and 2011 we sustained our excellent record in the area of Health and Safety for staff, clients and others affected by our operations Moving into 2011 we focused our attention on carbon reduction strategy which resulted in two particular outcomes: the introduction of teleconferencing for our inter-branch meetings; and the fleet purchase of green award vehicles for our management and supervisory staff. Both of these measures secured significant reductions in fuel costs and in our overall carbon footprint. Our other environmental programmes such as recycling/transport and waste along with service efficiency were refined and improved. Enigma also established a long-term sustainability strategy with positive outcomes to be achieved by 2020. In 2012 Enigma will continue to engage our employees, clients and our business associates in our strategic aim to include all in the responsibility and satisfaction of creating sustainable social and environmental improvements through the development of more principled and successful businesses. With this aim in mind Enigma issued a new Sustainable Supplier Chart for 2012 and now, in July 2012, Enigma are engaged in the development of a more comprehensive carbon footprint measurement system; and we are also piloting a new Achievement Monitoring System to help gauge the relevant target results set for senior management. Glen Webley Chief Executive Officer OUR MISSION Is to achieve profitable growth while making the world a better place. To succeed in our mission Enigma believe that we must plan our business growth based on a comprehensive sustainability strategy which integrates the United Nation’s ten principles relating to human rights, labour governance, the environment and anti-corruption. On Human Rights Principle 1 Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. Principle 2 Business must ensure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. The aim of Enigma Security Solutions is to communicate to all our employees, business connections and communities in which we operate, our commitment to respect and uphold human rights. We endeavour to observe and promote the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all people and all nations. The guidelines and conventions of the United Nations and International Labour Organisation on the Rights of the Child are also fundamental to instructing our policy provisions. Commitment  Enigma human rights policy  Enigma Group ethical code for all our suppliers Implementation  Enigma employs a widely diverse workforce who are guaranteed an “equality for all” policy to prevent discrimination in hiring, promotion and work conditions based on race, caste, colour, national origin, sex, age, religion, disability, marital status, actual or perceived sexual orientation, employment status or political affiliation. We endeavour to ensure that employees of sub-contractors and our suppliers have similar guarantees against discrimination. Enigma also expects that all of our employees and those of associated companies are able to work in an environment free of physical, psychological and verbal abuse and harassment, and in an environment free of the threats of such abuse and harassment.  Enigma has a published statement on human rights which is implemented through internal management systems and staff training, both introductory and ongoing. In March 2011 Enigma introduced a formal, periodic revision course for employees with more than 12 months company service. This course is now given to each employee at 12 monthly intervals and covers policy statements and job-specific information. It is to now continuously, along with other training and updates, as required. The course aims to ensure awareness of content and of changes to the initial induction training that all employees are traditionally given at the beginning of their employment.  Enigma’s employment handbook and site instruction booklets include all Policy Statements including those based on ethical commitments and legislative requirements. Appropriate procedures for implementation of policy are also comprehensively described. The Policy Statements and procedures are checked and reviewed on an annual basis at a minimum and are upgraded if and when necessary.  Whereas Enigma has long had a broad mix of employees from varying national and ethnic backgrounds, our gender mix was poor due to the traditional male dominance of our core business. In January 2011 we introduced new recruitment procedures which helped to almost double the number of female employees from 7% to 13% of the total workforce by mid 2011, and to 16% by July 2012.  Enigma endeavours to provide enhanced working conditionsregarding safety, comfort, and the ability to profitfor its employees. This is a prime consideration when applying for contracts and increasingly this is a strict requirement from clients seeking to contract products and services from providers. It is Enigma’s policy to only seek work contracts from clients adhering to UN principles in their own Corporate Social Responsibility/Sustainability Policy.  Enigma has implemented a proactive information, advice and complaints structure for employees through the provision of: a) 24 hour local management contactphone and internet b) 24 hour national management contact (through our ARC centre)  To ensure Global Impact principles are incorporated in Enigma’s sustainability strategy and operations, a management committee has been established. This is chaired by our CEO and includes two directors and Enigma’s Compliance Manager. This committee is linked to all operational issues regarding aims of improving work and living conditions under the umbrella of sustainability. The development of sustainable communities and workforce, best practice health and safety procedures, natural resource protection and environmental enhancement, are the essential priorities. All key business areas are represented at the committee which is given external specialist advice from SSAIB and Achilles. The committee in turn reports to Enigma directors who set sustainable practices throughout Enigma.  Enigma’s ethical code for suppliers highlights all ten principles of the UN Global Compact to which our suppliers are expected to adhere to throughout their operations. Enigma has linked this to the ISO. 9001.2008 quality assurance manual, and is documented, audited and reviewed. See Enigma’s Sustainable Suppliers Charter (below). On Labour Principle 3 Business should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. Principle 4 Business should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. Principle 5 Business should uphold the effective abolition of child labour. Principle 6 Business should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Commitment  Managing equality and diversity policy  Enigma code of conduct  Enigma ethical code of conduct Implementation  Enigma’s written Code of Conduct and Policy Statements provide a clear outline to all employees, of policies, procedures, and boundaries of various aspects of employment relating to terms, conditions and conduct that must be adhered to. Together they inform that Enigma supports all legislative and applicable common law and regulations concerning an individual’s right to freedom of association and right to Collective Bargaining. They also inform that no employee should be expected to work below national wage and benefit standards, or under forced, unsafe, or unsatisfactory conditions; or that any employee, at any level, should allow anything to compromise their own commitment to Enigma’s health & safety, environment, and social policies.  All employees can access our national ARC centre on a 24 hr basis either to request information and advice, or otherwise to report or raise concerns over possible breaches in policy, conduct and other standards.  Enigma provides all staff with a risk assessment (including hazard identification) and an environmental impact assessment for their particular place of employment. These assessments are reviewed at regular intervals with a compulsory minimum 12 month re-assessment period and comply with British Standards OHSAS 18001:2007 and ISO 14001:2004.  In March 2011 a trial introduction of quantitative testing for job candidates began. Two tests were given: one for literacy, and the other for industry-specific knowledge. They were introduced in order to increase objectivity and to help eliminate undesired discrimination in the recruitment process. Within a short period the testing partly contributed to a small but significant improvement in our female to male staff ratio. Enigma aims to continue this development of greater gender equality in the company.  Enigma through their ISO 9001: 2008 accreditation has asserted minimum expected ethical standards for suppliers through 2010 to July 2012 (See Enigma’s Ethical Code and Sustainable Suppliers Charter). This is documented, audited and reviewed based on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact covering the area of human rights, labour rights, environmental protection, bribery and corruption, and sets out the standards that are expected from all suppliers engaged by Enigma.  A.

Note that almost all enquiries regarding “Unsuitable Workplace Behaviour” and Theft/ Fraud involved either client staff or the public. The increase in “Personal Issues” enquiries may be part explained by the introduction of a computerised employee information and roster management system into the Control Room in January 2012. A dual increase seems to have developed in the overall frequency of calls from employees due to the increased role of Control Room staff in altering rosters and reporting personal issues raised by employees to HR and relevant managers – which was all part of Enigma’s aim to improve access for employees seeking advice and to enable a more comprehensive and rapid response of staff deployment in Contingency/ Continuity and Sustainability Planning B.

On the Environment Principle 7 Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Principle 8 Business should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibilities. Principle 9 Business should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Commitment  Enigma Environmental Policy: The environmental objective of Enigma is to provide effective environmental awareness and control, seeking to continually improve all aspects of its environmental performance within its sphere of operation as far as is economically viable. Implementation  Enigma will endeavour to care for the environment through continual review and improvement to working practices relating to environmental impacts.  Enigma will comply with the requirements of relevant legislation and regulations.  Enigma will encourage the efficient use of energy, materials, products and services together with minimising and eliminating pollution and waste wherever possible.  Enigma will apply health and safety considerations throughout all activities.  Enigma will provide employee awareness training in its environmental policy and procedures.  Enigma has established shared environmental objectives with clients and suppliers.  Enigma employees, directors and consultants are required to carefully consider environmental issues when making decisions in the planning, controlling and execution of work for the company.  In July 2011 Enigma approved the purchase of a fleet of new “green award” cars for managers, supervisors, and mobile response drivers. These cars which included electronic/fuel hybrids have significantly reduced fuel costs and Enigma’s carbon footprint. This reduction is expected to continue over the next few years as new improved additions to the fleet are made in late 2012 and early 2013.  Enigma has operated an intensive office recycling programme for several years. This has led to a now very refined division of all office waste (for example: high grade white paper; mixed white paper; newspaper; coloured paper) and a methodical procedure ensuring an almost 100% recycling score for all recyclable waste materials.  Through a policy change first initiated in 2010, approximately 95% of Enigma employees were receiving information and rota bulletins by email as opposed to post by July 2011. By June 30, 2012 this figure had crept up to 98% which also includes Employee Pay Slips and Monthly Newsletters.  As part of its carbon reduction initiatives, Enigma has established teleconferencing as the default format for management meetings and in July 2012 had achieved the 75% target for inter-branch meets.  Enigma’s environmental policy implementation will be based on BS. ISO 9001: 2008 and ISO 14001: 2004.  Enigma was first assessed 31st March 2009 for accreditation by Achilles UVDB category B2 and certificated, and has been successfully reviewed annually through to 15th February 2013. (supplier number 701717). On Anti Corruption Principle 10 Business should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Commitment  Enigma Code of Conduct. Due to its primary involvement in the security industry business Enigma, as both a company organisation and a group of people, has a duty to fulfil strict legal and social obligations relating to all forms of corruption and illegality. This duty is accepted in accordance with the underlying principles and technical requirements of both UK and internationally acclaimed law. Implementation  Enigma’s Code of Conduct addresses issues of bribery and corruption. As detailed in the Enigma Employment Handbook & the Enigma Instruction Manuals, employees are both protected and encouraged to raise concerns about possible or known acts of corruption. Legal protection is assured under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998.  As a provider of both manned and CCTV security services Enigma carries a great deal of responsibility in the management of public behaviour and Data Protection. Enigma staff are expected to act with enhanced sensibility and unquestionable integrity at all times.  Enigma is often obliged to carry out internal investigations and provide reports for incidents of suspected criminality involving the property and viability of businesses belonging to clients. These incidents generally involve theft and unlawful property damage but may also include forms of corruption including trade in illegal services and also stolen and/or counterfeit goods. See Table C for percent of incidents resolved to the satisfaction of both Enigma and Client. Table C. 2008 2009 2010 2011 Reported Incidents of 26 21 19 24 Suspected Criminality % Resolved to 86% 94% 91% 96% Enigma’s and Client’s Satisfaction Looking Ahead: Global Compact and our Sustainable Future As part of its sustainable and principled growth model, Enigma seeks to embed sustainability into all of its operations. As part of this objective Enigma has aligned its growth model with that prescribed in the UK Government’s Sustainability Development Strategy. This strategy focuses on four priority areas:  Sustainable communities and workforce  Natural resource protection and environmental enhancement  Climate change and energy  Sustainable consumption and production. It is our intention to deliver more sustainable solutions for our people, our customers and the wider community and environment in which we all work and live. This strategy reflects our commitment to ensuring sustainability is paramount in all aspects of our business. The Four Priority Areas: 1. SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES: “We will be good neighbours who engage with, work with, and support our local communities. We will create an excellent workplace where our people are respected, motivated and competent, and where excellence in Health & Safety is our goal.” 1.1 Health and Safety. Through the way we work and behave all our people and stakeholders will be protected from the risks of occupational injury and ill health. 1.2 Our People.

Our Sustainability Strategy Enigma first established a Sustainability Management Committee in 2010. It was chaired by the CEO and included the senior management team with advice given by external specialist organisations such as “Kelvin Holmes Associates” who have links to the UK government’s Sustainability Development Commission and “Achilles” who are strongly involved in the UN Global Compact. The SSAIB is also used to gain advice through their Business Leaders Forum in which key players meet regularly to share best practice information and to develop sustainability plans and objectives for Enigma. The Sustainability Management Committee refined the company’s strategic direction and targets using input from all operational groups within the company. To help clarify the company’s sustainability policy vision a long-term strategy model was developed to illustrate the links between Key Performance Indicators and Enigma’s Corporate Objectives. After several intensive discussions thirteen key performance indicators (KPI’s) were established by the committee to measure progress and an independent audit procedure was set up. This was via external auditors using our BS. 9001:2008, ISO 14001: 2004, and OHSAS 18001:2007 systems. See the Enigma Chart: Value through Sustainability & Strategic KPI’s. Our strategy will be delivered by:  Generating a culture that actively encourages and communicates best sustainable practices.  Ensuring the real involvement of all our people, our supply chain and stakeholders.  Conducting our business in accordance with our core values of openness, collaboration, mutual dependency, professional delivery, innovation, sustainable and profitable growth. Health & Safety and Sustainability As part of Enigma’s integrated approach to sustainability, a management based Health & Safety cultural assessment was incorporated in its strategy as part of a structured framework with which to assess Health and Safety across Enigma’s business. This assessment continues to form the structure for driving Health and Safety improvements, including those in Enigma’s supply chain. The assessment is based on four key elements:  Awareness. “All our people and stakeholders have an awareness and understanding of Health & Safety hazards and risks that affect our people and business”.  Competence. “All our people and stakeholders have the competence to undertake their work with minimum risks to Health and Safety”.  Compliance. “Our work activities achieve compliance with legislation, and our people are empowered to take action to minimise Health and Safety risks”.  Excellence. “Enigma is recognised for excellence in the way it manages Health and Safety”. These four elements of Awareness, Competence, Compliance and Excellence form the framework for Enigma to:  Facilitate the management of Health and Safety excellence.  Communicate the Health and Safety policy, objectives, procedures, guidance, plans and performance.  Realise and maintain continuous improvement in Health and Safety performance.  Ensure compliance with all relevant Health and safety legislation.  Fulfil the structural requirements of OHSAS 18001: Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems Specifications.

This easily leads to confusion even when people are heading in the same direction. Enigma uses the ideas and practices of sustainable development throughout the Company but increasingly the term Corporate Social Responsibility is being used in the business world. What does this actually mean for us? Corporate Social Responsibility How does CSR relate to sustainable development? (CSR) Sustainable development is… Has been defined as… “Development which meets the needs of the present “achieving commercial success in ways that honour without compromising the ability of future generations ethical values and respect people, communities and to meet their own needs”. the natural environment” The UK government addresses this definition of There are laws and regulations that set minimum sustainability with 4 key objectives: requirements for everyone. 1) Social progress which recognizes the needs of CSR encourages behaviour that goes beyond all people. basic legal obligationsbringing real business benefits 2) Effective protection of the environment. by reducing risk, enhancing brand values and 3) Prudent use of natural resources improving staff efficiency and morale. 4) Maintenance of high and stable levels of economic growth. These definitions echo the call from CSR to think about more than the economic bottom line, an issue particularly relevant to business. With CSR business can contribute to the overall goal of sustainable development… CSR ISSUES SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ENIGMA’S IMPACTS Community Social Progress which recognises Health & Safety Ethics the needs of all people Our people Human Rights Community Workforce Learning & Development Effective protection of the Land Impacts environment Biodiversity Environment Water Atmosphere Resource Use Prudent use of natural resources Supply chain Design Waste Marketplace Maintenance of high and stable Cost & Risk Vision & Values levels of economic growth Customer Shareholder Community Investment UK POWER NETWORKS (PREVIOUSLY EDF ENERGY NETWORKS) DATE RECEIVED RELEVANT COMMUNICATION DATE COMMUNICATED TO ENIGMA UNDERSTOOD TO STAFF ENGINEERING DESIGN STANDARD EDS 08-1029 UNDERGROUND SERVICES UP TO 100A 04.01.2012 NO YES N/A OPERATIONAL RESTRICTION HSS-406 ORE 25 VERSION 5 ACCESS TRESTRICTION AROUND ALSTON 05.01.2012 NO YES N/A OPERATIONAL RESTRICTION HSS-406 ORE 33 ACCESS RESTRICTION AROUND ALSTOM 05.01.2012 NO YES N/A ECP 11-0534 LUCY GEMINI 2.5 CONTROL UNIT AND RTU COMMISSIONING PROCEDURE + ECP 11.0534C 12.01.2012 NO YES N/A RE-SENDING ECP 11.0533 SCHNEIDER T200 SERIES 3 CONTROL UNIT AND RTU COMMISSIONING PROCEDURE 19.01.2012 NO YES N/A OPERATIONAL BULLETIN HSS 406 OB 85 NUMBERS OF CONTROL AND DISPLAY AT FORE HAMLET 20.01.2012 NOTE YES 20.01.2012 OPERATIONAL BULLETIN HSS 406 OB 86 NEW TELEPHONE NUMBERS FOR CONTROL AND DESPATCH AT FORE HAMLET 25.01.2012 NOTED YES 25.01.2012 REVISED ENGINEERING DOCUMENT COMMISSIONING PROCEDURE ECP 11 0515 METERING UNIT COMMISSIONING AND TEST FORM 25.01.2012 NO YES N/A ENGINEERING BULLETIN PROCEDURE EBP 03-0006 AIR METERING UNIT DESIGN MODIFICATION 25.01.2012 NO YES N/A OPERATIONAL BULLETIN HSS 406 OB 87 REPORTING AND RECORDING OF ASSET REGISTRATION INFORMATION 26.01.2012 NO YES N/A REVISED ENGINEERING DESIGN STANDARD EDS 06 0015 POLE MOUNTED EQP EARTHING DESIGN 26.01.2012 NO YES N/A HSS BULLETIN NB 128 PLANNING AND CONTROL LIFTING/ WINCHING OPERATIONS 02.02.12 NO YES N/A E0S 03-0001 GEC SF6 SWITCHGEAR TYPES FG1,GMTI1 AND GMT2 SLOW OPENING ON LOSS NITROGEN PRESSURE IS ON CDL 07.02.12 NO YES N/A A NEW ENGINEERING MAINTENANCE PROCEDURE EMP 01-0001 OVERHEAD LINE INSPECTOE AUDIT IS ON CDL 13.02.12 NO YES N/A OPERATIONAL RESTRICTION HSS 406 ORE 25 VERSION AROUND ALSTOM FMJL CT'S APPLICABLE TO ALL STAFF CONTRATORS WHO ENTER GRID AND PRIMARY SITES IN ALL NETWORKS 14.02.12 NOTED YES N/A OPERATIONAL RESTRICTION HSS 406 ORE 33 VERSION OF ABOVE 14.02.12 NOTED YES N/A OPERATIONAL ALERT HSS 406 OA-06 VERSION OF SCHNEIDER RNZc, REZc and RN6c RING MAINS UNITS CONTROL 15.02.12 NO YES N/A A REVISED ENGINEER DESIGN STANDARD EDS 08-0100 ADVISE ON RESPONSE TO REQUESTS AND CHANGING FOR DIVISION OR REMOVAL OF ELECTRICAL LINES AND OR PLANT ON PRIVATE LAND 16.02.12 NO YES N/A HSS BULLETIN NB 129 CLIMBING AND WORKING ON POLES (WOOD) 24.02.12 NO YES N/A NEW ENGINEERING BULLETIN PROCEDURE EBP 05-0024 MMLG XX TEST BLOCKS 27.02.12 NO YES N/A HSS BULLETIN NB130 TRANFORMER OIL REFILL INCIDENT LEARNING POINTS 29.02.12 NO YES N/A HSS ALERT NA 41 NEUTRAL EARTH BONDS ON TRANSFORMER MOUNTED A & B's FEEDING LV CUSTOMERS01.03.12 NO YES N/A HSS BULLETIN NB.131 ADVICE ON ENTERING PREMISES WITH LIVESTOCK AFFECTED BY THE SCHMALLENBURG VIRUS 02.03.12 NOTED YES N/A OPERATIONAL RESTRICTION: HSS 406.ORE LUCY AX AIR BREAK DISCONNECTOR (ABSD) STORES CODE 08809J 15.03.12 NO YES N/A HSS ALERT: NA42 USE OF LV HEATSINK POT ENDS AND HEATSINK TEMPORARY JOINTS ON PILC TRIPLE CONCENTRIC CABLES 22.03.12 NO YES N/A OPERATIONAL BULLETIN: HSS 406.08.89 EHV SYSTEM ALTERATION NOTICE (SAN) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQ. 22.03.12 NO YES N/A ENGINEERING BULLETIN PROCEDURE EBP01-0028 ASSESSMENT OF TREES ADJACENT TO OVERHEAD LINES 29.03.12 NO YES N/A DOCUMENT ISSUE AND REVISION REPORT MARCH 12 02.04.12 NOTED YES N/A EDS 01-0111 REVISED ENGINEERINF DESIGN.
