Community Service GREEN ENVIRONMENT – OUR COMMITMENT PLANTING TREES Indiscriminate destruction of trees and forestlands for developing agricultural lands and residential areas has become a major concern in Bangladesh. Growing population, along with increasing industrialization and urbanization is mainly responsible for this rapid deforestation, which is putting Bangladesh in one of the most vulnerable positions with respect to climate change. As part of our commitment to environmental protection, IDLC sponsored a tree plantation event in the University of Dhaka in August, 2011. The program formally inaugurated the country-wide 160 million tree plantation campaign of Mr. Musa Ibrahim, the first Bangladeshi to conquer Mount Everest.

Employee volunteering hours and fundraising activities were arranged on a number of occasions. The objective was to create long-term value in the lives of the people, instead of providing just one-time solutions. PARTNERING WITH LEADS In 2011, IDLC partnered with LEADS (Livelihood Education and Development Services), an NGO working for poverty reduction and sustainable social development by improving livelihood skills of the poor community, especially women and children. LEADS provides better educational support to underprivileged children enrolled in different government primary schools, while teaching them social and moral values and responsible practices. Currently the organization has a total of 39 children. IDLC initially arranged a session at its Corporate Head Office for its employees to interact with the children and see their development. Some of the employees even contributed financially to help these children. The children at LEADS come from very low-income families, and it often becomes very difficult for their parents to afford the basic necessities for their education. also signed agreements with the parents of each child in Again, as most of the children live in slum areas, they return of these items, requiring them to complete at least are also deprived of basic healthcare facilities, even pure primary education of their children. drinking water.

It mainly works with children coming from very poor families in slum areas, where they are often neglected and considered a liability to their families. SEID Trust aims to empower these children through special education, healthcare and vocational training, enabling them to take responsibility of their own lives. Currently SEID Trust is managing four centers in different locations of Dhaka, helping a total of 450 children. IDLC has been a regular contributor to SEID Trust. In 2011 as well, we contributed financially to help the organization carry out their activities and meet daily needs of the children. More information on SEID Trust is available at www. seidtrustbd.org SUPPORT FOR IBRAHIM The IDLC Group designed and sourced its Eid Greeting Cards in 2011 in cooperation with CRP (Centre for Rehabilitation of the Paralyzed). The theme of the card was a mouth-painting by Ibrahim, one of the patients and vocational trainees at the Savar-based CRP. 26 year old Ibrahim had both his upper limbs amputated after he suffered a spinal injury when he fell from a height while at work. CRP treated him with the required therapy and arranged special mouth-painting classes for him in cooperation with one of the faculty members of the Institute of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka. Learning such a skill is now helping Ibrahim make his own living, instead of being dependent on his family. By using Ibrahim’s mouth-painting, IDLC took his story to a broader group of people, including IDLC’s employees, clients, peers and other stakeholders, who can come forward and assist CRP in their cause. CRP was founded in 1979 by a British physiotherapist, Ms. Valerie Taylor, in response to the desperate need for healthcare and rehabilitation facilities for people with spinal injuries in Bangladesh. CRP, the only organization of its kind in Bangladesh, has a holistic approach to rehabilitation by focusing on physical, psychological and economic rehabilitation, while ensuring successful reintegration of discharged patients in the community.
