Note: Includes AirAsia Japan Annual Report 2012 21 President and Chief Executive Officer Shinichiro Ito on the ANA Group FY2012-2013 Corporate Strategy Our Renaissance as a Stronger ANA Group The ANA Group FY2012-2013 Corporate Strategy will help us achieve our corporate vision of being one of the leading airline groups in Asia. Based on changes in our operating environment, we are taking on the challenges of transforming the Group’s management structure and improving its cost structure to ensure we have the profitability and financial base to prevail in an era of all-out competition. Expect great things from our renaissance as a stronger ANA Group. Overview of the ANA Group FY2012-2013 Corporate Strategy Phase I of I would like to begin my explanation of the ANA Group FY2012-2013 Corporate Strategy Getting on Track for (years ending March 2013 and March 2014) we formulated in February 2012 by covering the Substantial Growth background and positioning of the plan. The ANA Group is now aiming to achieve its corporate vision of being one of the leading airline groups in Asia. We looked ahead to 2014 and 2015 when expansion of capacity at Tokyo-area airports will be almost complete, then formulated Phase I of the ANA Group FY2012-2013 Corporate Strategy for the initial two-year phase when departure and arrival slots will not change signiﬁcantly. As we move forward under the three themes of laying the foundation for our growth strategies, successive reinforcement of our ﬁnancial position, and Group reorganization, Phase I will be a two-year transition period. Phase II will begin the year ending March 2015, when expansion of departure and arrival slots at Tokyo-area airports will present another chance to expand capacity. In 2011, we revised the ANA Group FY2011-2012 Corporate Strategy, which we had formulated in February 2011, because of signiﬁcant changes in the preconditions of our strategy as a result of events such as the Great East Japan Earthquake and our decision to launch Narita Airport-based AirAsia Japan (AirAsia Japan Co., Ltd.). However, the previous management themes of enhancing managerial efﬁciency through maximum utilization of management ANA Group FY2012-2013 Corporate Strategy and Medium-Term Management Targets ANA Group FY2012-2013 Fiscal year ending Corporate Strategy March 2015 and beyond (Phase I) (Phase II) Themes Future Themes • Foundation for growth strategies • Business strategies supporting growth • Successive reinforcement of ﬁnancial position • Ability to deal with change in the market • Group reorganization • Final goals for ﬁnancial position 22 All Nippon Airways Co., Ltd. resources and establishing solid revenue foundations resistant to volatility remain crucial tasks. In addition, our achievements during the fiscal year ended March 2012 illuminated our corporate strategy. The impact of the decrease in demand caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake was substantial during the fiscal year, but we exceeded our forecasts with recordhigh operating income of ¥97.0 billion by thoroughly reducing costs groupwide and flexibly matching capacity with demand. Net income was ¥28.1 billion, and cash dividends per share increased ¥2.00 to ¥4.00. The ANA Group has thus strengthened its operating base, bringing the stage of further future growth into view. Three Pivot Points in I would like to explain the operating environment assumed for the ANA Group FY2012-2013 Our Renaissance as a Corporate Strategy. The global economic outlook is uncertain due to factors such as the Stronger ANA Group sovereign debt crisis in Europe, but the current outlook for global airline demand is solid to Prevail against because of growth in areas including China and elsewhere in Asia. We also see the low-cost carrier (LCC) market in Japan as an opportunity to tap into latent demand. However, we expect Competition an era of even more intense global competition because of additional capacity expansion at Tokyo-area airports and further airline industry deregulation. In this environment, the ANA Group FY2012-2013 Corporate Strategy contains three pivot points for our renaissance as a stronger ANA Group to prevail against competition. (See page 20 for an overall image of the three pivot points.) The first is a Multi-Brand Strategy. The ANA Group is operating in the LCC business through two companies, AirAsia Japan and Peach (Peach Aviation Limited) so that its LCC brands penetrate the market in conjunction with growth in the ANA brand. The second pivot point is Group Reorganization. We will transition to a holding company system and implement reforms to further strengthen Group management and raise management efficiency at operating companies. The final pivot point is Cost Restructuring so that we are resistant to revenue volatility risk and can prevail in cost competition with other airlines. We intend to reduce costs by ¥100.0 billion over the next three years in order to reduce unit cost by ¥1.0. We will increase revenues and earnings by expanding international passenger operations, domestic passenger operations, and cargo and mail operations. Expansion in international passenger operations and improved profitability will be growth drivers as we craft a strong Annual Report 2012 23 enterprise that can steadily generate operating income of ¥100.0 billion or above. We plan on substantial performance gains. For the ﬁscal year ending March 2013, we forecast a 6.3% increase in operating revenues compared with the ﬁscal year ended March 2012 to ¥1,500.0 billion and a 13.4% increase in operating income to ¥110.0 billion. For the ﬁscal year ending March 2014, we forecast a 4.0% increase in operating revenues compared with the ﬁscal year ending March 2013 to ¥1,560.0 billion and an 18.2% increase in operating income to ¥130.0 billion. We therefore aim to achieve our medium-term targets of operating income of ¥150.0 billion or above and an operating income margin of 10.0% or above by successfully completing the ANA Group FY2012-2013 Corporate Strategy. Pivot Point 1: Multi-Brand Strategy We will strategically Peach ﬂights started in March 2012, and AirAsia Japan ﬂights will begin in August 2012. The position the ANA brand ﬁscal year ending March 2013 is therefore the ANA Group’s LCC launch year. The ANA Group and our LCC brands will execute a multi-brand strategy that encompasses the ANA brand and its two LCC brands. We will clarify the customer segments each brand serves, develop networks that are well suited so that both evolve. to the features of each brand, and offer products and services with the goal of maximizing revenues for each brand and increasing the value of the ANA Group. We will leverage the low unit cost of our two LCC companies to establish a new business model. We aim to create new demand in business areas that the ANA brand cannot cover while capturing demand in the domestic market from other forms of transportation including railroads and expressway buses. The ANA brand will remain central to the ANA Group as a full-service carrier that serves passengers who require high-quality service and network convenience. We are already seeing extremely favorable short-term results from Peach, which began ﬂights in March 2012. Looking at single-month results for March 2012 on two routes that ANA also serves — Osaka (Kansai)–Sapporo (Chitose) and Osaka (Kansai)–Fukuoka — the number of ANA passengers did not decrease while Peach drew in customers. While we have just launched Peach, we believe that we are achieving our objective of two growing brands rather than the full-service carrier and the LCC cannibalizing existing demand. (See the business strategy feature, “Creating New Demand: Development of the LCC Business,” on pages 50-53 for additional details on our approach to the LCC business.)

President and Chief Executive Officer Shinichiro Ito on the ANA Group FY2012-2013 Corporate Strategy Pivot Point 2: Group Reorganization We will transition to a The ANA Group has implemented structural reforms that have reorganized seven Group holding company airline companies as of April 2010 into three companies as of April 2012. Taking full advantage system to ensure of the beneﬁts of reorganization and integration, we will transition to a holding company system from April 2013 to further strengthen the Group’s management structure and ensure ﬂexible and flexible and efficient efﬁcient management. management. Given the rapid pace of change in our operating environment, our objective in making this transition is to create an even stronger ANA Group by separating management policy decisionmaking from business execution and optimizing the allocation of management resources. Our increasingly intense competitive environment requires that we make market-oriented decisions with a sense of urgency, and that our operating companies autonomously build their businesses by looking for opportunities with companies outside the Group rather than relying exclusively on business opportunities within the Group. We also believe a ﬂat Group hierarchy will allow even more effective management of the ANA brand and the LCC brands by each company. Having Group companies autonomously manage their operations for speed and efﬁciency will enable the management structure necessitated by global competition and will build the base for our future growth strategies. In June 2012, the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders approved an absorption demerger contract proposal. We are now preparing to make the transition to a holding company with emphasis on strengthening the Group governance structure.

Successful completion of all ¥100.0 billion to lower of these cost-cutting plans has strengthened our business base. unit cost by ¥1.0 and However, while these initiatives have steadily produced results, we are only about halfway to manage revenue our targeted level of cost competitiveness. With global competition intensifying further, we volatility risk. absolutely must continuously reduce unit cost in light of unit price trends on our domestic routes Annual Report 2012 25 due to the entry of LCCs, the comparative productivity of overseas airlines, and the increasing share of highly volatile international operations in our future operations. We need further restructuring to maintain global competitiveness and build a strong earnings structure. The ANA Group will therefore focus on raising the productivity of operating units without exception and streamlining indirect personnel as we decisively reduce costs by a cumulative ¥100.0 billion through the ﬁscal year ending March 2015. This will reduce unit cost by ¥1.0. The table below outlines our cost reduction plan. Every department throughout the entire Group once again conducted a thorough review of costs under the direction of management. We then carried out a detailed study, considering the most feasible cost reductions. Our plan differs from conventional cost-reduction programs because rather than reducing costs to improve short-term proﬁtability, it features initiatives to revamp our earnings structure itself to improve competitiveness and proﬁtability. Our cumulative numerical target for the ﬁscal year ending March 2014 is to reduce costs by ¥55.0 billion to lower unit cost by ¥0.6. We therefore expect to achieve more than half of our overall plan by the ﬁnal year of our current corporate strategy.

President and Chief Executive Officer Shinichiro Ito on the ANA Group FY2012-2013 Corporate Strategy Strategy by Business: International Passenger Operations We will enhance our At this point I would like to cover the main strategies for each of our businesses. business model as a International passenger operations are our growth driver. Including the use of the increased full-service carrier to arrival and departure slots at Tokyo-area airports, we will enhance and expand our network with particular emphasis on long-haul international routes and transit passengers. We forecast increase earnings by signiﬁcant growth in the LCC business from AirAsia Japan, and therefore plan to increase substantially expanding operating revenues for the ﬁscal year ending March 2014 by 30.0%, or ¥95.9 billion, compared operating revenues. with the year ended March 2012 to ¥416.0 billion. We ﬁrst put the strategic Boeing 787 aircraft into service as a long-haul aircraft on Haneda– Frankfurt route in January 2012, and will deploy this aircraft fully during the ﬁscal year ending March 2013. The Boeing 787 is a medium-body aircraft that enables service on long-haul routes, and we will take advantage of this characteristic to further expand capacity. On European and North American routes, we will energetically leverage our trans-Paciﬁc joint venture with United Airlines and Continental Airlines and our European route joint venture with Deutsche Lufthansa AG. We will therefore build a competitive network by expanding our catchment area globally. In the ﬁscal year ended March 2012, the joint venture on North American routes steadily produced results, including approximately 300% growth in the number of reciprocal seat sales on United Airlines code share ﬂights. In the ﬁscal year ending March 2013, we plan to launch service on Narita–Seattle and Narita–San Jose routes, and will concentrate on enhancing joint marketing as we accelerate initiatives. The joint venture on European routes began setting common fares in April 2012 and is fully under way. ANA and Deutsche Lufthansa AG are currently working together to expand subject routes and plan to effectively handle vigorous passenger ﬂows between Japan and Europe.

In addition, we will successfully compete with other forms of transportation through the LCC business while creating new air travel demand. * Includes code share ﬂights with alliance partners. Annual Report 2012 27 We also intend to further increase proﬁtability. During the ﬁscal year ended March 2012, we were able to minimize the decrease in earnings resulting from depressed demand after the Great East Japan Earthquake by meticulously adjusting capacity and ﬂexibly setting fares. We will further enhance this precise approach to yield management in the future. We expect these initiatives to increase operating revenues for the ﬁscal year ending March 2014 by 8.6%, or ¥55.9 billion, compared with the ﬁscal year ended March 2012 to ¥707.5 billion. Over the medium-to-long term, we will sustain overall Group growth by leveraging the powerful ANA brand to generate stable earnings while expanding in the LCC business to rapidly create new demand.

This will enable us to steadily expand operating revenues. In the freighter business, which uses dedicated cargo aircraft, we will effectively use the Okinawa Cargo Hub & Network in deploying a ﬂeet of nine highly efﬁcient medium-body freighters while capturing strong demand in China and elsewhere in Asia to improve proﬁtability. We will also raise aircraft operating efﬁciency and reduce costs with the objective of making the freighter business proﬁtable in the ﬁscal year ending March 2014. Moreover, we will functionally integrate our expanded belly and freighter networks while aggressively promoting logistics agreements to acquire high-value-added cargo in the express and other businesses.

At this point, we plan to invest the Corporate Strategy. approximately ¥200.0 billion per ﬁscal year for the time being. Our ﬂeet strategy plan has not changed. We will aggressively introduce fuel-efﬁcient aircraft ahead of competitors while focusing on raising productivity by increasing the proportion of medium-body aircraft in our ﬂeet and integrating models. We added six Boeing 787 aircraft to our ﬂeet during the ﬁscal year ended March 2012 and will fully deploy Boeing 787s in the future. We plan to introduce a total of 21 Boeing 787 aircraft during the two ﬁscal years ending March 2014, which along with the six introduced during the ﬁscal year ended March 2012 will bring the total of our Boeing 787 aircraft to 27. That will represent about half of the 55 aircraft the ANA Group has ordered. The Boeing 787 is a truly strategic aircraft that we expect to be broadly effective in increasing operating income. We forecast potent growth from the ﬁscal year ending March 2015 onward. As I mentioned earlier, our medium-term targets are operating income of ¥150.0 billion or above and an operating margin of 10.0% or above. Our medium-term outlook is free cash ﬂow of ¥70.0 billion to ¥80.0 billion annually, and capital expenditure and investments at the ¥170.0 billion to ¥210.0 billion level.

The ANA Group has been exposed to numerous events over the past 10 years including the simultaneous terrorist attacks in the United States, the global recession, the H1N1 inﬂuenza pandemic and the Great East Japan Earthquake. In addition, issues including further airline deregulation and the rise of LCCs have made the global competitive environment increasingly intense. Even in this harsh operating environment, the ANA Group has continued to precisely match capacity with demand to maintain steady capacity. Over the past decade, the ANA Group has adjusted available seat-kilometers to match capacity with demand while the domestic and international routes of Japanese airline companies have ﬂuctuated and decreased overall. We have been able to do so by matching capacity with accurately determined demand to maximize earnings while minimizing expenses. As a result, we have been able to establish optimum capacity for our next phase of growth.

President and Chief Executive Officer Shinichiro Ito on the ANA Group FY2012-2013 Corporate Strategy We see enhanced shareholder returns as a primary management responsibility. We will balance returns with the need to enhance the internal capital resources that support stable operations, stronger ﬁnances, and investments that ensure growth and proﬁtability over the medium-to-long term. During the course of our current corporate strategy, we intend to provide shareholder returns that ensure a high and stable level of investor interest. We achieved record-high operating income during the ﬁscal year ended March 2012, and therefore increased the per-share dividend we planned at the beginning of the ﬁscal year by ¥2.00 to ¥4.00. The payout ratio was higher than it has been in the past because we want investors to recognize our strong determination to grow in the future. We plan to pay cash dividends of ¥4.00 per share in the ﬁscal year ending March 2013. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Initiatives We will actively fulfill our The ANA Group views CSR as the foundation for corporate activities that put its corporate social responsibilities philosophy into practice. Above all, we recognize that our primary mission is to provide the safest air transportation, which is the core of our business. In a very serious incident in with safety as the September 2011, the ﬂight attitude of ANA Flight 140 from Naha to Haneda temporarily became number-one priority, unstable. An incident occurred in February 2012 in which the rear section of ANA Flight 731 practicing CSR according from Osaka (Itami) to Sendai came in contact with the runway during landing. In another incident to international norms in June 2012, a hard landing resulted in deformation of a part of the fuselage of ANA Flight 956 and standards as a from Beijing to Narita. I would like to extend my deepest apologies to our customers and global corporate group. everyone concerned for the inconvenience and anxiety due to these incidents. We are implementing assiduous measures to prevent recurrence and are reafﬁrming the ANA Group Safety Principles tenet of “Safety is our promise to the public and is the foundation of our business” among all ofﬁcers and employees. We are committed to living up to our promise to provide the world’s highest safety standard. In implementing CSR, we emphasize involvement with all stakeholders. We always aim to be the airline of choice by establishing the ANA brand as number one in Asia because of its focus on high-quality service and products that take the perspective of customers. The targets we have set and energetically worked to achieve include the highest ﬁve-star rating from SKYTRAX and the world’s highest punctuality record. The efforts of each and every employee have been instrumental to achieving these goals. We will continue to take on challenges while nurturing personnel with global and diverse perspectives and strong individuality in order to generate inimitable value for the ANA brand. In addition, as a member of local communities we believe that our CSR includes contributing to solutions to social issues. We continue to provide support for the region stricken by the Great East Japan Earthquake while continuing CSR activities that are unique to ANA and contribute to society worldwide. We have also formulated ANA FLY ECO 2020 as an ecology plan for the medium-to-long term through 2020, and will further strengthen initiatives with the objective of being a world-leading airline in terms of the environment. We are determined to respond to the expectations and demands of diverse stakeholders both in Japan and overseas in order to achieve our corporate vision of being one of the leading airline groups in Asia. We will make use of international guidance including ISO26000 for CSR so that we continually test, verify and improve CSR in our business operations as we energetically put it into practice.

The two years ending March 2014 will be a time for us to innovate based on past restructuring to establish the business foundation for prevailing in the coming era of all-out competition. We will anticipate the global operating environment as we transform our Group management system and implement the dramatic cost restructuring we have already initiated, which is differentiated from past cost reduction efforts by its intensity. As the ﬁrst airline in Japan to enter the LCC business, we will take the initiative in creating new demand. The ANA Group is also a global leader in introducing the Boeing 787 and will develop an innovative network strategy through the full-scale rollout of this aircraft. In a rapidly changing environment, we will manage adroitly and ﬂexibly to further strengthen our proﬁtability and ﬁnancial position in order to achieve our renaissance as a stronger ANA Group that can achieve sustained growth and make substantial progress in the future. We are proud that we have overcome various difﬁculties and blazed a new way forward. The ANA Group will continue to take on challenges as we push forward on our track toward growth.

In addition, LCCs need airport terminal facilities that Over the long term, future population trends and other can be used at lower costs. Kansai International Airport considerations suggest that relying on the Japanese and Naha Airport will open dedicated LCC facilities from market will limit our growth potential.

We are enabling future business expansion by and other means. training and securing pilots, and are already training Peach pilots to operate other specific aircraft. In-Flight Service The last issue is cost. In the LCC business, cost competitiveness equals price competitiveness.

Safety Initiatives Aircraft Accidents and Serious Incidents in the Fiscal Year Ended March 2012: Investigation of Causes and Countermeasures In the fiscal year ended March 2012, there were seven cases of aircraft accidents and serious incidents involving the ANA Group. Although the serious incidents included two events that were not caused by the ANA Group, the number of cases exceeded the norm. In particular, the September 6, 2011 serious incident involving ANA140, the February 5, 2012 aircraft accident involving ANA731, and the June 20, 2012 aircraft accident involving ANA956* were widely reported in the media. The ANA Group deeply regrets the concern and inconveniences that resulted.

While actively cooperating with investigations by public organizations, the ANA Group also conducts internal investigations, investigates causes and gathers proposals to prevent recurrence. The Group’s efforts will not stop with thorough implementation of these countermeasures, and will extend to groupwide activities to further heighten safety standards. * Because the cause of the ANA956 air incident is currently under investigation, details will be reported as appropriate on ANA’s website. In-Flight Service Third-Party Comment While it is easy to say, “We’re working for safety,” flawlessly maintaining safety is no easy matter. During an extended period with few accidents or problems, lapsing into the self-satisfied attitude of “We’re Approach safe enough” and slacking off in safety initiatives becomes a possibility. The above accidents and major incidents can be seen as signs of organizational self-satisfaction and laxness. Companies that go beyond platitudes to actually maintain safety are characterized by each employee’s continuing stance of always asking himself or herself, “Are we really safe?” Because the self-satisfied, lax attitude of a single person can be the cause of a major accident or problem, the two points “individual Landing awareness” and “continuity” are vital in safety initiatives. Akira Saito The ANA Group continues to inspect organizational safety issues through means such as questionDirector naires for all employees, including the president and officers, to evaluate its safety culture. As part of the Research Institute for ongoing questioning of oneself, moving ahead without making the safety culture evaluations a mere forSocial Safety mality requires facing up to the strong expectations set by society regarding safety, and resolving issues on one’s own. As the ANA Group interacts with its customers and other diverse stakeholders, I expect it to firmly respond to the expectations of society, to continue to review its initiatives, and to continue to maintain a level of safety that leads the world. Annual Report 2012 63 CSR Special Feature: Ensuring the World’s Highest Safety Standard Flight Crew I am a Boeing 787 co-pilot. As the launch customer for the model, the ANA Group worked with Boeing to resolve many issues to develop a state-of-the-art passenger aircraft. Even after introducing the aircraft, the ANA Group continues to make improvements for safer flight operation methods. Owing to various restrictions arising from its complex weather conditions and the restricted airspace, Japan is considered a difficult country for aviation. Pilots must have abilities at the world’s highest level in order to acquire national qualifications, and we maintain our qualifications and skills through ongoing examinations. In addition, as a company pilot, I am working to create new flight methods for an appropriate response in the event of a large-scale disaster. I will continue my studies to offer safer flight operations while embracing new technologies, based on the flight operation skills passed down Yuzo Nakai over 50 years of ANA’s corporate culture and safety. Co-Pilot B787 Office Flight Operation Center Operation Management Staff I am in charge of meteorology in Operations Management, where I collect the latest data from domestic and overseas weather forecasts to provide aircraft and related departments with timely information that affects flight operations. In particular, to minimize the impact from approaching blizzards, typhoons and developing low atmospheric pressure that can have a major impact on flights, I play a role in our response by conducting detailed analysis of original simulations based on data from the Japan Meteorological Agency, in addition to referencing past performance data. Moreover, in daily operations I select altitudes and routes based on analysis of airspace where turbulence is predicted, and also carefully judge aircraft storage and service advisability when faced with typhoon-strength winds. Meteorological information from external organizations is advancing every year, and we plan to Kei Sakamoto make full use of such information through system improvements, as well as staff education and other Flight Operation Database activities, as we work to improve flight quality and safety. Management Team Operations Management Airport Passenger Services Staff I’m currently the Quality Supervisor for our Haneda Airport passenger services. As an airport staff member, during boarding procedures and other activities I carry out a cycle of searching for hidden dangers and deficiencies in our operations, proposing improvements for the problems I find, implementing the measures and verifying the results. Airport staff must be very sure to check every boarding pass at the gate, accurately determine the number of boarding passengers, notify staff about the latest information on dangerous items that cannot be carried on board, and thoroughly check these items on the spot. I work to collect and share information about procedures and behaviors that may lead to human error in order to help staff members identify problems quickly. By continuing to predict and prevent risks throughout our work, we aim to raise our safety quality to even higher levels. Mami Nishimura Passenger Services Tokyo Airport Office 64 All Nippon Airways Co., Ltd. Under the ANA Group Safety Principle, “Safety is our promise to the public and is the foundation of our business,” we practice responsible conduct with integrity as we create peace of mind and confidence in the ANA Group. Cabin Attendant As a Safety Leader, my role is to carry out safety awareness education and safety promotion activities for other crew members. The number of boarding passengers, weather, flight time, crew composition, aircraft model and other variables create a very different environment for every flight. For this reason, on every flight the crew shares measures against possible risks arising from weather and other variables, and conducts reviews and improvements after flights. We believe it is important to stay on top of the latest safety information and use it in risk management. To ensure safe, secure operations on daily flights, I confirm others’ understanding based on our manuals, give alerts in accordance with conditions, and proactively report near-miss incidents and my observations about safety. In addition, the organization as a whole implements various initiatives to improve safety and quality. As each person Miyuki Tenokuchi reliably executes his or her duties to improve our performance as a team, we aim to ensure the world’s Cabin Attendant highest level of safety. Inflight Services Maintenance Staff I do heavy maintenance of aircraft at the Airframe Maintenance Center at Haneda Airport. The ANA Group grades all maintenance work according to difficulty and criticality, and work is performed only by state-certified maintenance staff with the aim of aircraft that are absolutely safe. In addition, based on the premise that mistakes can happen even when you pay attention, we have also introduced an inspector system for third parties to check the quality of maintenance work. Also, all maintenance staff share and practice key maintenance points based on the knowledge and experience built up within the Group over many years. As a maintenance staff worker, I remember to stop at key points throughout the work flow and conduct numerous checks until I am satisfied so that I can finish each job with confidence. Kensaku Shimada Airframe Maintenance Section Airframe Maintenance Center Engineering & Maintenance Ground Handling Staff For safe and accurate ground handling work, we take precautions against accidents and problems, prevent their recurrence and carry out performance checks. Precautions include training to eliminate human error, thorough use of point-and-call checks in our work, and procedures for accurate work even under time restrictions. When problems occur, we promptly confirm the situation and take steps to prevent a recurrence. After a month, we check whether countermeasures have been thoroughly implemented and are effective at the airport where the problem occurred, as well as at other airports. Handling changes in step with changes in the environment. I therefore aim to create a framework that displays our strong on-site capabilities, repeatedly revising the handling system at each airport from Noriyuki Kodama various angles to enable the most appropriate response to even minor changes.

Compared with conventional navigation, RNAV enables faster and shorter flights, reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Winglet installation Efficient Flight Program (EFP) Promotion Project Firmly committed to safety as a premise, ANA Group flight crews take personal initiative in discussing ideas about how they can make their flights Eco Flights, and conduct flight operations with each individual taking the environment into consideration while ensuring safety, comfort, stability and on-time performance. Since 2008, flight crews have been taking the initiative in codifying their collective expertise in Promoting Eco Flights, an Eco Flight guidebook, which contributes to further improvements in implementation of Eco Flights. For example, pilots formerly used thrust reversers to reduce an aircraft’s landing length, thus increasing engine thrust. Currently, they land with the engines in idle to the extent possible, after determining that it is safe to do so based on an assessment of runway conditions and other factors. This change Promoting Eco Flights reduces CO2 emissions and mitigates noise pollution for more environmentally friendly landings. 76 All Nippon Airways Co., Ltd.

In the fiscal year ended March 2012, we undertook a number of initiatives keyed to our introduction of the Landing Boeing 787, which excels in environmental performance. In a campaign to enable easy in-flight participation in carbon offsets, we gave participants presents of original mini-Boeing 787 badges made of wood thinned from forests. Nearly 9,000 customers took part, offsetting about 546 tons of CO2. In addition, as a result of our use of Tottori Prefecture’s offset credit program under the Japan Certificate as “the bluechip firm which protects Verified Emission Reduction (J-VER) scheme,* the prefecture recognized ANA’s contributions to a forest in Tottori” forest conservation by certifying us as “the blue-chip firm which protects a forest in Tottori.” * A scheme established by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan in November 2008 that certifies as Original mini-Boeing credits the domestic, voluntary reduction or sink-base removal of greenhouse gas emissions. 787 Badge Annual Report 2012 77 Corporate Governance (As of June 19, 2012) Fundamental Approach strengthened the supervisory functions of the Board of The ANA Group believes that it is essential to institute a Directors through measures such as appointment of system of corporate governance that promotes business external directors and has enhanced the auditing capabilitransparency and accountability to stakeholders in order to ties of corporate auditors by appointing full-time external continue enhancing its corporate value. corporate auditors.
