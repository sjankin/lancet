This means that we will: • Integrate our environmental policy and management fully in the business as an important element of all management functions. • Develop the company’s environmental policies and results, having regard to technical and scientific developments. • Educate, train and motivate our employees to carry out their activities in an environmentally responsible manner. Every year the management will hold meetings with all employees in their various groups. • Cooperate with our partners.

We also expect our suppliers and their representatives to behave honourably and credibly. In other words, close working with us, both ethically and morally. Environmental and energy considerations will normally mean, that we prefer products approved under one of the official” environmental/energy labelling schemes. Main suppliers have confirmed to the company that they comply with environmental legislation and the conditions agreed in their environmental approvals and have forwarded the relevant documentation. • Develop and provide products and services without unnecessary harmful impact on the environment, which are safe to use, efficient in terms of use of energy and natural resources and which can be recycled or safely disposed of. • Carry on our business with an efficient use of energy and materials, minimisation of harmful environmental impacts and waste production and safe and responsible disposal of residual waste. • Evaluate work processes so as to reduce physical, chemical and mental stresses to the maximum extent. • Make the necessary information available to employees and the general public for understanding the environmental effect of hl-repro’s activities and United Nations principles. • Produce an annual report of the results and targets of our environmental and health and safety work. P. 11 / COP 3 Targets and action plan Environmental targets It is our goal to maintain our proportionate electricity and gas consumption as a minimum – and as a target to reduce it by 5% to the next report. These measures are not currently measurable due to new acquisitions, and implementation in our existing buildings. • To reduce CO2 emissions from 2002 in the heating plant by a minimum of 33% to the next report in spring 2013. • To increase collection for recycling and reduce the quantity of waste for incineration and also applies to enterprise acquisitions. • To introduce reusable packaging and recovery wherever possible. • To return reusable packaging. • To reduce fixer and developer consumption. • To hold annual meetings for all employees on policies and attitudes etc. Action plan • Electricity and Heating: Energy optimisation will have top priority. That is why a micro cogeneration energy system was installed in order to maximise our current energy system. According to technicians, the plant can be better optimised as a result of new legislation and a new and 15 kWh. micro cogeneration system has been installed at Reprovej 4 in spring 2011. We are are currently concidering opportunities for a total renovation for both plants for better and cleaner energy use. External consultants are currently studying the possibilities. A supply contract for electricity has been signed for the coming 2 years and and contract for gasdeliverie to 2017. A project with a 20 kWh micro cogeneration unit is under cosideration. Electricity -4,7%. Heating -10,1%. • Water: Water consumption has been minimised. The developer unit is closed down. Is phased out through the use of thermal film. Water -13,8%. • Waste disposal: The basis is the Local Authority waste regulations and the beginnings of standardisation under the Packaging Directive. The company is registered for internet control of quantities. Waste disposal is continuously evaluated for possible fraction classifications, recycling opportunities and returns. Waste -68%. Result: 2011 compared to 2010. P. 12 / COP 3 Action plan continued • Recycling: With respect to both waste for incineration and recycling we have not been able to meet the desired targets. We have maintained our environmental targets. We have close contact with the waste disposal companies about future opportunities. Increased collection -5%. ( Business increase ) • Fixer & developer: Developer and fixer consumption has been phased out. Developer -34,6% and phased out. Fixer phased out. • W.P.E. checklist: The W.P.E. checklist has been revised – used for first time in Feb. 05. On the checklist the completer must confirm having read the manual and which edition. Employees’ transport in kilometers is also covered by the evaluation for estimating CO2 load. • Employees: In march 2012 we have an annual talk with employees on the company’s policies, attitudes and results and at the same time hear their opinions on the company’s policies and day-to-day management. All relevant requests for education or training will be met. The persons responsible for implementation are: John Larsen Environment Solveig Løkke – Environment Worker Frank Rask Jendresen – Environment Koma Grafisk ApS All employees and management. The time horizon is continuous until the next report. Result: 2011 compared to 2010. P. 13 / COP 3 Emission / Climate impact Presentation The most important greenhouse gas is CO2. In addition SO2 and NOX is included in inventories, and are the greenhouse emissions we have included since 2002. Other greenhouse emissions from Kyoto-protocol is not included. ( CH4 N2O HFCs SF6 og PFC and in addition ozone and CFCs gasemissions ) The emission factors is used in the calculations of fossil fuels, electricity and heat. During study is potential calculations made for purchased materials and waste. Environmental priorities ·Avoid generation of waste ·Recycling ·Recyclable raw materials ·Combustion ·Repository Plan for the minimization The reason for investment in micro-energy was a much more efficient use of energy into electricity and heat and a significant CO2 reduction. This will be grounds for future investment. Better use of energy and less emissions. An action plan is made, where the point is: how do we get the greatest reduction of emissions of CO2. One example could be thermography of buildings or alternative energy sources. There will be establishes from the 2010 targets for CO2 reductions. The acquisition of Koma Grafisk okt. 2009 has meant a increased consumption and consequent is greater CO2 emissions. 900.000 800.000 700.000 600.000 500.000 400.000 300.000 200.000 100.000 0 2002 2004 2006 2009 2010 2011 2012 CO2 emissions include electricity, gas, internal and external transport. The reduction from year 2002 to 2009 is 21,7% or 175.411 kg. ( 807.931kg. > 631.980kg.). P. 14 / COP 3 The goal for 2012 is reduction to 500.000 kg.
