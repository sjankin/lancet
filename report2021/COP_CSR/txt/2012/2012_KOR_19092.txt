Global Corporate Citizen 24 KNOC strives to secure new business opportunities and future growth engines through various oil development business channels. KNOC has been committed to discovering new unconventional oil and gas resources while accelerating the existing E&P businesses in the world. With an acquisition of 23.7% stake of Anadarko's Shale Oil business in April 2011, KNOC entered into the unconventional oil and gas market in earnest and secured new oil reserves of 116 million boe. The company is putting spurs to secure additional reserves in Vietnam, Kazakhstan, and Canada. 12 we Think tomorrow Date of Acquisition Acquired Company or Assets February 2008 Ankor E&P Holdings, USA February 2009 SAVIA Peru S.A., Peru Self-sufficiency Ratio (Unit: %) December 2009 Harvest Operations Corp., Canada Korea Share of KNOC December 2009 Sumbe, Kazakhstan October 2010 Dana Petroleum plc., UK Issue 1. 13.7 February 2011 Assets of Hunt, Canada Global KNOC 9.0 10.8 March 2011 March 2011 Altius Petroleum Int.B.V., Kazakhstan Assets of PCUK 6.4 In the case of Dana, the company is promoting rational 5.7 Shale Oil Assets of Ana-Darko E&P 4.4 April 2011 operational strategies to attain its strategic objectives and Company, USA simultaneously appreciate the subsidiary’s unique corporate Assets of Northstar, USA value by scouting management specialists from major oil December 2011 Assets of Parallel, USA companies and reorganizing existing business structure. 2009 2010 2011 KNOC Sustainability Report 2012 13 Global KNOC KNOC contributes to the stable demand and supply of oil in Korea by actively engaging in overseas oil development, production, and exploration projects. The company has also executed M&As of leading international oil companies to accomplish the governmentled task objective, 'Sizable Growth', in the early stage, which enabled KNOC not only to create synergy between existing and newly acquired fields, but to lay the groundwork for growing into a truly global company by creating opportunities to penetrate the downstream sector. KNOC is committed to increasing the national self-efficiency through continual M&As of foreign oil companies and assets. Starting with the asset acquisition of Canada's Hunt in February, KNOC has succeeded in acquiring high-quality oil production assets in 2011: Kazakhstan’s Altius and Petro Canada UK in March, the shale oil business of the US’s Anadarko in April, and US Northstar • Parallel in December. Since 2008, KNOC has focused on acquiring oil production assets in strategic strongholds such as Ankor, SAVIA Peru, Harvest, and Dana. As a result, the national self-efficiency increased from 1.9% in 2008 to 6.4% in 2011, based on KNOC's development stake. After the successful acquisitions, KNOC facilitates the stable growth of its subsidiaries through the PMI*. In the case of Dana, the company is promoting reasonable operational strategies to attain our objectives given and simultaneously appreciate the subsidiary’s unique corporate value. In addition, the integrated management system is taking strong root within the subsidiary through the Global Steering Committee. Because of such efforts, Dana’s oil production rose by 31% from 14.8 million boe in the previous year to 19.4 million boe, and operating income also surged 412% from USD 120 million in the previous year to USD 620 million. * PMI (Post-Merger Integration): A term referring to the integration process after a merger. PMI is an activity of systematically managing an organization to create synergy on a short-term basis after acquiring an organization with a different environment, such as business modes and organizational culture. interview For the Takeoff as a Global Leader I think that securing continual growth engines is the most important for KNOC to become one of the world’s top 50 oil companies. KNOC has been successful in sizable growth for the past few years, contributing to the improvement of the national oil and gas self-sufficiency and the stabilization of the domestic oil prices through the expansion of economical gas stations. In particular, 2012 is the year for completing KNOC’s mid-/long-term strategic goal, “Great KNOC 3020,” which has been executed since 2008. In addition to the completion of the strategic goal, KNOC should solidify its foundation for future growth by focusing on R&D, creation of synergy with its subsidiaries, cultivation of experts, etc. At the same time, it is essential for the sustainability of the company that enormous efforts should be made in the enhancement of internal capability, instillation of a global-level management system, green growth, ethical management, social contribution activities, and win-win growth with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in a balanced manner as well as external business expansion. KNOC also needs to keep an eye on actively the potential environmental risks stemming from the E&P and stockpiling business executions, through which your company is able to prevent accidents and join the government-led environmental activities such as the Low Carbon Green Growth policy. Even though there are many difficulties in your business activities due to the unfavorable situations in the Middle East and the financial crisis in the Euro zone, I suppose that KNOC should consolidate sustainability management strategies and put them into practice from the longterm perspective; this can serve as a cornerstone for your growth into a global national oil corporation.

Oil sand and shale oil are typical unconventional resources. Korea and the UAE have been implementing collaborative business in the oil and gas development sector based on the strategic partnership formed after Korea won a nuclear power plant construction project in the UAE in 2009. KNOC had initiated the negotiation for the business with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) in 2010, and signed a HOT (Head of Terms) for the development of three on/offshore oil and gas blocks of Abu Dhabi and an MOU for the Active New Resources Development cooperation in the oil and gas sector in March 2011. With the conclusion of the drilling right contract on the three blocks with ADNOC in March 2012, KNOC has been conducting the joint operation of those blocks, and a large-scale E&P project with over 1 billion boe guaranteed in the MOU is also on the track. Our involvement with those projects has a significant meaning that KNOC not only gains a new growth base in the Middle East, but it also contributes to the improvement of the national self-sufficiency rate.

KNOC Sustainability Report 2012 17 Fostering New Growth Engines KNOC set up 6 key strategic technologies including basin analysis on promising areas, subsurface imaging, reservoir simulation, enhanced oil recovery, unconventional energy development, and drilling and well completion These are essential core technologies in four E&P fields such as oil geology, geophysics, engineering, and drilling. As for unconventional energy development, KNOC established a midand long-term strategy to secure technologies for unconventional energy development and to boost the Eagle Ford and Black Gold businesses. R&D tasks for the shale oil and tight gas exploration technologies are also being conducted. Additionally, KNOC established the 'KNOC Global Technology & Research Center' in Canada to conduct technical reviews on its major E&P projects and to gain the core technologies from the well-experienced foreign resources. In 2011, we implemented 6 in-house research tasks related to key 6 strategic technologies and on site support methods, and 20 midand long-term industry-education cooperative national tasks for the development of both conventional and unconventional oil resources. In particular, a total of 13 patents were applied and one of them was registered. The R&D investments in 2011 were KRW 19.3 billion, an increase of 17.5% over the previous year. To take the initiative in the national vision of Low Carbon Green Growth and secure new growth engines, KNOC is focusing on developing technologies for the GTL (Gas-to-Liquid) and subsurface storage of CO2. Additional R&D focuses are on the multistage hydraulic fracture technology to increase shale oil production and gas hydrate development technology to secure new energy resources. interview Leapfrogging into a World-Class National Oil Corporation through New Growth Engines Technological independence in the E&P business is essential for KNOC to leapfrog into a global national oil corporation. To that end, the company needs to improve core E&P technologies by acquiring advanced E&P technologies and actively using domestic industry-academeresearch R&D resources. It is also important to secure sophisticated technologies for the E&P projects in tough environment such as deep sea and polar region, enhanced oil recovery in existing production blocks, and new oil and gas resource development. Moreover, interest in the environment has been increasing globally since the crude oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico by BP in 2010. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent any accidents in every oil field. To this end, the company should establish a standard safety procedure, cultivation of HSE management experts, full-time inspection of risk factors and maintenance, and emergency responsiveness system. Considering the feature of oil industry, KNOC should strive to establish and achieve midand long-term strategic goals from the sustainability point of view, instead of short-term and performance-focused business implementation. I hope that the company is emerged as a true global company leading the energy future of the world by preparing long-range strategies and enhancing new growth engines.

This year marks its 21st year since the launch of the social contribution activities jointly with companies. Actually, the activities can be said to be the first social contribution model nationwide, creating synergy effects jointly with 10 companies in Anyang City. With corporate social responsibility emerging as a hot issue, corporate social contribution activities have become a must-do in business rather than a good thing to do, emerging as an essential factor if one is to grow into a respected company from a competitive company. KNOC works hand in hand with communities with its continuous activities rather than one-off activity, as a main player of joint corporate activities. Based on heartfelt volunteer services by employees and social responsibility culture spread within KNOC, KNOC is carrying out social contribution activities vigorously. KNOC executed the following social contribution activities in 2011 and attained satisfactory results for both local residents and our employees: Ecosystem Experience Camp for Volunteer Service Centers and multicultural home children; Talk about Your Wishes for children with incurable diseases, and; Joyful Seoul Culture Experiences with corporate partners. I think the establishment of an organization in charge of social contribution activities to enhance the professionalism and effectiveness of corporate social contribution activities is necessary. I hope KNOC establishes itself as a respected company that grows together with communities through activities in line with its business directions and values, considering the various stakeholders in the communities.

It shares the system across KNOC and puts the relevant plans into practice. By making annual procurement plans for women’s and disabled people’s companies, we execute the plans and expand the 2010 2011 procurement of the relevant products by awarding additional points at the qualification screening stage to select a successful bidder. KNOC Sustainability Report 2012 43 Shaping of Win-Win Culture through the Establishment of Fair Trading Order KNOC makes efforts to build fair trading order with SMEs. We avoid voluntary contracting by enacting private contract operation rules and handle the entire processes of bid and contract through the e-procurement system. This way, we abide by transparent and fair competitive bid procedures. We operate a subcontract cost direct payment system and subcontract cost payment checking system to block evil practices such as payment delay and payment by bill to our secondary and tertiary partner firms and guarantee adequate payment. We stipulate the collaboration obligation between contract parties in the contract terms and conditions for goods, construction, and services for win-win growth. We actually build sound cooperative relations by imposing the Integrity Contract Performance Contract upon signing all contracts. Promoting Win-win cooperation with SMEs through the Fair Performance Distribution System For win-win cooperation with SMEs, KNOC executes a performance sharing system pursuant to the Act on Win-Win Cooperation Promotion between Large Companies and SMEs. The performance results of SMEs selected through competitive bids are annually assessed, targeting 11 services in 5 fields that repeatedly occur such as service on expenditure for oil stockpiling bases. According to the assessment results, we share in the performance by extending the contract period (additional 2 years and limited to 3 years in total) and through cash payment (up to 2% of the contracted price). KNOC can consistently ensure high-quality services, and the relevant SMEs can develop stable sales channels and secure revenues and stable employment. To solidify win-win cooperation relations with SMEs and establish fair trading order, KNOC held in 2011 a Win-Win Growth Signing Ceremony between KNOC and SMEs to implement the sharing performance system. Specifically, we entered into a win-win growth agreement and held meetings with SMEs to listen to their difficulties and collect opinions. We consolidate cooperative relations for winwin growth by hosting regular meetings and encouragement events with partner firms’ employees. We plan to reorganize the performance results assessment criteria and operate various types of performance sharing system in linkage with the business for localization.

Samjin Security is a company managing, supervising, and inspecting HR (employment, resignation, punishment, reward), education/training, four major insurance benefits and retirement, equipment, administration, and other various matters under KNOC’s stockpiling branch expenditure service contract. Our employees have never worried about unfair treatment or unreasonable conditions since we started collaboration with KNOC in January 2011. KNOC treated us as a partner for win-win growth, and we have received huge help in participation in the bids of other agencies by improving service performance in collaboration with KNOC. Recently, Samjin Security acquired ISO9001 (quality management international standard) and Management INNO-BIZ SME certifications from the Administrator of Small and Medium Business Administration, thanks to the dramatic improvement of our employees’ management and operation capabilities and company image. To be a sustainable company, I believe a company needs to breathe and grow with society. I hold KNOC in high regard as a model company in social responsibility, considering its sincere fulfillment of its role as a good corporate citizen. I hope for the two companies’ good business relationship to continue based on win-win cooperation and trust. Park Jun-seok, General Manager of Samjin Security KNOC Sustainability Report 2012 45 Win-Win System Establishment Organization Dedicated to SME Support KNOC set up organizations such as “Win-Win Growth Unit” and “Win-Win Growth Committee” to support SMEs. Based on these organizations, we systematically select and implement cooperative businesses to be carried out with SMEs President and relevant bodies.

Health, Safety, Environment, and Quality (HSEQ) Management System KNOC seeks natural ecosystem protection and eco-friendly management and actively engages in domestic and overseas efforts to cope with global warming. We tirelessly improve the HSEQ management system, meet domestic and international legal requirements, and shape a safe, eco-friendly work environment. We continually reflect changes in external business environment, stakeholder needs, corrective (preventive) action, deliberation results, and job process change on the HSEQ management system regulations documents. We enacted and amended regulation documents for 481 times in 2011. To consolidate the HSE management system’s efficiency in the oil development area, we formed the Integrated Oil Development Unit in 2009. By establishing the HSE management system as oil development standard that reflects the key issues in the oil development area and relevant international regulations, we apply the system to domestic and overseas oil development worksites. We share each worksite’s HSE knowledge and know-how through GCoP, form a network between domestic and international HSE expert groups of KNOC by hosting the KNOC HSE Conference, and enhance specific implementation capability in key HSE issues. * GCoP: Global Community of Practice HSEQ Management System and the Linkage of Worksites at Home and Abroad Hazard Management Analysis of Change Internal HSEQ Mechanical Subsidiaries HSE Manual Offices Integrity Audit Emergency Operation Response Control HSEQ Management Sytem HSEQ Management KNOC manages the quality and environmental management systems (ISO9001, ISO14001) regarding all worksites, realizes accident and disaster-free worksites through continual improvement activities, and strives for environmental conservation in the surrounding areas of its worksites. We manage stockpiling bases through the health and safety ISO 14001 KOSHA18001 management system (KOSHA18001) and drill ship sector through the quality management system (ISO9001) and by building the ISM/ISPS code on a ship’s safety/security. We have ensured system effectiveness by analyzing the HSEQ HSEQ management system activity results to achieve management policies and goals and by continuously improving System aspects requiring improvement. In 2011, we deduced 53 improvement recommendations through internal audits and completed 48 cases of correction and 138 cases of corrective actions on 157 improvement recommendations ISO 9001 ISM through third-party audit and inspection by an external agency. KNOC Sustainability Report 2012 53 Environmental Performance KNOC puts eco-friendly management into practice by consistently expanding environmental investment, such as improving facilities and equipment in eco-friendly ones in all its worksites and minimizing the pollutants generated within the worksites. By consolidating responsibility on environment, health, and safety by business sector, we prepare coping strategies by responsibility type and fortify regular education/training on various anti-pollution activities, energy savings, and onsite health and safety. Investments in Environment Environmental Investment (KRW in millions) KNOC’s environmental investment was KRW 10.459 billion and KRW 3.867 billion in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Investment cost rose sharply with the new acquisition of atmospheric pollutants and wastewater management 10,459 facilities/equipment following the additional construction of the Ulsan base. To operate eco-friendly stockpiling 4,602 bases, we invested in various environmental facilities, i.e., expanding the installation of oil retaining wall, securing 3,867 the soundness of ground-installed pipes, installing high-efficiency distillate removing devices and water quality monitoring equipment and tanker ship’s VOC processing devices, and establishing biological processing facilities 2009 2010 2011 operation standards. We plan to invest vigorously in the atmosphere-related environmental sector to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) or pollutants generated in the process of worksite operation and to measure them cyclically. * The figure of 2009 was changed due to the reflection of omitted amount.

We carry out onsite education/ training on environmental management and operational plans and in HSE areas annually under the supervision of the staff in charge of the environment by worksite. We also monitor cyclically our partner firms’ environmental management activities to improve environment awareness at construction sites. In the case of the Donghae-1 gas production worksite and a drill ship, we manage the education/training and qualification required for the HSE job as the employee’s duty using the HSE education/training matrix and enables the worksite’s HSE management to be carried out systematically. Knowledge and information on the environment between stockpiling branches are exchanged to find out and improve risk factors effectively by stockpiling branch. 2012 KNOC HSE Conference Business case In June 2012, KNOC hosted the 2012 KNOC HSE Conference attended by HSE leaders in the oil development sector at study domestic and international worksites. A total of 18 HSE leaders working at domestic and overseas oil developing worksites and KNOC’s head office HSE staff attended this conference, which enabled not only the enhancement of understanding of the KNOC HSE system but also the sharing of HSE features, advantages, and operational know-how through the 11 topics presentations selected by worksite. We also formed a sense of unity between HSE experts by organizing the HSE expert network through GCOP within KNOC and shared information and value. Consequently, we promoted the improvement of safety management level across KNOC. The HSE leaders who attended the conference pledged to do their best to pursue safe oil development, shape a safe culture at worksites, and diligently improve safety performance. 54 we Think tomorrow Coping with Climate Change Sustainability Performance Sustainability Efforts Appendix Through strategies to execute the GHG and energy target system in the public sector and plans for renewable energy development, KNOC actively engages in low carbon, green growth and spearheads efforts to cope with climate change. GHG and Energy Target Management System in the Public Sector Under the Framework Act on Low Carbon Green Growth (Apr. 2010) and Administrative Guidelines for the GHG and Energy Target Management System in the Public Sector (Jan. 2011), we vigorously put GHG emissions reduction and energy savings into practice. KNOC was designated as an agency subject to public sector target management system in 2011. We make various efforts including setting annual targets to reduce GHG emissions by more than 20% on the annual average by 2015 compared to the average between 2007 and 2009. We laid the foundation for reducing GHG emission by establishing the GHG inventory in all worksites in Korea including nine stockpiling bases in 2009. By forming a council to cope with climate change, we consistently offer education/training and workshops on the reduction of GHG emissions. Consequently, we achieved a 15% reduction of GHG emissions or 6,076tCO2 in 2011 compared to the average GHG emissions between 2007 and 2009.

The above standard emissions are based on the Implementation Plans in 2012. Establishment and Implementation of Power Generation by New and Renewable Energy KNOC established a plan to develop renewable energy actively in line with the government policy of reducing energy consumption by 20% by 2015 and to operate eco-friendly stockpiling bases. For 2012, we execute GHG emissions reduction and energy efficiency improvement by improving the powerreceiving transformer operation method to secure the high efficiency of power facilities. We expect 2,178MWh of power generation and 1,015tCO2 of GHG emissions reduction annually by implementing wind and solar photovoltaic power generation in four places including the Yeosu Office in 2014. Expansion of Videoconference To expand the videoconference system across KNOC in line with the global management environment, KNOC reinforces conference equipment in domestic offices and stockpiling bases and increases the building of infrastructure including videoconference equipment at overseas offices. We carry out GHG emissions reduction through all this and expect to save the business trip related expenses about KRW 92 million (based on 2010) by using videoconference. KNOC Sustainability Report 2012 55 Efforts to Save Energy KNOC conducts activities to cut down energy use including power, city gas, and water resources and maximizes energy savings through savings in the buildings and transport sectors. Water Source Consumption Water Resources Use Amount (as of 2011) Water used in stockpiling bases is mainly for firefighting and water curtain injection (common for underground); source water includes waterworks, industrial water, underground water, and dam water. Most of the water 856,907 tons consumption occurs in common underground operational bases (Geoje, Yeosu, Pyeongtaek, and Guri). To reduce water consumption, the Guri Office efficiently manages water by using natural water such as valley water as water for water curtain injection and by installing a flowmeter by user groups. Total water consumption in 2011 was 856,907 tons; we will minimize the use of water through the recycling and reuse of the supplied water.

All our employees make the following a habit in everyday life and participate in government policies: energy keeper activity, selected day operation system of cars, car pool for employees, and installation of parking lot for compact cars and hybrid cars. Innovative Activities to Save Power At KNOC including the head office, 9 stockpiling branches, and gas field management offices, we spearhead energy efficiency improvement by carrying out innovative activities to save power. By reflecting whether individual coolers and heaters are used and whether the weekday control system of car operation is observed in energy-saving implementation as the internal evaluation index by department, we offer incentives according to the outcomes. To encourage employees’ energy savings, we reward excellent departments and energy keepers. We comply with the Regulations on Public Agency Energy Use Rationalization and maintain proper indoor temperature, prohibit the use of individual heating devices, offer in-house energy-saving education, and inspect the energy-saving status at stockpiling branches and gas field management offices twice a year. As a result, in 2011, we reduced energy consumption by 10% on the average during the peak season in winter compared to the same period in 2010. Target and Result of LED Lights Eco-Friendly Office Adoption Stockpiling branches and gas field offices had 43 cases of energy-saving improvement activities as of 2011. Through (Units) the climate control unit’s inverter control in the auditorium, power use was reduced by about 40% compared to the 1,330 existing method, and 314kWh energy reduction was realized annually through efficient office lighting operation. We 1,288 replaced 22.7% of the total lights with LED lights as of 2011, and we plan to replace more than 30% of all lights with LED lights by 2012. By changing the cooling mode from the use of computer room coolers regardless of season to the mode of 2011(Result) 2012(Target) supplying cold outside air to the computer room in winter, we have saved 292,867kWh of power annually. * Total number of lights at the building: 11,786 units Electricity Consumption Year-on-Year (%) 91.29 89.44 86.58 2011. 12 2012. 01 2012. 02 Energy-Saving Activities in Winter Business case To manage power effectively in summer and winter when power consumption is at its highest, we conduct energystudy saving activities. To realize 10% energy savings in winter, all our employees participate in the achievement of the target. We maintain appropriate indoor temperature at 18℃ or below at the time of heating and use natural lighting instead of turning on 1/2 of the lights at corridors and toilets. In this manner, we conduct power-saving activities. We encourage our employees’ energy-saving activities by broadcasting information on power-saving activities and wage a campaign to wear long johns through newsletters. As a result, we achieved a 10% reduction in energy consumption on the average in 2011 compared to the same month in 2010 during the coldest period in winter. KNOC Sustainability Report 2012 57 Environmental Management KNOC adopts an advanced safety management system to prevent water and maritime pollution in major business areas and conduct preventive activities against atmospheric and soil pollution. Prevention of Water and Maritime Pollution Wastewater Management Wastewater generated in the stockpiling bases in 2011 showed good water quality within the in-house standard through treatment in the wastewater treatment facilities. With the improvement of foul water treatment facilities in 2011, we promote foul water quality stabilization. We religiously carry out “comprehensive measures to prevent environmental pollution in stockpiling bases” established in 2009 and stably operate waste treatment facilities through environmental facilities investment and education/training of staff in charge of the environment.

KNOC also maximizes maritime pollution prevention abilities through quick response to domestic and international regulations and environmental changes, installation of high-efficiency distillate-removing devices and onsite automatic measuring devices, and adoption of advanced safety management system for maritime terminals. We plan to block risky ships and prevent serious maritime accidents by evaluating maritime terminal facilities and safety management system in accordance with international standards and execute evaluation on the accident risk of port-incoming ships and chartered ships beginning 2013 on a step-by-step basis. We are planning wharf reinforcement in 2015 by supplementing wharf facilities to prevent accidents in advance according to tide change, which stems from new port development. We expect to prevent environmental pollution accidents and save about KRW 5 billion in costs. At the Donghae-1 gas production facilities and overseas drilling sites, we make all-out efforts to prevent water pollutant discharge through more fortified management than domestic or international regulations on the discharged water pollutants. Consequently, the pollution level of the Donghae-1 gas field and a drill ship, Doo Sung, is lower than the regulated level, continually improving compared to the previous year. Biodiversity Business case KNOC has been taking various animal protection actions since endangered wild animals were found around the Yeosu and study Geoje Stockpiling Bases. Around the Yeosu Stockpiling Base in particular, excretions and footprints of wildcats and otters — designated by the Ministry of Environment as endangered wild animal grade II and grade I, respectively -were found. In the post-environment impact study in 2011, the emergence of kestrel, a natural monument, was additionally confirmed. We took action to move the wild animals to their habitat, provided hideouts, and planted trees for their habitat. Concerning the Geoje Stockpiling Base, otters’ continual food hunting activities were detected. Thus, we installed a path for otters and an artificial drinking water source. Through consistent monitoring, we are taking action to reduce impacts on otters. 58 we Think tomorrow Environmental Management Sustainability Performance Sustainability Efforts Appendix Water Quality Management at Stockpiling Bases (ppm) Ulsan Branch Geoje Branch Yeosu Branch Seosan Branch Guri Branch Classification Limit Result Limit Result Limit Result Limit Result Limit Result 2009 60 5.5 30 1.2 10 3.1 10 1.2 10 1 BOD 2010 10 3.9 30 1.2 10 1.1 10 1.3 10 1.2 2011 10 2 30 1.1 10 1.3 10 1.7 10 1.9 2009 70 8.9 40 2.9 10 7.5 15 5.9 40 3.6 COD 2010 23 7 40 2.5 10 5.2 15 4.9 40 3.4 2011 23 5.6 40 3.4 10 6 15 4.4 40 3.2 2009 60 6.7 30 0.3 10 3.8 10 2.6 10 2 SS 2010 10 2.7 30 0.8 10 1.6 10 2.5 10 2.4 2011 10 1.7 30 1.5 10 1.4 10 0.9 10 1.8 2009 15 0.8 1 0.3 1 0.7 1 0.5 1 0.4 N-H 2010 5 1 1 0.4 1 0.6 1 0.3 1 0.4 2011 5 0.6 1 0.4 1 0.5 1 0.1 1 0.4 * The limits at Ulsan, Geoje, Yeosu and Seosan Offices are the criteria of the environmental impact evaluation agreement.

From a sustainability management viewpoint, active communication with external stakeholders and PR activities are required. KNOC should actively publicize the overseas resources development business carried out on the national competitiveness acquisition dimension not only through currently implemented information disclosure, distribution of press releases, and meetings with community residents but also through PR activities directed at the Korean people and communication with them. KNOC also needs to fulfill its environmental responsibility actively. Through partnerships with domestic and international companies, KNOC needs to build an eco-friendly business process across all stages of the resources development business including exploration & development while engaging in overseas environmental protection business. The completion of KNOC’s midand long-term goal, “GREAT KNOC 3020,” which has been pursued since 2008, is expected to be realized in 2012. Through vigorous sustainability management, KNOC should foster autonomous strength and solidify capabilities to take off as the world’s top national oil company. Lastly, I hope KNOC checks the internal and external sustainability issues and directions with the publication of the sustainability report as cornerstone and actively reflects them on business management and plays a leading role in the development of the oil industry. Lee Jung-ho, Staff Reporter of the Korea Economic Daily 62 we Think tomorrow Economic Efficiency Sustainability Performance Sustainability Efforts Appendix KNOC grows into a world-class national oil company through the continual fostering of growth engines and innovative activities in many business areas including oil development, oil stockpiling, eligible loan from Special Account for Energy and Resources, and drill ship businesses. Sales Breakdown Growth Potential (as of 2011, Unit: %) KNOC carries out activities such as consolidation of oil development technological capability, enhancement of oil/ gas production area’s operation stability, active PMI (Post-Merger Integration) on acquired assets, and maximization of stockpiling base use value. Consequently, our consolidated sales stood at KRW 8.9484 trillion, up 24.8% or KRW 1.7807 trillion in 2011 compared to the previous year. Our main business areas include the following: oil development business (oil resources’ exploration, development, refining, and sales), oil stockpiling business (export of crude oil and petroleum products, stockpiling rental, oil stockpiling facilities management, etc.), loan business (loans to corporations engaging in energy and resources-related business), drill ship business (chartering of drill ship), and other businesses. The sales ratio of each business in 2011 is broken down into 96.7% oil development business, 1.57% oil stockpiling business, 0.62% drill ship business, and 0.98% other businesses. Sales of the oil development business were pegged at KRW 8.6609 trillion, up 25.1% compared to the previous year. Oil output in 2011 increased 39% to 72 million boe compared to 52 million boe in the previous year. This is attributed to the significant operational stability consolidation of oil/gas production blocks. The oil stockpiling business grew 11.7% compared to the previous year, posting KRW 140.7 billion in sales thanks to the expansion of stored oil E&P 96.79 supply ability and trading capability and marketing activation of crude oil produced overseas. The drill ship business Stockpiling 1.57 recorded sales of KRW 55.3 billion, down 32.8% compared to the previous year due to the decline in the number of Financing 0.05 operations stemming from the performance improvement of the Doo Sung.

KNOC Sustainability Report 2012 63 Profitability The E&P business and oil stockpiling business are being expanded in keeping with the sizable growth strategy, which also contributes to the enhancement of profitability. Activation of the Oil Development Business Based on quantitative growth through M&A and acquisition of promising production assets, we accelerate the oil development business. Through various channels, KNOC expands new business opportunities and strives to secure oil/gas reserves and facilitate the domestic continental shelf development business. Securing Reserves through Successful Exploration Exploration Success Rate Through the use of subsidiaries’ specialized workers and drilling activity consolidation in the existing/new exploration blocks, we establish efficient drilling activity strategies and carry out intensive exploration/drilling activities in 49% core promising areas. In 2011, KNOC was successful in discovering crude and gas in 28 out of 57 boreholes in Asia, 30% America, Europe, and MENA (Middle East and North Africa). We secured 46.5 million boe of additional oil reserves for a 163% exploration success rate compared to the target. In addition, we have made a global HR plan actively using subsidiaries’ specialized workers — together with 2011 2011 improving HR and organizational processes — to enhance our exploration success rate. While bolstering the (Target) (Result) exploration technology job by dividing the Asia Group into an exploration organization and a business support organization, we have set up a new team (NEP Team: New Exploration Play Team) identifies new business Reserves by Drilling opportunities by generating prospects under the Geology & Geophysics Department to secure preemptive midand (Million boe) long-term promising exploration areas. 46.5 Domestic Continental Shelf Development Business According to the government’s First Phase Seabed Mineral Resources Development Scheme (2009~2018), KNOC performs precision exploration in areas with oil and gas reserve possibility in the domestic continental shelf including 0 the deep sea areas of Donghae (East Sea). 2010 2011 By encouraging private companies’ participation in continental shelf development and supporting operational experiences and technological prowess for private companies, we lay the foundation for entry into overseas oil development. In October 2011, KNOC acquired new exploration rights in the middle and south of the 6-1 block Production Volume of Donghae-1 Gas Field jointly with Korea’s private firms for the first time in Korea. This project is being conducted jointly with STX Energy and (Thousand boe) Daewoo International in the middle and south of the 6-1 block, respectively. The joint exploration of the continental shelf is being activated to complement technologies with each other and improve profitability. In addition, KNOC and 3,374 Australian Woodside are engaging in joint evaluation project of the deep sea 8 block of the East Sea and developing 1,755 gas hydrate, a next-generation energy resource, under the schedule of pilot production in 2014. To secure stable energy supply source and efficient development of national resources, we implement the development of a gas field discovered in the past. In May 2012, we initiated reassessment on the reserves of Gorae 2010 2011 8 production block, carried out economic efficiency evaluation, and made development plans; we are carrying out development sequentially. 64 we Think tomorrow Profitability Sustainability Performance Sustainability Efforts Appendix Drill Ship Business KNOC operates a drill ship business — which is emerging as an important business in today’s era of high oil prices and maritime oil development — with excellent achievements. The Doo Sung, Korea’s only semi-submersible drill Rig Utilization Rate in 2011 ship operated by KNOC, successfully drilled 108 boreholes (as of June 2012) in 9 countries including Alaska, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Russia, and Myanmar, not to mention Korea. We meet operators’ requirements by building a safety 77% management system in line with international standards such as the ISM, ISO9001 certifications acquired in 1998 (281 Days) 52% and ISPS certification obtained in 2004. We recorded USD 50 million charter revenue in 2011, and Doo Sung posts (189 Days) approximately 25% higher operational rate compared to the other semi-submersible drill ships of Southeast Asia. Oil Stockpiling Business SemiDoo Sung submersible Rigs in Enhancement of Oil Demand and Supply Stability and Capability to Cope Southeast asia with Crises Through Stable Oil Supply The oil stockpiling business prevents instability in the demand and supply of oil by supporting in a timely manner oil stockpile and stockpiling facilities upon the occurrence of an unstable factor by domestic oil refinery. As a public benefit business, the business aims at the stabilization of domestic oil demand and supply and prices. To cope with snags in the world oil supply caused by the Libyan incident, we released 3,465,000 barrels of oil stockpile through negotiation between the government and refineries according to IEA’s joint responsiveness. Actually, we contributed to the stabilization of domestic oil demand and supply and prices. We also expanded the international joint stockpile to 40,500,000 barrels and consolidated cooperation with UAE ADNOC and Iraq’s SOMO in the E&P business sector. We improve oil stockpile supply capability by expanding the volume of crude oil produced overseas — and which can be introduced from abroad — from 21,000 barrels per day from 4 oil blocks to 153,000 barrels per day from 9 oil blocks in an emergency by building a system to introduce our crude oil produced abroad to Korea. In this manner, we have enhanced our capability to cope with the oil demand and supply crisis. To expand the oil stockpile supply and enhance the oil industry’s competitiveness, we religiously operate the oil hub business through an action plan for building the oil hub and business feasibility analyses starting with a Northeast Asian logistics-hub business plan in 2000. Currently, we are building commercial stockpiling facilities in Yeosu, and we are scheduled to launch commercial operations. We also implement the Ulsan project aiming at commercial operations by 2016, with the North Port project implementation mode confirmed following the recent completion of master plan design. Revenue from international Business Capability Consolidation through Maximization of Stockpiled Asset Use Value joint stockpiling projects KNOC maximizes the stockpiled assets use value and fortifies linked businesses. By expanding the international joint (KRW in billions) stockpile and carrying out strategic marketing, we recorded high revenue of KRW 112.5 billion in 2011. We have 112.5 actually built a global trading system including the establishment of a trading corporation (KNOC Trading Corp., 101.1 98.9 Huston U.S.), and we aggressively execute our business by greatly expanding stockpiled assets trading and marketing 65.7 of crude oil produced abroad. Our trading size of 18 million barrels of oil in 2010 rose to 32 million barrels in 2011. 2008 2009 2010 2011 관련 사진 KNOC Sustainability Report 2012 65 Management Stability KNOC retains financial stability and soundness together with external finance according to the need to raise a large-scale external fund to ease the financing burden caused by the instability of the world financial market and based on its sizable growth strategy.

For this deal, KNOC was awarded Best Deal of Bonds in Asia by Asia Money in 2011. By raising USD 360 Long-term borrowings 63.4 80.6 27.1 million through Swiss franc-denominated bond issuance in February 2012, we developed a new fund procurement ratio (%) market and contributed to Korean bonds’ additional interest rate reduction with record-low additional interest rate as Fixed incomea Korean agency. based We improve the financial structure with the successful sales of global assets in Korea and diversify new financing 32.5 70.7 117.5 borrowings rate (%) sources for oil development. For the expansion of resources development investment, we secured USD 308 million by selling minor stakes in the US’s ANKOR assets to the private sector. Through all this, we have secured investment financing without additional capital injection from Korean government. We realize debt structure stabilization considering an optimal debt structure by calculating the optimal ratio of long-term borrowings by conversion short term borrowings into long term borrowings and fixed interest rates. 66 we Think tomorrow Management Stability Sustainability Performance Sustainability Efforts Appendix Asset Management Improvement and Reasonable Use of Budget KNOC improves its asset management structure and reasonably executes budget through enhancement of asset management efficiency, budget execution’s transparency, and budget cut activation. We analyze portfolio according to the assessment of value and risk of E&P assets, prioritize them, and carry out business successively. Budget Reduction In 2011, we saved KRW 8.9 billion in expenditure by improving the stockpiling base operational method, recorded (KRW in billions) rate increase of 18% on the average with strategic marketing, and posted revenue of KRW 112.5 billion in the 44.2 international joint stockpiling sector. With our head office’s engagement in Dana’s produced crude oil marketing, we laid the foundation for global trading and generated annual revenue of KRW 3.3 billion. We improved the 15.9 transparency of budget execution through the expansion of entertainment expense disclosure object and fortification of the budget execution standard. Through the amendment of budget operation guidelines including 2010 2011 excessive budget execution and specific expenditure execution, we consolidate budget execution management. Debt and Credit Rating Management KNOC maintains a stable financial structure through continual debts management. Our debt ratio in 2011 was 193.2%, up 24% compared to the previous year. This can be attributed to the M&A as part of KNOC’s efforts for the sizable growth and R&D investment. To attain our strategic goal of Post-Great KNOC 3020, we set a midand long-term financial goal and manage cash flows from operating activities compared to the debt ratio (FFO/Debt), together with adjustment to lower our debt ratio. Concerning the debt ratio, we plan to lower it to 191.6% by 2017 and to 92% from the longer-term perspective compared to the current level. We plan to improve the FFO/Debt ratio to 72% and enhance our ability to repay borrowings. KNOC maintains high credit rating internationally, having received an A1 by Moody’s and an A by S&P in 2011.

Risk management activities play a pivotal role in business management by backing up reasonable decision making to achieve strategic goals. Risk Management Organizations KNOC operates a Risk Management Committee to deliberate on and manage major risks caused by management activities as a risk-managing organization. We also operate a risk management department that carries out supervision and support for risks, designate the staff in charge of risks in each department to monitor risks that may arise in the course of performing duties, and promptly respond to such risks. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) System KNOC has been operating the ERM system it built in 2010 for the systematic management of all risks in management and establishment of effective measures to cope with risks. With the building of the ERM system, we manage risks in our activities by integrating the risks and operate risk management resources and capabilities efficiently. Strategic Risk Management • Financial Risk Management: Through the ERM system, we automatically measure VaR (Value at Risk: Maximum possible loss amount of assets) and EaR (Earning at Risk: Maximum possible loss amount of earnings) according to the fluctuation of exchange rate, oil price, and interest rate. We manage them in an econometric manner by setting the allowed limit. Upon exceeding the allowed limit, we cope with risk by executing hedging. • Strategic Risk Management: Through the ERM system, we frequently measure and manage key management strategic indices, output, reserves, sales, and annual estimated result vs. target in terms of operating income and RAPM (Risk Adjusted Performance Measurement). When a risk signal of non-attainment of target (Red: Serious, Yellow: Alert) is demonstrated, we establish countermeasures immediately and execute them. • Operational Risk Management: Through the ERM system, we automatically extract the violation of regulations, errors in trading from key business process, and take the required action immediately. To enhance safety management ability in each worksite, we monitor key HSE indices (LTIF, oil spill, etc.) at all times. Each department identifies and manages possible risks in the course of performing duties. For risks with great importance, depending on the risk frequency and impact, we select them as KRI (Key Risk Indicator) and monitor them and establish countermeasures at the company-wide level. Response to Risks KNOC carries out activities to minimize damage by effectively coping with and recovering from crisis through the establishment of an emergency countermeasure body (Crisis Management Committee, Crisis Countermeasure HQ) in case serious losses occur in KNOC’s management activities or value or an imminent situation arises due to risks, together with pre-risk management activities. KNOC divides the crises into four fields (management risk, disaster, PR, conflict management) and devises and operates a manual that sets forth the procedures for coping with crisis stages (interest, caution, alert, serious) by crisis type. “Risk Management” 68 we Think tomorrow Economic Performance Distribution Sustainability Performance Sustainability Efforts Appendix Through social contribution, tax payment, and community investment, KNOC distributes the created economic value to various stakeholders related to management activities including employees, partner firms and customers.

The BOD meeting can be convened by the request of the Chairman of, or 1/3 or more of the directors registered; items on the agenda are decided by the approval of the majority of the directors registered. The BOD Chairman can re-deliberate on the items on the agenda through a supplement of data while holding off the decision, if he/she decides that there is a serious problem in executing the decided matters. Pursuant to the Act on the Public Agencies’ Operation, the director whose participation in the BOD is restricted is not included in the count of directors registered. A director can exercise voting rights through the forms of communication, which all directors can send and receive moving images and voice even without attending the BOD meeting in person. KNOC promotes the activation of BOD through the establishment of a regular BOD meeting. Through this, we have enhanced the directors’ participation in management and raised the attendance rate according through increasing the number of items on the agenda of the BOD meeting and the number of meetings. The ratio of utterance between the non-executive directors and the executive directors rose 2.08% in 2011 compared to the previous year’s it. KNOC held 18 BOD meetings and deliberated on 62 items on the agenda, with 9 out of the 53 decided items handled by resolutions through corrections. The minutes of BOD meetings are posted on our main website (www.knoc.co.kr) and Alio (www.alio.go.kr).

An executive director’s remuneration consists of the basic pay, the performance-based pay, and the severance pay, whereas an external director’s remuneration is made up of service allowances. Concerning the executive director, the performance-based pay is depending on the annual performances or the job performance evaluation results. The payment rate of the agency head’s performance-based pay is decided by according to the management performance evaluation result, but the ceiling of performancebased pay and the payment rate comply with those set forth by the government. For the non-executive directors, service allowances for items on the agenda of BOD meetings the research on business development of KNOC and attendance allowances when attending BOD meetings are paid. The service allowances are paid as conforming to the stipulations set forth by the Executives’ Remuneration Regulations, and the attendance allowances are paid by the standard set forth by the CEO of KNOC.

Based on such a strategic goal, in 2011, we improved various ethical systems and consolidated employees’ ethical education to put world-class ethical management into practice. KNOC's Integrity Monitored by the AntiCorruption and Civil Rights Commission Ethical Management Implementing System KNOC set up the Ethical Management Committee, which reports directly to the CEO. It deliberates and decides on important issues and matters to implement effective ethical management. The implementing organizations include 2011 the supervision department of ethical management, Legal Team, and officers in charge of integrity and ethics in 9.33points each department’s practice of ethical management. As a result of employees’ efforts to put ethical management into practice, KNOC earned the highest grade, AAA, for five consecutive years in MKE’s Sustainability Management Evaluation (KoBEXSM). We also garnered 9.33 points in 2011, which is an improvement from the 9.26 points we got in 2010 in the external integrity assessment by the Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission of Korea. 2010 9.26points Vision A World-class National Oil Corporation Beloved by the People Ethical Management Roadmap Strategic Goal GREAT KNOC 3020 Response to the global level 2010 ethical management ~ 2011 Cultivation of ethical talents on a Ethics Goal Securing Reasonable Profitability and Systematic Ethical Management global level Expansion of the ethical 2012 Strategic Goal for Global B.E.S.T.

We actually established advanced audit foundation by integrating and managing audit progress through the e-audit system and by realizing the following: establishment of the risk-based system for audit and quality evaluation, building of an inspection system for lax management/management guidelines, frequent monitoring and early warning, and audit statistics and knowledge & information management. We also established the two-way inspection system of the audit department and general departments and the autonomous internal control inspection system centered on the field. Reporting and Rewarding System for Public Interest KNOC operates a reporting system for public interest wherein employees can report other employees’ unethical http://www.knoc.co.kr/sub02/ behaviors on its website or via telephone and mail. sub02_1_5.jsp We pay up to KRW 2 billion as reward in accordance with our regulations and strive for the protection of the reporting employee or informant by imposing stringent disciplinary punishment on the employee who discloses information on the reporting employee or informant. KNOC Sustainability Report 2012 79 Integrity Ombudsman System To enhance the effectiveness of the reporting on ethical management and the management suggestion system, we have bolstered reporting channels by introducing an integrity ombudsman system. We commissioned three external experts as integrity ombudsmen, and we operate an irrationality reporting center. The integrity ombudsman system discovered KNOC’s ethical risks from an independent organization’s standpoint by suggesting management issues for 6 times in 2011. Ethical Norm Amendment and Strengthening Monitoring KNOC strives to enhance the executive ability of ethical norms by frequently amending its code of conduct and http://www.knoc.co.kr/sub02/ regularly inspecting employees’ understanding of the amended details. In 2011, we made an executives’ antisub02_1_4_3_r.jsp corruption integrity pledge and the completion of integrity education mandatory by amending the code of conduct. We also expressly specified the tenure of the staffs in charge of work wherein arrangement and solicitation are highly likely to be made — such as supervising construction — so that corruption can be avoided in advance. KNOC also increased the inspections of employees’ understanding about the code of conduct from twice a year in 2010 to four times in 2011 and simultaneously carried out ethical education and counseling as well upon the inspections of understanding. We aim at employees’ precise understanding and practice of the code of conduct and the ethical management system by fortifying the feedback of the inspection results. Integrity and Ethics Mileage System KNOC operates the integrity and ethics mileage system it has adopted, wherein mileage is awarded to employees and departments who/that actively put ethical management into practice. In 2011, we consolidated activities to induce ethical management practice by awarding mileage and rewarding excellent contestants with the hosting of a Quiz Contest to Know the Code of Conduct Better and the Contest on Autonomous System Improvement Challenges in 2011. Number of Employees Ethical Management Education Completed the Cyber Trainings (Persons) Overseas Ethical Education 949 903 In line with continuous expansion of the overseas business, KNOC has been bolstering the ethical education for employees working at overseas offices. A standing audit committee member visited all overseas offices in 2011 and offered special lectures on integrity and ethics. The Legal Team visited offices in Kazakhstan and Vietnam and 2010 2011 provided guidance on ethics-related norms to be observed in the offices including British and American bribe-related laws and regulations. This way, we have focused on broadening understanding of employees’ ethical management. Through consistent ethical education for overseas branches, we will enhance understanding and the will to practice ethical management for employees at overseas offices. Development of Educational Contents on Ethical Management KNOC endeavors to diversify ethical education contents including the customized ethical educational contents linked with KNOC’s work. In 2011, we maximized educational effects through the development of ethical educational contents, and educational satisfaction rose 14% compared to the previous year’s it. Customized Ethical Management Education We offer ethical management customized to the education target. We conduct cyber ethical education that targets all our employees, code of conduct education targeting our new employees, and integrity education targeting our executives each year. We also hold ethical management workshops for the in-depth education of the officers in charge of integrity and ethics in each department. 80 we Think tomorrow APpendix Awards / Membership in Associations 81 Third Party Assurance Statement 82 Reporting standards 84 Glossary 88 KNOC Sustainability Report 2012 81 Awards / Membership in Associations Awards (2010 ~ 2012) Year awards Held by Commissioner's Prize of the Statistics Korea for the best institution in the national 2010 Statistics Korea statistics sector 2010 Safety Award for Excellences (Ankor Energy, a subsidiary of KNOC) Minerals Management Service, USA 2010 Excellent Institution Award for the Performance Sharing System Ministry of Knowledge Economy Commissioner's Prize of the Statistics Korea for the best institution in the national 2011 Statistics Korea statistics sector 2011 Excellent Labor-Management Culture Award Ministry of Labor 2011 Governance Award at the National Volunteer Festival Jungang Ilbo 2011 Merit Award for Eco-friendly Industry Development and Low Carbon Green Growth Ministry of Environment 2012 President's Prize for Stockpile Product Management Ministry of Public Administration and Security 2012 Prime Minister's Prize for Excellence in Equal Employment Opportunity Ministry of Labor Membership in Associations Korea Petroleum Association Korea Electric Engineers Association Korean Geotechnical Society Korea Plant Industries Association Federation of Korean Industries Korean Dietetic Association Energy & Mineral Resource Development Association Korean Society Of Civil Engineers Environment Preservation Association of Korea Korea Fire Safety Association Korea Society Of Innovation Korean Library Association Public Institution Transparent Society Convention Korea Industrial Safety Association Korea Productivity Center Implementation Council Advancement Audit Forum Korea Fire Safety Association The Institute of Internal Auditors Korean Association for Organizational Studies Emergency Planners Association of MKE Korea Customs Logistics Association Korean Committee for WPC Korea Association of Middle East Studies Workplace Reserve Forces Commanders Association International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) Korea Electric Engineers Association Korean Resource Economics Association Korea Association of Chief Financial Officers Korea Society of Economic and Environmental Geology Korean Society of Earth and Exploration Geophysicists The Korea Society of Energy Engineering Korean Resource Engineering Association The Geological Society Of Korea Korean Society of Soil and Groundwater Environment Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers Korean Fire Protection Association KEF (Korean Member Committee of the WEC) Korea International Trade Association Council for Energy Industry Overseas Advance Korea Accounting Association The Korean Society for Geosystem Engineering Korean Society of Earth and Exploration Geophysicists Korea Industrial Technology Association Climate Change Business Forum The Korean Society of Petroleum Geology Yoongyeong Forum International Contractors Association of Korea Korea Carbon Capture & Storage Association (KCCSA) Korean Petroleum Association Korea Management Association Corporation CEO Club of public energy institutions 82 we Think tomorrow Assurance Statement INTRODUCTION Det Norske Veritas Certification Ltd.

In reaching our conclusion, we have undertaken the following work; • Interviewed the KNOC’s executives; • Visited the KNOC’s office in Anyang, Republic of Korea; • Examined relevant documents, data and other information requested by DNV and made available by KNOC; • Reviewed the mechanisms implemented by KNOC to promote and oversee its sustainability-related policies as described in the Report; • Reviewed a selection of internal communication and external media reports relating to KNOC’s sustainability management approach, performance and adherence to its policies; • Analyzed sustainability data management systems, assessed the specific data and information reported. • Assessed reliability of the data and information based on explicit assertions regarding sustainability performances on material issues. • Checked that the Report fulfilled the requirement of GRI Application Level. KNOC Sustainability Report 2012 83 CONCLUSIONS In the DNV’s opinion, and based on the scope of this Assurance Engagement, the Report provides a reliable and fair representation of the KNOC’s sustainability strategy, policy, practices and performance in 2010-2011. Based on the work undertaken as part of this Assurance Engagement, DNV believes that the Report generally meets the requirements of GRI G3.1 about the principles, content and quality. The Report meets the requirement of GRI about the Application Level ‘A+’. Further conclusions and observations on the adoption of reporting principles and specific performance information are made below; Inclusivity: KNOC has engaged with a wide range of stakeholders regarding sustainability issues via surveys and interviews. Stakeholder engagement process is disclosed in the Report. 6 Stakeholder groups which are, Employees, Suppliers, Customers, Local community/NGOs, and Academia, Government/National assembly are identified. Why these stakeholders are selected and how the communication processes for respective groups go are stated in the report. Since many E&P operations and drilling ship operations which are parts of the major business areas of KNOC are progressing abroad, there are various stakeholders who have been involved in those projects and operations. It is recommended that the engagement be expanded with the international stakeholders so that the concerns and expectations of these stakeholders are reflected into the sustainability strategy of KNOC. Responsiveness: Stakeholders’ views, interests and expectations sought from the survey are considered in the preparation of the Report and in the formulation of KNOC’s sustainability management approach. KNOC is recommended to establish quantitative objectives corresponding to respective material issues and regularly monitor and measure the performance. These needs to be reported in the sustainability report. Materiality: The Report generally provides an account of performance on the issues that are most significant to KNOC’s activities and which are most relevant to its stakeholders. The material issues were identified and prioritised based upon the stakeholders’ opinion sought by survey. Reliability: Data and information presented in the report are generally reliable. However, internal assessment of data management and data checks need to be implemented. The Report is referred to GRI G3.1 for preparation so that the readers can compare the performance and changes over time. The control of the data and information about the sustainability performance should be improved. Some data in the report are found inconsistent with the source data during the verification and subsequently corrected. Completeness: The scope and the boundary of the Report cover the issues and activities that are of the most significant to KNOC and relevant to its stakeholders. No material omissions were identified in data or information verified. More efforts to improve reporting on the performance from international business operations needed to be made. Neutrality: The information in the Report is generally presented in balanced manner. However more proactive actions needed to be taken against stakeholders’ negative views on its performance and disclosure of factual information needs to be provided. OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT The following is an excerpt from the observations and opportunities reported to KNOC’s management in addition to the recommendations above. However, these do not affect our conclusions on the Report and are provided to encourage continual improvement. • Adopt more structured and systematic processes for data gathering, analysis and reporting as part of the existing internal audit program to ensure the accuracy and reliability of reported information; • Progressively extend the scope of the sustainability strategy and Report to operations and projects overseas; • As for GRI indicators, address the reason for omission or partially reported according to GRI Application Level Check Methodology.

As an international organization presenting guidelines on a firm’s sustainability report, GRI offers standardized reporting indices of sustainability GRi (Global Reporting initiative) management. The G3.1 version is currently being developed. GTL means converting natural gas into synthetic oil. Actually, German chemists Franz Fischer and and Hans Tropsch manufactured synthetic fiber in 1923 GTL (Gas to Liquid) through the catalyst reaction of syngas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen) generated from the partial oxidation of coal (CTL: Coal-To-Liquid). In the 1950s, the GTL technology was developed and commercialized by using natural gas in South Africa through the adoption of the German technology.
