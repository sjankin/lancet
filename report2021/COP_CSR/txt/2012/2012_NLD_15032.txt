These areas of attention were determined in 2008 by the Responsible Business portfolio holder. They are: responsible leadership; responsible conduct; responsible business operations; responsible products and services; embedding in society; and acountability & reporting. The annual report on Responsible Business 2010 has been compiled based on this structure. SNS REAAL has decided in favour of electronic publication of the report in order to better convey the information to better meet the needs of various target audiences. Electronic publication also reduces the use of natural resources (paper). The division into six areas of attention will be evaluated in the course of 2011. Target audience The target audience for which this report is intended consists of our stakeholders: clients, intermediaries, employees, suppliers and civil society organisations. Organisation The information on which we report is derived from within the organisation, structured according to the six 'R's and stored in a database. In conjunction with the RB portfolio holder and the core team for RB, the RB Director has decided where the report's emphasis should rest. An editorial board has been constituted, and external parties engaged, to decide on the composition and the writing of the content of the report. Feedback The report incorporates the option for providing feedback. This makes it possible for SNS REAAL to gauge whether the information is sufficiently accessible for different target audiences and if they have been able to find the information required. We employ their feedback in ensuring that the following report even better meets the expectations of our stakeholders. Evaluation Information for the report has been provided by the brands and the staff departments. The report's texts have been submitted to the editorial board and to the co-ordinators of the brands and the staff for evaluation and/or assessment. In addition, the content of the report has been assessed by Legal Affairs, Group Audit, Concern Communication, GORCC (Governance Operational Risk & Compliance Committee), the Executive Board and the core team RB. Following publication of the report the entire process will be evaluated. 3.6 Demarcation of the report DThe information provided, the data on environmental indicators and data concerning the social performance indicators apply to the whole of SNS REAAL. Where a part of the organisation is referred to by name, the information (objectives, results) is relevant to that particular part. Where parts of the organisation are not referred to, no explicit or additional information was available at the time of publication of this report. 3.7 Specific exceptions SNS REAAL reports on the entire organisation, excluding those exceptions in 3.6. 3.8 Basis for reporting on collaborations and subsidiaries In this report, SNS REAAL reports on the entire organisation, with the exception of the business divisions specified in 3.6. In addition, ASN Bank publishes its own (sustainability) report. Refer also to http://www.asnbank.nl . 3.9 T echniques and calculation methodologies for data gathering. Account for any decisions for not applying GRI protocols or for significant deviations from them SNS REAAL reports according to GRI G3 guidelines, level C. For reasons of data availability, a different indicator has been relied upon for some performance indicators. It is indicated where this has been the case. 3.10 Revisions Data for 2009 have been revised in the GRI tables in cases where additional information subsequently became available. In graphics and tables referring to environmental aspects of responsible business operations FTE data concern the situation as at 30 September 2010. SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  5 3.11 Amendments to scope Data in this report concerning personnel in previous years may vary from data presented in earlier published reports. Variations in data result from information being derived from different personnel administration departments, as a result of the integration of new business units such as AXA, Property Finance and Zwitserleven. These administrative departments have subsequently been integrated into one centralised personnel administration register. VERIFICATION 3.13 Policy and practice concerning external verification RB reporting by SNS REAAL does not involve external verification. We are open to the opinions of our stakeholders: clients, intermediaries, employees, shareholders, suppliers and civil society organisations. A number of them present their opinions about SNS REAAL in this report. Via the Sounding Board Group for Responsible Business, discussions are held with stakeholders about issues relevant to a company such as SNS REAAL in this area. starting from the beginning of 2001 concerning the themes which are relevant in this field for a company such as SNS REEAL. In addition, Group Audit has conducted an internal audit with the aim of adding certainty that the social report constitutes a reliable and adequate representation of the policy of SNS REAAL concerning responsible business, company operations, the activities and performance of SNS REAAL in this area during the reporting period 2010. The quantitative information presented in this GRI index has also been assessed for admissibility and completeness by the DHV advisory group on sustainable business.

Numerous factors are taken into account on a daily basis, for instance in accepting new clients, the provision of credit, investment in projects and businesses and the development of (and the framework of standards for) new products. In so doing, we apply the precautionary principle. In terms of policy, this is set out in our client acceptance policy, credit policy and investment policy. 4.12 Non-obligatory external guidelines By the close of 2010, SNS REAAL and its business divisions had signed onto a variety of declarations by leading organisations in the field of responsible business. We have an obligation to abide by the guidelines of: –– Apart of pharmaceutical companies about the extent to which they make their medicines available for people in developing countries. Greater access to medicines could save millions of human lives each year. –– Carbon Disclosure Project (SNS Asset Management and ASN Bank). –– Equator Principles, signed by ASN Bank in November 2009, by which ASN Bank commits itself to assess the projects in which it invests according to societal and environmental criteria of the International Finance Corporation (IFC). –– EuroSIF transparency guidelines (ASN Bank and SNS Investment Funds, with regard to sustainable funds). –– Global Reporting Initiative, guidelines for reporting on sustainable business (SNS REAAL and ASN Bank). –– UN Global Compact (SNS REAAL and ASN Bank). –– UN Principles for Responsible Investment (SNS Asset Management). SNS Asset Management has also signed the PRI Collaborative Engagement Initiative of the UNPRI, aimed at improving responsible business in Hong Kong en Singapore. –– Investor Statement on a Global Agreement on Climate Change (ASN Bank). –– Banks' Climate Statement (ASN Bank). SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  8 –– Fair Green Deal (ASN Bank). –– Biodiversity Coalition (ASN Bank). The following sets of guidelines have been incorporated into the general business principles of SNS REAAL: –– ILO Treaty. –– Universal Declaration of Human Rights. –– OECD guidelines for multinational corporations, in particular with respect to environmental policy. –– In addition, we report according to GRI guidelines, level C. SNS Asset Management, ASN Bank and the ASN Investment Funds also operate their own strict sustainability criteria that are entirely in line with the UNPRI. ASN Bank operates via a range of partnerships on the dissemination and implementation of sustainable investment, such as in the green reflection group of banks, the association of investors for sustainable development (VBDO), UNEP FI, CDP etc. ASN Bank has incorporated ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) aspects in specific investment criteria and issue papers. These are also included in the bank's voting policy and engagement policy. Service providers are approached with questions concerning how they intend to deliver upon ASN Bank's policy in the field of sustainable investment. Voting behaviour and share spreads are open to public scrutiny via the website www.asnbank.nl. ASN Bank's sustainability report presents a comprehensive overview of progress in the area of ESG. Since 2008, SNS Asset Management has included exclusions, engagements and voting activities in its standard reporting. The investment process begins with ESG criteria. SNS Asset Management places specific demands on its investments. The fundamental policy principles which SNS Asset Management applies are: 1 respect for the core rights of the individual, 2 not being guilty of the worst forms of child labour, 3 refraining from involvement in forced labour, 4 refraining from serious forms of corruption, 5 refraining for serious forms of environmental pollution, 6 no involvement in the production of weapons systems whose impacts are disproportional or which do not distinguish between military and civilian targets, 7 respect for generally accepted ethical principles which apply in a humane society. SNS Investment Funds (SBB) has the task of consistently in applying an umbrella investment philospophy to the SNS Funds. Asset management by the best asset manager, active management with sufficient active share and low costs. The most important pillar underpinning the policy is the outsourcing of asset management to the best party. Asset managers are often expert in one particular field for instance, property, fixed income securities or emerging nations. SBB conducts business with all these specialists. This is a different approach to the market standard. On behalf of the client, SBB is the interlocutor with the asset managers. We aim to encourage companies to improve their ethical policy and conduct. Should there be doubts concerning the ethical conduct of the company an engagement process is initiated and we actively pursue a dialogue. We guard over, analyse and monitor the agreed investment policy and the resulting return. SNS Investment Funds Management (SBB) decided in November 2009 that for virtually all SNS Investment Funds ESG criteria responsible environment, social and governance aspects should apply to investment decisions. These fundamental policy principles are identical to those applied by SNS Asset Management. 4.13 Most important memberships As well as being signatories, SNS REAAL and ASN Bank are members of UNGC Netherlands. SNS REAAL is also a member of CSR Europe, the ESBG and the WSBI. SNS Asset Management and ASN Bank are members of the Carbon Disclosure Project, about which SNS REAAL has generated publicity.

SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  9 STAKEHOLDERS 4.14 List of involved interest groups Stakeholder dialogue and influence on RB policy and reporting Shareholders/investors (including Stichting Beheer SNS REAAL), supervisory bodies, ratings agencies, analysts/journalists; clients; investor associations such as NVB and VvV; the Dutch Finance Ministry (as legal body and also in relation to state aid) Communication with shareholders via AVAs etc The CEO, CFO and the IR department maintain regular contact with national and international institutional investors. They visit investors twice a year to inform them about semi-annual and annual results. In addition, a trading update (quarterly financial update) is issued twice a year, which can be followed via the website. A so-called 'investor day' is also arranged once a year, aimed at institutional investors, to provide an update on strategy, financial performance, the capital situation and group activities. At least once a year the Executive Board holds a general meeting of shareholders. During the course of this meeting the Executive Board reports on topics including objectives, company strategy, policy and financial results. The Executive Board is also in regular contact with ratings agencies to inform them about strategy, financial performance, the situation regarding capital and group activities. The Executive Board is also in regular contact with supervisory agencies. Stakeholders are also consulted on a regular basis: the supervisory agency extremely frequently; ratings agencies around twice a year; investors, by means of roadshows twice a year; the investors once a year at the investor day; analysts and journalists on a continual basis; interest groups also on a continual basis; clients during their visits to bank shops, for instance; and the Finance Ministry as required. The new corporate website has been set up with separate sections for a variety of stakeholders be they shareholders, analysts, journalists, job seekers or other interested parties. The site also has a specfiic section for Responsible Business. The new site allows SNS REAAL to more effectively keep a variety of stakeholders informed and to communicate what the company is what it stands for. ASN Bank: ASN Bank maintains close contact with a range of stakeholders in the social and environmental field. Following are a few examples: 1 Strategic co-operations with a variety of organisations with the aim of exchanging information and arriving at common objectives. Examples of organisations with which ASN Bank co-operates are: Amnesty International, Cordaid, Oxfam Novib, the Dutch branch of Friends of the Earth (Milieudefensie), Stichting Natuur en Milieu and Greenpeace. 2 Active approaches to stakeholders in which (two-way) communication with clients both proactive and reactive is a central feature. Examples of this are annual events such as the shareholders AGM for the ASN investment funds and active information provision through the Spaarmotief magazine and the ASN Bank website. Three 'client days' were also organised in 2010. 3 The active online community www.voordewereldvanmorgen.nl where people can engage in discussion and set up initiatives to promote sustainability. While ASN Bank operates this platform as a way of bringing people together, the active participation of the bank also serves in maintaining contact with clients and those who are concerned about sustainability. The bank used the opportunity of the ASN Bank World Prize to invite clients and community members to take part in workshops aimed at those taking the initiative on sustainability topics. 4.15 Selection of interested parties SNS REAAL is in regular contact with its stakeholders. This involves contact with clients, intermediaries, employees, shareholders, suppliers and civil society organisations. Contact takes place on a regular basis but on occasion also results from specific incidents. Refer also to the chapter on Reporting in the RB Annual Report. 4.16 Nature of discussion/dialogue SNS REAAL: The dialogue differs according to stakeholder. Investors, shareholders, journalists and analysts are chiefly interested in the financial situation and the future prospects for SNS REAAL (SNS Property Finance; results; repayments to the state and the stichting); consequences of low interest rates and long-term risks; these aspects also interest supervisory agencies although their chief concern rests with ensuring compliance with legal requirements and regulations (the goal being the sound operation of financial markets and protection of clients), issues such as the client's interests occupying central place, remuneration policy, stress tests; interest groups focused on developments in the field of new legal and SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  10 regulatory requirements (Banking Code, Insurers Code; publication of the latest actuarial tables; stress tests); and with clients concerning service provision. 4.17 Results and use of information Refer also to the financial supplement in this document.

SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  13 Environmental performance indicators DEFINITIONS APPLIED Scope of environmental data Data concerning the environment are for the whole of SNS REAAL. Business waste: the total amount of waste collected, in kilograms, divided according to paper and cardboard and other waste. Data regarding business waste are based on actual weighed quantities and on collections by the waste collector based on the average weight of containers emptied. Organic catering: organic products are all those products in company restaurants which bear the EKO certification. Energy use: gigajoules of electricity, gas, heating and diesel consumed in the reporting year, in buildings and as fuel and kilometres travelled on the basis of annual calculations or from meter readings. Green electricity: the overwhelming proportion of green electricity is generated from natural and sustainable energy sources such as water and wind and not from fossil fuels or nuclear power. Paper consumption: the quanity of A4 papier, envelopes and printed materials (including bank statements and policies) purchased in the reporting year, in kilograms. Emissions of greenhouse gases: the CO2 emissions from energy use in buildings, both directly (CO2 emissions from SNS REAAL premises) and indirectly (CO2 emissions by energy companies) and from travel by company car and air travel. Water consumption: the amount of water consumed, in m3, in the reporting year for sanitation, in drinks machines, company restaurants, cleaning, fire extinguishers and air conditioning, based on meter readings. All water consumed is drawn from Dutch mains water companies. Units applied: GJ (gigajoules), kg (kilogram), FTE (full-time equivalent, refer also to P&O definitions), litre, % (percent), m3, (cubic metre). MATERIALS EN1 Total quantity of materials used according to weight and volume Paper consumption The following diagrams show SNS REAAL's paper consumption. The first figure gives total paper consumption per FTE at SNS REAAL. Paper use per FTE was reduced by 6% in 2010, from 210 kg per FTE in 2009 to 198 kg per FTE in 2010. The second figure shows total paper consumption split into three categories: copy and printer paper, envelopes and printed materials (including bank statements and policies). During 2010, 1% less copier and printer paper was purchased compared to 2009, and 8% less printed materials and bank statements. The amount of envelopes purchased in 2010 fell by 18% (374,000 kg in 2009 and 308,000 kg in 2010). The reduction in the amount of envelopes was due to an increasing number of account holders opting for electronic bank statements and by REAAL largely substituting physical mailings by e-mails.

The following diagrams show the energy used in SNS REAAL's office premises and for transport. Figure 6 presents the total energy use per FTE for SNS REAAL. Energy consumption per FTE rose 3% during 2010 to 32.44 GJ per FTE, compared to 31.49 GJ per FTE in 2009. Figure 5 shows total energy consumption broken down according to energy source. The percentage of green electricity in 2010 83% was unchanged from 2009. Use of gas, measured in GJ, increased by 10% from 40,959 GJ in 2009 to 45,192 GJ in 2010. Electricity use decreased by 18%.

Green certificates were purchased in 2008, 2009 and 2010 covering electricity use in all offices owned by SNS REAAL in order to reduce our CO2 emissions. The following diagrams show the CO2 emissions by SNS REAAL's office buildings and transport. Figure 9 shows total CO2 emissions per FTE at SNS REAAL. This reveals that CO2 emissions per FTE rose from 1,413 kg per FTE in 2009 to 1,490 kg per FTE in 2010. Compensation for CO2 emissions via the purchase of green electricity certificates has a significant impact on our CO2 footprint. Figure 8 shows total CO2 emissions according to source. Emissions in 2009 amounted to 10,627 tonnes. This increased to 10,832 tonnes in 2010. Of this, 54% can be attributed to company cars, 23% to gas consumption, 16% from electricity use, 3% due to flights and 4% from other fuels.

The following diagrams show the quantity of paper and cardboard and other business waste. Starting from 2011, 'other waste' will be broken down into at least six distinct waste streams. Figure 10 shows the total quantity of waste per FTE at SNS REAAL. In 2010, this fell significantly, to 183 kg/FTE compared to 297 kg/FTE in 2009. From 1 April 2010, waste is paid for on a per kilo basis. Prior to this, payment for waste was per container. Introduction of this new methodology means that data for waste generated in 2009 and 2010 cannot be compared side by side. In 2010, quantities of paper and cardboard waste fell compared to 2009 from a total of 1,462 tonnes in 2009 to 750 tonnes in 2010. The quantity of other waste fell from 776 tonnes in 2009 to 582 tonnes in 2010. Again, due to the new measuring methodology, amounts of other waste and paper/cardboard waste in 2009 and 2010 cannot be compared directly.

The employer is responsible for the formulation of company policy. Where possible, in operationalising the resulting policy frameworks, discussions are held as close as possible to where working activities take place particularly when this is of relevance to working conditions, procedures and working times and options concerning how work is rewarded. No policy developments. There are no specific programmes for employee participation. The organisation has a structure for consultation that involves participation (trade unions and the works council). It is the central Works Council's function to handle employee participation at organisational level and deal with matters concerning SNS REAAL as a whole. Cases that are specific to a division of SNS REAAL are dealt with by the Works Council for the division concerned. Modernisation of employee participation procedures calls for a flexible approach concerning different levels. Particular issues of concern can be dealt with by working groups comprising participatory representatives and colleagues/experts engaged on the basis of their expertise for a specified period of time. The advantage of this approach is that colleagues do not have to commit themselves for a three-year period. This lowers the threshold for becoming involved in activities related to participation. This approach also allows for expertise to be called upon on an ad hoc basis to advise on issues of concern to the Works Council. Participatory bodies can also set up sounding boards and network groups to ensure continued contact with the workfloor, concerned employees and local managers. Such groups are able to arrange meetings with colleagues and/or management representatives either on a regular basis or by topic. Briefly stated, these discussions contribute to informal exchanges of information and visions. SNS REAAL and trade union representatives met during the course of 2010 to discuss a new collective bargaining agreement (CAO) and Social Plan. The first of these sessions was an exploratory meeting. Discussions centred on important (societal) topics and developments affecting SNS REAAL's policy regarding terms and conditions of employment now and in the future. Such as the new mission, strategy and core values of SNS REAAL and the (financial) situation of the company. Topics also include developments in the employment market, sustainable deployability, flexibility, performance and working productivity. The employer and the trade unions are agreement concerning relevant developments and the leading topics for consideration. The parties plan to engage in tackling the following topics over the coming period: employment security, sustainable deployability, diversity, flexibility, health, participation and productivity. The entire employee complement (100% of FTEs) is represented in formal joint occupational welfare committees formed of employers and employees. Refer also to the annual financial report.

LA8 E ducation, training, advice, prevention, and risk-management programmes for personnel, their families and local inhabitants in connection with serious illnessess Healthcare policy can be divided into policies covering prevention, sickness absenteeism and rehabilitation. Engaging the external occupational welfare organisation Beter, has allowed SNS REAAL to fairly comprehensively elaborate its process for case management and the round the clock contract the company has with the Institute for Psychotrauma within absenteeism policy and aftercare. Additional attention was devoted to an integrated approach to prevention policy during 2010. Although there were no developments as regards policy, progress was made with implementation through the GOED BEZIG! campaign. GOED BEZIG! is the campaign SNS REAAL began in 2010 to provide an impulse to healthcare policy. It also forms part of our policy for sustainable deployability. The campaign chiefly focuses on prevention policy in line with the BRAVO lifestyle behaviour principles: being more active, stopping smoking, moderating alcohol consumption, a healthy diet and adequate relaxation. Beyond use being made of the means we already have, such as the health check and the services of the occupational welfare service, during 2010 a range of engaging activities were organised such as participation in the national stair climbing week. And to encourage a more active lifestyle for our employees we are offering opportunities for company fitness. This has been promoted by offering employees the chance of a year-long membership to fitness sessions. EDUCATION AND TRAINING LA10  verage number of hours that an employee spends on training, broken down according to category of A employee The number of hours that employees participate in training each year is not recorded, though the annual costs per employee are. Training expenditure per FTE declined slightly in 2010. This is not in contradiction to SNS REAAL's continuing commitment to maintain investment in its employees. Rather, training was organised more cost efficiently one reason being that we now work with preferred suppliers. LA11 Programmes for competence management and life-long learning SNS REAAL provides expert, professional and engaged employees with opportunities to develop their talents to the maximum extent in order to improve their performance and their deployability inside and outside of the organisation. For SNS REAAL, it remains essential to continue creating value for clients on the structural level. Crucial to this is the ongoing development of new concepts and working procedures as well as the development, exchange and retention of expertise. In recent years SNS REAAL has continued to focus on the development of its personnel. The varied range of professional training courses on offer, the Performance and Competence Evaluation cycle, the provision of generic training schemes, traineeships, and the Talent Development and Management Development programmes are examples of this. Attention focused especially on the deployabilty of personnel who were internally reassigned. Where their positions disappeared, for instance due to reorganisation, it was the task of a mobility manager and a career adviser to provide intensive support in the search for a new position within the organisation, or externally. The principle behind the Social Plan is 'from work to work'. In the course of 2010, 322 reassigned personnel moved either to a new function within or outside the organisation, or received a financial departure package. Of this group, 76 employees were re-engaged internally. With regard to sustainable effectiveness, the following range of instruments are at the disposal of employees and their managers: –– Strategic personnel planning (the impact of internal and external developments on the complement of personnel, both quantitatively and qualitatively); –– Performance and Competence Evaluation (PCB) cycle, which is our management performance cycle; –– Personal Development Plan (POP) for development and career discussions; –– Team Development Scan (the right person in the right place) –– Highlighting available talent, through 'showcasing'; –– Management Development, Talent Development, Management and Financial trainees; –– The range of training opportunities, as well as SNS REAAL's career development site. SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  28 –– Most important are individual consultations with employees regarding their deployability and career possibilities. Education and training were the most important areas of attention in 2009 in relation to the policy for sustainable deployability. In 2010, health (see below) and strategic personnel planning were the focus within this policy. Strategic personnel planning is a process for ensuring that the personnel complement as far as possible meets the need for personnel which is constantly changing under the influence of internal and external developments. A roadmap with a corresponding set of intruments for integrated personnel planning has been developed to assist managers within the organisation. The roadmap comprises two mutually-dependent tracks: the business objectives of SNS REAAL and the goals set by employees (the best use of their talents, ambition and passion). Through integrated personnel planning we can ensure that these twin tracks are intertwined in a logical fashion in order that the personnel complement as far as possible satisfies employees' needs both quantitatively and qualitatively. The performance evaluation is the point at which the tracks intersect. After the pilot projects which were conducted in 2010 have been evaluated the roadmap for integrated personnel planning will be implemented across the organisation. SNS REAAL's diversity policy is included in the company's code of conduct under the heading of 'Respect and professional conduct'. The key principle is equal treatment for everyone. Every person is unique. At SNS REAAL, we work in a respectful way with each other and with everyone together. That means being open and equal, with an eye to and appreciation for the other irrespective of nationality, culture, religious belief, gender, age or state of health. SNS REAAL's diversity policy remained unchanged during 2010. The progression of female staff to senior positions within the company is an important issue for SNS REAAL and one to which attention was devoted in 2010. By focusing attention on the percentage of women in each echelon, and on the ratio of male and female personnel in various forums (such as management teams), we ensured that this topic regularly appeared on the discussion agenda and that progress in this area was discussed. The percentage of women occupying more senior positions within the company increased during 2010. We operate no organisational-wide diversity programmes. Where there is a need for diversity programmes, these are tailormade to specific requirements.

REAAL Verzekeringen: A REAAL undertook client satisfaction research in 2010. The topics included were: 1 general level of satisfaction among private damage and life insurance clients. 2 the degree to which they would recommend their insurance company 3 client-focus 4 written communication materials 5 telephone contact with the insurer 6 process for claims payment 7 complaints procedure B REAAl also participated in the life insurance performance survey 2010 and the damage insurance performance survey 2010. Results: 1) An important finding is that REAAL has regained its position among the leaders of the life insurance market. Regarding damage insurance, the combination of attractive premium arrangements, flexibility and acceptance and a client-focused internal service lies at the heart of REAAL's success in both the private and business damage insurance market. Zwitserleven: Topics which have been the subject of research: –– Overall satisfaction of the end-user (i.e. an employee) –– Whether this client (i.e. an employee) would recommend us –– What we can do better –– The image that the end-user (i.e. an employee) has of the insurer SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  31 –– The level attention that staff internally and account managers devote to the business relationship –– Accessibility of the appropriate employee internally –– Delivering on agreements –– Speed of answering questions –– Co-operation between account management and the organisation internally –– Decision-making capabilty of staff –– Expertise of internal staff and account management –– Quality and error-free quotations and policies –– Speed and error-free administration processes –– Quality of the amendment process –– Predictability of policy duration –– Quality of claim handling payment process –– Quality of tax-related legal assistance –– Quality of marketing and training –– Product quality –– Possibilities for tailoring work to individual situations –– Attractiveness of premium structure –– Payments to intermediaries –– Operation of extranets –– User-friendliness of electronic tools –– The complete online product range –– Results from 2010 are not yet available in their entirety –– Zwitserleven scored highest in terms of general level of satisfaction and gained the highest NPS score among its peers –– Zwitserleven achieved the highest score among its peers for 'caring about the client' and was in second place with regard to 'caring about society' and 'caring for its employees' ASN Bank: On a monthly basis, each client opening an account with ASN in the previous month are asked how satisfied they are about ASN and about the process of opening the account. We also ask clients for their evaluation of our speed, clarity, whether any errors have been made and about simplicity. Clients are invited to provide ASN with any suggestions or ideas for improving service provision. In addition, clients are asked about whether they would recommend ASN (Net Promotor Score, NPS) Furthermore, a half-yearly client satisfaction survey is conducted in conjunction with SNS REAAL. This gauges the general level of client satisfaction and NPS and allows for comprehensive explanation of the scores. A number of image propositions are also presented to clients about issues which ASN regards as being extremely important. For example, trustworthiness, transparency, social responsibility. Monthly research In general, clients are extremely satisfied about ASN. Overall, ASN achieves an average score of 8.0 and its account opening process a 7.9. A substantial group of clients would recommend ASN to their family, friends and acquaintances. This is frequently reflected in practice. New clients cite these groups among the top three sources of information that they consulted in deciding to open a new account. Clients attach enormous value to the bank's sustainability policy in combination with competitive rates and good service. They are also attracted to the insights provided about what ASN achieves with their money. The most frequent response to open questions is 'Carry on doing what yoou're doing!' Happily, points for improvement are also thrown up, mostly with regard to the time involved in the process and the desire for clearer explanationn of the various steps involved in the process. Half-yearly survey With a score of 8.0, ASN enjoys a high degree of client satisfaction along with a high Net Promotor Score of 19. This is an excellent result given that most banks achieve strongly negative scores. SNS Asset Management: –– relationship managers (accessibility, engagement, proactive stand, etc) –– reporting (clarity, relevance, timeliness) –– performance (absolute and relative) –– SNS AM in general (product range, service provision) SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  32 Results Clients are satisfied about results achieved and about the information provided regarding the portfolios. Regarding the product range, there are expectations to be met and improvements can be made in the overall service provision to the client. In the latter area, clients are keen to see a more proactive stance concerning developments within the client's own field of interest.

ASN Bank: The credit provision process is based on ASN Bank's sustainable investment criteria, meaning that all financing is required to meet the sustainability criteria applied by the bank. The criteria explicitly state what the bank's investments need to satisfy. Criteria give equal importance to human rights (social) and environmental aspects. The credit department and the sustainability policy department together evaluate loans against the criteria. In 2010, sustainable investment criteria were implemented within the process for sustainable financing. Policy: ASN bank's mission is to promote sustainability within society. This is put into practice by maintaining strict investment criteria and choosing to invest only in companies and organisations that explicitly take into account people, animals and the environment. Alongside concerns about climate change and the environment, human rights also constitutes a substantial element of ASN Bank's sustainability policy. Since its establishment in 1960, ASN Bank has developed into a leader in the field of sustainable financial services and is the largest sustainable bank in the Netherlands. Just as in previous years, 2009 saw substantial growth in the number of clients and assets under management. SNS Asset Management: SNS AM imposes requirements on its investments, as formulated in the fundamental policy principles. SNS AM also manages a number of products which are screened against supplementary ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) criteria. The SNS Institutional Microfinance Fund, being a socially-focused form of investment in itself, was a difficult investment category in which to include social and environmental aspects. There was little information available. Nonetheless, SNS AM succeeded in including this screening in the selection process for suitable investments in this category. Link to fundamental business principles SNS Property Finance: SNSPF is a member of the Dutch green building council. It has no further specific policy. Environmental aspects are treated as standard issues in the permitting procedure for property development.

These principles may be further elaborated on by each of section of the company. In its principles SNS REAAL commits itself, for example, to comply with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and to the UN Global Compact. Leading risks are reported by business units each quarter via Integrity & Compliance (I&C) reporting.

During the year an increasingly higher score was achieved. Regular contact with interest groups such as those representing the elderly, and the less able, and contacts in relation to the transition of SNS Bank: Vizirus, Bartimeus and ANBO. SNS Asset Management: With a number of our clients we have entered into specific agreements about sustainability analyses in addition to an asset management contract. In addition, we have held a number of formal and informal meetings with clients in order to make this issue more concrete in connection with their implementation in investment portfolios. ASN Bank: ASN Bank maintains close contact with a range of stakeholders in the social and environmental fields. A number of examples are: 1 Strategic co-operations with various organisations with the aim of exchanging knowledge and seeking to establish common objectives. Examples of organisations with which ASN Bank works are: Amnesty International, Cordaid, Oxfam Novib, Milieudefensie, Stichting Natuur en Milieu and Greenpeace. 2 Active approaches to stakeholders in which (mutual) proactive and reactive communication with clients is central. Examples of this are annual events such as the annual general meeting of the ASN investment funds and the active provision of information via the magazine Spaarmotief and through the ASN Bank website. Three client days were also organised across the country during 2009. 3 3 The active online community www.voordewereldvanmorgen.nl (for tomorrow's world) where people can exchange views and can set up their own activities to promote sustainability. In this, ASN Bank provides a means of communication to bring people together but also plays an active role on the platform in remaining in contact with clients along with those who are sympathetic to issues related to sustainability. Via the ASN Bank World Prize, the bank iinvited clients and members of the community to participate in workshops for those arranging various initiatives. SNS Property Finance: Environmental aspects are included as standard in the permitting procedure for property development.

ACTIVE OWNERSHIP FS10  ercentage and number of companies in the portfolio with which there is communication concerning P environmental and social aspects Since the 1970s, SNS Asset Management (SNS AM) has taken social and ethical criteria into consideration in the course of investing funds from clients. Criteria concerning the environment and corporate governance were added during the 1990s, and SNS AM has developed a comprehensive approach for including ESG aspects which it has continued to develop. SNS AM now undertakes ESG research on behalf of internal and external clients, and also provides them with advice, in the field of constructive dialogue and voting. SNS AM believes that ESG selection criteria can reduce both reputational and financial risks and have the potential to promote improved performance. For these reasons this form of investment is particularly appropriate for institutional investors bearing longer-term responsibilities, such as pension funds. SNS AM has completely integrated its responsible investment profile into its investment process which comprises investment, constructive dialogue and voting. A team of economists, social scientists and environmental experts investigates and evaluates companies, institutes and countries based on environmental and social criteria and in relation to sound governance (ESG). These criteria are rooted in the fundamental business principles of SNS AM, on which SNS AM's investment decisions are based, and/or in clients' investment policy. To guarantee sound integration and understanding of our responsible investment strategy, based on these fundamental policy principles, the ESG research department regularly organises training sessions and internal meetings with other departments within SNS AM. Specifically, the following fundamental policy principles constitute the basis of the asset management services provided by SNS AM: SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  36 Aan de vermogensbeheerdiensten van SNS AM liggen de volgende Fndamentele Beleidsuitgangspunten ten grondslag: –– avoidance of the most serious violations of human rights, –– avoidance of the worst forms of child labour, –– avoidance of involvement in forced labour, –– avoidance of serious forms, –– respect for the core rights of the individual, –– avoidance of the worst forms of child labour, –– avoidance of involvement in forced labour, –– avoidance of serious forms of corruption, –– avoidance of serious forms of environmental pollution, –– no involvement in the production of weapons systems whose impacts are disproportional or which do not distinguish between military and civilian targets, –– respect for generally accepted ethical principles which apply in a humane society. ASN Bank: ASN Bank maintains close contact with a range of stakeholders in the social and environmental fields. A number of examples are: 1 Strategic co-operations with various organisations with the aim of exchanging knowledge and seeking to establish common objectives. Examples of organisations with which ASN Bank works are: Amnesty International, Cordaid, Oxfam Novib, Milieudefensie, Stichting Natuur en Milieu and Greenpeace. 2 Active approaches to stakeholders in which (mutual) communication with clients, both active and proactive, is central. Examples of this are annual events such as the annual general meeting of the ASN investment funds and the active provision of information via the magazine Spaarmotief and through the ASN Bank website. Three client days were also organised across the country during 2009. 3 The active online community www.voordewereldvanmorgen.nl (for tomorrow's world) where people can exchange views and can set up their own activities to promote sustainability. In this, ASN Bank provides a means of communication to bring people together but also plays an active role on the platform and so comes into contact with clients and those who are sympathetic to issues related to sustainability. Via the ASN Bank World Prize, the bank iinvited clients and members of the community to participate in workshops for those arranging various initiatives. The voting policy on sustainability was amended this year and further extended to additional companies. ASN Bank indicated how, in addition to the selection of its investments, it also intends to add substance to achieving its sustainability mission. Aspects which have been added include: the link between remuneration and sustainability performance; whether information concerning sustainability is included in an annual report; and supporting shareholder proposals concerning sustainability.

SNS Asset Management places specific requirements on its investments. The fundamental policy principles which SNS AM adheres to are: –– respect for the core rights of the individual, –– avoidance of the worst forms of child labour, –– avoidance of involvement in forced labour, –– avoidance of serious forms of corruption, –– avoidance of serious forms of environmental pollution, –– no involvement in the production of weapons systems whose impacts are disproportional or which do not distinguish between military and civilian targets, –– respect for generally accepted ethical principles which apply in a humane society. All products operated by SNS Asset Management meet particular responsible principles (fundamental principles). SNS Asset Management offers total solutions in the fields of fixed interest and business securities. The latest products available are the SNS Responsible Index Fund Equity US, introduced in January 2009, followed in December 2009 by the SNS Responsible Index Fund Equity Pacific. SNS Asset Management's performance shows a rising trend in its compliance with UNPRI guidelines. Implementing the guidelines takes time but SNS AM has achieved a great deal in a short period. SNS Asset Management is already ranked among the leaders as regards the most important aspects of the guidelines, such as the integration of environmental, social and governance factors in investment policy, and reporting on these issues. For other guidelines regarding the promotion and dissemination of UNPRI guidelines to other investors and to the companies in which we invest, we achieve an above average score. This places in a position to take further necessary steps. SNS AM is yet 100% compliant with the UNPRI. The current priority is on our own organisation and on reporting. Only then can we devote effort to creating awareness externally. Risk Metrics Group voted on behalf of SNS AM during shareholder meetings in the past year. RMG took ESG factors into account in its voting stance. SNS AM reports as standard (and also publicly) on its exclusions as well as on its engagement and voting activities. SNS Beleggingsfondsen Beheer (SBB): Our investment process begins with ESG criteria. We place specific demands on our investments. The fundamental policy principles which SBB applies are: –– respect for the core rights of the individual, –– not being guilty of unacceptable forms of child labour, –– avoidance of involvement in forced labour, –– avoidance of serious forms of corruption, –– avoidance of serious forms of environmental pollution, –– no involvement in the production of weapons systems whose impacts are disproportional or which do not distinguish between military and civilian targets, –– respect for generally accepted ethical principles which apply in a humane society. SBB reports as standard, and publicly, on exclusions, engagement and voting activities. ASN Bank: ASN Investment Funds manages its own specific, open sustainable voting policy and engagement policy. It also publicises its voting behaviour. ASN Bank's sustainable investment criteria (link) are specific in stating the requirements which the bank's investments must satisfy. The criteria place equal weight on human rights (social) and environmental aspects. All investments are assessed against these strict criteria that cover the entire spectrum of human rights and the environment. ASN Bank also intends to continue writing and publicising issue papers concerning investment policy on specific topics. Consultations are held periodically with SNS Asset Management's ESG research team, as are meetings with the selection committee. SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  38 REAAL: REAAL's goal is to be perceived as an accessible and approachable insurer in area of chronic illnesses. With regard to its responsible investment policy, REAAL's objective for 2011 is to further develop and improve its responsible investment policy covering questions of exclusion, voting and engagement (the green insurer). SOCIETY FS13 Points of access in thinly populated or economically deprived regions With the exception of SNS Property Finance, SNS REAAL operates exclusively in the Dutch market. This indicator is therefore of little relevance for the company's direct impact and is not reported on. FS14 Initiatives to improve the access to financial services for people with a handicap Accessibility for people with a handicap: SNS Bank: As the only bank in the Netherlands, SNS Bank has ensured since September 2009 that its website is universally accessible for those suffering from a visual impairment. The bank's website received the highest rating from Stichting Waarmerk Drempelvrij, with a score of 16 out of 16. All SNS shops have one or more internet work stations with wheelchair access where clients can arrange their banking affairs, with or without assistance from an employee. ASN Bank: ASN Bank is a 'direct' bank: all of its products are accessible and can be opened and managed via the internet or telephone. For the partially sighted and those who are less able-bodied with their hands ASN Bank provides an extra large digital pass (digipas). In addition, during 2009 ASN Bank introduced a talking digipas for the visually impaired. The website has also been updated with an audio application for people with a visual handicap. Zwitserleven: Zwitserleven introduced special invalid parking spaces and wheelchair access. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY FS15 Policy for honest design and sales of financial products and services REAAL: The product approcal process has been introduced within REAAL, involving a product development and portfolio safeguard procedure that guarantees that the design and sale of our financial services satisfies conditions including the duty of care. The most important principles in this are that the interests of the client remain central and the five promises to our clients. Products and services offered by REAAL damage insurances are accessible to all our intermediaries and all information concerning products is provided online for both intermediaries and clients. We are currently engaged in redrafting the entire range of product cards to ensure they are clearly understandable. SNS Bank: The design and sale of products is required to meet the brand values of accessibility, client-friendliness and simplicity. Every procedure and product should satisfy criteria that are laid down for the brand. Zwitserleven: –– Within Zwitserleven a particular product development process has been developed (PAP) in which all relevant disciplines are involved and whose approval is required. –– Within Zwitserleven active market teams focus on specific market segments and follow market developments and identify corresponding client requirements. This serves as the basis for initiatives leading to the introduction of new products and/or changes to existing products which are then put through the product develop process. –– Changes in legal requirements and regulations can also lead to modifications to products. These also go through the product development process. –– The product groups, in which all relevant disciplines are represented, are responsible for product specifications. SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  39 –– Alongside this, tax and legal affairs, operational and financial risk management and compliance play an important role in the process and experts in these fields provide their own judgements on a product's development. –– Within Zwitserleven a separate Product Market Pricing Committee, comprising managers and other members, decides on product development and the introduction of new products. SNS Asset Management: In the regulated environment in which SNS Asset Management operates information and transparency are extremely important. SNS Asset Management provides clients with comprehensive information prior to them deciding to purchase a particular financial service. A variety of services are also developed as a result of dialogue with (potential) clients. ASN Bank: ASN Bank's mission is expressed in six so-called business principles. All of ASN Bank's products and services must be assessible and satisfy these business principles. Business principles –– ASN Bank chooses to work together with parties who, like ASN Bank, strive to promote sustainable development. –– ASN Bank provides capital to businesses and organisations that promote a sustainable society. Companies and sectors which undermine a sustainable society are excluded from ASN Bank's activities and products. –– ASN Bank develops sustainability criteria for its products and services. –– ASN Bank evaluates each capital provision in advance against its sustainability criteria, devoting a level of attention to research that corresponds to the nature and scale of the activity. –– ASN Bank consults interested parties in establishing or substantially amending sustainability criteria. –– ASN Bank is transparent and reports on the policies it pursues. Strategic principles (steps towards realising the mission and vision) ASN Bank has the ambition and sufficient assets for it to play a leading role as a sustainable financial services provider. To this end, ASN Bank in the first instance places demands upon itself, taking into account external interests.

SNS Bank: Improving financial literacy is one of the priorities of SNS Bank's RB policy. SNS Bank believes greater accessibility to its services and straightforward products are the first steps in improving financial literacy. The bank has therefore further simplified and revamped its range of savings products and has established clear, logical and transparency pricing levels for mortgages and savings. At the same time, SNS Bank is continuing to design so-called 'do-it-yourself' products enabling clients to as far as possible manage their own banking arrangements. In addition, SNS Bank provides training in internet banking, chiefly for senior citizens. It is expected of marketing staff that they regularly lead training sessions and provide information about banking and financial independence, for instance to schools. SNS Bank is also an active participant in Weet wat je besteed!. ASN Bank: As a sustainable bank, transparency is an indispensable component of how it does business. Transparency is therefore fully integrated into business operations at both process and product level. In concrete terms, ASN Bank attaches extremely high SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  40 importance to clear and transparent communication about its products.

Clients, and potential clients, are free to request further information about a specific product (product flyers and Information Memoranda) and our sales and relationship managers are available to meet to provide additional details.

In 2010, for instance, SNS Asset Management organised a seminar (for pension funds and insurers) in conjunction with the association of investors for sustainable development (VBDO). SNS AM also participated in a meeting of SNS Investment Funds Management where further information was provided about sustainability policy. (From this year, all SNS house funds have met the terms of the fundamental policy principles). A presentation was also made at the annual European TBLI conference.

SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  41 SNS Asset Management: Since the 1970s, SNS Asset Management (SNS AM) has taken social and ethical criteria into consideration in the course of investing funds from clients. Criteria concerning the environment and corporate governance were added during the 1990s, and SNS AM has developed a comprehensive approach for including ESG aspects which it has continued to develop. SNS AM now undertakes ESG research on behalf of internal and external clients, and also provides them with advice, in the field of constructive dialogue and voting. SNS AM believes that ESG selection criteria can reduce both reputational and financial risks and have the potential to promote improved performance. For these reasons this form of investment is particularly appropriate for institutional investors bearing longer-term responsibilities, such as pension funds. SNS AM has completely integrated its responsible investment profile into its investment process which comprises investment, constructive dialogue and voting. A team of economists, social scientists and environmental experts investigates and evaluates companies, institutes and countries based on environmental and social criteria and in relation to sound governance (ESG). These criteria are rooted in the fundamental business principles of SNS AM, on which SNS AM's investment decisions are based, and/or in clients' investment policy. To guarantee sound integration and understanding of our responsible investment strategy, based on these fundamental policy principles, the ESG research department regularly organises training sessions and internal meetings with other departments within SNS AM. Specifically, the following fundamental policy principles constitute the basis of the asset management services provided by SNS AM: –– avoidance of the most serious violations of human rights, –– avoidance of the worst forms of child labour, –– avoidance of involvement in forced labour, –– avoidance of serious forms ... ????

SNS Asset Management abides by a number of fundamental policy principles concerning sustainability in arranging its investment portfolios. The principles includes areas such as human rights, child labour, forced labour, corruption, serious environmental destruction and controversial weapons, such as landmines and cluster munitions. From 1 November 2010 these principles also apply to Zwitserleven's investment funds. COMPLIANCE & NON-COMPLIANCE: FRIJNS CODE AND BANKING CODE SNS REAAL largely complies with these codes.

In relation to simplicity in money matters and simple products, client research is undertaken concerning the criterion of 'simplicity' ASN Bank: ASN Bank's three share funds are assessed for their performance with regard to climate-friendly investment. At the request of the honest banking indicator (www.Eerlijkebankwijzer.nl), ASN Bank is taking part in quantifying the performance of investments in sustainable energy and working conditions in the clothing sector. REAAL: 1 REAAL is improving its focus on the client through a programme known as Darwin. An essential component of the programme is the 'voice of the client' by means of which REAAL seeks to engage clients at an early stage concerning products and services destined for the market. We intend to achieve this by ensuring that we continually listen to SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  43 clients and internally translate the wishes and needs of our clients and intermediaries into our new products, services and service provision. The first client panel sessions were held in April 2010. 2 During 2010 REAAL was also involved in the client satisfaction survey concerning life insurance and injury insurance. The research focuses on three distinct groups of clients: a New clients: those who purchased a policy less than 18 months ago b Existing clients c Clients who have submitted claims (concerning damage/injury), and clients who have received payouts (life insurance). Zwitserleven: –– Zwitserleven toetst haar producten en diensten aan de interne en externe richtlijnen en wet-en regelgeving. –– Zwitserleven streeft naar een VO-benchmark voor pensioenproducten en heeft hiervoor contact opgenomen met betreffende instanties. SNS AM SNS AM 'measures' all of its investments by screening them against the fundamental policy principles. And, via engagement, we attempt to achieve an impact for ESG; namely, we are committed to improving companies' policy and behaviour. On a relatively frequent basis, research is conducted into the social effect of our investments in the field of impact investing, such as microfinancing. A concrete example of this is the development of a scorecard for microfinancing funds which helps during screening of responsible conduct by microfinancing institutions. The UNPRI survey devotes considerable attention to this best practice. The text from the report is reproduced here. SNS REAAL GRI Table Responsible Business Annual Report 2010  44
