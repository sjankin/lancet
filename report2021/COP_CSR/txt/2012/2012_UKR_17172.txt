The document is available in Ukrainian, Russian and English. • BDO is studying the Business Principles for Countering Bribery issued by Transparency International (http://www.transparency.org) and will evaluate possible integration with the existing RMM to provide a even stronger foundation to counter bribery in all business transactions. Going forward, we will continue to maintain zero tolerance for corruption and to work against it in all its forms.
