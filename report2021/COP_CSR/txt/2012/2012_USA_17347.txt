PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 6 Supply Chain Management Promega values suppliers of goods and services that adhere to the highest social, ethical and environmental standards. In 2011, Promega took the first step in expanding the reach of Corporate Responsibility by surveying our key suppliers to understand their social and environmental commitments. A survey was sent to quantify the number of vendors with formal programs, their key areas of focus, and to identify contacts within each organization. Of the vendors that responded to our survey, over 50% have Sustainability or Corporate Responsibility programs established or in development. Promega recognizes the impact and importance that our suppliers have in the scope of our Corporate Responsibility and strives to work with companies that have similar commitments. Sourcing from local suppliers is also a focus to support local communities and reduce impacts from shipping. Promega acknowledges the opportunity to reduce impacts through our global supply chain. In the coming year we will start collaborating with key suppliers to identify ways to improve our impacts and add mutual business value. Creative Approach Although meticulous and rational, scientists must also maintain imagination in Leadership their work if they are to discover the mysteries of the unknown. In response to the needs of such individualists, we have a long and creative tradition of doing Innovation what is best versus what is expected. That independent spirit and determination Paradigm Shift has led to a number of firsts that continue for Promega in each of its multiple roles as a business, a member of the community and an employer. Integration Today, Promega is the largest privately held life science company in the world, an Throughout business processes accomplishment of which we are very proud. In an environment where acquisition is the norm, we have maintained independence and instead forged selective, global partnerships. An example of this is the collaboration between Promega Continuous Improvement What you measure will improve and the experts in mass spectrometry at MS Bioworks. This partnership provides researchers access to a complete workflow solution, by providing unique proteomic reagents coupled with mass spectrometry services. Compliance Meeting requirements Promega embraces the values of corporate responsibility through all aspects of operations and supply chain and strives toward leadership.

Genetics of Taste Lab Central at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science is researching a gene called Taster 38, which determines whether an individual can taste a particular bitter substance. The lab is asking if the differences in the way individuals taste affect food choices, with possible implications on health and lifestyle. Volunteer Citizen Scientists work in the lab on the Genetics of Taste project. Visitors to the museum can enroll into the project by completing a few steps including providing a DNA sample. The Citizen Scientists use the Maxwell® 16 to purify DNA rapidly. The Maxwell® 16 provides ease of use and streamlined results for the lab. Lab Central’s goal is to bring awareness to the public to help people make healthier life style choices.

For the first time since tracking global waste and recycling, 140,000 More Recycling Promega is recycling more than we are sending to the landfill. Since 2008, Cubic Feet Than to Landfill 120,000 recycling efforts globally have increased by 31% as a result of improved awareness and convenience for recycling at all Promega locations.

In 2012, Promega Biosciences will be initiating a composting program that will further reduce waste being sent CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL to the landfill. Being in the biotech industry, manufacturing processes often require work with potentially hazardous substances. Promega takes the responsibility that comes with the use of these products seriously as well as the obligation to reduce waste while ensuring that, at the end of their life, these products are disposed of 10579MA responsibly. As a result of focus on efficiency, Promega has seen a 10% reduction 2008 2011 in waste as indexed to revenue. Promega recognizes the value of absolute reduction in waste stream and will continue to regularly analyze hazardous waste reduction opportunities. PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 18 Water Usage Promega recognizes the value water provides to all life on this planet and the fact that billions of people each year go without clean water. Many Promega locations worldwide incorporate design features to minimize water use and insure proper disposal of water. The corporate park of offices in Sydney, Australia, uses rain water collected for cleaning, toilets, and irrigation of plants. Similarly, our Madison-based global headquarters building uses rainwater collection, allowing runoff to drain to prairie and rain gardens for natural filtration. Promega is committed to responsible water use from all sources whether used in manufacturing processes, landscaping, or daily office activity. With the increase in water-intensive manufacturing processes since 2010, reduction in water usage poses an ongoing challenge. In 2011, Promega realized a 4% reduction in water usage when indexed to revenue as a result of ongoing diligence and new efforts. Promega Biosciences’ “Green Team” in San Luis Obispo, CA made significant steps to reduce water usage in 2011 primarily through an optimized irrigation schedule and implementation of a water recirculating system for distilled water units. In the new system condensing water is re-used rather than sent down the sewer. Over the last year water usage is down 30% saving over Global Water Usage 250,000 gallons of water. 200,000,000 Promega Biosystems in Sunnyvale, CA, also 15,000,000 Gallons of Water continues to look to GOAL reduce water use through 63.3 63.8 661.1 1 57.5 10,000,000 55.7 low-flow aerators on every 4 Reduction % sink and a new dishwasher Indexed to Revenue that is more water and 5,000,000 energy efficient. 10629MA 0 2008 2011 2014 PROMEGA CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2011 19 Packaging 2011 Packaging Breakdown by Spend Packaging serves many functions for our products, but it also is a primary consumer of raw materials. Promega recognizes the impact of our packaging and is Paper Aluminum committed to searching for innovative ways to reduce packaging, use environmenGlass tally friendly materials, and design for recycling or reuse. Polystyrene One recent step to improve our impacts was moving to unbleached shipping Plastics boxes. This step has been completed at all global logistics hubs to avoid the Corrugated harmful environmental impacts of bleaching corrugate. Unbleached corrugate uses less virgin wood, less energy, and produces fewer waste and air emissions than bleached corrugate. For shipments out of North America we were also able to use Sustainable Forestry Initiative materials to minimize impacts further. To take this initiative even further a team of individuals at our Corporate HeadPaperboard quarters set out to look for an alternative to the wax coating on some of our boxes. While initial testing was unsuccessful we are currently working with other resources outside of Promega to identify a solution. This change will allow shipping boxes, which were not previously recyclable due to wax coating, to be Labels recycled. These recent strides follow a long history of efforts to reduce the 10645MA impacts of packaging such as: • Funding a program for over 20 years enabling customers to return Styrofoam® containers for reuse to minimize waste in landfills. In 2011, over 14,000 polystyrene containers were recycled and re-used. • In 2012, Promega partnered with the Packaging Engineering Department at the California Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo to identify ways to implement more sustainable packaging and maintaining quality during transport. Capturing environmental impacts of product and shipment packaging continues to be challenging. Maintaining the critical need to adequately protect products while minimizing the use of packaging is a delicate task. An initial cost analysis indicated that plastic encompasses about half of the packaging purchases yet corrugate for shipping, as well as paperboard used in product packaging, represent our best opportunity for reducing environmental impact. Following transition to a new ERP we will have richer data allowing for quantification of the amount of materials used, providing the ability to develop a comprehensive packaging impact baseline.
