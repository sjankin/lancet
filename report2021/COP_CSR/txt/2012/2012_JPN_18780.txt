Editorial Policy This report has integrated Astellas’ Annual Report with its CSR report. Until now, these two reports had been published separately. We decided to merge these two publications as a means of deepening stakeholders’ understanding of our business activities and CSR-based management, which is the base for those activities. The information contained in this Annual Report 2012 is organized according to the five fields of CSR-based management, namely, the economy, employees, society, the environment, and compliance. Please note that content related to employees concerning aspects such as the work environment and human rights, which would normally be found under “Society,” have been included in the “Employees” field. Similarly, content related to the value chain is included under “CSR Initiatives in Business Processes” in the “Economy” field. The basic purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the activities of Astellas Pharma Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries worldwide in fiscal 2011, which covers the period from April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012. The figures indicated in the fiscal 2011 status report for the field of “Environment,” however, present the results for fiscal year 2011 (April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012) in Japan and the calendar year 2011 (January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011) for overseas operations as a combined total. In each instance where the period or scope of particular content varies from these parameters, we have provided clarification. We have used charts, photographs, and other visual aids to make the report easy to understand so that it may aid communication between the Company and its many stakeholders. Note about forward-looking statements and forecasts Statements made in this annual report with respect to current plans, estimates, strategies and beliefs and other statements of Astellas that are not historical facts are forwardlooking statements about the future performance of Astellas.

Consequently, undue reliance should not be placed on these statements.

Astellas Pharma Inc. Annual Report 2012 069 Global Warming Prevention Framework and Initiatives Astellas recognizes that global warming could become an even greater obstacle to the continuation of corporate activities in the future. Accordingly, Astellas has positioned measures to address this problem as a key management priority. By establishing medium-term targets for global warming prevention in its Environmental Action Plan, Astellas actively promotes reduced energy consumption by existing facilities and strategic investments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Global Warming Prevention Framework Measures for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions Considered by Astellas Astellas believes that it will not be possible to achieve the level of greenhouse gas emission reductions demanded Energy conservation Green chemistry, etc. of private enterprises by simply continuing with existing energy conservation measures implemented independently by each facility. Consequently, in fiscal 2009 Technological Astellas established the Global Warming Prevention Committee as a special task force under the CSR Committee, which is chaired by a member of top management.
