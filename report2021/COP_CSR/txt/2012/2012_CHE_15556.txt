Zurich, 6 March 2012 PricewaterhouseCoopers AG Gerd Tritschler David Pritchett Syngenta Corporate Responsibility Performance 2011 5 Resource efficiency in Corporate Responsibility agriculture & stewardship Performance 2011 Helping growers use limited natural resources efficiently and make the best use of their inputs is key to increasing farm productivity and building sustainable rural economies. Educating growers is critical to ensure they can use our products effectively, profitably and – above all – safely. This is part of our wider stewardship efforts throughout the lifecycle of our products. Resource efficiency in agriculture Highlights ––Operation Pollinator®, MARGINS and Multifunctional Landscapes are examples of Syngenta projects designed to optimize the use of natural resources alongside productive agriculture. Running in 13 European countries with over 2,000 hectares of managed biodiversity and about 2,500 farmers, these projects doubled in scale from 2009 to 2011 ––Heliosec®, Syngenta’s bio-purification system, provides an easy and safe solution for managing water contaminated during the cleaning of application equipment.

More information on our approach and our investments is reported in the strategy, R&D and growers’ needs sections where future product pipeline highlights for every key crop are also listed. Syngenta recognises that resource efficiency needs to be integrated at scale through farm management training, and safe-use programs. One example is minimum tillage, which reduces soil erosion by using crop protection products, as an alternative to extensive ploughing, to control weeds. Other practices include introducing multifunctional field margins on river banks to prevent run off of chemicals into watercourses.

By focussing on the most effective programs we increased the relative amount spent in 2011 by 20 percent while the number of programs decreased. 6 Syngenta Corporate Responsibility Performance 2011 Resource efficiency in agriculture & stewardship Corporate Responsibility continued Performance 2011 Stewardship Highlights ––Over 200 million farmers trained since 2000 on safe use of crop protection products in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture in China ––10th anniversary of the Syngenta Pequeño Agricultor de Syngenta (PAS) program to promote sustainable intensification of farming for smallholders and our Stewardship for Life safe use program in Latin America; so far PAS has reached around 360,000 farmers with advice and training ––More than 10 million farmers trained in safe use and secure storage over the last three years Performance Number of people trained by Syngenta total vs. per program m 000s 4.5 48 50 4.0 3.2 40 3.5 36 3.0 2.9 2.2 30 2.5 18 2.0 20 1.5 Total number of people directly trained 1.0 10 Number of people 0.5 directly trained per Syngenta program 0 0 2009 2010 2011 Safe use and disposal We provide training for growers around the world to ensure safe and effective use of our crop protection products, using local partners to tailor our approach. In 2011, our training in safe use reached almost 2.9 million people and there were 61 active training programs. By deciding to focus on the most effective programs and the completion of our televised training pilot, we reduced the total number of people that account for being trained directly through Syngenta. Together with strong partners we concentrate on scalable programs tailored to farmer’s needs in the regions. For example, in North America our Syngenta team is strongly promoting proactive, national pesticide stewardship education, regardless of whose pesticide is being used. In China, we have worked with the Ministry of Agriculture to train over 200 million farmers on safe use since 2000. In Australia, our annual SPRAY AWARDS® emphasise the need for safe application of pesticides. Our ”Stewardship for Life” safe use training has reached over 360,000 growers over the last decade. Our online resource centre – www.stewardshipcommunity.com – provides growers with a forum for discussion and a wide range of materials on best practices. Syngenta is also collaborating with the international industry organization CropLife to encourage responsible use and storage of crop protection products in India and to address the issue of obsolete stocks of pesticides in Africa. Product Stewardship 2009 2010 2011 Number of countries participating in adverse health incident management system 50 84 84 Syngenta Corporate Responsibility Performance 2011 7 Resource efficiency in agriculture & stewardship Corporate Responsibility continued Performance 2011 It takes robust data to continuously improve our stewardship efforts. We promote reporting of adverse health incidents as a result of exposure to crop protection products and in 2011, a total of 84 countries used Syngenta’s adverse health management system. We also train medical personnel on how to deal with pesticide related health incidents. In Argentina, for example, we have trained over 1,200 doctors on how to treat pesticide-related incidents over the past five years through a national toxicology center known as TAS. Building on this success, we have implemented similar medical training programs in China, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. Product stewardship – biotechnology and regulatory compliance 2009 2010 2011 Number of employees completing regulatory compliance training 1,177 1,593 2,044 Number of trial locations requiring a permit 471 435 406 Number of trial inspections performed by Syngenta1 189 237 155 1 2011 decrease due to more efficient inspection schedule Stewardship from the start of the product lifecycle Our focus on safety and the environment begins right at the start of our products’ lifecycle. We rigorously comply with strict regulations on biotechnology in the development of geneticallymodified (GM) crops and follow a quality management system modelled on the international ISO 9001 standard. In 2011, we trained 2,044 employees and contractors on regulatory compliance. This 28 percent increase from 2010 reflects the rising number of Crop Protection employees now involved in biotechnology field trials as a result of the integration with the Seeds business. The experience, knowledge and risk awareness of our employees has led to a high level of compliance on our seed sites. This has allowed us to reduce the number of inspections of field trials to monitor compliance by 35 percent.

We also invest in the communities where we operate and in developing markets to promote their sustainable development. Highlights ––14 percent increase in our direct economic contributions to employees, governments and communities ––2001 – 2011: Ten years anniversary of the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture ––Agronomic knowledge sharing through the second annual Syngenta Connections program, linking organizations, institutions and growers throughout the Asia Pacific Our economic contribution Performance Our economic contribution 1 Consists of income and other taxes paid, excluding VAT (included in Payments to suppliers) and employment-related taxes (included in Employee wages and benefits) 2 Consists of expenditures for dividends, share repurchases (excluding those for employee share plans) and interest on debt 3 In 2011 US$0.8 million from resource efficient programs We use our core capabilities to add value to the economies of the countries and communities in which we operate. By delivering innovative agricultural products and technologies, we build sustainable and productive agricultural systems and strong rural economies – integral components to meeting the world’s growing demand for food. We share our experience, technology and products with rural communities so that farmers can improve their incomes and their standard of living, making them true stewards of the land. Syngenta also contributes to the creation and distribution of economic value through the products and services we purchase from suppliers, the wages and benefits we offer employees, the taxes we pay to governments, the payments to providers of capital, our capital expenditure and community investments. Syngenta Corporate Responsibility Performance 2011 9 Economic value shared Corporate Responsibility continued Performance 2011 Our economic contribution is enhanced by our investments in communities, and our promotion of sustainable development, both of which target areas relevant to our business such as efficient use of resources. We tailor our community investment projects according to local needs. In 2011, we invested US$18 million in community programs focusing on water, land use efficiency, biodiversity conservation, access to technology, health and nutrition, and science and education. Much of this support is channelled through the Syngenta Foundation. In the 2011 Syngenta Connections program a group of Australian agriculture university students ran farm sustainability workshops with almost 500 East Javanese farmers. The program aims to link organizations, institutions and growers throughout the Asia Pacific. In 2010, the inaugural project saw a dozen students work with rice growers in India. Bringing farming closer to a wider set of stakeholders is one of the driving forces behind our INTERRA farms in Europe. These farms are on the one hand used as centers of expertise to give local farmers the latest information on a full range of responsible farming practices and environmental stewardship, and on the other hand an opportunity for researchers, schoolchildren, and policy makers, to learn first-hand how farming creates value for the farmer, society and the environment.

To recognize the contribution our employees make to our business, we offer attractive conditions, great development opportunities and a stimulating working environment. Our compensation practices are flexible and competitive, aligned with the market conditions in our different locations globally. We reward our employees’ performance. Our performance management system emphasizes the need for coaching and development alongside appraisal. Incentive award programs are based on company and individual performance indicators and support our global strategy and culture. 12 Syngenta Corporate Responsibility Performance 2011 People Corporate Responsibility continued Performance 2011 For instance, the Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) is an instrument that allows Swiss employees to become Syngenta shareholders by purchasing shares at a preferential price. All employees in Switzerland, including members of the Executive Committee, are eligible to participate in the ESPP. Shares purchased under the ESPP are subject to a blocking period of three years. Under the Swiss ESPP, participants can purchase shares for 50 percent of the share value at the date of grant up to a maximum share value of CHF 5,000. 46 percent out of the 16,872 entitled employees executed this right in 2011. Long-Term Incentive (LTI) is an important element of the compensation of members of the Executive Committee and selected senior managers, and is designed to reward leadership, innovation and performance. It provides participants with 3-year restricted stock-based incentives that link the potential amount of total compensation to Syngenta’s market value (share price). In 2011 1,047 employees participated in the LTI plan a slight increase of 2 percent compared to 2010.

We do not tolerate discrimination on any grounds and ensure that our diversity policies provide fair treatment for all employees. Syngenta aims for the highest internationally-acknowledged benchmarks of fairness, honesty and integrity. Our strong commitment to comply with national and international labor laws is set out in our Syngenta Labor Standards. The proportion of women in the company remained constant at 32 percent.

We are committed to ensuring our people understand our purpose and strategy and the role they play in delivering it. People development is a key to our success. Our Performance Management process includes objective setting, development planning, feedback and formal reviews. Achievement against personal performance objectives is tied to our annual incentive programs. Each employee meets with their line manager at least once a year to discuss their performance against agreed objectives and their individual development plan which is tailored to their talents and needs. Our business grows and develops with our employees. In 2011, we invested US$30.6 million in training and development programs to help our people achieve their full potential – equivalent to US$1,161 per employee. We assess development needs in each of our markets through local learning and development groups, and tailor our approach accordingly. Examples of development programs we ran in 2011 include a new leadership program to promote collaboration across boundaries in cooperation with the Center for Creative Leadership, the extension of our Marketing and Sales Excellence (MaSE) program and the establishment of our three-part agronomics program. 14 Syngenta Corporate Responsibility Performance 2011 People Corporate Responsibility continued Performance 2011 Health and safety Performance Health and safety 2009 2010 2011 Recordable injury and illness rate (IIR) per 200,000 hours1, 2 0.42 0.41 0.44 Recordable injury rate per 200,000 hours1, 2 0.38 0.39 0.39 EAME3 0.47 0.43 0.38 North America 0.58 0.75 0.99 LATAM 0.19 0.22 0.20 APAC 0.19 0.18 0.17 Recordable occupational illness rate per 200,000 hours1 0.03 0.02 0.05 EAME3 0.05 0.01 0.05 North America 0.06 0.06 0.16 LATAM 0.03 0.00 0.00 APAC 0.00 0.01 0.01 First aid cases 712 820 798 1 According to US OHSA definition for injuries and illness 2 2010 data corrected due to six late recordables after closing of the reporting year 3 Including headquarter (Switzerland) Maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for employees is integral to our success. We expect every employee to adhere to the standards, codes of practice and guidance outlined in our Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) management system. We communicate these expectations through our intranet, training and site visits, and carefully monitor performance at all our sites worldwide. All incidents must be reported every month through our HSE Performance Reporting System. We aim to maintain leading health and safety performance in our industry and set a clear goal to keep our Injury and Illness Rate (IIR) below 0.5 per 200,000 employee hours. In 2011, the IIR remained within this target at 0.44. The total number of occupational health cases increased from six to 19 in 2011 and the recordable illness rate rose to 0.05 per 200,000 hours worked. This increase is largely due to specific events affecting several individuals, including incidents of photo-dermatitis as a result of clearing wild parsnips in the UK and allergic reactions to pollinating flowers leading to rhinitis at our newly acquired site in Gilroy, US. In November 2011 we were saddened by the accidental death of an employee at our Monthey facility in Switzerland. We have conducted an internal investigation into the causes of the accident. The Swiss authorities have also conducted an investigation.

In Kenya, for example, we ran a two-month HIV/AIDS awareness campaign in 2011. We made counselling available and over 370 employees volunteered to be tested for HIV. Additionally we are continuously fostering new safety initiatives to further improve motor vehicle and driving safety in Asia. We also encourage our people to maintain a healthy, balanced lifestyle. We offer a range of locally tailored programs to enhance wellbeing, including sports centers, healthy options at staff restaurants, health checks, family counselling and legal advice.

We monitor, measure and identify opportunities to reduce these impacts using our robust environmental management system. Local targets enable sites to focus on the areas where they can achieve the biggest reductions. We report environmental data in absolute terms and normalized to US$EBIT1 to better relate our performance in these areas to value creation. 1 Excluding restructuring and impairment Highlights ––7 percent reduction in energy use (MJ/US$EBIT) compared to 2010 ––8 percent reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e/US$EBIT) compared to 2010 ––8 percent reduction in water consumption (liters/US$EBIT) compared to 2010 ––Extension and improvement of our data collection system by including further 10 seed sites in 2011 Energy efficiency Performance Energy consumption TJ MJ/US$EBIT 8,707 10,000 8,334 8,031 4.50 3.79 4.36 4.08 4.40 8,000 4.30 4.20 6,000 4.10 Gas 4.00 Electricity 4,000 3.90 Steam 3.80 Oil 2,000 3.70 Others 3.60 Energy consumption 0 3.50 relative to 2009 2010 2011 US$EBIT Reducing operational energy consumption is critical to help us cut associated greenhouse gas emissions. Our energy strategy encourages sites to monitor energy use, identify and implement opportunities to improve efficiency, and share best practice across the company. Our total energy use in 2011 was 8,707 TJ, an 8 percent increase from 2010 in absolute terms due to increased production, however energy use per US$EBIT decreased by 7 percent to 3.79 MJ/US$EBIT. Energy from renewable sources comprised 17 percent of our total electricity use. In 2011 Syngenta improved reporting on gas and steam energy use at Swiss sites. These sites now report the steam they purchase and not the natural gas used to produce this steam. As a result the use of natural gas was reduced by 5 percent and steam consumption increased by 54 percent and energy from other sources rose by 23 percent, also driven by increased production. Local teams are responsible for improving energy efficiency at each site. In 2011, 19 of our manufacturing sites had set energy targets, representing more than 66 percent of our total energy use. Depending on the site level requirements, different energy-saving initiatives, such as coolers that shut down when the outside temperature drops, and sensors that switch off lights in unoccupied offices are in place. Syngenta Corporate Responsibility Performance 2011 17 Environment Corporate Responsibility continued Performance 2011 GHG emissions Performance Directly and indirectly controlled CO2 equivilant emissions 000s tonnes kg/US$EBIT 1,452 0.76 1,396 1,600 1,304 0.8 0.61 0.66 1,400 0.7 1,200 0.6 1,000 0.5 800 0.4 600 0.3 Directly controlled CO2e emissions 400 0.2 Indirectly controlled CO2e emissions 200 0.1 CO2e emissions relative to US$EBIT 0 0 2009 2010 2011 Controlling greenhouse gas emissions is a priority to enable us to grow our business while reducing our impact on climate change. In 2011, we continued to work towards our established target to reduce emissions relative to earnings before interest and tax (US$EBIT) by 40 percent by 2012 compared with the 2006 baseline. Our total greenhouse gas emissions increased by 7 percent to 1.4 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent (CO2e) in 2011, due to increased production and distribution activities as well as improved reporting on indirect emissions. Emissions relative to US$EBIT continued to decline, decreasing by 8 percent compared with 2010 to 0.61 kg/US$EBIT. This is equivalent to a 34 percent reduction from the 2006 baseline, and we are on track to meet our 40 percent reduction target by the end of 2012. Scope 1 emissions, including those resulting from our own operations and company vehicles, declined by 15 percent in 2011. Scope 2 emissions from the energy we purchase to run our operations increased by 24 percent. This increase in 2011 is partly due to an increase in production, but also because we changed the way we report on gas and steam energy use at Swiss sites. These sites now report the steam they purchase and not the natural gas used to produce this steam. As a result, these emissions are now reported as Scope 2 (indirect emissions from energy we purchase externally) instead of Scope 1 (direct emissions from our own operations). Scope 3 emissions associated with the distribution of our products went up by 31 percent due to an increase of the distribution activities and minor changes in the transportation mix. We strive to reduce emissions arising from transport associated with sourcing raw materials and moving products to our customers. A key focus is to shift distribution away from roads to rail. CO2 emissions arising from rail transport are some 90 percent lower than truck transport. Although employee travel emissions are very low in relation to the overall emissions, company policy is to limit business travel whenever possible. We request our travel agency to continue improving the data it provides. In 2011 the number of countries included in the data collection increased from 23 to 42, resulting in an increase of Scope 3 emissions from employee travel. Greenhouse gas emissions also arise from our outsourced activities, such as suppliers. We are actively supporting the WRI/WBCSD protocol to properly measure and capture the greenhouse gas emissions in our supply chain. We work with our suppliers to improve their data collection systems and help reducing their carbon footprint. 18 Syngenta Corporate Responsibility Performance 2011 Environment Corporate Responsibility continued Performance 2011 Climate change and carbon footprint Performance 2011 Greenhouse gas emissions (CO2e in 000s tonnes) The diagram above illustrates our carbon footprint at each stage of our products’ lifecycle: from supply chain to production through to use by growers. We distinguish between direct emissions from our own operations and indirect emissions from purchased electricity, business travel, and distribution of products. Where we cannot accurately quantify the impact of emissions outside our control – from our suppliers and on customers’ farms – we indicate their footprint. Based on these figures and estimates, we strongly believe that the overall carbon footprint of our products is positive. Helping farmers increase resource efficiency on the farm, by using less land, less energy, less water, to grow higher and better yields is the single most important activity to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Syngenta contributes to this by developing tailored solutions that allow farmers all around the world, large and small, to adapt to changing climates, reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and maximize the potential of their land. As part of ongoing environmental management programs, and in response to an increasing number of requests from customers and external agencies for carbon footprint information about its products, Syngenta initiated a program to work on carbon footprinting together with ERM (Environmental Resources Management) in 2010. ERM confirmed that the challenge for Syngenta in reducing its carbon footprint is that a considerable proportion of the footprint is outside Syngenta’s operational control. Beyond Syngenta’s own efficiency initiatives, significant opportunities for reductions can be found through engaging with suppliers to identify low carbon options, as well as securing the benefits of supplier carbon management initiatives.

Nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulates and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are also released by our manufacturing sites. Our aim is to limit these emissions and improve air quality through systematic local programs. Nitrogen oxides increased by 10 percent as a result of higher production volumes. Non-halogenated VOCs rose by 47 percent as a result of new measurements and technical difficulties in a device designed to reduce emissions at one site in Switzerland. In 2011, we reduced emissions of halogenated VOCs by 40 percent as a result of production modifications, and emissions of hydrochloric acid by 26 percent, sulfur dioxide by 13 percent and particulates by 7 percent due to a reduction of heavy fuel usage in APAC.

The most significant contribution we can make to reducing global water use is to help growers conserve water by developing innovative products and promoting sustainable agriculture techniques. Our total water withdrawal in 2011 was 30.8 million cubic metres, an increase of 7 percent in absolute numbers from the previous year. This is largely due to the addition of data from new seed sites which use significant amounts of irrigation water. Relative to US$EBIT, however, this translates into a 8 percent reduction compared to 2010. Origin of Water 2011 Surface fresh water 72% Underground water 19% Drinking water from municipal network 8% Recovered rain water 1% Saline water 0% Surface fresh water accounts for most (around 72 percent) of the water we use. By carefully monitoring consumption, using direct measurements where meters are available, we can identify opportunities to cut water use. Local initiatives to conserve water at our sites include recycling condensation from air conditioning units and installing low-flush toilets.

The majority (60 percent) of hazardous waste was incinerated under controlled high‑temperature conditions to ensure safe disposal. We use obsolete seeds as renewable energy in cement kilns or as a component in alcohol production. We achieved a 29 percent reduction in non-hazardous waste – including plant waste – in 2011 with the year’s total reaching 94,500 tonnes. Around 68 percent of non-hazardous waste was recycled, up from 57 percent in 2010. There was a significant decline in inert waste from demolition work as well as lower volumes of obsolete treated seeds and less organic waste. In addition, seed by‑products sold for feed in the United States are no longer classified as waste. Overall we decreased in 2011 our total waste relative to US$EBIT by 24 percent from 0.17 kg/US$EBIT in 2010 to 0.13 kg/US$EBIT. Minimizing waste is high priority for our site management. Site managers submit their site targets and action plans to global operations. In 2011, 16 of our manufacturing sites had set waste reduction targets.

In 2011 we continued our awareness campaigns. All reports received through the Compliance Helpline are taken seriously and are appropriately investigated. Also, we do not tolerate any retaliation against employees who submit a report or the deliberate misuse of the Compliance Helpline. Compliance and risk management is everybody’s responsibility. We have established processes to train and support our employees on compliance matters. At the end of 2011, we completed the training of 62 percent of our employees on our Code of Conduct through online courses. New employees receive their own copy of the Code and complete e-learning training when they join the company. Syngenta Corporate Responsibility Performance 2011 23 Compliance Corporate Responsibility continued Performance 2011 Internal controls help monitor our performance. Our global team of compliance officers works directly with managers around the world to ensure the implementation of consistent policies and guidelines. These managers comprise representatives from legal, financial compliance, risk management, corporate responsibility, security, health, safety and environment. In 2011, Syngenta launched new global anti-bribery, gifts and entertainment, and anti-fraud policies. These address bribery in both the public and private sectors, and prohibit facilitation payments. Charitable contributions, sponsorships, donations, and political contributions are also addressed. The policies are cascaded through Syngenta’s management to all employees, and face-to-face training is provided to selected employee groups.

We assess suppliers against our global minimum standards for health, safety, environment, labor and human rights. In 2011, our HSEQ team assessed 97 chemical suppliers: six in EAME, five in North America, 25 in LATAM and 61 in APAC. We recorded a further improvement in suppliers’ average observed HSE performance for the ninth consecutive year, and extended the scope of our HSE support for our most important suppliers to include process risk assessment. In addition, we carried out 129 HSEQ assessments at warehouse and logistics service providers to ensure compliance with our standards. We also assess seed supply farms using the methodology developed with the Fair Labor Association (FLA), which focuses on health and safety, child labor (below 15 years old), awareness of workers’ rights, wages and benefits, work hours, harassment and abuse, and discrimination. In 2011 we were able to extend the program to more seed suppliers in Brazil, Argentina and Romania. This means that in total – together with the Indian program – the number of seed supply farms included in the program amounted to 16,880 by the end of 2011. In parallel the FLA conducted independent audits of our supply seed farms, including farm visits, document checks, and interviews with workers and growers. Each of these audits lasted three days and was timed to coincide with peak production seasons when the risk of non-compliance is greatest. In 2011, the findings of the FLA and Syngenta audits were again broadly consistent in highlighting health and safety as areas of concern, as well as a number of cases where wages were below minimum levels. In addition, the FLA detected cases of child labor, most of which were on farms of growers who are first time producers in our supply chain. In order to address this Syngenta is undertaking corrective actions targeted at strengthening the awareness program among its new growers. Syngenta consults with the FLA to develop detailed remediation plans in response to the audit findings. Records are published on the FLA website. 24 Syngenta Corporate Responsibility Performance 2011 Compliance Corporate Responsibility continued Performance 2011 Animals in research Performance Animal welfare 2009 2010 2011 Number of audits performed in contract laboratories 3 6 8 Number of instances of non-compliance found 0 0 0 Syngenta uses alternatives to animal research wherever possible.

Each of our sites measures and monitors its environmental impacts, and reports data to group and regional HSE managers. Performance data is reviewed quarterly by the Compliance and Risk Management Committee, and annually by the Syngenta Executive Committee and the Board-level Corporate Responsibility Committee. Unplanned releases from our chemical manufacturing activities are a particular concern and we allocate significant resources to prevent them. In 2011, for the third consecutive year, there were no unplanned releases from any of our sites.
