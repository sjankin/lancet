Our customers sell our products to the end consumer, who enjoys our brands. The vast majority of consumers drink alcohol responsibly and in moderation. Irresponsible or excessive consumption can cause problems with health, anti-social behavior and drinking and driving.

In fiscal 2011, we started to review our blue agave supply chain in Mexico. We started by visiting three of our main blue agave suppliers to introduce our Responsible Sourcing program and to encourage them to join Sedex. The visits included agave plantations to see the harvesting in operation. In a similar way to sugarcane production, agave production is characterized by significant manual labor and our visits intended to provide more insight into workplace standards.
