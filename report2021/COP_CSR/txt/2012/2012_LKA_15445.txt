This conformance mandates adherence to many highly desirable standards, environment.” ranging from biodiversity and environment conservation and land use to ethical business practices. The Company has also adopted a new logo, the image complementing its dedication to sustainable business. The rubber plantations in the Yatiyantota-Bulathkohupitiya region produce several varieties of Crepe Rubber and Centrifuged Latex at its plant in Kiriporuwa Estate. Sole Crepe from Dewalakande, Panawatte and Kiriporuwa Estates are internationally synonymous with supreme quality. The product range and the process flexibility enable the Company to adjust product mix to meet changing market demands. All of the Company’s rubber plantations have been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), as being environmentally and socially sensitive entities. This accreditation has also been extended to the dry rubber and latex from the Dewalakande and Panawatte factories. Pursuing a policy of product diversification, the Oliphant Estate Black Tea Factory in Nuwara Eliya was converted to the production of Green Tea in 2003, followed by Glassaugh Black Tea Factory in 2008. In 2007, a new facility was set up at Nuwara Eliya estate to manufacture Instant Tea. In 2003, KVPL formed a strategic alliance with Mabroc Teas (Pvt) Ltd., a leading Sri Lankan tea marketing company engaged in the export of bulk and branded tea to nearly 50 countries. In 2006, in association with Mabroc, KVPL became a signatory to the UN Global Compact, a member of the UNGC Charter and has since used this platform to launch a range of unique tea products, including Single Origin Tea from select tea gardens and positioned as, ‘The Ethical Tea Brand of the World’. In 2010 , KVPL secured total control of Mabroc, in order to pursue direct marketing initiatives more aggressively. In 2003, in association with ECO Power (Pvt) Ltd., a dedicated hydropower development company, KVPL established Kalupahana Power Company (Pvt) Ltd., initially setting up a 01 MW mini-hydropower plant linked to the national grid, at Kalupahana Estate. Our policy of plantation community development is a key component of our management strategy and has been further reinforced by an unique, multi-dimensional initiative branded as “A Home for Every Plantation Worker”, launched in 2006. Designed to uplift the quality of life of our people in all aspects, it has been featured as a benchmark in the booklet, ‘Globally Positioning Sri Lanka’s Best’, released by the Global Compact Sri Lanka Network, at the UNGC International Network Conference in Mexico in 2007. The Company’s continuous search for excellence is reflected in its operational practices, its many internationally recognized accreditations and the voluntary subscription to non-regulatory concepts of ethical business management. In furtherance of this policy, the Company has also engaged with several other organisations in environment and biodiversity protection initiatives within its plantation boundaries. Its present position in the industry is a testimony to the commitment and the spirit of innovation demonstrated by its 14,000 employees, led by a closely knit management team. 2011 Winner National Business Excellence Award Winner (Environment) Special Project on Corporate MILESTONES Social Responsibility Award Silver Award Best Annual Report 2010 in plantation sector 1st Runner Up for the ‘Best Presented Accounts Awards 2010’ in Agricultural Sector, conducted by South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA), in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

I wish to thank all employees for their determined efforts during the year, our business partners for their support and my colleagues Prospects on the Board for their valuable inputs and guidance. The market outlook for rubber in particular seems uncertain although prices have stabilised at around US$ 3.50 per kg. In my review of the year 2010, I wrote that it would be unduly optimistic to expect the then price levels to be sustained. Manufacturers turned to synthetic alternatives as a counter to the high natural Mohan Pandithage rubber prices, whilst there are also reports of stockpiling in China Chairman and Thailand. Although, Chinese and Indian consumption levels 14th February, 2012 continue to be satisfactory, it appears that neither economy will maintain the same growth momentum into the current year. The EU debt crisis is bound to have a ripple effect on the whole of Europe and will influence both consumption and demand. These factors are certain to stifle any likelihood of another price boom and it would be prudent to expect contributions to profit from rubber to be moderate in the current season. 08 BOARD OF DIRECTORS Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2011 A M Pandithage* Chairman Past Chairman of the Planters’ Association of Ceylon.

The basic rental payable under the revised basis was Rs. 19,598,000/per annum. This amount is to be inflated annually by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator in the form of contingent rent. This lease agreement was further amended on 1st August, 2002, freezing annual lease rental at Rs. 25,839,041/from 18th June, 2002. Hence, the GDP deflator adjustment has been frozen at Rs. 6,241,041/per annum until 17th June, 2008. Thereafter which will be inflated annually by GDP deflator. According to the ruling given by the Urgent Issue Task Force (UITF) of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, the amount stated in the Financial Statements have been adjusted to reflect the following: 1. Future liability on annual lease payment of Rs. 19,598,000/would continue until year 2045. The Net Present Value of this liability at 4% discounting rate (as recommended by UITF) would result in a liability of Rs. 357,693,521/-. 2. Net present value of Rs. 357,693,421/is represented by gross liability of Rs. 656,533,000/(Rs. 19,598,000/x 33 1/2 years) and interest in suspense of Rs. 298,839,579/-. 3.
