The 2011 data shows that our target from our Footprint Strategy, of never emitting more CO2 than we did in 2008, is more than fulﬁlled: The C02 emissions are reduced by 6% since 2008 – and during the same period the turnover increased by 11%. Compared to 2010, CO2 emissions are reduced by 5% Please note that this data cannot be compared directly with the CO2 data from the Management review in Grundfos Annual Report 2011.

Hazardous waste is categorised according to national regulations and is indexed in relation to amount of 1 mio. working hours. Focus is on handling waste correctly – in particular hazardous waste. However, sorting, categorising and disposal of waste in different fractions and handling are treated differently globally. This means that reporting on waste is not as mature as other environmental indicators. More comprehensive reporting concerning waste was introduced from 2010 and the reporting of working hours has been enhanced to a more complete scope. Therefore, the waste/working hours ﬁgure for 2010 has been changed compared to prior reporting and the 2008 ﬁgure has been left out due to lack of comparability.. Non-hazardous waste * Waste disposal is divided into hazardous and non-hazardous waste and reported in kilograms.

The estimate is based on the actual sales ﬁgures for the year and assumptions about which previous models the sold pumps replace. The ﬁgure is calculated as energy savings in kWh a year. Since 2009 the savings have doubled. The total sale of A-pumps from 2005 up to 31 December 2011 has by the end of 2011 lead to energy savings of 1.5 billion kWh per year (2010: 1.1 billion kWh per year). The savings per year are accumulated as each pump leads to energy savings for several years.

From 2010 to 2011 the workforce size grew by 5% from 16,609 to 17,481 full time employees. One third of the workforce size is female, two thirds are male. 55% are white collar workers and 45% are blue collar workers. Compared to earlier years the percentage of women is increasing, which is also the case for the percentage of white collar workers. Female leaders Leaders are deﬁned as having staff responsibility meaning having employees reporting to them. In 2011 – and 2010 – Grundfos had 17% female leaders. It is our goal that the percentage of female leaders in general should be minimum 25% in 2017. Furthermore, it is our target that minimum 25% of our senior executives are women by 2022 today it is 3%. 16 / GRUNDFOS SUSTAINABILITY DATA 2011 SOCIAL 2011 2010 2009 Workforce Ŭ]VľVp<VLōl]~i 23 n/a n/a i]p<y<]VpΜμΝ łUiO]p]Vpi<OylUp 4 4 4 ΜμΝ Non-Danes in Group positions Group positions are deﬁned as managers from group management to group directors and selected regional managers and group managers in key positions. This indicator is part of Grundfos’ Diversity Policy, which was decided on in 2011. Therefore 2011 is the ﬁrst year reporting on this, and the baseline shows 23% of Non-Danes in Group positions. The Grundfos target concerning Non-Danes in Group positions is to have a share of non-Danes in Group positions of 40 % in 2017 and 60% in 2022. Employees on special terms The indicator is calculated as the number of employees who are given special consideration by Grundfos, and for whom Grundfos installs facilities aimed at the employees’ physical, psychological or social problems. Special consideration is given to employees by amending or adjusting the workplace with regard to time, ﬂexibility or mobility, and by adjusting the content of the job and nature of the work, to enable this to be carried out in spite of reduced working capacity. The number of employees working for en external business partner who carries out assignments for Grundfos is also included. It is Grundfos target to have 3% employees on special terms. Since 2008 the percentage has been 4% on average for all the Grundfos companies including 2011.

During 2011, CIC audited 45 group entities. 6 of the visits were unannounced. While in 2010 most of the visits were ﬁrst-time-visits, in 2011, 29 visits were 2nd visits and 3 were 3rd visits. This leading to a higher maturity rating in 2011. Actions taken in response to incidents of corruption During 2011, 1 report concerning “conﬂict of interest” was received by the Ethics Committee and investigated by the Corporate Internal Control in Grundfos. No violation of the Grundfos Code of Conduct was found.
