Since it is exposed to the environment, the secondary lagoon allows the evaporation of a small amount of water.

As a result there is also a small amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), an effluent enriched in nutrients bio available to plants, and organic stabilized matter. The water is kept in the digester from 35 to 40 days.

Once organic waste is converted into liquids and gases, once they are separated, the next step is to burn the biogas to avoid polluting emissions into the atmosphere. Our goal is to use the methane as a power source that supplies all our farms. We have a pilot project; two sites are already being illuminated from the gas produced. We are a social ecological company We donate a useful sub product to groups of producers in the communities, organic fertilizer, it is obtained by having completed the process of treating organic waste in the lagoons of our farms.
