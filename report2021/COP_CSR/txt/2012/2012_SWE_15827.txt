During the year, we began rating our positively since the previous survey two years ago. j m a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 1 1 CEO’ S comments 3 Preparing for a weaker economic situation There is some uncertainty regarding how the economy will develop, and JM is prepared to meet a weaker economic situation. This is important in our case since the economy impacts both demand and prices, and thus also has an indirect impact on JM’s level of housing starts. • Developed sales process – reinforced sales efforts • Enable cost-related adjustments of projects • Continued initiatives for change within the Structured Production project • Building rights can also be used for production of rental housing for external parties • The building rights portfolio is continuously refined to meet improved future demand. Looking ahead, our core business will consist of tenant-owned apartments in apartment buildings in attractive locations. One example is Kvarnholmen in Nacka where we are planning to build approximately 1,100 residential units in what was previously an industrial area located at the entrance to Stockholm’s harbor. However, we are also going to build single-f amily home neighborhoods, housing for the elderly and various types of residential care facilities. We should also be proficient at developing housing for the + 55 years of age group. This is a very aware group that is interested in moving closer to public transport and service. JM’s international operations are relatively limited, with the exception of Norway. The aim in Denmark, Finland and Belgium is to increase volume, while maintaining requirements for good profitability.

JM has signed the UN’s Global Compact, which is a voluntary Stockholm, March 2012 initiative supporting ten principles related to human rights, labor law, the environment and combating corruption. In the section called “Sustainable urban planning”, we describe our current Johan Skoglund efforts in terms of satisfying the Global Compact’s principles. President and CEO j m a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 1 1 CUSTOMER NEEDS JM resides close to the customer. We aim to understand how driving forces such as urbanization and demographics influence customers, and which requirements and needs are important to both current and future customers. customer needs BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND MACRO 5 Our customers’ surroundings influence their needs JM is to be the customer’s first choice when buying a new home on our markets. JM focuses on the customer’s needs. Doing so gives JM one of its most important competitive advantages. In order to assume a leading position, we must be quick to recognize and understand how people live and work. From a slightly longer term perspective, the most important societal changes include urbanization, the aging population and a firmer focus on the environment and sustainability. Trends that influence demand: • Demographic changes, an aging population and a large generation of young people entering the housing market • Urbanization is a strong trend. People are seeking freedom of choice and diversity • Urban areas and commuting distances are growing, which makes new housing markets attractive • New technology generates new opportunities and makes old solutions obsolete • Financial development: continued growth of real disposable income, and the population is more inclined to put a larger portion of income into housing • Shift in values – more prominent individualism, but also Trends accountability for the common environment. There is a clear need for simplicity in homes, and JM concentrates a great deal on producing housing that uses space effiGood insight results ciently.

JM has been in business since 1945 when John Mattson, a master builder, formed the company and began the tradition of building quality homes with commitment and a sense of style. Sustainable urbanization is above all dependent on competent management of environmental issues, and energy consumption has been in focus the past few years. Thus for a number of years, JM has been producing solutions that reduce energy consumption and utilization of other resources. Customer insight Experience shows that a person’s life situation is the primary factor governing the choice and design of his or her home. As a means of ascertaining housing needs, we continuously conduct various customer surveys using focus groups, at-home interviews and web panels, for example. JM also aims to be more open and sensitive to the needs of customers when they purchase their home. Customers are given the opportunity to take part in the project at the earliest stage possible. There are several areas in which they can participate and exert influence. Examples of such areas include desired service in the neighborhood and alternative ways of using shared premises. Employee know-how As a means of utilizing employees’ experience and ideas for development, annual development dialogues with JM’s employees are conducted. Several working groups with representatives from all areas of JM, including both wage-earners and salaried employees, attend A development area might be a clean product improvement workshops to produce proposals for change and improvement project or a sales theme for market communication. within various development areas. Some of the development projects that can be mentioned are: Supplier know-how Kitchen: We are placing higher demands on our kitchens and A “workshop for the future” is held once a year where suppliers spending an increasing amount of time in them.

Important challenges for JM • Increasingly knowledgeable and proactive customers • Heightened focus on energy-efficient housing • More flexible and adaptable residential units needed to satisfy the need for a workplace and having children at home every other week • Modified home loan requirements – The mortgage ceiling has an effect on home loan ratios – High ratio home loans in households. j m a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 1 1 customer needs the market 7 the market Housing JM is one of the Nordic region’s leading developers of housing. Operations primarily focus on new production of homes, with the main focus on expanding metropolitan areas and university towns in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Belgium. The previously good demand for newly built homes in Sweden became more cautious during the second half of 2011. Demand continued to be good in Norway, while in Denmark it became weaker in 2011 after some improvement in 2010. In all, JM started construction on 3,629 residential units in 2011, compared with 3,404 units the previous year. Sweden had 2,841 housing starts; 93 percent were units in apartment blocks and 7 percent were single-family homes. Norway had a total of 640 housing starts; 79 percent were apartments and 21 percent were single-family homes. Belgium had 71 housing starts, all of which were apartments. Construction began on 18 single-family homes in Denmark and we started 59 units in Finland. The total number of residential housing starts include 77 rental units in Stockholm for an external client. Market for new production in 2011 Demand for housing in the Nordic countries fell in 2011, with the exception of Norway where demand continued to grow. Global turmoil was the primary factor contributing to the weak housing market. Population growth is still relatively high and interest rates are low.

JM aspires to be the customer’s first choice when buying a new home—where focus on the customer and sensitivity to our customers’ needs are crucial factors of success. Most satisfied customers in the industry Satisfied customers are an important key to success. The Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) measures customer satisfaction in the residential development industry in Sweden. For the third consecutive year, JM has the most satisfied customers in the industry with a CSI of 77, which can be compared with the industry index of 72 of 100 potential points (Source: Prognoscentret). JM’s best project in Sweden in 2011 was Trädgårdsmästaren in Malmö. Achieving a high degree of customer satisfaction is evidence of JM’s well-functioning process for managing customer relations. The aim is for customers to have a good dialogue with JM during the entire process. The process typically starts with a general idea of JM and a first expression of interest, contract signing, information meetings and work site visits, and continues until occupancy.

At the same time, we also want to take responsibility for our children’s future environment. More information about our environmental initiatives is presented on pages 34–43. well-insulated windows Windows are often a major source of heat loss in a building. As a result, all of the windows in our new homes have extra heat insulation with a Uw value of 0.9 W/sqmK. allergies Research has shown that there may be a relationship between problems with allergy in children and PVC. JM’s residential units have PVC-free walls and flooring. The landscaping surrounding JM houses use nontoxic plants and trees that are suitable for people with allergies, such as apple trees and roses. JM avoids dusty shelves in the kitchen by installing cabinets that go up to the ceiling. Energy-efficient appliances Major appliances can account for a fairly large proportion of a household’s electricity consumption, which is why JM equips our housing with energy-efficient appliances. All of our housing that is being planned will be equipped with induction cooktops, which can offer energy savings of up to 20 percent compared to a traditional cooktop. Good electrical installation environment We minimize exposure to electrical and magnetic fields. We always use a five-wire system, which limits the magnetic fields throughout the building, and we avoid locating distribution boxes close to the bedroom. Good sound environment Many people perceive loud sounds and noise as one of the biggest problems in a residential environment. Our residential units are quieter than what Swedish building regulations require. Our extra thick walls and floor structure provide very good insulation between apartments. Our exterior doors are required to have a good sound transmission class, and we avoid mail slots in doors by placing mailboxes in the entry to the stairwells and newspaper delivery boxes by the apartment doors. Possibility to impact energy consumption Since all of our residential units are constructed according to JM’s concept for low-energy houses, residents can achieve low household operating costs and help lower overall energy consumption. In addition, hot water usage is measured individually in each apartment, which helps ­residents understand that using hot water sparingly will also result in a lower cost. Sound materials Wood, rock, tile. We use natural materials to the greatest extent possible. We have been developing an environmental product database since 1990 where we check relevant products. Doing so enables us to build housing that is healthy and helps us avoid using hazardous substances. j m a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 1 1 16 OUR OFFER JM ’s 10 BIGGEST PROJECTS IN 2011 Liljeholmskajen, Stockholm Development period: 2001–2018 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: approx. 3,200 – Started: 2,135 – Housing starts in 2011: 334 Apartment sizes: 41–146 m2, 1–6 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: approx. 1,100 Location: Central, 5 km from downtown Stockholm A part of Stockholm’s inner city Kvarnholmen, Nacka Development period: 2010–2022 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: approx. 1,100 – Started: 54 – Housing starts in 2011: 0 Apartment sizes: 53–108 m2, 2–4 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: approx. 1,050 Location: Central, 6 km from downtown Stockholm Unique location at the entrance to Stockholm’s harbor Järvastaden, Solna and Sundbyberg Development period: 2007–2017 Housing type: Single-family homes/Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: just over 1,000 – Started: 548, of which 114 single-family homes – Housing starts in 2011: 167 Apartment sizes: 46–123 m2, 2–5 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: approx. 500 Location: Close to nature, 8 km from downtown Stockholm Garden town with an urban feel, close to downtown Dalénum, Lidingö Development period: 2010–2018 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: just over 750 1) – Started: 60 – Housing starts in 2011: 0 Apartment sizes: 52–168 m2, 2–6 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: just over 700 1) Location: Central, 9 km from downtown Stockholm Land with a tradition on Lidingö Kungsängen, Uppsala Development period: 2002–2017 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: Approx. 900 – Started: 524 – Housing starts in 2011: 0 Apartment sizes: 43–116 m2, 1–5 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: approx. 350 Location: Close to the city center South of Uppsala’s city center 1) In addition there are 220 building rights for rental units. j m a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 1 1 OUR OFFER JM ’s 10 BIGGEST PROJECTS IN 2011 17 Dockan area, Malmö Development period: 2003–2013 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: approx. 950 – Started: 740 – Housing starts in 2011: 84 Apartment sizes: 34–162 m2, 1–5 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: just over 200 Location: Close to the city center/by the sea With a view of the Öresund sound Lomma Strandstad, Lomma Development period: 2003–2016 Housing type: Apartment blocks/Single-family homes Number of residential units: – Total: just over 1,000 – Started: 484 – Housing starts in 2011: 43 Apartment sizes: 42–115 m2, 1–4 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: approx. 550 Location: Close to the sea, 8/10 km to Lund/downtown Small town by the sea Malmö Norra Älvstranden, Gothenburg Development period: 2002–2015 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: just over 1,000 – Started: 758 – Housing starts in 2011: 151 Apartment sizes: 40–135 m2, 2–5 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: just over 250 Location: Close to water, 5 km to downtown Gothenburg Norra Älvstranden continues to grow Öster Mälarstrand, Västerås Development period: 2008–2012 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: Approx. 180 1) – Started: 150 – Housing starts in 2011: 61 Apartment sizes: 36–111 m2, 1–4 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: approx. 30 1) Location: Central, 2 km from downtown Västerås Front row seat to nature Grefsen Stasjon, Oslo, Norway Development period: 2010–2020 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: approx. 260 2) – Started: 24 – Housing starts in 2011: 24 Apartment sizes: 38–187 m2, 2–4 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: approx. 240 2) Location: Central and close to nature, approx. 5 km from New residential area in Oslo downtown Oslo 1) Number on the balance sheet.

JM’s control systems and processes are structured to support and stimulate an optimal cash flow approach in all project phases and thus achieve maximized value development in the Group. Decisions concerning acquisitions and housing starts are crucial business decisions that have a major impact on cash flow, and therefore undergo special scrutiny and evaluation. Finance strategy and policy JM’s finance unit handles the Group’s short and long-term financing, liquidity planning, cash management and financial risk management. The division of responsibility, organization and control of the Group’s overall financing activities are regulated by a finance policy established by the Board. The policy specifies the objectives for finance operations, overall responsibility and specific rules and limits. The objectives for the finance operations are to: • Support operational activities in residential and commercial project development • Optimize use of capital and cash flow management • Control and manage the financial risks to which JM is exposed. JM’s basic finance strategy is to clearly link cash flows from projects in progress and project properties to the Company’s borrowing and interest rate risk management. This strategy provides the best control of financial risks. In order to maintain flexible administration and cost-effective debt management, existing loan agreements are guaranteed by JM’s excellent credit worthiness, which means that no mortgage deeds are provided. j m a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 1 1 28 PROFITABILIT Y risks and risk management SENSITIVITY ANALYSES Sensitivity analysis, various cost categories, project development housing Category Percentage of cost, % 1) Change, % Effect, SEKm Salaries/wages 14 +/–10 +/– 91 Material 16 +/–10 +/– 110 Land 12 +/–10 +/– 80 Developer’s costs 15 +/–10 +/– 100 Pre-construction 4 +/–10 +/– 27 Overhead 7 +/–10 +/– 45 Subcontracting 32 +/–10 +/– 217 1) Share of cost base for project development of housing in Sweden was SEK 6.7bn in 2011.

JM Entreprenad is certified according to ISO 9001 and ISO 14001; its environmental initiatives are focused on reduced energy consumption, waste sorting, soil remediation and proactively choosing the best environmental transportation and shipping alternatives. The Company’s business model promotes a policy to influence clients by proposing the most environmentally friendly choices with respect to products, transports or methods. JM’s agreements with partners and suppliers stipulate that they must meet environmental requirements. environmentally sound logistics solutions JM’s environmentally sound logistics solutions concept focuses on environmental management of excavated material to and from our construction projects. The concept consists in part of physical facilities for storage and handling of the excavated material and in part of a digital deployment service. Two facilities are currently in operation in Stockholm, what are known as “Ekobackar”, and the goal is to have at least four sites in operation in the Stockholm area, one at each end of the city (north, south, east and west). For every “Ekobacke” area JM Entreprenad commissions, reduced carbon dioxide emissions of 1,500 tons a year are made possible, which corresponds to 7,500 round trip flights between Stockholm and Malmö. A digital service has been developed to deploy clean excavated material between the Company’s projects. A map with a search function is available on the Intranet that presents locations of external crushing plants and dumping areas for clean excavation material, for example. Planning for site preparation projects is facilitated, and transports of excavated material and crush material can be reduced, which reduces carbon dioxide emissions and benefits both the environment and project finances. Soil remediation Over the year, JM Entreprenad performed several soil remediation projects for JM as well as for external clients. Each individual remediation project has specific conditions and regulatory requirements depending on what is to be built in the area. JM Entreprenad collaborates with several environmental consultants, business analysis firms and reception facilities in order to facilitate the process for our clients. j m a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 1 1 long -term approach Sustainable urban pl anning 39 Housing Assignment: extremely low energy The same type of environmental program implemented for consumption residential development projects is implemented for the After careful evaluation of the organization and its skills, senior housing and rental units developed by JM Property JM Entreprenad was selected in a competitive bid situDevelopment.
