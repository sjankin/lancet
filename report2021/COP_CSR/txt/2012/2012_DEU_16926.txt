In our company’s 60-year history, we have demonstrated time and again our ability to adapt to change. That makes us confident that we will master the many challenges the future holds – be they economic, environmental, or societal in nature. And, as always, we are already looking ahead and have set clear goals for the future. Many of these goals are part of our new »CSR Strategy With our »CSR strategy 2015«, we 2015«, with which we will integrate sustainability even have set some ambitious goals for the next five years. And we intend more firmly into our company and our entire value to achieve them. chain in the years ahead. Together with our employees, customers, and suppliers we will achieve this goal. The year 2010 saw the economy come back to life. KRONES benefitted more than average from the upswing because we had maintained our core workforce throughout the crisis. That enabled us to increase production quickly without compromising on quality when the orders started rolling in. We are especially pleased at how well our enviro sustainability programme has become established within the company. Our employees have internalised enviro and are digging deeper into our machines’ performance in terms of energy and media consumption, in search of even more efficient solutions. But when it comes to taking responsibility for the future generations, KRONES wants to do more than deliver efficient technology solutions. We also want to promote sustainability in the business community and in society. For this reason, we intensified our communications with all stakeholder groups in 2010 and provided financial support within the Regensburg region and to a dental clinic project in Nepal. Our overarching goal is to create »added value« – for our company, our employees, our customers, our suppliers, our investors, and society as a whole. This sustainability report contains numerous examples of how we have achieved this goal in 2010.

Werner Frischholz, Member of the Executive Board Christoph Klenk, Member of the Executive Board Production Research and Development Foreword by the Executive Board 4 Report from the CSR committee Dear readers, Social responsibility has become an important part of doing business. Commitment and responsibility are central themes of KRONES AG’s CSR strategy. Commitment to our employees, our customers, our suppliers, and our shareholders and responsibility toward society and our many stakeholder groups establish trust and confidence in our company. krones compact The CSR committee wants to ensure that KRONES measures up to this trust. Therefore, we are continually developing new strategies that will enable KRONES to deliver »added value« for our shareholders, our employees, and society as a whole. The economic crisis and its repercussions were a watershed event for business. KRONES AG used the opportunity to revise and evolve its CSR strategy. The result is our »CSR strategy 2015«, which was adopted in the committee’s last meeting on 24 November 2010 (see page 23 for details). The CSR committee met twice in 2010. In these meetings, CSR officer Kristina Ebenbeck informed the other committee members, Philipp Graf von und zu Lerchenfeld, Prof. Dr.-Ing. Erich Kohnhäuser, Prof. Dr. Thomas Schwartz, and Volker Kronseder, about the current status and evolution of KRONES AG’s corporate social responsibility strategy. The CSR committee, from left to right: Prof. Dr. Ing. Erich Kohnhäuser, Philipp Graf von und zu Lerchenfeld, Kristina Ebenbeck, Volker Kronseder, and Prof. Dr. Thomas Schwartz The first committee meeting in January 2010 focused on reviewing the year 2009 and on the company’s rating by oekom research. The agency gave KRONES a C+ rating in 2010, thus awarding the company PRIME status. That qualifies KRONES’ share for inclusion in sustainable (socially responsible) mutual funds. The committee’s second meeting in November 2010 focused on the newly developed »CSR strategy 2015«. We have chosen a long-term approach for our CSR strategy because it enables us to achieve the goals more effectively. Ms. Claudia Islinger was appointed to the committee as a representative of the IG Metall trade union. A central theme of both committee meetings was the evolution of our enviro sustainability programme, which stands for innovation and performance, resource savings, and added value. Our machines undergo an optimisation process that ensures conservation of resources and enhanced user-friendliness. Neutraubling, April 2011 The CSR committee Prof. Dr.-Ing. Philipp Graf von Kristina Ebenbeck Volker Kronseder Prof. Dr. Erich Kohnhäuser und zu Lerchenfeld Thomas Schwartz 5 Interview with Claudia Islinger, new member of the CSR committee Claudia Islinger, a representative of the IG Metall trade »Krones needs to further increase union, speaks about her goals and duties as a new memtrainee numbers and invest more in continuing education to ensure ber of the CSR committee. that we have enough qualified specialists in Germany in the future.« Ms. Islinger, you joined the CSR committee at the end of 2010. Are you satisfied with the way KRONES is handling its krones compact corporate responsibility? The way sustainability and corporate responsibility are reflected in KRONES’ corporate culture is exemplary. At KRONES, sustainability and corporate responsibility are not merely buzz words. They truly are part of company life. We see this, for instance, in the company’s comprehensive reintegration management programme and the counselling service. What do you consider to be your job within the CSR committee? I am a member of the Works Council and an IG Metall representative, so the social aspect is, of course, very close to my heart. KRONES does an excellent job in this area for permanent employees. But I do see room for improvement when it comes to temporary workers. The goal here has to be »equal pay for equal work«. I would also like to see the company use fewer temporary workers. The best approach here would be for KRONES to permanently hire as many as possible. Where else do you see room for improvement? Of course, there is always something that could be done better. I will work to get KRONES to further increase the number of trainee positions it offers and invest more in continuing education so that we have enough qualified specialists in Germany in the future. But in general, KRONES is already an exemplary company within IG Metall. What are your thoughts on KRONES’ »CSR strategy 2015«? I think KRONES has once again taken a leadership role here. This is a pioneering strategy, with which KRONES aims to continually improve all of its processes and work flows in order to achieve its economic and environmental goals. My focus will be on ensuring that we meet or even exceed our goals with respect to labour practices. report from the CSR commitee 6 Remembering our company’s founder, Hermann Kronseder KRONES’ founder, Dr.-Ing. E.h. Hermann Kronseder, died on 9 July 2010, at the age of 85. With his passing, we have lost one of the last great entrepreneurs of the post-war era, whose life and work were dedicated to KRONES AG. Hermann Kronseder was a prolific inventor, with more than 630 patents to his name. He was known in the industry as the »powerhouse of beverage machinery design«. In 1951, at the age of 27, Kronseder set up a craft enterprise in Neutraubling for makkrones compact ing electrically powered machines. He devised new solutions for semiautomatic and fully automatic labelling machines and success came swiftly. In its ninth year, the company was already employing 540 people. KRONES established its first foreign subsidiary in the USA in 1966. Many more subsidiaries followed, in all major industrialised countries and all of KRONES’ key markets. In 1980, Hermann Kronseder converted his company – which then had 2,300 employees and annual sales of around €90 million – into a stock corporation under German law (Aktiengesellschaft, or AG). The company went public in 1984. The ensuing years were marked by steady, rapid growth. Hermann Kronseder managed the company as Chairman of the Executive Board until 1995, when the group of companies generated more than €800 million in sales and employed around 7,800 people. Then he passed the baton to his son Volker, and thus to the next generation. It was not easy for him to withdraw from active management of the company’s operations. But he had the perspicacity to realise that a competent team leading the company could accomplish more than one man, no matter how dedicated and innovative that one man might be. In recognising and opening the path for his company’s future in this way, Hermann Kronseder once again demonstrated his exceptional entrepreneurial spirit. Hermann Kronseder stepped down from the Supervisory Board in 1997, but continued to visit the plant frequently – where he was respectfully addressed as »boss« – right up to his final days. Apart from earning the highest honours in his home state of Bavaria, Hermann Krons­eder also was awarded the Officer’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesverdienstkreuz 1. Klasse) and the 1990 Gold Diesel Medal from the German Institute for Inventions (Deutsche Institut für Erfindungswesen). With that, he joined the ranks of great inventors such as Wernher von Braun, Konrad Zuse, and Claudius Dornier. In 1993, he received an honorary doctorate from the Technical University of Munich in special recognition of his achievements. However, to Hermann Kronseder, far more important than any honour were his employees, who remain loyal to the »boss« in gratitude and respect even in death.

In order to prevent accidents at the workplace and work-related illness, we create a safe environment that The measures KRONES has taken to is conducive to the good health of our employees.

Agim Bajrami, assembly, Our production operations are eco-friendly filling technology division, aseptic systems As far as is economically reasonable, we use all of the options available to make our production operations environmentally compatible. We not only comply with statutory regulations, we make every effort to remain as far below the prescribed limits as possible. We do business for the long term and we do it transparently All strategic decisions within the KRONES Group are reviewed for their long-term probability of success. Short-term optimisation of profits or cash flow has no place in our business model. It is our intention to be a reliable partner for all of our stakeholders, and this includes a policy of maintaining open communications. Code of Conduct As the market leader, KRONES intends to be, and ultimately has to be, the standardsetter – and this includes our ethical behaviour. Sustainability has always been an important part of KRONES’ corporate strategy. This places high demands on each and every one of us. We want to ensure that our actions are always irreproachable, correct, and exemplary. For this reason, we have drafted a code of conduct on the basis of the shared values that are our corporate guidelines. The aim of the code of conduct is to ensure company-wide compliance with laws, standards, and guidelines in order to create a working environment of integrity, respect, fairness, and accountability. It is binding for all KRONES employees – including KRONES compact – Our attitudes and actions 21 the Executive Board, management, and every member of our staff worldwide. All employees are urged to not only comply with the guidelines in the code of conduct in a formal sense but to live and breathe their meaning and purpose. Only in this way can they serve as the basis of an open and vibrant culture of compliance. In the interest of all employees, violations of the code of conduct are systematically investigated and disciplinary action taken. Of course, we want KRONES to be recogkrones compact nised as the market and technology leader. But we also want our customers, employees, suppliers, and shareholders as well as government agencies, institutions, and the general public to perceive us as a reputable, trustworthy, and dependable partner. That is crucial to retaining and expanding our position as the market leader. The complete KRONES code of conduct is available online at www.krones.com/en/ company/sustainability.htm. Suppliers’ code When choosing our business associates, we look at their performance with respect to sustainable, socially responsible management. KRONES has developed a suppliers’ code for this purpose, which is available online at www.krones.com. Compliance with the guidelines set out in the code is essential to successful, transparent, and sustainable business relationships with our suppliers. The suppliers’ code covers safety, health, the environment, quality, human rights, KRONES has developed a suppliers’ employee standards, and preventing and fighting corruption. In order to ensure code that commits suppliers to act responsibly. The suppliers’ code is compliance, our quality assurance team performs audits on site at the suppliers’ available online for download at facilities and then prescribes improvements where necessary. www.krones.com/downloads/ Liko_2010_e.pdf. In addition, KRONES seeks to use vendors that are independently certified. Corporate governance With a few exceptions, KRONES follows the recommendations of the German Cor­ porate Governance Code. The code presents essential statutory regulations for the management and supervision (governance) of German listed companies and contains internationally and nationally recognised standards for good and responsible corporate governance. More information and details on our statement of compliance as well as the compensation report are published in our Annual Report (pages 100 to 111) and online (www.krones.com). KRONES compact – Our attitudes and actions 22 Sustainability in our organisation KRONES AG has systematically anchored its sustainability strategy in the company by way of group-wide standards and an organisational structure that includes clearly defined responsibilities (see chart below). CSR comitee The most important body in this respect is the CSR committee, which is endowed krones compact with far-reaching authority. The CSR committee monitors compliance with the group-wide CSR guidelines and initiates open, neutral dialogue with stakeholders. Another of the committee’s core duties is to oversee implementation of the company’s CSR goals and intervene where necessary. CSR specialist teams These teams consist of representatives from various departments and define sus­ tainability-related goals, actions, and tasks. The CSR officer brings these proposals to the CSR committee. In collaboration with the Executive Board, the CSR committee in turn ensures that sustainability issues are translated into appropriate actions throughout the group. CSR management Supervisory Board at KRONES Our integrated manageExecutive Board ment system (quality, environmental protection, CSR commitee and occupational safety CSR officer management system – Specialist IMS) ensures compliance team leads with the processes.

Therefore, we have analysed our core expertise and used the results of this analysis to formulate our corporate values. KRONES is Securing value for a strong future Creating value with powerful solutions Respecting values in effective dialogue Our aim is to create »added value« for our company, our employees, our customers, our suppliers, our investors, and society as a whole. Seizing opportunities – reducing risks Because the business environment is constantly changing, it is important to identify new challenges early. We systematically analyse and assess opportunities and risks relating to CSR topics in ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders. That helps us to identify potential weak points and new challenges early. And with that, we are minimising risks for the company, strengthening our stakeholders’ trust in us, and safeguarding the company’s reputation. But KRONES also wants to take advantage of the opportunities that come with change and use them to acquire new business and employees. For example, we are developing particularly resource-saving products and services under our »enviro« label. And by investing heavily in Germany as a business location and maintaining an employee-friendly corporate culture, we are attracting qualified personnel – one of the key factors for KRONES’ future success. KRONES compact – CSR strategy 2015 24 KRONES’ csr targets through 2015 In the future, we want to put our sustainability expertise to work in an even more targeted manner, to utilise opportunities that present themselves and reduce existing and potential risks. To this end, we have established clear, ambitious, traceable goals for the next five years. With these goals, we aim to further substantially improve our performance in all areas (economy, environment, labour practices, and krones compact society) and thus underpin our market lead in terms of CSR as well. CSR goals: Economic Added value Our goals with respect to economy focus on expanding the enviro sustainability programme, boosting profits, and further improving our risk management. Value Our new programme »Value« aims to increase KRONES’ profitability. Only through profitability can KRONES continue to invest in new developments and qualified, highly motivated employees. Creating added value for customers and the company Improving profitability Strengthening customer loyalty Pre-tax return on sales > 7% Value-oriented sales enviro With the certified management system enviro, we are gaining growing advantages over our competitors. Third-party verification is an important component here. We plan to have 100% of our machines assessed under enviro by 2015. Risk management = opportunity management KRONES’ aim is not only to avoid risk. We also want to identify and use the opportunities the rapidly changing markets offer. Some of the core topics here are quality, suppliers, personnel, and compliance. More information can be found in the KRONES Annual Report 2010, on pages 78–85. Supplier management: fair treatment, ensuring continuity of supply Quality assurance: quality without compromise Human resources management: well positioned for the »war for talent« Compliance: as an integral part of our corporate culture KRONES compact – CSR strategy 2015 25 CSR goals: Environmental Green supplier In the years ahead, KRONES wants to underpin its leadership on the market – not krones compact only in terms of technology but also in terms of environmental protection. We have set ambitious goals for substantially reducing internal resource consumption by 2015. The basis for this effort will be to define concrete parameters and introduce a group-wide measuring system in order to form a transparent picture of all relevant consumption data. Reducing energy consumption (CO2 emissions per €1 million in sales) Introducing an energy management system, which is planned for 2012, is an important part of our efforts to substantially reduce energy consumption. Reducing waste When it comes to generating waste, we will adhere even more closely to the dictum »avoid, reduce, reuse, recycle«. In this way, we intend to substantially reduce the amount of non-recoverable waste generated at our facilities in the years ahead. Reducing water consumption We intend to further reduce our consumption of fresh water, for instance, by recirculating and reusing water as much as possible. Establishing an energy management system (based on DIN EN 16001) 2011 Jan Feb Mar Apr May June July Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Define additional measuring points (electrical power + heat) Discuss previous production figures with assembly and production teams Install the additional measuring points Define performance indicators Define targets for 2012 based on the performance indicators defined above KRONES compact – CSR strategy 2015 26 CSR goals: Labour practices and society Employer branding krones compact Demographic trends in the world’s industrialised countries are expected to result in a shortage of qualified workers in the years ahead. Since KRONES has focused primarily on internal growth, it is extremely important that we establish a reputation as an attractive employer. We have set the following goals with respect to employer branding: Expand and optimise our human resources marketing (recruitment): Use our knowledge from Personnel Management and Social Affairs to recruit new employees and retain existing ones Increase the value of our sites with respect to recruitment by way of charitable giving and sponsoring Improve work-life balance Continue to develop employee qualifications to secure our market position and as incentive for our employees Boost training and continuing education Expand the employee suggestion box system to better unlock and utilise our »hidden knowledge« Improve work safety Reduce absenteeism by expanding health management and counselling service KRONES compact – CSR strategy 2015 27 Charitable giving and sponsoring concept Sponsoring krones compact We are reorienting our charitable giving and sponsoring activities with a focus on training and continuing education. At the regional level, we support schools and universities near our production sites. At the national level, we are doing intensive marketing at colleges and universities. And at the international level, we are supporting the construction and expansion of the Dhulikhel university clinic in Nepal. Improving dialogue with stakeholders Dialogue Trust is based on communication and transparency. Therefore, KRONES actively seeks to engage in dialogue with all stakeholders. But here, too, we see potential for improvement and want to enhance both the quality and the quantity of our com­ munications with stakeholders in the years ahead.

KRONES is also convinced that the only way a company can be profitable in the long term is by conserving resources, taking environmental protection seriously, and taking on social responsibility. For this reason, KRONES has traditionally sought to maintain the fruitful symbiosis of profitability and social responsibility. ökonomie krones compact KRONES Group sales (€ million) 2,381 2,156 2,173 1,911 1,865 The new competence management 2,000 reviews show me that KRONES is interested in promoting my skills and 1,500 helping me develop professionally.

In 2010, we reaped the rewards of having retained our core workforce throughout the crisis of 2009. Our people were already in place to handle the unexpectedly strong surge in orders in 2010. As a result, sales revenue at KRONES increased 16.5% (€308 million) to €2.173 billion. The company’s bottom line was also positive once again, with net income of €50.9 million after the previous year’s net loss of €34.5 million. Apart from the general economic recovery, these figures also reflect KRONES’ technological leadership on the market and the continuing success of the »Conversion« programme. KRONES Group net income (€ million) In 2010, KRONES returned to profit106.5 ability after having posted the first 101.8 net loss in the company’s history in 100 77.5 2009. 50.9 50 0 –34.5 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Economic – Economic responsibility 31 With »Conversion« complete, KRONES is now focusing on »Value« At the end of 2008, KRONES launched a programme entitled »Conversion« in response to the difficult economic situation. The idea behind »Conversion« was that we had to change our thinking as well as our organisation. The comprehensive raft of measures resulted in substantial savings once again in 2010. However, the rapid economic recovery has compelled KRONES to shift its focus back to managing growth. Therefore, in early 2011, the extremely successful »Conversion« programme was replaced with »Value«. The new programme is aimed at creating added value for customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, society as a whole, and of course, KRONES. During the crisis of 2009, price quality deteriorated dramatically. Therefore, the goal for 2010 was to at least stabilise prices. And we did. One important factor here was that our sales team is continually reviewing and improving the quality of our orders. For this purpose, KRONES introduced a multi-dimensional risk analysis system economic worldwide in 2009 and systematically implemented it in 2010. Our focus on valueoriented sales paid off in 2010 and made a significant contribution to improving our performance. KRONES’ medium-term goal remains: to achieve a pre-tax return on sales of at least 7%. To achieve this, it is imperative that our sales team continually improve price and order quality. Increasing value added The value added calculation presented here shows the KRONES Group’s contributions to the economy and society. A company’s value added is calculated by deducting the expenses for production – that is, cost of goods and services purchased, depreciation, amortisation, and write-downs on non-current assets, and other operating expenses – from total operating revenue. The result for KRONES for the year under review is value added of €753 million (previous year: €587 million). KRONES Group value added calculation More than 90% of KRONES’ value added went to our employees in the form of wages, salaries, and social Taxes 2.7% (€20 million) security contributions. Other operating expenses 16.6% (€386 million) Goods and services purchased Value added 48.3% (€1,119 million) Employees 91.1% (€686 million) 32.5% (€753 million) Depreciation, amortisation, and write-downs of non-current assets Dividends 0.0% (€0 million) 2,6% (€61 million) Added value remaining within the company 6.2% (€47 million) Total operating revenue 2010: €2,319 million (100%) Economic – Economic responsibility 32 The lion’s share – 91.1% or €686 million – went toward our employees. In addition to wages and salaries (€565.2 million), KRONES spent €120.3 million on social security contributions, pension plans, and employee benefits. In addition, €20 million or 2.7% of value added went to the state in the form of tax payments. Since KRONES did not pay out a dividend to shareholders in 2010, €47 million of value added remained within the company. This amount is available for expansion projects and, thus, for funding future growth. Increasing capital spending I find it remarkable that KRONES Even in difficult economic times, KRONES stands by its conviction that providing did not cut back on investing in leading technology and services is the only way to achieve long-term, sustainable sustainability during the economic value added. For this reason, the company has a long tradition of investing heavily crisis. in its employees, production facilities, and research and development.

KRONES also invested around €81.5 million (previous year: €88.2 million) in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in the year under review. It is worth noting that KRONES AG did not receive or request any government funding, subsidies, tax relief, or other grants for its investments. KRONES will continue to invest in the future – using our own resources – in order to maintain our leadership of the market for the long term.

That is because KRONES is exposed to a variety of risks that are inextricably linked with doing business globally. We continuously monitor all significant business processes to identify risks early and to actively manage and limit them. An internal control system with which we record, analyse, and assess all relevant financial and operating risks (from liquidity risks to personnel risks) is an integral part of KRONES’ risk management system. We monitor all material risks and any countermeasures already taken in a detailed, ongoing process that entails planning, information, and control. We are continually expanding and improving our risk management system on the basis of practical expeKrones handled the economic crisis rience.

Therefore, the company is not currently discussing actions to counter such risks. Details on risk management and the risk categories can be found in the risk report in our 2010 Annual Report. Economic – Economic responsibility 34 Economic Production With the exception of our subsidiary KOSME (< 4% of consolidated sales), which produces in Italy and Austria, all of our production takes place in Germany. All Flensburg manufacturing steps are carried out in one of our German plants, in Neutraubling (company headquarters), Nittenau, Rosenheim, Flensburg, or Freising. Providing cutting-edge technology and the highest possible quality requires close collaboration between our R&D people and our specialists on the shop floor. That is why we are not offshoring our production. Instead, we are committed to maintaining our triedNittenau and-true production matrix at home in Germany.

LCS employs more than 1,800 highly qualified people, to provide customers with a comprehensive range of top-quality KRONES products and services no matter when or where they need them. LCS covers all maintenance and repair services, spare parts and change parts, individual services, software tools, and training. Thus, LCS is an important basis on which to build consistent long-term earnings. When contracting installation services abroad, we carefully ensure that the foreign subcontractors meet our strict environmental and social standards (see the discussion of our suppliers’ code on page 21). In our quality assurance department, some 15 people are at work worldwide, monitoring the installation of our lines on site. Another of KRONES’ goals is to conserve resources in our own production. We achieved this goal in 2010. Energy consumption relative to sales revenue was down. In other words, we used less energy for each euro in sales we generated. Detailed environmental data is presented in the »Environmental« section of this report, beginning on page 40. High standards for suppliers and logistics Our suppliers and their reliability for on-time delivery are critical to our own efforts to keep up an excellent delivery record. The long-standing, fair relationships we maintain with our vendors and our excellent payment record help ensure this dependability. We purchased raw materials, products, and services totalling around €1.1 billion from partners in some 60 countries in 2010. We expect these partners to operate in accordance with our company’s ethical values (see the discussion of our suppliers’ code on page 21).

And wherever possible, KRONES relies on ship or rail to deliver our machines and lines instead of air transport. Highest level of quality assurance The name KRONES has always been synonymous with quality. As the market leader for beverage and packaging technology, we feel an obligation to always provide our customers with the latest technology and the highest quality. But the concept of quality encompasses more than products and manufacturing processes. It also stands for our responsibility to protect the environment and to comply with standards for occupational safety and health. In obtaining certification of our IMS economic for all of our sites in Germany in 2009, KRONES also strengthened its role as a leader in this area. The existing quality management systems were expanded into an integrated management system (IMS) for quality (DIN EN ISO 9001), environmental protection (DIN EN ISO 14001), and occupational safety (BS OHSAS 18001) and certified To me, CSR also means using local by TÜV SÜD. suppliers.

KRONES’ R&D team is made up of more than 1,700 highly qualified people. Part of the team focuses on advancing strategic development efforts. The rest, the majority, of the team works to continually improve existing products and services and further increase the benefits they offer our customers. The focus here is on ensuring line uptime and efficiency throughout the entire lifecycle. In our industry, it is important to protect innovations and knowhow under intellectual property law. In recent years, KRONES has implemented a very successful patent strategy, which is reflected in a steep increase in registered patents. At the end of the Through ongoing research, developreporting period, KRONES had around 2,000 registered patents and utility models ment, and investment, KRONES has maintained its position as market (previous year: around 1,600). leader and is continually surprising me with new innovations. enviro – a strong label with competitive advantages Stefan Lamm, main assembly shop, economic inspection technology division With the enviro sustainability programme, launched in 2008, KRONES has established a standard of energy and media efficiency for machines and lines in the bott­ ling and packaging industry. It also helps shape our company’s research and development work. enviro stands for innovative, high-performance machines and lines that use resources sparingly and offer customers added value while at the same time ensuring the safety of operating and maintenance personnel. All KRONES developments are now guided by the enviro programme, which earned TÜV SÜD certification in 2009. The criteria for energy The criteria for media The criteria for efficiency include: efficiency include: eco-friendliness include: Electrical power Gasses Composition of Compressed air Water all materials used Heating and cooling (raw materials and supplies) Consumption of the media used in various defined operational states Emissions (e.g. noise and effluents) We look at the entire beverage production and filling process and perform a detailed analysis of the machines’ consumption data. Then our engineers work out intelligent solutions for minimising consumption. The result of this development work is lines that save our customers energy and other media such as water and compressed air over the long term. With that, we are able to offer our customers real added value and secure our own competitive advantage. Economic – Products 37 KRONES obtained TÜV SÜD certification in 2009 to establish the enviro seal for efficient use of energy and media (gas, water) and environmental friendliness. In addition, KRONES’ enviro passport provides a high level of transparency, enabling customers to compare different machines’ consumption data. All relevant data are collected and consumption forecasts for the machines and systems are documented on the basis of a standardised procedure that has been certified by TÜV SÜD. Machines and systems that have an enviro passport offer numerous benefits for the food and beverage industry: The certainty that they will receive machines and lines that provide economic I find it fascinating what KRONES and environmental benefits. has achieved with enviro.

For example, if a brewery with an annual output of 500,000 hectolitres generates 3.4 hectolitres of waste water per hour at an effluent temperature of 26°C, the amount of energy lost is equivalent to around 300,000 litres of heating oil. One focus of KRONES’ process engineering is on developing technologies that help conserve energy and resources. The best example of this is our new EquiTherm system, which is used in wort production. This stage of beer brewing consumes the most primary energy of all, in the form of heat. An energy recirculation feature between the lautered wort heater and the wort boiler, which is fed by the vapour conSeeing the resource savings achieved in production – without denser, is already a well-established KRONES product.

Alexander Kirchmeier, assembly, filling technology division, modular The concept only works with the ShakesBeer EcoPlus mash kettle from KRONES, systems which features a special heating surface flow pattern that ensures very high heat flow even at low admission temperatures. At the Bergquell Brewery in Löbau, Germany, our energy-saving system has reduced primary energy consumption in the brewhouse by 30%. At an annual beer output of 200,000 hectolitres, that corresponds to savings of 500,000 kilowatt hours of thermal energy each year. With EquiTherm, breweries can often cut primary energy consumption in the brewhouse by between 20% and 30% or more depending on the mashing process and recipe used. Since wort boiling is the only significant primary energy consumer left in the brewhouse, peaks in demand are also reduced by as much as 40%.

Economic – Products 40 Environmental Systematically evolving our environmental protection activities KRONES has made reasonable and efficient use of resources one of its corporate guidelines and willingly accepts its responsibility for protecting the environment and preventing climate change. That is why we strive to save resources and minimise the environmental impact of our own production processes at our manufacturing sites. To accomplish this, we employ the latest technological processes, which enable us to comply with environmental regulations and improve our environmental performance. Since our Italian subsidiary KOSME has its own management systems, it is not possible to collect uniform data for all of the group’s production sites. For this reason, the environmental data presented here is limited to the German production KRONES has taught me how imporsites. tant sustainability is. Before, I had never even given it a second thought. Environmental protection at KRONES Christian Hafner, assembly, filling technology division As far as economically reasonable, we use all of the options available to ensure ökologie economic that production operations at our manufacturing sites conserve resources and are environmentally compatible. We comply with statutory regulations and do everything we can to ensure that we stay below the prescribed limits. We also want to substantially reduce consumption of valuable resources in all other (non-manufacturing) areas of our company. Every stage of production – from the first manufacturing step to the disposal of Conserving resources and avoidsupplies used in production – is designed to be as environmentally compatible as ing the use of substances that harm the environment are important aspossible. Minimising the use of hazardous materials and using eco-friendly alternapects of our product development tives wherever possible is an important aspect of our product development process. process. We have set ambitious environmental goals as part of our CSR Strategy 2015 (see page 25) in order to pursue the issue in a structured, sustainable manner. Focal points of the strategy programme include increasing transparency and reducing energy and water consumption and generating less waste. Many environmental performance indicators improved considerably in 2010 We were able to further improve many important environmental performance indicators in 2010. Energy and water consumption rose far less steeply than sales. As a result, these consumption figures per €1 million in sales revenue – the relevant performance indicators used at KRONES – were down in 2010. Only waste generation increased more sharply than sales. Environmental – Systematically evolving our environmental protection activities 41 Energy consumption The following energy consumption data relate to the energy required for operating the machines, systems and buildings at our five sites in Germany. In collecting this data, we have included 100% of the energy consumed by our own buildings. Leased buildings are only partially included since some are leased at a flat rate that includes electricity, heating, and water and these buildings are generally shared with other users. We have not included consumption data for our vehicle fleet (fuel) or data for energy consumed at installation sites. In the year under review, total energy consumption rose 8.1% to 117,887 MWh, which KRONES supported me in my trainis less than the increase in sales revenue at KRONES (16.5%). ing as a paramedic.

Consumption 8.2 dropped from 9.5 to 8.2 MWh per €1 million in sales. 3.0 2.3 2.5 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Energy used, heating oil (MWh per €1 million in KRONES Group sales) Heating oil now accounts for a very small portion of the group’s total energy consumption. It was back down to its 2008 level in 2010. 2.2 1.1 1.3 1.0 1.0 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 CO2 emissions KRONES calculated and published data on CO2 emissions for the first time in 2009. Environmental The figure includes the emissions caused by consumption of electricity, natural gas, heating oil, LPG, and district heating at our five factories in Germany. We have made our calculations on the basis of statements from the electrical and district heating utilities and the Bavarian Environment Agency’s tool for calculating emissions. This tool takes into account direct and indirect emissions. Direct emissions are the emissions that result at the site where the energy is converted. Total CO2 emissions amounted to 36,633 metric tonnes during the reporting period, after 27,159 metric tonnes in the previous year. Of this, 24,238 metric tonnes (previous year: 15,287 metric tonnes) are related to electricity consumption. The reason The award our Works Council received shows me that KRONES really for the dramatic increase is that only 27% of the electricity KRONES obtained from cares about its employees and that the utilities in 2010 was produced using renewable resources (previous year: 35%). I can count on the Works Council. However, even this percentage is still far higher than the German average (16%). Manfred Schaffner, main assembly The remaining 12,395 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions relate primarily to natural shop, inspection technology divigas and district heating and, to a lesser extent, to heating oil and LPG. sion KRONES Group CO2 emissions in 2010 24,238 metric tonnes from electricity 12,395 metric tonnes from natural gas, consumption (of which 27% is from district heating, and (to a lesser extent) renewable resources) heating oil and LPG Total CO2 emissions: 36,633 metric tonnes Environmental – Systematically evolving our environmental protection activities 43 Waste management The trend was not as positive with respect to waste generation. The total volume of waste generated increased 28.9%, more steeply than sales (16.5%). One reason for this, apart from the previous year’s extremely low figure, was that cleanup work was carried out in 2010 that is only done every few years. The total volume of waste generated per €1m in sales increased from 5.33 metric tonnes to 5.89 metric tonnes. In absolute terms, the total waste generated at KRONES was 12,803 metric tonnes, which corresponds to the amount of garbage generated by 22,700 individuals in Germany per year. Total waste generated (metric tonnes and metric tonnes per €1 million in KRONES Group sales) The total volume of waste generated in 2010 was up considerably from the previous year, rising more 12,388 12,962 12,803 sharply than sales. 10,621 9,935 5.60 5.75 5.44 5.33 5.89 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Environmental The volume of non-recoverable waste (that is, waste that must be disposed of) rose to 594 metric tonnes (previous year: 498 metric tonnes), roughly parallel to sales. That puts the volume of non-recoverable waste per €1 million in sales at the same level as a year earlier. Nonrecoverable waste (metric tonnes and metric tonnes per €1 million in KRONES Group sales) In 2010, only 594 metric tonnes of waste could not be recycled, just under five percent of the total 1,214 1,203 volume of waste. 519 498 594 0.64 0.56 0.22 0.27 0.27 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Recyclable waste (metric tonnes and metric tonnes per €1 million in KRONES Group sales) The volume of recyclable waste increased even more sharply 12,443 12,209 11,185 than sales during the reporting period and approached 6 tonnes 9,407 9,437 per €1million in sales. 5.19 5.23 5.06 5.62 4.92 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 The volume of recyclable waste generated at KRONES’ production sites increased 29.4% in 2010. Apart from the higher-than-average increase in the total volume of waste, another reason for the increase in recyclable waste is improved waste separation, which allows more and more of the waste generated at KRONES to be recycled rather than disposed of. Environmental – Systematically evolving our environmental protection activities 44 Water consumption increased more slowly than sales After decreasing slightly in 2009, water consumption increased 8% to 111,689 m3 in 2010 due to a massive surge in business. This volume corresponds to the average annual water consumption of 2,400 individuals in Germany. Water consumption in relation to sales was down from 55 m3 to 51 m3 per €1 million in sales. We are con­ fident that we will be able to further reduce water consumption through targeted measures in the years ahead. Depending on the source, waste water is treated in internal treatment plants prior to being channelled into the main sewer system. In 2010, as in years past, contaminant At KRONES AG, there is never a doubt levels in the treated waste water were far below the legal limits for chromium, nickel, that employees are the key to the copper, and zinc. company’s success. That makes me proud to work for KRONES. System data and measurements are recorded in regular analyses as stipulated in Christina Sperl-Steiner, the German Self-Monitoring Ordinance [Eigenüberwachungsverordnung]. External in-house medical service checks confirm the results of our analyses. Of course, light liquid separators are used in the various systems prior to discharge of the treated waste water into the public sewer system. KRONES engages qualified specialists to dispose of boring and filing emulsions and cooling lubricants. Water consumption (m³ and m³ per €1 million in KRONES Group sales) In 2010, total water consumption increased to 111,689 m3, which Environmental 111,689 roughly corresponds to the annual 104,862 103,402 consumption of around 2,400 96,689 85,207 people in Germany. However, the 79,794 figure in relation to sales (per €1 57,400 55 million in sales) was far below the 47 51 45 45 44 38 previous year’s high level. 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Emissions To reduce particulate emissions and thus minimise our impact on the environment, we have implemented measures in our motor pool such as the use of diesel-powered cars with particulate filters. In addition, as of 2010, all pool vehicles now have CO2 emissions of 120 g/km or less. Another way KRONES is cutting emissions is through a software-based ride sharing programme, which reduces the number of separate trips taken by employees between our sites. KRONES is also increasingly using videoconferencing for meetings, thus reducing the number of car and plane trips taken by staff and management. Periodic emissions tests are carried out on the facilities for which such tests are prescribed under the German Act for the Protection against Harmful Environmental Effects Caused by Air Pollution, Noise, Vibration, and Similar Factors [Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz], including the electroplating shop and the pickling plant. These facilities are in compliance with the mandated limits.

Qualified, motivated employees are the backbone of our business. They are not a cost factor but a critical factor for our success. With the populations in the industrialised countries of the West ageing at an accelerating pace, sustainable human resources policy must address a number of questions: How can we maintain our employees’ expertise and good health? How can we respond to our employees’ different life stages and offer suitable working time models? How can we promote and challenge our older employees? How can we recruit young people to work for us? KRONES responds to these challenges with a variety of measures and offerings, which are described in detail on the following pages. During the economic crisis the media reported on massive lay-offs. Not at KRONES. That shows me that Record number of employees the company values my work and I don’t have to be worried about The decision to avoid lay-offs, even during the crisis of 2009, enabled us to generate the future. a positive operating result in 2010.

The additions came both in Germany and abroad. We will continue to invest heavily in recruitment and in training and continuing education for motivated employees. For reasons relating to data collection, the following statements and figures on employees – with the exception of the number of employees within the group – relate to our workforce in Germany only.

Therefore, one of their most important tasks is to ensure a lasting supply of qualified young recruits and to further improve our existing employees’ 10,180 qualifications. With more than 10,000 job applicants in 2010 alone, KRONES is al8,125 ready a popular, reputable employer. Our aim is to further enhance KRONES’ employer branding and therefore secure a strong position for the »war for talents«. A look at our employees’ qualifications shows that our people are optimally prepared 323 192 to handle the challenging tasks their work entails. Almost all of our employees in 2009 2010 Germany possess recognised professional or vocational qualifications. The share of employees who hold a university degree grew to 16.7% last year. Job applicants New hires Labour practices/society Human resources development and continuing education Personal and professional development is an important key to maintaining our company’s competitiveness and innovative power and safeguarding jobs. Our HR department works to provide employees with regular continuing education and development opportunities. In addition to qualification measures relating to specific fields, we also offer interdisciplinary and intercultural training opportunities. Spending on external continuing education and training at KRONES AG (€ thousand) Spending on external continuing education and advanced training for our employees increased consid2,919 erably once again in 2010. 2,396 1,874 1,525 1,415 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Labour practices – Employee qualifications 52 KRONES increased spending on external continuing education and advanced training opportunities for our employees from €1.4 million to €1.9 million in 2010. But the number of internal seminars was also increased over 2009. Since early 2009, employees have been able to find out about all of the training and development courses offered by KRONES through our SAP training portal. Courses are held on more than 450 subjects in a wide range of technical areas. In 2010, KRONES also began offering alternative e-learning options, for instance for learning a foreign language. Some 14,600 participants took advantage of internal (8,500) and external (6,100) training and development opportunities in 2010. Beyond job-specific qualifications, KRONES also offers employees opportunities for Making profits is one thing – how their own personal and professional development under a company agreement. those profits are made is another thing entirely. Fortunately, both In general, almost all continuing education opportunities that are relevant to the are good at KRONES! company can be done on either a full-time or part-time basis. Employees can apply Udo-Bela Udvar, assembly, filling for assistance to cover the continuing education expense. For part-time continuing technology division, aseptic systems education measures, employees can also apply for educational and professional development leave. For full-time continuing education opportunities, employees can apply for an unpaid sabbatical or a commitment to rehire. There are a limited number of approvals available for these options. Competence management is another important component of human resources development at KRONES. In annual review meetings, employees and their managers discuss strengths and areas for further development. Employees receive feedback and can request specific locations. They work out suitable development measures in dialogue with their manager or supervisor. These measures may include traditional Labour practices/society ones such as seminars and conferences or recommended reading or exchanges with co-workers. Development reviews were initiated with 3,000 employees in 2010. KRONES also launched a training series entitled »TIMMY’S service code« in 2010.

In general, we try to involve our employees in the creation of employee development tools. Modern management – international Because our workforce is made up of more than 10,000 people from over 50 different countries, establishing a uniform management culture worldwide is an im­ portant task. To this end, we use a modular training concept for employees with management duties. External coaches provide training and guidance to help management employees from various departments augment their leadership skills. Over a total of nine days, the modules impart tools such as goal-setting, conflict resolution, and argumentation techniques using case studies and role plays with practical relevance. Labour practices – Employee qualifications 53 By including our managers from outside Germany in the management training system, we can better align perceptions of the role among managers in Germany and abroad. This approach also improves coordination and cooperation between the subsidiaries and the parent company. Seven groups have completed the international management training since the programme’s launch in 2009. In 2010 we expanded the programme to include more lower-level managers in some countries. All told, 113 KRONES employees completed a management training seminar in 2010. The 83rd group began management training at the end of 2010. Each group usually has around nine participants, bringing the total number of managers who have attended the seminar to around 750. That in turn brings us a big step closer to our goal For me, as a woman in a man’s doof establishing a uniform, modern understanding of management within the entire main, it means a lot that KRONES is promoting women.

For employees who are not suited to or interested in management positions, we present alternatives for advancement such as project leader or subject matter expert positions and offer specific measures and training tailored to the desired career path. Diversity management – an important part of HR policy Because KRONES is an international company and employs people from many different countries, we have made employee diversity an important aspect of our personnel strategy. Diversity management at KRONES is about more than implementing laws. It is a holistic concept for putting the diversity of our workforce to work for everyone. Labour practices/society Within our diversity management concept, we strive to promote the potential of heterogeneous groups while also preventing conflicts. This concept improves information exchange and increases performance, cohesion within the team, employee motivation, and work quality. Experience has shown that mixed teams are often more innovative and creative when it comes to problem-solving than homogeneous groups. We are very pleased to report that the ratio of women in our workforce has increased steadily over the past several years. Women have for years made up more than 10% of our workforce in Germany – a respectable number in the machinery industry. In 2010, the share of women in our workforce rose to 12.5%. The comparable figure for the previous year was 12.0%. Women at KRONES AG* (%) For a machinery manufacturer, KRONES has a respectable ratio of 12.0* 12.0* 12.5 women in its workforce, which 11.1* 11.3* reached an internal record for KRONES of 12.5% in 2010. 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 * Prior year figures adjusted because trainees are no longer included in the calculation. Labour practices – Employee qualifications 54 It should be noted that the prior-year figures have been adjusted because trainees are no longer included in employee calculations. Women held 3.9% of the managerial positions within the company in 2010, compared with 4.9% the previous year. Only satisfied employees are motivated employees KRONES aims to foster a lasting, fair, and fruitful partnership with our employees. The core elements of this are established in our corporate guidelines and code of conduct. KRONES employees enjoy freedom of association worldwide. In addition, KRONES observes all relevant laws and regulations aimed at protecting workers. For the purpose of achieving a uniform corporate identity, the Works Council regularly I’m happy about the profit-sharing reviews, on site, whether the applicable laws and KRONES’ own guidelines are being plan because it acknowledges the employees’ efforts. For me, it’s very adhered to with respect to the working conditions at our offices and sites abroad – motivating. even in the emerging markets. Hauke Bahnsen, assembly, filling At KRONES, all employees whose pay is determined by collective agreement (blue-coltechnology division, production lar and white-collar alike) are paid on the basis of a common general pay agreement (ERA). Moreover, KRONES employees who are covered by collective agreements were given a share in the company’s profits for the first time in 2010. All employees covEmployees covered by ered by collective agreements now earn a share in KRONES AG’s profits in accordance collective bargaining contracts with a scheme that applies to all. The relevant profit figures are determined by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board at the turn of the year as part of the 75.6% group’s annual planning for the upcoming calendar year. The additional pay above 59.2% and beyond that stipulated by the collective agreement can equal as much as 60% of one month’s pay. In general, KRONES adheres to the applicable collective agreements. KRONES never pays less and often pays more. Labour practices/society KRONES AG has made a commitment to use only temporary work agencies that are Employees in Germany members of one of Germany’s associations of temporary employment agencies (BZA Total KRONES workforce and IGZ) and therefore subject to and adhere to the collective agreements for temporary workers signed by these associations and the individual trade unions that are affiliated to the Confederation of German Trade Unions (DGB). Each year, KRONES permanently hires a significant number of its temporary workers. Works Council honoured for its work KRONES has always cooperated closely with our employee representatives as a matter of conviction. In Germany, where KRONES is headquartered, there are clear rules governing and ensuring codetermination. Employee representatives make up half of the Supervisory Board. In addition, the Works Council represents the interests of employees. The Works Council and the Executive Board negotiate reasonable solutions for day-to-day working life. The results of these negotiations often go above and beyond the requirements set forth by the law or collective bargaining contracts. Examples include our employee benefits, salaries, and flexible working hours. Labour practices – Employee qualifications 55 KRONES AG’s Works Council has been awarded the »German Works Council Award in Silver« from the German trade publication for works councils »Arbeitsrecht im Betrieb« for its foresightful work. The KRONES Works Council’s submission on the plant agreement, »Future-oriented design of the general conditions of employment for German sites«, was one of around 100 and took second place. This was the second year that »Arbeitsrecht im Betrieb« has presented the Works Council Award, this year under the auspices of Germany’s Labour Minister Ursula von der Leyen.

That is why we have for years been working hard to recruit highly qualified young people, offering them attractive career opportunities at KRONES that start with training programmes, internships, or thesis-writing opportunities. We also consider it our social responsibility to offer young people opportunities to get a good start in their careers.

That is why KRONES offers attractive, challenging training KRONES is securing access to highly qualified young talent. opportunities to a large number of young people in 25 different fields every year. We invest around €70,000 in each of our young trainees. Labour practices/society But we also hold our recruits to high standards. Of the 1,700 or so school leavers who applied to train with us in 2010, only 136 began training at KRONES in the fall of 2010 after a rigorous selection process. Approximately one-third of these trainees have a qualified school leaving certificate from a lower secondary school (Haupt­ schulabschluss), around 50% have a school leaving certificate from a mid-level secondary school (Mittlere Reife), and the rest have the university entrance quali­ fication (Abitur). In all, KRONES was training 499 young people in Germany at the end of 2010. Of our trainees, 441 were in industrial and technical fields and 58 were in commercial fields.

KRONES employees work closely with the students, who can also participate in a lecture series designed especially for them, to give them an in-depth look at the company. Each quarter, KRONES employees present three lectures for the young university students. Topics include container design, logistics systems, and the enviro sustainability programme. After the lectures, the KRONES experts field questions from the students. In 2010, we advised 226 students writing theses and 685 interns on a variety of projects with practical relevance.

KRONES piques interest among kids – boys and girls alike Well over one thousand teens and their parents visited KRONES’ plants in Neutraubling, Nittenau, and Rosenheim at the end of July 2010 for »Training Day«. There, they got a first-hand look into the 25 different careers KRONES offers in commercial, industrial, and technical fields. They had an opportunity to talk about the programmes with current trainees and their trainers in the different divisions. Talking with peers made for a more relaxed atmosphere and reduced the young people’s natural inhibitions. We are pleased to report that around half of the teenagers who attended »Training Day« were girls. We also had a strong showing of technically inclined girls at our »Girls Day« event in April 2010. The total of 150 participants at all of our German plants was twice the previous year’s total. KRONES trainees got to play the role of trainers at the event.

Labour practices/society Labour practices – Employee qualifications 60 Labour practices Responsibility for safety and health A family-owned enterprise, KRONES has always placed special importance on sustainable, employee-friendly personnel policy. Preserving and promoting the health and safety of our workforce and promoting their professional development are among our company’s established goals. In order to prevent workplace accidents and work-related illness, all of our workflows are designed with the safety and health of our employees in mind. We also offer a variety of options to help our employees stay physically and mentally fit and help them with the challenging task of striking a healthy work-life balance. In close cooperation with our employees, our managerial staff work out and agree concrete goals and actions for ensuring that all workplaces and workflows protect KRONES is not only interested in safety and health. Comprehensive checks ensure that the resulting measures are improfits. We are also interested in our employees’ well-being. In my plemented and that safety rules are adhered to.

We are committed to complying unconditionally with Germany’s Occupational Martina Vilser, assistant to the Health and Safety Act and the Works Council Constitution Act. Other licensing, reguWorks Council latory, and statutory requirements are also followed at all KRONES sites. As far as technically feasible and economically reasonable, we go above and beyond the minimum requirements of the law, implementing our own policies to further increase safety. Occupational safety honoured In Germany, training on occupational safety and health is an integral part of our Labour practices/society continuing education programme. The more than 600 KRONES employees who work at construction sites around the world are advised by a dedicated safety engineer. In 15 visits to construction sites in 2010, the safety engineer observed our occupational safety standards at work and contributed to increasing occupational safety. In 2010, our effort to more deeply integrate occupational safety into the planning of new lines proved very effective. From day one, it increased employee safety on site and reduced down times and costs. Our external contractors’ employees are also closely integrated into our training programmes and informed about KRONES’ work safety rules. The number of work-related Reportable work-related accidents per 1,000 employees (>3 days lost time) at KRONES AG accidents per 1,000 employees at KRONES is far below the industry 45 average. The figure was down 40 slightly in 2010. 35 30 25 20 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 KRONES AG based on 7,994 employees (excluding KRONES subsidiary MAINTEC) BGMS (Berufsgenossenschaft Metall Nord Süd – employers’ liability insurance association for metalworkers) Labour practices – Responsibility for safety and health 61 To further increase work safety and eliminate potential hazards, KRONES began systematically recording all accidents – even those resulting in only minor injuries – and near-accidents in 2009 and taking actions to prevent future incidents. The number of reportable work-related accidents has been declining steadily for Work-related accidents at KRONES AG years – proof that our efforts in the area of occupational safety are paying off. At 18.0 resulting in one or more days of lost (previous year: 20.1), KRONES’ figure for reportable work-related accidents per 1,000 time per 1,000 employees employees (> 3 days lost time) was far better than the industry average of around 37 (see page 60). KRONES began reporting work-related accidents that result in as little 26.2 27.1 26.3 as one day of lost time at its German plants in 2008. In 2010, this figure was 26.3 per 1,000 employees (previous year: 27.1). As low as they are, KRONES is not satisfied with these figures. Every work-related accident is one too many. That is one reason KRONES will hire two additional employees in the field of occupational safety in 2011. Our aim is to further decrease the number 2008 2009 2010 of work-related accidents through training, information, and even more intensive risk assessment. Emergency management In 2010 KRONES continued to improve its preparedness for sudden emergencies such KRONES conducts regular emergency as major fires, bomb threats, employee kidnappings, natural disasters, and global drills to ensure that we are ready to respond quickly and effectively to pandemics. situations like fires, employee kidnappings, and natural disasters. The company has introduced a crisis management system that defines key responsibilities and procedures in a crisis situation. Emergency teams are an important part of this system and have been formed at all KRONES AG production sites to be available on site quickly. The teams are made up primarily of voluntary first responders, Labour practices/society safety officers, fire safety assistants, and factory security personnel. We hold exercises for the crisis management team to train in the various processes and skills. KRONES’ in-house medical service keeps employees fit for service around the world In ageing societies with fewer and fewer young people, it becomes increasingly important for companies to maintain, restore, and improve their employees’ health and productivity for the long term. A high-quality in-house medical service is an important tool here. The medical staff identifies health deficits early through regular screenings and physical fitness checkups and helps employees remedy them. For example, our in-house medical service provides preventive checkups and courses on topics including back health, relaxation techniques, stress management, nutrition, and fitness in collaboration with our company health insurance fund. The service also helps employees prepare for assignments abroad, providing information about various local diseases and important vaccinations. KRONES has a specialist trained in tropical medicine on staff to check employees’ fitness for service in the tropics. KRONES employees who are preparing for personal vacations can also get the vaccinations they need. Labour practices – Responsibility for safety and health 62 Another important topic is medical preparation for projects abroad. The in-house medical service offers the following: Fitness screenings and preventive care for employees Emergency kits for construction sites Organisation of medical care on site Training for project and site managers (first aid/emergency response) KRONES’ aim is to establish a global health management system to ensure highquality medical care for KRONES employees working around the world. The fact that KRONES takes on Professional health management responsibility in the world’s poorer regions shows me how socially reBut promoting the health and well-being of our employees is not only the job of the sponsible a global company can be. in-house medical service. It is also the responsibility of KRONES and its management. Stefan Wagner, order processing Only healthy employees are able to perform at their best. That is why KRONES is establishing a professional health management service in an effort to reduce healthrelated absenteeism. The goal is to better identify and remedy the causes of healthrelated absences among our highly qualified employees. We view health-oriented management as a shared responsibility of our managers and our human resources management. Talks that focus on health topics play an important role in determining the causes of absences and appropriate remedial actions. In cooperation with the Works Council, the disabled employees’ representative, the counselling service, and the in-house medical service, the results of such talks are analysed and translated into suitable preventive measures. Labour practices/society KRONES held its first-ever health fair at one of the German plants in November 2010 Absenteeism at KRONES AG to inform employees about the various aspects of promoting good health. At the fair, employees learned about a variety of topics, including stress management, back and 3.9% 3.8% 4.0% posture problems, and nutrition. The health fair and the wealth of information presented were very well received by employees. Counselling – taking care of our people KRONES’ counselling service is a trustworthy partner for employees needing help with work-related or personal problems such as addiction, debt, separation and di2008 2009 2010 vorce, mobbing, and burnout. Counselling services range from organising hospital stays to reassignment within the company to mediating conflicts. The counselling service works internally with the Works Council, the in-house medical service, the disabled employees’ representative, the company health insurance fund, and the human resources department. Cooperation with external partners such as doctors, clinics, and therapists are at least equally important. Labour practices – Responsibility for safety and health 63 In addition, KRONES relies on active in-company integration management to help Disabled employees at KRONES AG employees who are no longer able to perform their original jobs for health reasons 5.6% 5.8% to remain active, contributing members of the workforce.

The number of disabled employees at KRONES reflects the success of our integration efforts. At 5.8%, the share of disabled employees at KRONES was well above the statutory requirement in 2010. Here, too, the prior-year figures have been adjusted because trainees are 2008 2009 2010 no longer included in the calculation.

The Regensburger Rückenschule, a back care clinic, offers BKK members professional guidance for strengthening their back muscles – and the BKK covers 85% of the cost for the first 24 units. This benefit has been very popular among employees. The welfare fund Hermann-Kronseder-Unterstützungskasse e.V. provides additional health-related support for KRONES employees. Employees may receive benefits of up to €600 per year above and beyond the payouts from the health insurance fund. Labour practices/society This fund kicks in, for example, when sick pay has been exhausted or has expired, for hospital stays or rest cures, or for dentures, eyeglasses or contact lenses, or hearing aids. In 2010, the fund paid out around €178,000 to employees. Another important element of health management at KRONES is the company sports club, which offers a variety of sports such as football (soccer), tennis, shuffleboard, running, and badminton. Apart from the health benefits, sports also give co-workers Full-time and part-time employment an opportunity to get to know each other outside the workplace environment and at KRONES AG promote teamwork and cohesion.

We give the employee’s partner an opportunity to visit the new location before the transfer so he or she can get to know it and evaluate it. KRONES also helps employees find appropriate schools for their children at their new location and offers the entire family an opportunity to prepare for life in a new country through the intercultural school in Passau, Germany. KRONES assumes all of the associated costs. If and when the employees and their families return to the company’s headquarters and nearby Regensburg, the family’s children can continue to attend an international school. KRONES supports the Regensburg International School for this reason.

Labour practices – Responsibility for safety and health 66 Society Open dialogue with all stakeholders Viable solutions for doing business sustainably can only be found through dialogue with all stakeholder groups. To get a sense of the various groups’ interests, we regularly seek contact with all stakeholders – in Neutraubling, in our region, and around the globe. Our stakeholders include employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, government agencies, politicians, trade associations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), scientists and academics, and the general public. We are committed to a proactive, frank and open information policy. We systematically analyse and assess opportunities and risks relating to CSR topics in ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders. That helps us to identify potential weak points and new challenges early. And with that, we are minimising risks for the company, strengthening our stakeholders’ trust in us, and safeguarding the company’s reputation. In direct contact with our various Policymakers Customers Scientists and academics stakeholder groups, KRONES analyses the opportunities and risks The general public krones NGOs associated with the different areas of CSR. Suppliers Employees Cultural institutions Direct contact is extremely important here. For this reason, we organise a variety of events worldwide each year. The events range from regular »Open Days« for employees and their families to »Training Days« to round-table discussions with stakeholder groups and participation in international initiatives. The KRONES Academy hosted an extremely successful »Expert Dialogue« with our Labour practices/society customers in Neutraubling in 2010. More than 50 experts from major bottling plants and various sectors of the beverage industry attended and shared their practical experiences with production and service. Most of the presentations were made by KRONES customers, who laid out strategies and solutional approaches. Symposium participants had opportunities to follow up on the various topics in discussion forums. A number of new product ideas – including some for our sustainability programme enviro – arose from this event. We hold a »Training Day« at our plants in Neutraubling and Nittenau, Germany, every year. The numerous participants get a look at the career options and training facilities we offer and can flesh this out with details in one-on-one conversations with instructors and current trainees. In addition, we now offer Saturday company tours to our staff and their families on a bimonthly basis so that our employees can show their families their workplace. Society – Open dialogue with all stakeholders 67 Leading the way in modern social media communication Technology-oriented business-to-business (B2B) companies are often perceived Krones is also a leader when it as unlikely candidates for the social media, with little to offer in that realm. But comes to communicating with stakeholders through Facebook, KRONES has been active in numerous online communities since early 2010. We’ve Twitter, YouTube, and Xing. been posting about interesting projects and daily life in the company on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Xing. Through active dialog with various target groups – customers and their employees, journalists, job applicants, and our own employees – KRONES has established an appealing, authentic image on these sites. And our efforts have been rewarded, with second prize in our category in the »B2B Twitterer of the Year (B2BTOTY)« awards. The awards recognise B2B companies that are especially active and informative on Twitter. An example of our active information policy alongside the publication »KRONES Magazine« is the KRONES newsletter, which has been published monthly since February 2010. It shares news and technology trends with customers and employees. Readers are also invited to submit topic suggestions to the editor, thus encouraging an ongoing exchange of information. To keep employees worldwide abreast of developments within the KRONES Group, we published five issues of the »Inside KRONES« employee magazine in 2010 in German, English, and Italian. In addition, the new intranet »KRONES inside« gives all KRONES employees a modern communication platform for exchanging and finding information. KRONES stays in regular, direct contact with analysts, individual shareholders, and Labour practices/society institutional investors. We hold analyst conferences and conduct regular meetings with investors to keep the capital markets supplied with comprehensive information. We also maintain a policy of openness at press conferences and interviews. Sustainability topics are gaining importance in all of these forums. KRONES’ high environmental and social standards recognised oekom research, a highly regarded agency for sustainable, socially responsible inoekom research rated Krones the vesting, awarded KRONES »prime« status once again in 2010. Of the 3,100 companies best among German machinery manufacturers. the agency rates in 45 industries worldwide, only every sixth is given the »prime« designation. KRONES was rated the best among German machinery manufacturers and holds eighth place in the industry worldwide. This positive assessment of our environmental and social standards through oekom research expands our pool of potential investors considerably. In Europe alone, some €5,000 billion are being invested exclusively in shares of companies that meet the very strict criteria of rating agencies specialising in socially responsible investment. The reason for this is that analyst studies have shown that many particularly socially responsible companies generate above-average profits – in business and on the stock markets. Society – Open dialogue with all stakeholders 68 Society Involvement in charitable causes and culture The principles of sustainability also apply to our civic responsibilities. Beyond our business obligations, we are also committed to doing our part with respect to society, culture, the sciences, and academics. In other words, we are committed to being good corporate citizens. For KRONES, sharing such engagement with our employees is part and parcel of corporate social responsibility. A good example of this is a special fundraiser that KRONES held in collaboration with employees in 2010 to raise money for earthquake victims in Haiti. All of our employees company-wide were encouraged to donate and KRONES’ charitable giving committee added to the total amount collected. Regional KRONES has been a partner and supporter of the Regensburg International School (RIS) since 2010. RIS is open to children from the local community and around the world. It provides families in the region an alternative to the local schools. RIS opened in 2009 and offers schooling in English to children of international and local families in Regensburg and Eastern Bavaria. The school is committed to providing a high-quality, challenging, international education. Its aim is to develop in each student the ability to think critically and creatively and to help all of its students grow into reflective, independent life-long learners who are socially responsible, concerned for the environment, and able to face the complex challenges of the modern world. KRONES AG also regards support for universities as an important contribution to society. As a patron of the Hochschulstiftung Regensburg foundation, the company Labour practices/society supports various events and promotes cultural exchange among students at the local University of Applied Sciences. As a global company, KRONES feels an obligation to financially support international schools and universities. KRONES has been a supporter of Regensburg International School (RIS) near company headquarters since 2010. Society – Open dialogue with all stakeholders 69 Labour practices/society Around the world Besides the »usual« donations to charitable organisations, the company has decided to provide substantial long-term support to the Water for the World foundation. In its role as a corporate sponsor, KRONES supports projects all over the world that give people in developing countries access to clean drinking water. Water they need for drinking, cooking, and washing and for irrigating their fields. Our guiding principles here are sustainability and helping people help themselves. We concentrate our support on rural projects and ensure that they actually benefit families, women, and children. We also invest in education and training, so that people can take charge of their own water supplies. KRONES has supported the Dhulikhel Hospital in Nepal since 2008. The hospital provides high-quality medical care to a large portion of Nepal’s population. Society – Open dialogue with all stakeholders 70 KRONES funds construction of a dental clinic in Nepal Through »Water for the World«, KRONES has been supporting the expansion of Dhulikhel Hospital in Nepal, 30 kilometres northeast of the nation’s capital Kathmandu, since 2008. The aim of KRONES’ long-term involvement is to ensure that Nepal’s largely poor population has access to affordable, high-quality medical care. People with little or no income are treated free of charge at Dhulikhel Hospital. As part of our engagement, Caroline Kronseder, wife of Executive Board Chairman Volker Kronseder, visited Nepal at the end of 2010 and laid the cornerstone for a new dental clinic that is being funded by donations from KRONES AG. Prof. Ram Shrestha, director of Dhulikhel Hospital, welcomed the expansion: »In Nepal, dental care is currently available only in Kathmandu«. In the future, the dental clinic will not only treat patients with dental problems – preventive care will play an important role. Dhulikhel Hospital serves patients from all regions and income levels in Nepal. KRONES’ international giving is bundled into contributions to the Water for the World foundation. Those funds have already helped to build wells and water lines in Nepal. The foundation also organised and funded the water distribution and saniLabour practices/society Society – Open dialogue with all stakeholders 71 tation system for Dhulikhel Hospital and its outreach centre in the remote village of Bolde Phediche. In collaboration with Regensburg physicians, we are also helping Labour practices/society to provide the hospital with valuable new medical devices such as incubators, trephines and burrs, and ultrasound equipment. The hospital, which was built 15 years ago, now serves around 100,000 outpatients and 10,000 inpatients each year. Those are the official figures. But the actual numbers are likely far higher because each patient who registers for treatment can later be seen or treated by other specialists under the same initial fee – so those additional visits are free of charge. »By contrast, someone with no money seeking treatment at a hospital in Kathmandu will not even be allowed in the door«, explains Professor Shrestha. Despite the exceptionally high quality of care, the public clinic is still funded entirely through donations. Because Dhulikhel Hospital is a non-profit and operates under the principles of social equity, KRONES has made the long-term support of this project in collaboration with other companies and physicians in the Regensburg region part of its CSR strategy. A number of actions and site visits are planned for 2011.

In some cases, it may consist of many various components that are produced along the stages of value creation. Several stages of value creation constitute a value chain. Value creation calculation The value created is determined by subtracting from the company’s performance (sales revenues and other income) the advance payments necessary for bought-in goods and materials, depreciation and amortisation, and other expenditures. The origination of the value creation is set against its use.
