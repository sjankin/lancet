Opinions on economic development going forward varied widely, torn between still positive sentiment in the emerging markets and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. This volatility has been a major challenge for companies. Already in the beginning of 2011, KRONES began preparing itself for such uncertainties and stronger demand fluctuations with its »Value« strategy programme. With »Value«, we aim to create sustainable added value – for our customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, society as a whole, and of course, for KRONES. As you will see in this report, we achieved this goal once again in 2011. Many interesting examples illustrate how KRONES is pursuing a sustainable corporate strategy independent of short-term fluctuations. To attain the medium-term growth targets under the »Value« programme, we have Krones increased its workforce hired over 800 new employees bringing our staff total to 11,389 persons in the year considerably in 2011, laying the foundation for meeting our under review. We have also permanently hired all of our highly qualified trainees as medium-term growth targets well as many of our temporary staff to keep their know-how in the company. within our »Value« strategy. Our enviro sustainability programme is another part of our long-term strategy. A growing number of our machines are being quality certified by TÜV SÜD and more and more of our customers can enjoy the enviro machines’ economical use of valuable resources in their daily operations. Foreword by the Executive Board 3 As the market leader in machinery for filling beverages into PET bottles, we have always been keen on recycling this valuable plastic material. Our PET recycling systems that process used PET bottles into food-grade recycled flakes save valuable resources. The economic and ecological benefits are so clear that the European Commission decided last summer to support our process. krones compact We also want to further optimise and improve resource use in our own production. A big step in this direction was introducing our new energy management system, which was audited by TÜV SÜD for the first time in 2012. Yet, technological solutions are not all there is to KRONES’ sense of responsibility towards future generations. KRONES maintains constant dialogue with all relevant stakeholder groups to understand their wishes and incorporate them as best possible. KRONES made great progress in sustainability in 2011. However, we will not rest on our laurels and have instead set ourselves even more ambitious goals for 2012 (see pages 94 to 97) – and we aim to achieve them. Volker Kronseder Chairman of the Executive Board Human Resources and Corporate Communications Foreword by the Executive Board 4 For a technology leader, new products and innovations are essential for long-term success. We again made great progress in this regard in 2011. The machines and lines from our enviro sustainability programme are gaining increasing acceptance on krones compact the market and saving our customers valuable resources in daily use. Another big success in the year under review was the European Commission’s decision to support our PET recycling systems. To better bundle our employees’ knowledge and expertise and bring it to bear in innovations, we have created »Idea Space«, an excellent platform for sharing sugChristoph Klenk gestions for improvement and inventions. Member of the Executive Board Finance and Information Management (since 1 January 2012) Technology, Research and Development (until 31 December 2011) Christoph Klenk Customer satisfaction is the measure of our work. That is why our sales team strives not only to acquire new business but also to cultivate and improve relations with our existing customers. My team has always kept an open ear for our customers’ wishes and requirements. Our popular envirocertified machines and lines are an excellent example as they help our customers to save valuable resources and thus money. But also the annual certification of our sustainability report by TÜV SÜD is a big advantage for our customers, providing them with documented proof that KRONES is a strong and Rainulf Diepold dependable partner. This also helps our customers Member of the Executive Board to secure their own CSR measures across their enSales and Marketing tire supply chains for the long term. Rainulf Diepold The Executive Board 5 With the recent certification of our energy management system, we added an important component to our integrated management system (IMS). That has brought us a big step closer to our goal of sustainably conserving resources in our own production. krones compact By further expanding our Lifecycle Service (LCS) Centres and the related services, we have boosted customer loyalty and helped to reinforce our longterm commercial success. Conserving resources and being close to our customers are key elements of our »Value« programme. Werner Frischholz Member of the Executive Board Operations and Service Werner Frischholz When deciding which R&D projects to pursue, our unwavering focus is on the added value we can generate for our customers with new and better products. Our primary aim is to reduce energy and media consumption and increase line uptime – by shortening makeready times, automating troubleshooting, and simplifying cleaning and maintenance. All new developments at KRONES must meet the standards of our enviro sustainability programme, which is an essential part of our corporate strategy.

Thomas Ricker The Executive Board 6 KRONES bids a fond farewell to Hans-Jürgen Thaus Hans-Jürgen Thaus served as Chief Financial Officer and Deputy Chairman of the Executive Board of KRONES AG for 15 years. Mr. Thaus, together with his fellow Executive Board members, made important contributions to the company’s success. Having reached the prescribed age limit, Mr. Thaus stepped down from the board effective 31 December 2011. krones compact Hans-Jürgen Thaus managed various departments during his tenure.

To this Group. end, we not only monitor the measures currently in place but also try to develop new ideas for improvements in continuous dialogue with various stakeholders. krones compact The CSR committee held four meetings in Neutraubling in the year under review. In these sessions, CSR committee members or the respective KRONES project heads presented, discussed, and resolved upon various CSR-related issues and topics. The main issue at the first meeting in March 2011 was our CSR strategy up to 2015. In this respect, we determined our objectives in terms of economy, ecology, labour practices, and society and resolved initial measures. We also analysed, updated, and amended the contents of our 2010 CSR report, which was published shortly thereafter. At our second meeting in June 2011, Volker Kronseder presented the goals and actions under our »Value« strategy programme. Our objectives are in line with our brand claim »We do more« – generating »more value« for our staff, customers, and shareholders. With our »Value« programme, KRONES wants to counter the increasing volatility in business and thus in demand for our products. In this endeavour, we must respect KRONES’ core values: »securing value for a strong future«, »creating value with powerful solutions«, and »respecting values in effective dialogue«. In the meeting, the csr committee was also informed about on the status of our enviro sustainability programme. Our customers are increasingly seeking the transparency of con­sumption values and sustainable development that our product portfolio offers. This secures KRONES’ role as a leader in the industry. The EvoLite strapping machine, launched at the interpack trade fair, has been a huge success. EvoLite met the enviro standards easily and is yet another example of how enviro delivers impressive innovation in new products. To advance our CSR strategy further and resolve TÜV SÜD’s main criticism, we decided to make collecting key environmental data a top priority for KRONES and that introducing an energy management system was of critical importance. Already in our third meeting, in September 2011, the project lead presented in detail the advantages for KRONES of having an energy management system certified under DIN ISO 50001 along with an exact timetable. In addition, CSR Officer Kristina Ebenbeck informed the committee that KRONES had met all requirements and joined the VDMA’s (German Engineering Federation) sustainability initiative BLUECOMPETENCE in the third quarter of 2011. The initiative is designed to promote sustainable development work and prepare durable standards for sustainable products and production in the machinery sector. Report from the CSR committee 8 The main agenda item at our final meeting last November was an extensive report Social counselling is at the heart of by CSR team leader for labour practices and society issues, Wolfgang Bernkopf, on his KRONES. That is why the CSR committee invited KRONES’ head social primary activities in KRONES’ counselling service. He stressed the importance of incounsellor, Wolfgang Bernkopf, to company integration management to best facilitate employee reintegration into the report extensively on the tasks and workplace after long-term illness so that no valuable know-how is lost. In addition challenges of his department. to presenting the entire range of counselling services at KRONES, Mr. Bernkopf also reported that the incidence of mental illness has been rising dramatically for years. krones compact There are many and complex reasons for this. Burnout syndrome is also affecting KRONES. Here too, there are always several factors involved, both at home and on the job. Burnout is generally a long-term illness. According to Mr. Bernkopf, burnout syndrome is pushing the medical and therapeutic services to the limits of their capacities, often resulting in long wait times before therapy can start. As a first step to help our employees, KRONES has launched a pilot project with a free external hotline for stress and burnout problems. At the end of the CSR committee meeting on 21 November 2011, committee members defined their main tasks as follows: Prof. Dr. Erich Kohnhäuser, science and research; Prof. Dr. Thomas Schwartz, global issues and corporate ethics; Philipp Graf von und zu Lerchenfeld, politics and society; Claudia Islinger, labour practices and social issues; Roland Pokorny, dialogue and stakeholders.

Mr. Pokorny, your CSR committee responsibility is »diakrones compact logue and stakeholders«. What exactly does that involve? My job is to cultivate communication with all interest groups (stakeholders) worldwide. These include employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, government agencies, politicians, trade associations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), scientists and academics, and the general public. We want to maintain an active and open information policy for them. What do you want to communicate to stakeholders? First, we have to make clear to them what exactly KRONES stands for. We have recently In our »Value« strategy programme, developed a mission statement that defines our self-image and the company’s basic KRONES has developed a master plan for tackling future challenges. The principles. strategy needs to be well communicated both internally and externally. And what are those? At the heart of KRONES are our core values: »securing value for a strong future«, »creating value with powerful solutions«, and »respecting values in effective dialogue«. That is what KRONES stands for. What does that mean in concrete terms? Our »Value« strategy programme translates KRONES’ mission statement and values into individual statements and concrete actions. It gives us direction for our future. Every measure is aligned with one of the core values (see strategy page 32). Does that mean you will focus your communication on the »Value« strategy programme? That will certainly be my main task at first. With »Value«, KRONES is working to establish a master plan for tackling all future challenges. The individual strategies that the different divisions have developed so far, including the CSR strategy, are being bundled and prioritised within the »Value« framework. »Value« needs to be well communicated both internally and externally. In 2012, I will mostly focus on internal communication. How do you intend to communicate »Value« to the workforce? The leadership at all of our sites will discuss »Value« and our mission statement with their staff. This will make employees aware that every individual can and should contribute to bringing our mission statement and strategy to life. Moreover, we plan to communicate »Value« to our employees through our intranet, our employee magazine, image clips, and posters.

Why has antimony been found in beverages that came from PET bottles? Is antimony harmful to humans? Some time ago, Heidelberg University’s Institute for Earth Sciences found antimony in beverages that came from PET krones compact bottles and this made the news. Antimony compounds are used as catalysts in PET production.

This makes KRONES a dependable partner for our customers, employees, shareholders, and suppliers. Our financial strength gives us independence. We use resources wisely in order to safeguard this freedom for the long term. Our sites around the world form a global value chain that serves as the very foundation of our success. Each of our core modules is built at only one site worldwide, with exceptional cost-effectiveness. These sites concentrate our expertise and experience in the relevant technology.

KRONES – We do more KRONES compact – Our attitudes and actions 30 KRONES code of conduct As the market leader, KRONES intends to be, and ultimately has to be, the standardsetter – and this includes our ethical behaviour. Sustainability has always been an important part of KRONES’ corporate strategy. This places high demands on each and every one of us. We want to ensure that our actions are always irreproachable, correct, and exemplary. For this reason, we have drafted a code of conduct on the basis krones compact of the shared values that are our corporate guidelines. The aim of the code of conduct is to ensure company-wide compliance with laws, standards, and guidelines in order to create a working environment of integrity, respect, fairness, and accountability. It is binding for all KRONES employees – including the Executive Board, management, and every member of our staff worldwide. All employees are urged to not only comply with the guidelines in the code of conduct in a formal sense but to live and breathe their meaning and purpose. Only in this way can they serve as the basis of an open and vibrant culture of compliance. In the interest of all employees, violations of the code of conduct are systematically investigated and disciplinary action taken. Of course, we want KRONES to be recognised as the market and technology leader. But we also want our customers, employees, suppliers, and shareholders as well as government agencies, institutions, and the general public to perceive us as a reputable, trustworthy, and dependable partner. That is crucial to retaining and expanding our position as the market leader. The complete KRONES code of conduct is available online at www.krones.com/downloads/Coco_2010_e.pdf. Suppliers’ code KRONES has developed a suppliers’ code that commits suppliers to act responsibly. The suppliers’ code is available online for download at www.krones.com/downloads/ Liko_2010_e.pdf. The code covers safety, health, the environment, quality, human rights, employee standards, and preventing and fighting corruption. In order to ensure compliance, our quality assurance team performs audits on site at the suppliers’ facilities. In addition, KRONES seeks to use vendors that are also certified by an in­ dependent institution. KRONES has developed a suppliers’ code that commits suppliers to act responsibly. The suppliers’ code is Corporate governance available online for download at www.krones.com/downloads/ For KRONES, the German Corporate Governance Code is an integral part of goverLiko_2010_e.pdf nance. The Code presents essential statutory regulations for the management and supervision (governance) of German listed companies and contains internationally and nationally recognised standards for good and responsible corporate governance. The management of KRONES takes the principles and rules of corporate governance into account in all business activities which are aimed at systematically increasing the company’s value for the long term. More information and details on our statement of compliance as well as the compensation report are published in our Annual Report (pages 110 to 111 and 119 to 121) and online (www.krones.com). KRONES compact – Our attitudes and actions 31 Sustainability in our organisation KRONES AG has systematically anchored its sustainability strategy in the company Krones has established an organiby way of group-wide standards and an organisational structure that includes sational structure for addressing sustainability. The CSR committee clearly defined responsibilities (see chart below). plays an important role here and has far-reaching authority. CSR committee The most important body in this respect is the CSR committee, which is endowed krones compact with far-reaching authority. The CSR committee monitors compliance with the group-wide CSR guidelines and initiates open, neutral dialogue with stakeholders. Another of the committee’s core duties is to oversee implementation of the com­ pany’s CSR goals and intervene where necessary. CSR specialist teams These teams consist of representatives from various departments and define sustainability-related goals, actions, and tasks. The CSR officer brings these proposals to the CSR committee. In collaboration with the Executive Board, the CSR committee in turn ensures that sustainability issues are translated into appropriate actions throughout the group.

The aim of our »Value« strategy is to create »added value« for our company, our employees, our customers, our suppliers, our investors, and society as a whole. Because the strategies pursue parallel objectives, it only makes sense that the CSR strategy will contribute to our company’s krones compact long-term success as a component of »Value« in the future. Of course, the CSR targets we set last year remain unchanged. KRONES will continue to work toward achieving these targets. Beginning with this year’s sustainability report, we will be reporting on individual actions and progress in the chapters on economy, environment, labour practices, and society and in the section on our goals and actions. »Value« is about actively shaping our company’s future and carrying on the successes of the past. With »Value«, we want to keep KRONES on course for sustainable, profitable growth and strengthen our brand values Securing value for a strong future Creating value with powerful solutions Respecting values in effective dialogue For this reason, this report includes a discussion of two CSR topics from 2011 relating to each of these three brand values. We believe the introduction of our energy management system (pages 24 and 25) and our PET recycling process, which is supported by the European Commission (page 16) are »securing value for a strong future«. The newly launched »Brainpool« (pages 34 and 35) and the enviro sustainability programme (pages 36 to 39) are described in detail under the heading »creating value with powerful solutions«. Finally, a discussion of our human resources strategy and strong partnership with university students (pages 62 to 65) shows how KRONES is »respecting values in effective dialogue«. The success of our strategy is reflected in the fact that KRONES was one of the first companies to meet the strict standards of the German Engineering Federation’s (VDMA) new sustainability initiative, BLUECOMPETENCE. The programme aims to become the leading initiative for ecological product and production design and for innovative environmental technologies in the mechanical engineering sector. With our CSR targets and the enviro programme, KRONES meets almost all of the criteria for inclusion in the initiative (300 points out of a possible 320 points; with a minimum of 170 points required for inclusion). That underscores our leadership in terms of sustainability.

In 2011, KRONES once again benefited from our sector’s growth and even grew faster than the market. Sales revenue at KRONES increased 14.1% (€307 million) to €2,480 billion. Apart from the general economic recovery, these figures also reflect KRONES’ technological leadership on the market and the continuing success of the »Value« strategy programme. The company’s bottom line was positive in 2011, with consolidated net income of €43.7 million (previous year: €50.9 million). The fact that net income was down slightly despite the increase in sales revenue was due in part to a provision recognised for legal disputes in the USA and in part to a higher tax rate. KRONES Group net income (€ million) Due to one-time expenses, consolidated net income was 101.8 106.5 down in 2011, to €43.7 million. 100 50.9 43.7 50 0 –34.5 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Economic | Economic responsibility 41 Krones maintains focus on »Value« With the »Value« strategy programme, KRONES intends to create added value for customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, society as a whole, and of course, KRONES itself. Under »Value«, we intend to achieve sales revenue growth of seven percent on average and a pre-tax return on sales (ROS) of seven percent. To achieve this, it is imperative that we continue to improve our relationships with our cus­ tomers.

Nieru Rutere John Economic Technical mechanic, Kenya To further ensure such access, we have tested, analysed, and optimised all of our sales processes. The result is a »Lead to Project« (L2P) process that ensures uniform sales process flows throughout the KRONES group. The process extends from identification of potential customers (leads) to finalisation of contracts to customer satisfaction analyses. The new CRM system maps the entire process. As a result, our sales activities are more efficient and we are able to serve our customers’ needs faster and better. We are confident that the new CRM strategy will strengthen customer loyalty and improve our chances of winning new customers. Economic | Economic responsibility 42 KRONES Group value added calculation More than 90% of KRONES’ value added went to our employees in the form of wages, salaries, and social Taxes 4.0% (€32.8 million) security contributions. Dividends 1.5% (€12.1 million) Other operating expenses 17.5% (€457 million) Goods and services purchased Value added 48.6% (€1,272 million) Employees 90.6% (€738 million) 31.2% (€815 million) Depreciation and amortisation on non-current assets 2.7% (€70 million) Value added remaining within the company 3.9% (€32.1 million) Total operating performance 2011: €2,614 million (100%) Economic Value added increased further The value added calculation presented here shows the KRONES Group’s contributions to the economy and society. A company’s value added is calculated by deducting the expenses for production – that is, cost of goods and services purchased, depreciation and amortisation on non-current assets, and other operating expenses – from total operating performance. The result for KRONES for the year under review is value added of €815 million (previous year: €753 million). The lion’s share – 90.6% or €738.5 million – went towards our employees. In addition to wages and salaries (€613.5 million), KRONES spent €125.0 million on social security contributions, pension plans, and employee benefits. In addition, €32.8 million or 4.0% of value added went to the state in the form of tax payments. Shareholders received €12.1 million or 1.5% in the form of dividends. Thus, €32.1 million in value added remained within the company in 2011. This amount is available for expansion projects and, thus, for funding future growth. Increasing capital spending KRONES stands by its conviction that providing leading technology and services is the only way to achieve long-term, sustainable value added. For this reason, the company has a long tradition of investing heavily in its employees, production facilities, and research and development. KRONES invested around €106.0 million (previous year: €81.5 million) in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets during the reporting period.

That means KRONES is a dependable partner to its customers, helping to ensure that they and their employees can also serve as dependable links in the value chain for the long term. Another of KRONES’ goals is to conserve resources in our own production. We achieved this goal in 2011. Energy consumption relative to sales revenue was down. In other words, we used less energy for each euro in sales we generated. Detailed environmental data is presented in the »Environmental« section of this report, beginning on page 56. Krones is investing heavily in decentralised service business Lifecycle Service (LCS) bundles all aspects of KRONES’ service business and employs more than 1,800 highly qualified people. LCS covers all maintenance and repair services, spare parts and change parts, individual services, software tools, and training. KRONES has for years invested heavily in Lifecycle Services (LCS) in order to provide our customers with a comprehensive range of top-quality KRONES products and services – any time and anywhere around the globe. To ensure smooth production at our customers’ plants, we must have service specialists and spare parts available locally worldwide. KRONES maintains more than 40 subsidiaries and offices around the world. In addition, we have in recent years established Service Centres at strategic locations to serve as decentralised support bases. Economic | Production 45 We further expanded these Service Centres in 2011. As in years past, a large portion of our investment here went into our Chinese service base in Taicang. Last year KRONES hired around 300 new employees in our various service offices. We attach great importance to ensuring that our employees speak our customers’ language and understand their culture. By improving the availability of parts in our decentralised warehouses, we were able to further enhance the level of service offered by our international Service Centres in 2011. When contracting installation services abroad, we carefully ensure that the foreign subcontractors meet our strict environmental and social standards (see the discussion of our suppliers’ code on page 30).

Economic | Production 46 High standards for suppliers and logistics Our suppliers and their reliability for on-time delivery are critical to our own Krones uses local suppliers. That benefits companies in the region efforts to keep up an excellent delivery record. The long-standing, fair relationships and the shorter transport distances we maintain with our business partners help ensure this dependability. make for lower CO2 emissions. We purchase raw materials, products, and services from partners in some 60 countries. We expect these partners to operate in accordance with our company’s ethical values (see the discussion of our suppliers’ code on page 30). As a company that operates on the just-in-time principle, KRONES sometimes has to give priority to speedy delivery to the production and delivery chain over environmentally optimised transport. Nevertheless, KRONES strives to further optimise the efficiency of transport and logistics. We achieve this in part by increasing our own vertical depth of production, thereby eliminating many supply transports, and in part by using suppliers that are close to our production sites as much as possible. And wherever possible, KRONES relies on ship or rail to deliver our machines and Economic lines instead of air transport. Risk management is an important factor for success Our »Value« strategy assigns considerable importance to improving and refining our risk management system. That is because KRONES is exposed to a variety of risks that are inextricably linked with doing business globally. We continuously monitor all significant business processes to identify risks early and to actively manage and limit them. An internal control system with which we record, analyse, and assess all relevant financial and operating risks (from liquidity risks to personnel risks) is an integral part of KRONES’ risk management system. We monitor all material risks and any countermeasures already taken in a detailed, ongoing process that entails planning, information, and control. We are continually expanding and improving our risk management system on the basis of practical experience. The system consists of the following modules: risk analysis, risk monitoring, and risk planning and control. At present, KRONES does not foresee any physical, regulatory, market, cost, or legal risks worldwide that could arise from climate change. Therefore, the company is not currently discussing actions relating to such risks. Details on risk management and the risk categories can be found in the risk report in our 2011 Annual Report. Economic | Production 47 Quality assurance expanded to include »energy« The name KRONES has always been synonymous with top quality. As the market leader for beverage and packaging technology, we feel an obligation to always provide our customers with the latest technology and the highest quality. But the concept of quality encompasses more than products and manufacturing processes. It also stands for our responsibility to protect the environment and to comply with standards for occupational safety and health. In obtaining certification of our IMS for all of our sites in Germany in 2009, KRONES also strengthened its role as a leader in this area. The existing quality management systems were expanded into an integrated management system (IMS) for quality (DIN EN ISO 9001), environmental proWith KOSME’s portfolio, KRONES shows that we are not just contection (DIN EN ISO 14001), occupational safety (BS OHSAS 18001), and information cerned about global companies but technology service management (ISO 20000) and certified by TÜV SÜD. that we also place equal importance on producers in the lower In May 2012, TÜV SÜD audited and certified our new energy management system output ranges. under the DIN ISO 50001 standard. Our aim is to collect energy-related performance Economic Cinzia Milani data and to improve energy efficiency, thereby reducing energy consumption and KOSME Sales costs. With the certification, the energy management system becomes another component of our integrated management system (IMS). Benefits of the energy management system: Transparency on energy consumption We have to know our consumption before we can utilise potential for savings Increased energy efficiency Concrete measures and integrating the topic of energy into KRONES’ processes reduce energy costs Reduced CO2 emissions Krones uses internal and third-party audits to ensure process security across the entire system. KRONES intends to expand the breadth and depth of the IMS in the years ahead (with more management systems and by including LCS Centres and branch offices). Economic | Production 48 Economic Products As the world’s market leader for beverage filling lines, KRONES bears responsibility to its customers. They expect KRONES to develop and produce systems and machines that give them added value. And we intend to meet this expectation with new and better products. For this reason, KRONES attached high importance to and is continually expanding our research and development (R&D) resources. Intensive dialogue with our customers, new technological possibilities, and megatrends inspire innovation at KRONES. We currently have more than 1,750 people conducting fundamental research, developing production-ready technologies, and continually improving existing products. Corporate social responsibility is When deciding which R&D projects to pursue, our unwavering focus is on the added becoming progressively more imvalue we can generate for our customers with new and better products.

Another gain for customers and KRONES alike comes from our efforts to reduce commissioning times. These efforts include thorough testing of complete systems like the ErgoBloc L at our plant. Streamlined machine designs also help to speed the commissioning process. Many new patents for KRONES To create value for the long term, it is important that we secure our innovations with patents. In 2011, the number of patents and utility models held by KRONES grew to more than 2,200. The number of patent applications was up by around 30%. Patents in KRONES’ core technology areas – such as filling, plastics, labelling, packing, and palletising – increased sharply. We were also able to protect many system-related developments with patents in the year under review. SuperPET – EU funding for KRONES PET recycling process KRONES’ recycling systems are one example of successful project developments. These projects have been receiving funding from the European Commission under its eco-innovation programme since July 2011. The programme’s goal is to successfully establish eco-compatible processes and environment-friendly products in the European market, thereby strengthening the competitiveness of companies in the EU. The KRONES recycling process is making an important contribution to protecting the natural environment by reducing waste, emissions, and pollutants. Economic | Products 49 From the large number of applications from across Europe submitted to and reviewed by the EU, KRONES’ SuperPET project was rated as particularly deserving of support and approved by the Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation (EACI). The crucial factors behind the decision to support KRONES’ PET recycling process (also referred to as the Super-Clean PET Flake Process) were not only the cost effectiveness of the system and the quality of the recycled product but also its high market potential in the 27 countries of the European Union. KRONES is offering the PET recycling market a fully developed, field-tested technology that is able to produce food-grade flakes from used PET bottles for making new PET containers. The super cleaning process produces high-purity flakes that can immediately be used as material for new bottles. Conventional approaches require additional process steps to make food-grade recycled PET. This innovative process saves on electricity, thermal energy, water, and new raw materials, including petroleum. The reduction in CO2 emissions is substantial. A KRONES PET recycling line: left Economic is the washing module, right is the decontamination module. First lines already in operation One of the first PET recycling lines from KRONES went into successful operation at KRONES PET recycling lines are the soft drinks producer Akij Food & Beverage LTD in Bangladesh in 2009. The Akij already in operation in Japan and Bangladesh. Group invested in the high-tech line (comprising a washing module and a decontamination module) and is already able to cover at least 30% of its raw PET material requirements for its in-house PET perform and PET container production operations with recycled PET flakes. Increased independence from the global market for raw PET materials is one of the direct results of this investment. The Japanese FP Corporation, Hiroshima, has been operating a KRONES bottle-tobottle PET recycling plant since the beginning of 2011. In Japan, FP is the only manufacturer of disposable food trays that uses recycled material for the food industry. The aim is to use 100% recycled PET. Economic | Products 50 Sleevematic ES The new Sleevematic ES labeller drew interested crowds at the interpack 2011, the world’s most important trade fair for the packaging sector. The Sleevematic ES handles stretch-sleeves with an exceptionally high stretch rate of up to 55%. The recyclable LDPE film is a very eco-friendly product. The sleeves’ high stretch rates mean that less material is needed than for shrink sleeve labelling. These sleeves are also particularly well suited for specially designed containers with sharper contours since they are twice as elastic as conventional stretch sleeves. As a result, they form a close fit The new Sleevematic ES labeller and can accommodate any subsequent stretching of the containers. This new techhandles highly elastic film sleeves. nology eliminates the need for both a shrink tunnel and a container dryer, dramatically reducing energy consumption. The Sleevematic ES is the perfect response to the increased demand for eco-friendly, sustainable beverage containers that are nevertheless attention-getting and cost-effective. Contiform 3: The new generation of blow moulders offers many advantages Economic The successful launch of the new Contiform 3 stretch blow moulder was an especially important achievement in the year under review. With it, KRONES has once again set new standards for the production of PET plastic containers. One highlight of the Contiform 3 is a redesigned blowing module, which boosts the machine’s output from 2,000 containers per hour per blowing station to 2,250. We also cut compressed air consumption by around one-third. These groundbreaking improvements were possible thanks to innovative technologies like an electromagnetically conThe Contiform 3 is faster, more trolled stretch system and a compressed-air recycling system.

Modulfill puts user benefits front and centre With the development and launch of a comprehensive modular design concept under the name Modulfill, KRONES has established a new generation of fillers that is both sustainable and highly versatile, handling a wide variety of products while using a minimal variety of parts. With Modulfill, KRONES is setting new standards for energy and media efficiency in the area of filling technology. KRONES has successfully bridged the gap between low operating costs and low initial investment, thus balancing cost-effectiveness and The filler’s modular design makes eco-compatibility. it easy to synchronise into a bloc arrangement with other machines. Economic | Products 51 enviro – the standard for sustainable products With the enviro sustainability programme, launched in 2008, KRONES has established a standard of energy and media efficiency for machines and lines in the packaging industry. The enviro programme stands on three pillars: economy, environment, and ergonomics. It stands for innovative, high-performance machines and lines that use resources sparingly and offer customers added value while at the same time ensuring the safety of operating and maintenance personnel. All KRONES developments are now guided by the enviro programme, which earned TÜV SÜD certification in 2009. This independent certification enables KRONES to award the enviro seal for efficient use of energy and media (gas, water) and environmental friend­ liness. The criteria for energy The criteria for media The criteria for ecoefficiency include: efficiency include: friendliness include: Economic Electrical power Gasses Composition of all Compressed air Water materials used Heating and cooling (raw materials and supplies) Consumption of the media used in various defined operational states Emissions (e.g. noise and effluents) We look at the entire beverage production and filling process and perform a detailed analysis of the machines’ consumption data. Then our engineers work out intelligent solutions for minimising consumption. The result of this development work is lines that are proven to save our customers energy and other media such as water and compressed air. The consumption data are documented in the enviro passport. All relevant data are collected and consumption forecasts for the machines and systems are documented on the basis of a standardised, independently certified procedure. At present, enviro looks only at the consumption data and eco-friendliness of individual KRONES machines in operation (»production« status). The results will be useful for figuring environmental report cards later. As of this printing, the following machines have an enviro passport: Contiform stretch blow moulder Contiroll labeller Volumetic series of fillers Robobox pack collating system Stromboli wort boiling system Hydronomic water treatment system ErgoBloc L monobloc for the wet section of the line EvoLite packer Economic | Products 52 TÜV SÜD confirms Hydronomic water treatment system’s compliance with enviro criteria The certification department of TÜV SÜD Industrie Service GmbH has confirmed that the consumption data given in the system’s enviro passport are in fact those achieved in day-to-day operation. TÜV SÜD tested and certified the KRONES Hydronomic water treatment system installed at the Einbecker Brewery in accordance with the requirements of the enviro management system. As a result, there is independent certification of KRONES’ water treatment system on file for the first time. Wound membrane module within the Hydronomic RO enviro confirms a pump efficiency optimally matched to the output involved for the Hydronomic RO water treatment system featuring membrane technology installed at the Einbecker Brewery. Energy consumption is up to 20% lower than with conventional systems. In addition, the gentle treatment of the membranes makes for longer useful lifetimes as well as longer replacement cycles. All care and maintenance intervals have been specifically matched to the machine’s actual requirements and personnel is alerted in good time so that the downtimes for maintenance work can be better planned. Economic With enviro, operators also receive special instructions on sustainable control and operation of the machine. In addition, enviro supports them in selecting the bestsuited additives. The processing materials used for the Hydronomic RO comply with the enviro checklist and thus meet the requirements laid down in TÜV SÜD’s environmental criteria. By adjusting to changes in the mains water quality, the enviro Hydronomic also provides automatic quality assurance. The measurements recorded in the test report in regard to electrical power demand, wastewater quantity, and compressed-air consumption were likewise confirmed. This means that the consumption forecasts in the Hydronomic RO’s enviro passport have also been validated. This enviro certification through TÜV SÜD Industrie Service GmbH is another sig­ nificant step for KRONES in its long-term strategy of launching sustainable machines and lines.

EvoLite also meets enviro criteria with regard to media Volker Kronseder and energy efficiency and eco-compatibility. Chairman of the Executive Board of KRONES AG Because creating shrink packs requires wrapping bottles in a relatively large amount of film material and shrinking the film to the pack also consumes energy, KRONES’ engineers developed LitePac – a more cost-effective and more eco-friendly alternative. LitePac still groups bottles in rows of two, but arranges them at a diagonal instead of the customary parallel configuration. If customers wish to have bottles in a parallel configuration, LitePac can provide that, too. The grouping is then encircled with a slim strap made of PET. A second, somewhat wider strap made of polypropylene Economic serves as a carry handle. The encircling strap features a tab for easy opening. All it takes is a quick tug of the fingers.

The pack itself remains intact and can still be future – LitePac and the EvoLite carried as a stable pack even with a bottle missing. machine In a direct comparison with shrink packs, LitePac excels in several respects: Because it consists of only two narrow straps, it uses far less material. A pack consisting of six 1.5-litre bottles, like those commonly found in supermarkets, uses around 75% less material. This is an advantage that benefits consumers as well as producers since they have less waste to deal with and can therefore do their part to protect the environment. Shrink packs also create additional costs in bottling operations due to the shrinking of the film to the pack – an energy-intensive process step that LitePac dispenses with completely. Because the bottles are arranged diagonally in the LitePac, more packs can fit onto a single pallet than when shrink packs are used. Thus, LitePac is clearly the better choice for transport and storage as well.

That is why we strive to conserve resources and minimise the environmental impact of our own production processes at our manufacturing sites. We comply with statutory regulations and do everything we can to ensure that we stay below prescribed limits. To accomplish this, we employ the latest technological processes.

For this reason, the Human Resources and environmental data presented here is limited to the German production sites. IT-Administration, China Significant progress made in 2011 We are able to achieve our environmental targets by using new technological processes and renewable energy. The regional utility company Rewag has for several years been operating a cogeneration plant at KRONES’ headquarters. The plant has three units and produces around 2,000 kilowatts (KW) of electrical power and the almost same amount of heat energy by way of a heat pump. Since February 2011, one of the units has been powered by biogas from Rewag’s biomethane plant in nearby Kallmünz. In the warmer months, the waste heat is used to cool the buildings – with two absorption chillers converting it into around 1,000 KW of cooling power. The advantage of this system is that each absorber uses only one-tenth as much electrical power as a conventional cooling system. That saves KRONES about 350 KW of electricity per hour. Another innovation for cooling KRONES’ buildings is the use of groundwater in the heating circuit of the underfloor heating system, which can be switched over to a ceiling-based cooling system since the cooled air sinks. A new photovoltaic installation on the roof of the pipe machining centre in Neutraubling went into operation in August 2011. The installation produces around 146,000 KWh of electricity per year, most of which is fed into the plant’s own network. The solar panels generate enough electricity to power 40 single-family homes each year. KRONES also maintains its own collection station for waste and recyclables, uses closed-loop systems to minimise waste water, and operates a PET chipper that makes recycled material (PET granulate) for new preforms out of the test bottles produced in stretch blow moulder trials in a bottle-to-bottle system. Environmental | Systematically evolving our environmental protection activities 57 Many environmental performance indicators improved considerably in 2011 We were able to improve many important environmental performance indicators in 2011. Despite the 14.1% increase in sales revenue, KRONES reduced energy consumption by almost 4% in 2011. Water consumption and waste generation increased less steeply than sales revenue. As a result, all three consumption figures per €1 million in sales revenue – the relevant performance indicators used at KRONES – were down in 2011. Energy consumption The following energy consumption data relate to the energy required for operating KRONES’ success is not only a factor of technological leadership on the the machines, systems, and buildings at our five sites in Germany.

The figure includes the emissions caused by consumption of electricity, natural gas, Environmental heating oil, and district heating at our five plants in Germany. We have made our calculations on the basis of statements from the electrical and district heating utilities and the Bavarian Environment Agency’s tool for calculating emissions. This tool takes into account direct and indirect emissions. Direct emissions are the emissions that result at the site where the energy is converted. Indirect emissions take into account the upstream chain of energy production (for instance, the emissions related to the production of wood pellets). Total CO2 emissions amounted to 39,012 metric tonnes during the reporting period, after 36,633 metric tonnes in the previous year. Of this, 29,134 metric tonnes (previous year: 24,238 metric tonnes) are related to electricity consumption. About 28% of the electricity used by KRONES was produced using renewable resources (previous year: 27%). This percentage was far higher than the German average of 20% in 2011. The remaining 9,878 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions (previous year: 12,395 metric tonnes) relate primarily to natural gas and district heating and, to a far lesser extent, to heating oil and LPG. KRONES Group CO2 emissions – 2011 vs. 2010 9,878 metric tonnes from 12,395 metric tonnes from natural gas, district heating, natural gas, district heating, and (to a lesser extent) and (to a lesser extent) heating oil and LPG heating oil and LPG 29,134 metric tonnes from 24,238 metric tonnes from electricity consumption electricity consumption (of which 28% is from (of which 27% is from renewable resources) renewable resources) Total CO2 emissions in 2011: 39,012 metric tonnes Total CO2 emissions in 2010: 36,633 metric tonnes Environmental | Systematically evolving our environmental protection activities 59 Waste management We were able to improve our waste management during the reporting period. Although the total volume of waste generated increased 5.5%, that is far less than the increase in sales revenue (+14.1%). One reason waste generation increased less steeply than sales was that cleanup work had been carried out in 2010 that is only done every few years. As a result, the volume of waste generated per €1 million in sales at KRONES decreased from 5.89 metric tonnes to 5.44 metric tonnes, which is only slightly higher than in 2009, the lowest value achieved to date. Total waste generated (metric tonnes and metric tonnes per €1 million in KRONES Group sales) With enviro, KRONES is including 12,962 13,506 its customers in its sustainability 12,388 12,803 concept. But sustainability begins 9,935 at home in our own plants. Our energy management system and intelligent building control systems 5.75 5.44 5.33 5.89 5.44 are substantially reducing our electricity consumption. Franz Zollner Vice President Building and 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Building Engineering Services The volume of non-recoverable waste (that is, waste that must be disposed of) decreased to 523 metric tonnes in the year under review (previous year: 594 metric Environmental tonnes). At 0.21 metric tonnes, the volume of non-recoverable waste per €1 million in sales is therefore well below the year-earlier level (0.27 metric tonnes). Nonrecoverable waste (metric tonnes and metric tonnes per €1 million in KRONES Group sales) In 2011, only 523 metric tonnes of waste could not be recycled, just under four percent of the total 1,203 volume of waste. 519 498 594 523 0.56 0.22 0.27 0.27 0.21 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Recyclable waste (metric tonnes and metric tonnes per €1 million in KRONES Group sales) The volume of recyclable waste 12,984 per €1 million in sales was down 12,443 12,209 considerably from the high year11,185 earlier level. 9,437 5.19 5.23 5.62 5.23 5.06 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 The volume of recyclable waste generated at KRONES’ production sites increased 6.3% in 2011. The reason for the increase is a further improvement in waste separation at KRONES, which allows more waste to be recycled rather than disposed of. Nevertheless, we were able to reduce the volume of recyclable waste generated per €1 million in sales from 5.62 metric tonnes to 5.23 metric tonnes. Environmental | Systematically evolving our environmental protection activities 60 Water consumption increased less than sales Water consumption increased 13.5% to 126,778 m3 in 2011 due to strong growth. This volume corresponds to the average annual water consumption of around 2,800 individuals in Germany. Water consumption in relation to sales was flat at 51 m3 per €1 million in sales. We are confident that we will be able to further reduce water consumption through targeted measures in the years ahead. Depending on the source, waste water is treated in internal treatment plants prior to being channelled into the main sewer system. In 2011, as in years past, contaminant levels in the treated waste water were far below the legal limits for chromium, nickel, copper, and zinc. System data and measurements are recorded in regular analyses as stipulated in the German Self-Monitoring Ordinance [Eigenüberwachungsverordnung]. Several external checks throughout the year confirm the results of our analyses. Of course, light liquid separators are used in the various systems prior to discharge of the treated waste water into the public sewer system. KRONES engages qualified specialists to dispose of boring and filing emulsions and cooling lubricants. Water consumption (m³ and m³ per €1 million in KRONES Group sales) In 2011, water consumption increased to 126,778 m3, which 126,778 111,689 roughly corresponds to the annual Environmental 104,862 103,402 consumption of around 2,800 96,689 85,207 people in Germany. The figure in 79,794 relation to sales (per €1 million) 55 51 51 was the same as in the previous 47 45 45 44 year. 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Emissions To reduce particulate emissions and thus minimise our impact on the environment, we have implemented measures in our motor pool such as the use of diesel-powered cars with particulate filters. In addition, as of 2010, all pool vehicles now have CO2 emissions of 120 g/km or less. Another way KRONES is cutting emissions is through a software-based ride sharing programme, which reduces the number of separate trips taken by employees between our sites. KRONES is also increasingly using videoconferencing for meetings, thus reducing the number of car and plane trips taken by staff and management. Periodic emissions tests are carried out on the facilities for which such tests are prescribed under the German Act for the Protection against Harmful Environmental Effects Caused by Air Pollution, Noise, Vibration, and Similar Factors [Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz], including the electroplating shop and the pickling plant. These facilities are in compliance with the mandated limits. A detailed overview of our concrete environmental goals and actions for the current year and the implementation status of measures that have already been taken can be found in the »Goals and actions« section of this report on pages 94 to 97.

Our HR department organises regular continuing education opportunities for our employees. In addition to qualification measures relating to specific fields, we also offer interdisciplinary and intercultural training opportunities. Spending on external continuing education and training at KRONES AG (€ thousand) Spending on external continuing education and advanced training for our employees was up dramati3,115 cally in 2011. 2,919 2,396 1,874 1,415 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Krones increased spending on external continuing education and advanced training opportunities for our employees from €1.9 million in 2010 to €3.1 million in 2011. Employees can find out about some 450 of the training and development courses offered by KRONES through our SAP training portal. As an alternative to in-class training courses, KRONES also offers e-learning opportunities, enabling employees to take a variety of courses online on a more flexible schedule. All told, some 19,700 (previLabour practices/society ous year: 14,500) participants took advantage of internal (11,800) and external (7,900) training and development opportunities in 2011. A key HR development goal in the year under review was to establish more courses that are tailored to specific target groups. Our focus here was on seminars dealing with various aspects of customer orientation. For example, almost all relevant employee groups completed the »value-oriented sales« series in 2011. For our employees outside Germany, the focus of course offerings was on technical training for sales staff and on seminars relating to project management within the KRONES Group. Further expanding our competence management was another important aspect of HR development in 2011. In annual review meetings, employees and their managers discuss strengths and areas for further development. The employees do a self-evaluation and also receive feedback from their supervisor. They work out suitable development measures in dialogue with their manager or supervisor. These measures may include seminars and conferences or projects with universities or purposeful exchanges with co-workers. Labour practices | Promoting qualifications and involvement 71 Development reviews were conducted with nearly 4,000 employees (previous year: around 3,000) as part of our competence management efforts in 2011. We intend to achieve our goal of some 4,400 reviews by the end of 2012. For our production staff involved in group work, we introduced a special procedure to support group work in 2011 on a pilot basis. Under our company agreement, KRONES also offers employees opportunities for their own personal and professional development. Employees can complete almost all continuing education opportunities that are relevant to the company on either a full-time or a part-time basis. They can also apply for financial assistance to cover the cost of part-time continuing education and for educational and professional Today’s managers have two impordevelopment leave.

External coaches provide training and guidance to help management employees from various departments augment their leadership skills. Over a total of nine days, the modules impart tools such as goal-setting, conflict resolution, and argumentation techniques using case studies and role plays with practical relevance. Labour practices/society By including our managers from outside Germany in the management training system, KRONES intends to establish a uniform, modern understanding of management within the entire group. Ten groups have completed the international management training since the programme’s launch in 2009. In 2011 we further expanded the programme to include more lower-level managers in some countries. All told, 58 KRONES employees completed a management training seminar in 2011. The 89th group began management training at the end of 2011. Each group usually has around nine participants, bringing the total number of managers who have attended the seminar to around 760. Diversity management – an important part of HR policy Because KRONES is an international group of companies and employs people from many different countries, we have made employee diversity an important aspect of our personnel strategy. Diversity management at KRONES is not merely about implementing laws. It is about putting the personal and cultural diversity of our workforce to work within the company. Labour practices | Promoting qualifications and involvement 72 Within our diversity management concept, we strive to promote the potential of heterogeneous groups while at the same time preventing potential conflicts. This concept improves information exchange and increases performance, cohesion within the team, employee motivation, and work quality. Experience has shown that mixed teams are often more innovative and creative when it comes to problemsolving than homogeneous groups. That is one more reason why KRONES further increased the share of employees outside Germany in 2011 and has made further expansion abroad a target for the future (see page 66). Steady increase of women in our workforce In our Moscow office, we do everyThe share of women in our workforce has also grown steadily over the past several thing we can to demonstrate to our years.

In November, 15 young girls from schools across Bavaria came to spend a week as »engineers« at KRONES. KRONES hosts the camp in collaboration with the University of Applied Sciences in Regensburg to give girls first-hand experience with technical fields. Young women who are working as engineers or completing a dual course of study at KRONES conducted experiments with the 15 to 19-year-old camp participants on a very current topic: energy efficient heating and drying of PET flakes.

We pay particular attention to ensuring proactive, comprehensive exchange of information within the company. To this end, KRONES works closely with employee representatives. In the plants and offices in Germany, there are clear rules governing and ensuring codetermination. Employee representatives make up half of the Supervisory Board. In addition, the Works Council represents the collective interests of employees. The Works Council and the Executive Board negotiate reasonable solutions for day-to-day working life. Labour practices/society The results of these negotiations often go above and beyond the requirements set forth by the law or collective bargaining contracts. Examples include our employee benefits, salaries, and flexible working hours. At KRONES, all employees whose pay is determined by collective agreement (blue-colEmployees covered by collective lar and white-collar alike) are paid on the basis of a common general pay agreement bargaining contracts (ERA). In addition, as in 2010, KRONES employees who are covered by collective agreements were once again given a share in the company’s profits in 2011.

The company provides attractive options for motivated young people who begin their careers with KRONES through vocational training, internships, or graduate theses. 2010 2011 Good training is the key to future success Our employees’ well-grounded professional training is the foundation for KRONES’ long-term commercial success. KRONES offers attractive, challenging training opportunities to a large number of young people in 20 different fields every year. We invest around €70,000 in each of our young trainees. But we also hold our recruits to high standards. Although the number of school graduates applying for a training opportunity at KRONES declined from 1,700 in 2010 to 1,500 in 2011, the quality of applications remained high. After a long and rigorous selection process, 145 young people began their training with KRONES in the fall of 2011. Approximately one-third of these trainees have a qualified school leaving certificate from a lower secondary school (Hauptschulabschluss), around 50% have a school leaving certi­ficate from a mid-level secondary school (Mittlere Reife), and the rest have the university entrance qualification (Abitur).

Of these, 429 were in industrial and technical fields and 59 were in commercial fields. At 5.6%, our training rate was down compared to the previous year’s 6.2% because we expanded our core workforce in the year under review. We permanently hired all trainees who successfully completed their training in 2011 (52 in the winter and 98 in the summer). KRONES is especially proud that around two-thirds of all examinees received a top grade. In some fields, the entire graduatLabour practices | Promoting qualifications and involvement 75 ing class earned perfect marks. KRONES honours the best of each class of trainees with a scholarship for subsequent university studies. In 2011, five young people were awarded KRONES scholarships. KRONES promotes international training In addition to the content prescribed by the respective training programmes, KRONES aims to give its trainees additional qualifications such as English language skills, presentation techniques, and international experience through stays in our subsidiaries. In 2011, ten KRONES mechatronics trainees in their third year spent three weeks in England to enhance their language skills and gain international work I am proud to work for KRONES experience as part of the EU’S »Leonardo da Vinci« project.

There are plans in place for 40 KRONES mechatronics trainees to participate in this special EU programme by the end of 2012. To further promote internationalism within our training organisation, our goal for 2012 is to have our commercial trainees take the exam for certification as a bilingual secretary for English. In preparation for the exam, the young people are receiving after-school instruction in English twice weekly.

Students come not only from China but also from other countries across Asia, such as Mongolia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The first two semesters of the KRONES course in Wuhan follow the Chinese curriculum. The third through sixth semesters then concentrate on KRONES-specific content. The programme also includes six months of internships at breweries and bottling operations in China. The final examinations are comparable to those completed by mechatronics technicians in Germany. After completing the programme, graduates with the corresponding aptitude can begin working for KRONES at our local customers’ plants. KRONES is building a bigger training centre KRONES began construction on a larger training centre in September 2011. The company expanded its training space by about one-third. The 1,400 m2 centre provides a bright, friendly atmosphere for our trainees to work in. Since the new building also includes our service technician training centre and the KRONES Academy, the end result is a sort of training campus that benefits all of our young recruits. Labour practices | Promoting qualifications and involvement 76 The importance we attach to our trainees is reflected in the fact that our employee magazine »inside krones« has regularly devoted an entire two-page spread to the topic of training and trainees since the second half of 2011.

This career programme is designed specifically for our service technicians and is KRONES’ response to the scarcity of skilled people in this area. In 4.5 years, young people earn a vocational training certificate as well as the »state certified technician« title. Upon completing the programme, the participants are not only ideally prepared to handle the demands of KRONES’ service business. They also have an excellent foundation on which to build a career full of interesting development opportunities. Getting kids interested in KRONES More than one thousand teens and their parents visited KRONES’ plants in Neutraubling, Nittenau, and Rosenheim at the end of July 2011 for »Training Day«. There, they gained information as well as a first-hand look into the 20 different careers KRONES offers in commercial, industrial, and technical fields. They had an opportunity to talk about the programmes with current trainees and their trainers in the different divisions. Talking with peers made for a relaxed atmosphere and reduced the young people’s natural inhibitions. On average, each of the presentations on dual courses of study, Profil 21, and other training options was attended by 100 people. Labour practices | Promoting qualifications and involvement 78 Krones is making space for ideas To better leverage our employees’ knowledge and ideas, KRONES launched »Brainpool« in the second half of 2011. The platform is available to all employees to submit ideas or improvement suggestions and to track the status of their suggestions directly online via our intranet. KRONES’ Brainpool consists of three parts: Competition, Invention, and Improvement. The latter merges the existing continuous improvement process with our employee suggestion system. The Brainpool Invention went live in early 2012 while the Brainpool Competition will follow in 2012 (see interview on pages 34 and 35 for details).

Preserving and promoting the health and safety of our workforce are among our company’s established goals. In order to prevent workplace accidents and work-related illness, all of our workflows are designed with the safety and health of our employees in mind. We also offer a variety of options to help our employees stay physically and mentally fit and help them strike a healthy work-life balance. In close cooperation with our employees, our managerial staff work out and agree concrete goals and actions for ensuring that all workplaces and workflows protect safety and health.

Other licensing, regulatory, and statutory requirements are also followed at all Bharat Prakash KRONES sites. As far as technically feasible and economically reasonable, we go above KRONES India and beyond the minimum requirements of the law, implementing our own policies to further increase safety. Intensive training Accident prevention and improved occupational health for employees are among the topmost objectives of our occupational safety and health programme. For this reason, training on occupational safety and health is an integral part of our continuLabour practices/society ing education programme in Germany. At the beginning of 2011, we introduced a new training concept for occupational safety and health which helps managers and supervisors instruct their employees in a way that is methodologically sound and ensures correct content. The programme provides managers and supervisors with information on 26 specialised topics such as construction site safety, travel safety, working in confined spaces, and working at height and puts them in contact with a safety expert. The more than 600 KRONES employees who work at construction sites around the world are advised by a dedicated safety engineer, who visits the construction sites to observe occupational safety standards at work and ensure occupational safety. Our external contractors’ employees are also closely integrated into our training programmes and informed about KRONES’ work safety rules. In all, some 100 training courses were conducted in 2011, of which around 25% were specialist seminars or workshops offered by external training institutions. Our in-house occupational safety and health specialists conducted some 30 courses for employees and 40 courses for managers and supervisors.

At 16.2 resulting in one or more days of lost (previous year: 18.0), KRONES’ figure for reportable work-related accidents per 1,000 time per 1,000 employees employees (> 3 days lost time) was once again down year-on-year and far better than the industry average (see chart). KRONES began reporting work-related accidents that 27.1 26.3 24.2 result in as little as one day of lost time at its German plants in 2008. In 2011, this figure was 24.2 per 1,000 employees (previous year: 26.3). Although the trend is moving in the right direction and although the figures are good by comparison, KRONES is not satisfied. Every work-related accident is one too many. Our aim continues to be to further reduce the number of work-related acci2009 2010 2011 dents through training, intensive hazard assessment, and precise accident analysis. Labour practices/society The accident analysis is a collaborative investigation performed by the injured worker’s supervisor and the company’s occupational health and safety expert. In addition to direct, obvious causes, this team will seek to uncover other issues such as shortcomings in the process organisation or risk awareness. To further improve our standards here, we added personnel to our central security management team in 2011. Emergency management To ensure that we are prepared to act quickly when sudden emergencies arise, KRONES has emergency response KRONES has in place a crisis management system that defines key responsibilities teams at all of its production sites in Germany. The teams consist of and procedures in a crisis situation.

The teams are made up primarily of voluntary first responders, safety plant security personnel. officers, fire safety assistants, and plant security personnel. The emergency response team in Neutraubling went through four training workshops and is now an integral part of our emergency response organisation. The team responded to 71 emergencies, successfully limiting the resulting damage. Labour practices | Responsibility for safety, health, and social affairs 81 In May 2011, KRONES held fire safety days at all of its German plants for the first time, providing training for some 500 managers and supervisors, members of the emergency response team, fire safety assistants, and safety officers. The event’s primary aim was to ensure that these safety personnel know how they can best help evacuate employees. The training course has already proven useful. When a fire broke out in one of the company’s buildings in Neutraubling in March 2011, it took personnel only two minutes to evacuate the entire complex.

The in-house medical service also helps with rehabilitation and reintegration. Labour practices/society The service also helps employees prepare for assignments abroad, providing information about various local diseases and important vaccinations. KRONES has physicians with thorough knowledge of tropical medicine on staff to check employees’ fitness for service in the tropics. KRONES employees who are preparing for personal vacations can also get the vaccinations they need. Another important topic is medical preparation for projects abroad. The in-house medical service offers the following:  Fitness screenings and preventive care for employees  Emergency kits for construction sites  Organisation of medical care on site  Training for project and site managers (first aid/emergency response) KRONES’ aim is to establish a global health management system to ensure high-quality medical care for our employees working around the world.

In cooperation with the Works Council, the disabled employees’ representative, the counselling service, and the in-house medical service, the results of such talks are analysed and translated into suitable preventive measures.

The basic principle of our social counselling service is that the services are not directed only towards specific, at-risk employees or those in particularly serious difficulties but rather towards all of the company’s employees. As a rule, we offer individual counselling for employees dealing with crisis situations, debt, illness, conflicts at work, personal and family issues, mobbing, addiction, and stress-related problems. Our counselling service also offers roundtable discussions and contributes to training courses. In addition, the counselling service advises managers and supervisors as well as HR managers when problems arise (leadership support). In addition, KRONES relies on active in-company integration management to assist employees who are no longer able to perform their original jobs for health reasons. KRONES’ counselling service coordinates an integration team (Works Council, counselling service, HR department, disabled employees’ representative) in adapting work stations, preparing for the employee’s return to work, and providing ongoing, long-term support to the employee. Labour practices | Responsibility for safety, health, and social affairs 83 Returning to work after illness – we need to retain valuable employees The in-company integration The story of Michael Hohmann at our Rosenheim plant is an example of KRONES’ management programme for employees dealing with health in-company integration management at work. Mr. Hohmann is one of the first issues is an important part of KRONES employees for whom a complete workstation was installed in his own home. social counselling at KRONES. The reason: The 37-year-old software programmer developed a disorder of the eye muscles and has had difficulty working at the computer ever since. Horizontal eye movements in particular quickly resulted in headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. For this reason, Mr. Hohmann now works at a 37-inch screen that stands approximately two metres away from where he sits. He still has to take breaks after one or two hours of work to avoid overexerting his eyes. He does approximately 80% of his work from home. He comes in to the plant on a regular basis for meetings. His position is scheduled as a regular job, but his tasks are selected in such a way that he does not need to travel. KRONES has gone to great lengths and successfully retained a valuable, experienced employee. KRONES offers attractive health benefits The company health insurance fund, BKK KRONES, also offers employees attractive additional benefits. For instance, the GesundPlus card gives BKK members priority treatment from members of the Regensburg Ärztenetz medical network, which includes more than 220 general practitioners and specialists. That saves time and speeds healing. Free health checkups for BKK members aged 35 and older are another special benefit. A particular aim of the checkups is early detection of cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and diabetes. All that members have to do is take the time for the doctor visit every two years and present their BKK insurance card. Labour practices/society The welfare fund Hermann-Kronseder-Unterstützungskasse e.V. provides additional health-related support for KRONES employees. Employees may receive benefits of up to €600 per year above and beyond the payouts from the health insurance fund. This fund kicks in, for example, when sick pay has been exhausted or has expired, for hospital stays or rest cures, or for dentures, eyeglasses or contact lenses, or hearing aids. In 2011, the fund paid out around €180,000 to employees. Another important element of health management at KRONES is the company sports club, which offers a variety of sports such as football (soccer), tennis, shuffleboard, running, and badminton. The teams are quite successful – »BSG KRONES« has already won numerous championships in the local company and public agency league (Regensburger Firmenund Behördensportliga) – thanks to the enormous volunteer effort on the part of KRONES employees. But this involvement is certainly worthwhile. Apart from the health benefits, sports also give co-workers an opportunity to get together other outside the workplace environment and promote teamwork and cohesion. The company sports club, which celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2011, is thus a vital element of the vibrant corporate culture at KRONES.

We give the employee’s partner an opportunity to visit the new location before the transfer so he or she can get to know it and evaluate it. KRONES also helps employees find appropriate schools for their children at their new location and offers the entire family an opportunity to prepare for life in a new country through the intercultural school in Passau, Germany. KRONES assumes all of the associated costs. Upon the family’s return, the children can continue to attend an international school. KRONES supports the Regensburg International School (RIS) for this reason. Labour practices | Responsibility for safety, health, and social affairs 85 KROKI supports working parents Our company-supported childcare facility, KROKI, in Neutraubling was operating at full capacity in 2011. KROKI is open 10 hours each day, offers flexible drop-off and pick-up times, and is closed no more than 15 days per year – giving employees the flexibility they need to reconcile work and family. In 2010, the centre had nursery space for 24 infants and toddlers ages 4 months to 3 years (3rd birthday) and 19 preschool spots for children age three through their first day of primary school. Because KROKI receives far more applications than can be accommodated, a special point system is used to ensure that the 43 spots are assigned in a fair, comprehensible manner.

Plant security Wolfgang Bernkopf Counselling service Society 87 Open dialogue with all stakeholders To get a sense of the various groups’ interests, we regularly seek contact with all stakeholders – in Neutraubling, in our region, and around the globe. Our stakeholders include employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, government agencies, politicians, trade associations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), scientists and academics, and the general public. We are committed to a proactive, frank and open information policy. We analyse and assess opportunities and risks relating to CSR topics in ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders. That helps us to identify potential weak points and new challenges early. And with that, we are minimising risks for the company, strengthening our stakeholders’ trust in us, and safeguarding the company’s reputation. In direct contact with our vari­Policymakers Customers Scientists and academics ous stakeholder groups, KRONES analyses the opportunities and The general public KRONES NGOs risks associated with the different areas of CSR. Suppliers Employees Cultural institutions Direct contact is very important here. For this reason, we organise a variety of events worldwide each year. The events range from regular tours for employees and their families to round-table discussions with stakeholder groups and participation in international initiatives. In July 2011, we held a »Training Day« at our Neutraubling, Nittenau, and Rosenheim plants. Some 1,000 participants got a look at the career options and training facilities we offer and were able to flesh this out with details in one-on-one conversations Labour practices/society with instructors and current trainees. We also offer Saturday company tours to our staff and their families on a bimonthly basis so that our employees can show their families their workplace. An example of our active information policy is the KRONES newsletter, which is published monthly. It shares news and technology trends with customers and employees. Readers are also invited to submit topic suggestions to the editor, thus encouraging an ongoing exchange of information. To keep employees worldwide abreast of developments within the KRONES Group, we published four issues of the »Inside KRONES« employee magazine in 2011 in German, English, and Italian. In addition, the new intranet »KRONES inside« gives all KRONES employees a modern communication platform for exchanging and finding information. Society | Open dialogue with all stakeholders 88 Krones conducts intensive investor relations work Transparent, prompt, and honest communications with all of our shareholders is a major aim of our investor relations activities. As a member of the MDAX share index, we are followed by international investors and analysts, who have high expectations of our financial communications. We are happy to meet these expectations – including in person-to-person dialogue. Sustainability topics are gaining importance in all of these forums. We conducted more than a dozen road shows last year, visiting investors in international financial centres such as London, New York, Stockholm, Zurich, and Frankfurt. These shows were attended by Executive Board members or the head of investor relations – or both – who fielded questions from the market professionals. KRONES also participated in numerous investor conferences in Germany and Sustainability and commercial abroad in 2011. success are not mutually exclusive.

Labour practices/society the agency rates in 45 industries worldwide, only every sixth is given the »prime« designation. This positive assessment of our environmental and social standards through oekom research expands our pool of potential investors considerably. Worldwide, some €11,000 billion are being invested exclusively in shares of companies that meet the very strict criteria of rating agencies specialising in socially responsible investment. The reason for this is that analyst studies have shown that many particularly socially responsible companies generate above-average profits – in business and on the stock markets. Society | Open dialogue with all stakeholders Society 89 Involvement in charitable causes and culture The principles of sustainability also apply to our civic responsibilities. Beyond our business obligations, we are also committed to doing our part with respect to society, culture, the sciences, and academics. In other words, we are committed to being good corporate citizens. We focus our efforts on those areas where we feel we can make the greatest impact, primarily through projects in our region. We provide charitable donations and sponsoring as well as knowledge and manpower. For KRONES, such engagement is part and parcel of corporate social responsibility. Regional KRONES has been a partner and supporter of the Regensburg International School (RIS) since 2010. RIS is open to children from the local community and around the world. It provides families in the region an alternative to the local schools. RIS opened in 2009 and offers schooling in English to children of international and local families in Regensburg and Eastern Bavaria. The school is committed to providing a high-quality, challenging, international education. Its aim is to develop in each student the ability to think critically and creatively and to help all of its students grow into reflective, independent life-long learners who are socially responsible, concerned for the environment, and able to face the complex challenges of the modern world. KRONES also works closely with KJF-Werkstätten, the Catholic youth welfare organKrones supports many social and isation of the Regensburg diocese.

KRONES also conducts some 20 training courses and seminars each year at the Hermannsberg educational facility. Here, eleven people with mental disabilities are employed in accordance with their capabilities. In this way, KRONES is not only helping to give these individuals opportunities. We are also bringing the concept of inclusion to life by bringing together persons with and without disabilities. Inclusion means that all people, with their varied abilities, participate in society. KRONES AG also regards support for universities as an important contribution to society. As a patron of the Hochschulstiftung Regensburg foundation, the company supports various events and promotes cultural exchange among students at the local University of Applied Sciences.

KRONES has decided to bundle its international charitable giving and sponsoring efforts into providing substantial long-term support to the Water for the World foundation. In its role as a corporate sponsor, KRONES supports projects all over the world that give people in developing countries access to clean drinking water. Water they need for drinking, cooking, and washing and for irrigating their fields. Our guiding principles here are sustainability and helping people help themselves. We concentrate our funding on rural projects and ensure that they actually benefit families, women, and children. We also invest in education and training, so that people can take charge of their own water supplies.

Sabine Fichtl, a member of our Asia-Pacific sales team, is helping schools in the northeast Indian state of Assam. She was inspired while travelling in India, where a priest told her about his missionary work in the northeastern part of the country. Ms. Fichtl was able to assess the situation first-hand and is now committed to giving the region’s impoverished children a chance at a better future by building schools there. She has won the support of the charitable organisation Helfende Hände Zukunft für Kinder und Jugendliche e.V. for this effort. Sabine Fichtl is helping build schools in northeast India Christine Clarissa Gouw of KRONES Indonesia is helping children in a slum in Indonesia’s capital city, Jakarta. The slum is home to many »trash pickers« and their families. Christine Clarissa Gouw began by visiting the children each Saturday to sing Labour practices/society and paint with them and to tell them stories. When she noted that most of the children were not attending school, she convinced their parents to let her send them. The mother of two registered the children at school and bought the clothing, school bags, shoes, and books they needed. She even built a small hut and equipped it with a chalkboard, electrical light, chairs, books, and toys for the 52 children and youth. »This is our home«, she says. Now, the KRONES project coordinator can be found there every Saturday, tutoring the children. Christine Clarissa Gouw tutors children in the Indonesian capital Jakarta in a hut she built herself.

The production of and the paper used for the KRONES Group’s 2011 CSR Report have been certified in accordance with the criteria of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The FSC prescribes strict standards for forest management, thus helping to prevent uncontrolled deforestation, human rights violations, and environmental damage. Because products bearing the FSC label are handled by various enterprises along the trading and processing chain, the companies that process the paper, such as printers, are also certified under FSC rules. In addition, the CO2 emissions resulting from the production of this report – including both the production of the paper and ink and the printing process itself – were measured and then offset through the purchase and retirement of high quality emission certificates. krones ag Kristina Ebenbeck csr Officer Böhmerwaldstrasse 5 93073 Neutraubling Germany Phone + 49 9401 701211 Fax + 49 9401 703786 E-mail csr@krones.com Internet www.krones.com
