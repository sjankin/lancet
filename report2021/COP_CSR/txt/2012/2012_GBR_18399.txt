Our commitment to corporate responsibility is a deeply embedded part of the firm’s ethos and is reflected in our Business Plan. We are committed to continuous improvement throughout the entirety of our network. There are several linked strands to our CR strategy. The principal ones revolve around initiatives in jurisdictions where we do business that:  address social inclusion by helping the less privileged;  ensure that we undertake appropriate levels of pro bono work;  ensure respect for our environment; and  help to build a diverse and balanced firm in which equal opportunities are open to all. Internally and externally, we look for ways to promote initiatives that support these principles and allow us to work with clients and community partners to fulfil our objectives. Colin Passmore, Senior Partner Page 01 Simmons & Simmons Corporate responsibility 2011/12 “Our ongoing work with NGONET has been both rewarding and challenging. It has also helped us as a firm to develop our understanding of how we can best assist international pro-bono clients.
