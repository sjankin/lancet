Opinion on the financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the company as at December 31, 2011 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. II. Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: Your company applies the “equity method valuation”, provided for in article L. 232-5 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) to assess its equity interest, as set out in note 1.4 to the financial statements. Valuation of its equity interests is performed using the consolidation accounting policies and methods used to establish the consolidated financial statements. To review the valuation, we relied on results of our consolidation testing performed on the group consolidated accounts as at December 31, 2011. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. III. Specific verifications and information We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by French law. We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management’s report and in the documents addressed to the shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements. 6 Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of article L. 225-102-1 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from companies controlling your company or controlled by it. Based on this work, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information. In accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the purchase of investments and controlling interests and the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.

An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the company as at December 31, 2011 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. II. Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: Your company applies the “equity method valuation”, provided for in article L. 232-5 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) to assess its equity interest, as set out in note 1.4 to the financial statements. Valuation of its equity interests is performed using the consolidation accounting policies and methods used to establish the consolidated financial statements. To review the valuation, we relied on results of our consolidation testing performed on the group consolidated accounts as at December 31, 2011. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. III. Specific verifications and information We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by French law. We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management’s report and in the documents addressed to the shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements. 6 Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of article L. 225-102-1 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from companies controlling your company or controlled by it. Based on this work, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information. In accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the purchase of investments and controlling interests and the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.
