By focusing our activities on our key industrial sectors, we strengthen our businesses and underline our determination to accelerate sustainable growth. This was highlighted in 2011 by the acquisitions of coatings manufacturer Schramm Holding AG and the coatings business operated by Schramm’s largest shareholder, Korean company SSCP. The two deals made AkzoNobel the global leader in specialty plastic coatings for mobile devices, laptops and TVs. They also enhanced our position in the automotive industry with high-end, water-based technology for plastic and metal and will enable us to bring color and design to vehicle interiors. Significantly, more than half the combined revenues of Schramm and SSCP are in Asia – primarily China, Korea, Vietnam and Thailand – offering us a major opportunity to boost our Industrial Coatings activities, particularly in these regions. However, the Schramm deal also shows that we are investing globally in the right technologies when the opportunity comes along. Based in Offenbach, Germany, with a 200-year history of innovative coatings developments, Schramm manufactures and markets coatings for plastics, metals and electrical insulation, as well as coil coatings. The transaction was notable for reinforcing AkzoNobel’s position in the automotive interior sector in Germany. Peter Brenner – Managing Director of Schramm, who became Director of the combined specialty plastic coatings business – said he was delighted with the deal: “We are looking forward to working with our new colleagues and exploiting the exciting opportunities this integration offers to deliver a new portfolio of world class products and service to our customers.” Achieving our strategic ambitions Value Accelerated growth €20 billion in revenue Growth in absolute EBITDA, Reduction in OWC of 0.5 p.a., Stable to rising dividend (Delivering) in a 13–15 percent margin range towards a 12 percent target (Delivering) (Improvement actions in progress) (Facing headwinds) • Made progress with achieving our • A combination of volume issues and a • Continued to make progress with regard • Intending to grow the 2011 total dividend €20 billion target in all three Business difficult raw material cost environment has to receivables and payables by 4 percent to €1.45 per share Areas created significant contribution margin • A challenging year in terms of inventory • Shareholders are offered an option to • Introduced country organizations in and EBITDA margin pressure management – slower volume growth obtain a stock dividend high growth markets/regions (Brazil, • Continuing to take aggressive pricing in the second half of the year and India, China, Middle East) to support the actions as a result of raw material cost prudent management of raw material achievement of specific, largely organic, pressures;

AkzoNobel Report 2011 | Strategy | Our strategic agenda 25 A taste for innovation 9g Salt is something we know a lot about. In fact, our expertise with all forms of what is one of the most basic compounds goes back nearly 100 years. So when questions started being asked about healthy daily limits for human salt consumption, our Functional Chemicals organization’s Salt Specialties business Average daily adult salt started to investigate. Their aim was to develop a low consumption is above sodium product suitable for use by the food industry. healthy levels After researching various solutions, our scientists have developed the patent-pending OneGrain technology. Just in time too, because it’s widely accepted that adults shouldn’t consume more than six grams of salt a day in order to limit sodium intake. In fact, authorities in many countries are increasing pressure to reduce salt consumption, so manufacturers need solutions. OneGrain incorporates multiple salt replacement Suprasel Loso ingredients into a single grain of salt. The result is a OneGrain product we’ve called Suprasel Loso OneGrain, a great tasting like-for-like salt replacement which contains up to 50 percent less sodium. It grains like traditional salt and can be used and stored in exactly the same way. It also makes foods healthier without compromising on taste, which is crucial because food producers don’t want to risk losing customers as they reduce sodium. Several food manufacturers are already using Suprasel Loso OneGrain in their products and it could eventually be launched onto the retail market. Looks, tastes and -50 can be stored like regular salt % Suprasel Loso OneGrain contains up to 50 percent less sodium than normal salt Thirdly, we are managing our operating working capital.

By developing one, unified approach, we avoid the trap of making false trade-offs. For this reason, all of the strategic agenda items described above embed safety and sustainability and there is not a separate agenda item on this point. We do, however, recognize that, given the cross-business, cross-functional, cross-country/regional aspect of the sustainability agenda, we must go beyond our “normal” business processes, which have historically been associated solely with financial performance. As a result, we have a Sustainability Council which advises the Executive Committee on the definition and appropriate implementation of the sustainability aspects of the strategic agenda. The Council is chaired by the CEO. He is joined by Business Unit Managing Director representatives from each Business Area and Executive Committee members or corporate directors from the main relevant functions. The Sustainabiilty Council meets quarterly. The Council monitors our progress on our sustainability agenda through our strategy dashboard, which encompasses both leading and lagging indicators associated with each of our eight strategic ambitions. In addition, the Council oversees AkzoNobel Report 2011 | Strategy | Our strategic agenda 29 Building on our expertise Early in 2011, we announced our biggest ever investment in Latin America. It was a clear signal of our strategic intent to accelerate growth and achieve our medium-term ambition of doubling revenue in Brazil to €1.5 billion. We have committed nearly €90 million, which will be used by our Pulp and Paper Chemicals business (Eka Chemicals) to build a new plant to supply the world’s largest pulp mill. Other locations Jacareí The agreement – with Eldorado Celulose e Papel – Jundiaí involves supplying, storing and handling all chemicals for Rio de Janeiro the 1.5 million tons a year green field mill, which is being Eunápolis constructed in the northern part of Três Lagoas City. The mill is expected to come on stream in 2012 and the 15-year deal underlines the value AkzoNobel attaches Três Lagoas to securing long-term partnerships with customers. “Building the world’s largest pulp mill requires working with reliable partners who can provide the best technology,” explained Eldorado President, Rogerio D’Alcantara Peres. “AkzoNobel’s proven Chemical Island concept, together with the company’s world class expertise and strong commitment to sustainability, meant that they were a natural choice for this major project.” Work on the new Pulp and Paper Chemicals facility – which will also supply other key customers in Brazil – is already well underway. It will expand on our well-established pulp €90m and paper activities in the country, where Eka Chemicals already operates its sustainability focused Chemical Island concept at several mills, as well as running production units in Jacareí, Eunapolis, Três Lagoas, Rio de Janeiro and Jundiaí. Future demand for pulp and paper chemicals in Latin America is projected to increase substantially over Eka Chemicals is investing the next 15 years. The Eldorado agreement therefore €90 million to build a bespoke represents an exciting opportunity for us to further expand Chemical Island next to the in the region, as well as emphasizing the importance of world’s largest pulp mill Latin America to our growth ambitions. 1.5 million tons When complete, the Eldorado mill will be the largest pulp mill in the world, with a capacity to produce 1.5 million tons of pulp each year. Biomass Eucalyptus waste results from the production process. This biomass is then used to help power the Chemical Island, which means there will be a sustainable supply of renewable energy for the new facility. Our Executive Committee At the beginning of 2011, we broadened our leadership team and established a nine-strong Executive Committee in order to accelerate sustainable growth and help us deliver on our strategic ambitions. Comprised of the five Board of Management members and these four leaders with functional expertise, having this organizational set-up at the very top of the company means that we can better deliver functional and operational excellence, drive common agendas, build capabilities and develop a culture of confidence, cooperation and co-creation. All members of the Executive Committee work together to define our strategic direction, establish policies and manage the company’s day-to-day operations. The functions currently represented are HR & Organizational Development; Research, Development & Innovation; Supply Chain/Sourcing (including Health, Safety and Environment). In addition, our General Counsel is included to ensure strong governance and compliance.

Information on market characteristics, key brands and revenue comparisons is also provided. AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals 37 AkzoNobel Performance Coatings 47 AkzoNobel Decorative Paints 57 Putting customers first Developing sustainable technology is at the forefront of our innovation. We’re constantly striving to make breakthroughs that will offer real benefits to our customers. One such advance was made in 2011 by our Industrial Chemicals business, which was the culmination of eight years of collaborative research with Spanish company GRIT. We’ve been working together to develop the recently launched DeMythe LDD, which is notable for being the most sustainable, cost-effective and environmentallyfriendly degreasing and dehydrating technology available to the leather and protein processing industries. The solvent dimethylether (DME) is used in a closed process to degrease and remove water from animal skins. The DME is then separated from the grease and water and reused. This sustainable process makes the use of huge quantities of water and chemicals redundant. It also guarantees a process improvement and results in cleaner waste water. Another significant development during the year was the signing of a license agreement with Koninklijke Hulshof in the Netherlands for the exclusive use of the patented DeMythe LDD technology. Under the terms of the agreement, Hulshof will build a facility which is expected to start operating in mid-2012. Commented director Herman Hulshof: “This innovative technology means that the original waste stream will be a source of income. The result is a more sustainable operation and a healthier future.” The DME will be produced at the AkzoNobel Industrial Chemicals facility in Rotterdam. The plant’s capacity is currently being expanded to 45,000 tons per year. AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals “2011 was a year of solid and Paper Chemicals reported record earnings.

Based in the province of Shangdong, Boxing is China’s leading producer of specialty surfactants. With the acquisition now finalized, Boxing is being integrated into our Surface Chemistry business, giving us a strong local manufacturing footprint in the region. We are already a global leader in the manufacture and supply of specialty surfactants and synthetic and bio-polymer additives. What’s significant about this deal is that Boxing’s leading market position in nitrile amines and derivatives will complement our existing global activities and help us accelerate growth in Asia, where demand for amines and derivatives is expected to increase significantly over the next few years. Our Surface Chemistry business supplies products that are used as formulation ingredients and process aids in many applications, ranging from home and personal care to agrochemicals and asphalt road paving. Demand in Asia for these products is being driven by population growth, an expanding middle class, increased focus on sustainability and expanding infrastructure. In fact, a third of Asian demand for amines comes from China alone.

Analysis Customer intimacy, product quality and innovation and supply chain efficiencies – along with a strong market footprint – helped to grow our underlying margins, particularly in the Coatings, Life Sciences, Soda Ash and Chemicals businesses. However, the additional cost of approximately €7 million incurred for using expensive alternative fuel in place of natural gas due to supply shortages dragged down both margins and EBITDA. Highlights Thanks to our continued commitment to sustainability we achieved significant improvements in our environmental performance. One of the most notable initiatives was the launch of a coke briquetting project at our Soda Ash business. Designed to reduce waste, it involves converting coke dust into usable briquettes. We also reduced water intake through a number of water reuse projects and improved farm economics through the introduction of new products in our Life Sciences business. Our safety performance remains one of the best in the Business Area, with one of our manufacturing sites completing 15 million man hours and another 15 years without a lost time incident. AkzoNobel Report 2011 | Business performance | AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals 45 The sky’s the limit As the pace of innovation continues to gather momentum, one industry in particular is really taking off when it comes to reinventing the customer experience. Airline travel is undergoing several seismic shifts designed to not only enhance passenger comfort, but also make aircraft lighter, more fuel efficient and in turn significantly reduce their carbon footprint. All of this requires game-changing technology and our Automotive and Aerospace Coatings business is at the forefront of air transport’s blueprint for the future, supplying both Airbus and Boeing with innovative, high performance coating systems. For example, we have developed a world class basecoat/clearcoat system which has redefined the application process. Requiring one coat instead of the usual two or three, it also dries in two hours (rather than ten) and offers lower dirt pick-up, resulting in less need for cleaning. The potential weight reduction brought about by using less paint could also mean improved fuel efficiency. We’re also researching other functionality, such as coatings that can change color and provide a tactile feel, conduct electricity and provide tints that influence people’s moods. In addition, we are working on a coating which will stop insects sticking to the exterior and are looking into applying antibacterial qualities to our cabin coatings which will help to improve air quality. As we strive to be even more environmentally progressive, we’ve also turned to nature to look for inspiration. In an effort to reduce drag on the exterior of an aircraft, we’re developing a coating which mimics the structure of shark skin. In the water, it helps the creature to reduce drag, allowing it to swim swiftly and silently. By imitating this, we hope to improve the airflow over the top of an aircraft’s wing.

All these powerful fouling deterrence for up to benefits are wrapped up in an exciting new antifouling two years. developed for the yacht market by our Marine and Protective Coatings business. Targeted for both retail and professional customers, Micron WA – part of the industry-leading International Paint range – uses pioneering water activated matrix technology to deliver outstanding multi-seasonal protection in high challenge areas, in all types of waters. It combines powerful antifouling performance with a very low VOC to provide the perfect solution for customers looking for a premium quality, brightly colored antifouling which can also reduce their environmental impact. The product dries to a finish unlike a conventional antifouling and, before immersion, the color may even appear dull. But once immersed, a uniform finish and bright color develops as water filters through the matrix, saturating the pigments while at the same time efficiently releasing the active ingredients to deliver powerful fouling deterrence for up to 24 months. This extended in-service period means that owners can save money as the boat can stay in the water for longer. Designed to be compliant with future legislation, Micron WA is scheduled for an initial launch in France, with a global rollout expected to follow. A patent application has been filed to help maintain technology leadership and promote this innovative new product.

They have made rapid progress in launching into new AkzoNobel Report 2011 | Business performance | AkzoNobel Performance Coatings 55 Building the brand Whatever the industry or market you’re in, if you want to be successful, brand building is vital. A brand has to be distinctive and requires appropriate investment. It has to be recognizable and customers have to immediately connect with it. So for our Decorative Paints business, one of the most significant developments of 2011 was the launch of a single global brand identity for its retail consumer paint range. Being rolled out worldwide, the introduction of the new strategy demonstrates our determination to further expand our global market share and strengthen our reputation as the world’s leading decorative paints company. Based around a colorful flourish, which embodies Decorative Paints’ global Let’s Colour campaign – and inspires and invites consumers to decorate their homes and surroundings – the new identity has already been launched in Canada, China, India, South East Asia Pacific and the Netherlands. Other countries and regions will soon follow. AkzoNobel company endorsement is also being introduced on the front of pack and in all advertisements, product websites and other relevant marketing materials. The strategy involves streamlining our offering from dozens of brands to fewer, more impactful global brands, with the new identity eventually being deployed in close to 50 key markets. Creating the right degree of commonality and consistency, while maintaining a relevant local touch, will also help us to compete directly in regional and local markets and establish more leadership positions. Adopting this single, global approach will also help consumers to better engage with the brand through touch points and in-store shopping experiences and enable us to more effectively promote our vast range of innovative and eco-premium products.

The agreement means that consumers have full access to a complete range of top quality, innovative AkzoNobel products covering all aspects of interior and exterior decoration and offering unrivalled color expertise. As well as ensuring that RONA customers have a terrific choice of exciting decorating solutions, the strengthening of the business partnership has also resulted in a significant increase in sales.

The Supervisory Board is, however, pleased to have identified Ton Büchner as his successor and is fully expecting his formal appointment as CEO to take place at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders in 2012. In common with every year, the Supervisory Board held a full day strategy review. This followed on from the more detailed and operational three-day Executive Committee strategy review to guide the overall strategy development of the company, consistent with the medium-term ambitions announced in September 2010. To deliver on the promise created by the appointment of the Executive Committee and its introduction in January 2011, AkzoNobel announced a major performance improvement program designed to improve efficiency (with targeted improvements of €500 million by 2014) and effectiveness. Given the expected change in CEO leadership in 2012, the Supervisory Board took a more active role in the development and implementation of this program to ensure continuity during the leadership change.

We accrue for the expected costs of providing such post-retirement benefits during the service years of the employees. The main changes in 2011 related to our pension and other post-retirement obligations concerned the AkzoNobel (CPS) Pension Scheme. The UK Government announced in July 2010 that inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rather than the Retail Price Index (RPI) would be used to determine future statutory pension increases for private sector pension schemes. As CPI inflation is generally lower than RPI inflation, the anticipated lower pension payments for a large proportion of CPS pensioners reduced the defined benefit obligation by around €131 million in 2011 following a reduction of €58 million in 2010 when the change was applied to a smaller group of members. 124 Notes to the consolidated financial statements | Financial statements | AkzoNobel Report 2011 Movements in pensions and other post-retirement benefits Pensions Other post-retirement benefits Total In € millions 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 Defined benefit obligation Balance at beginning of year (13,688) (14,171) (393) (394) (14,081) (14,565) Acquisitions/divestments/transfers 192 9 16 – 208 9 Curtailments 6 – – – 6 – Settlements 15 16 – – 15 16 Past service costs (8) (6) 3 (5) (5) (11) Current service costs (52) (51) (7) (6) (59) (57) Contribution by employees (3) (4) (3) (2) (6) (6) Interest costs (773) (725) (20) (18) (793) (743) Benefits paid 936 919 34 31 970 950 Actuarial gains/(losses) (250) (715) 4 (16) (246) (731) Changes in exchange rates (546) (382) (28) (11) (574) (393) Defined benefit obligation at year-end (14,171) (15,110) (394) (421) (14,565) (15,531) Plan assets Balance at beginning of year 11,821 13,122 – – 11,821 13,122 Acquisitions/divestments/transfers (105) (6) – – (105) (6) Settlements (14) (16) – – (14) (16) Contribution by employer 524 502 31 29 555 531 Contribution by employees 3 4 3 2 6 6 Benefits paid (936) (919) (34) (31) (970) (950) Expected return on plan assets 691 684 – – 691 684 Actuarial gains/(losses) 652 840 – – 652 840 Changes in exchange rates 486 394 – – 486 394 Plan assets at year-end 13,122 14,605 – – 13,122 14,605 Funded status (1,049) (505) (394) (421) (1,443) (926) Unrecognized net loss/(gain) 637 491 (6) 10 631 501 Unrecognized past service costs 4 5 (19) (17) (15) (12) Restriction on asset recognition – (3) – – – (3) Medicare receivable – – (6) (4) (6) (4) Net balance sheet provisions (408) (12) (425) (432) (833) (444) Recorded under Provisions for pensions and other (856) (724) (425) (432) (1,281) (1,156) post-retirement benefits Other financial non-current assets 448 712 – – 448 712 Total (408) (12) (425) (432) (833) (444) AkzoNobel Report 2011 | Financial statements | Notes to the consolidated financial statements 125 Funded and unfunded pension plans In € millions 2010 2011 Wholly or partly funded plans 13,792 14,812 Unfunded plans 379 298 Total 14,171 15,110 Funded status in earlier years at December 31 Pensions Other post-retirement benefits In € millions 2007 2008 2009 2007 2008 2009 Defined benefit obligation (4,628) (11,468) (13,688) (286) (441) (393) Plan assets 3,502 10,480 11,821 – – – Funded status (1,126) (988) (1,867) (286) (441) (393) Actuarial gains and losses Pensions Other post-retirement benefits In € millions 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Defined benefit obligation Due to experience 90 (147) 331 (92) (98) (3) (5) 5 23 11 Due to change in assumptions 166 1,624 (2,034) (158) (617) 6 5 (12) (19) (27) Plan assets Due to experience (29) (1,445) 614 652 840 – – – – – Total 227 32 (1,089) 402 125 3 – (7) 4 (16) Net periodic costs Weighted average assumptions Other post-retirement Other post-retirement Pensions benefits Pensions benefits In € millions 2010 2011 2010 2011 In % 2010 2011 2010 2011 Service costs for benefits earned during the period (52) (51) (7) (6) Defined benefit obligation at year-end Interest costs on defined benefit obligations (773) (725) (20) (18) Discount rate 5.4 4.6 4.9 4.4 Expected return on plan assets 691 684 – – Rate of compensation increase 4.6 3.7 Amortization of unrecognized losses/(gains) (36) (31) – (2) Amortization of past service costs (7) (6) 5 (2) Net periodic pension costs Change of restriction of asset recognition – – – – Discount rate 5.6 5.4 5.3 4.9 Settlement/curtailment gain 6 1 – – Rate of compensation increase 4.6 4.6 – – Total (171) (128) (22) (28) Expected return on plan assets 5.7 5.3 – – 126 Notes to the consolidated financial statements | Financial statements | AkzoNobel Report 2011 The remaining plans primarily represent defined Plan assets funding of this pension fund from the escrow account is contribution plans.

This section contains summarized key performance indicators (KPIs) relating to sustainability performance. Further information on AkzoNobel’s sustainability strategy, activities and results can be found on our corporate website: www.akzonobel.com/sustainability In the driving seat As the world’s population continues to grow, finding innovative ways to develop solutions to the planet’s environmental problems is becoming increasingly important. In regions where this growth is far outpacing the global average, the need is even more urgent. Take India, for example. It’s a massive country with a rapidly expanding population and it faces several major environmental challenges. But look closely at its booming transportation market and you’ll notice that sustainable technology is starting to have an influence and make a difference. Vehicle manufacturer Tata has just launched the Iris, a small people mover designed to compete with the common rickshaw – which is open-sided and regarded by many as being unsafe. The introduction of the Iris is also significant to AkzoNobel because it uses the company’s Interpon A5000 powder coatings. The technology is a natural choice for innovative companies such as Tata. Why? Because powder products have virtually no VOCs and can be recycled or reclaimed. Powder’s environmental credentials are further enhanced by the fact that it’s a totally dry, non-liquid coating, so there’s no need to use water during manufacturing. The technology – which helps to save energy and doesn’t compromise on performance – is therefore one of few truly sustainable options well positioned to grow. The Iris was launched at Tata’s new plant in Dharwad, south west India, which is expected to produce 300 vehicles per day utilizing our powder technology. AkzoNobel’s Powder Coatings business also worked with Tata on the successful ACE truck, assembled in Pantnagar.

In the European coatings industry, one particular focus of government regulation is the use of VOC compliant varnishes and paints for all interior finishing. This is already in force for permanent installations such as cabinetry, flooring and windows and it is anticipated that the same requirements will soon be placed on movable furniture. This impending change will have a wide-ranging and significant impact, particularly on the wood coatings industry. It means that conventional, solvent-borne varnishes – which have been used for generations to apply a beautiful, durable finish – will have to be replaced. Many original equipment manufacturers (OEM) of wood products have already switched to more sustainable waterborne and UV cure formulations, but these products typically require sophisticated application equipment, which is not practical for use in custom workshops. Chemists at our Wood Finishes and Adhesives business have also been busy working on this switch to more sustainable technology and have created a new waterborne varnish which solves the custom workshop dilemma. Marketed under the Zweihorn brand, our new Duocryl waterborne, high gloss varnish has all the properties of outstanding brilliance, depth and a perfect gloss, but without the application costs and complexities. Sandable after six hours, it gives craftsmen and custom workshops the first, practical waterborne high gloss finish while reducing the impact on the environment.

Education Fund The Education Fund was created at the end of 1994 in order to make a contribution to the education of children in developing countries. Since being launched, it has changed the lives of tens of thousands of young people by supporting projects from school renovation in Burkina Faso, through improving sanitation and hygiene conditions at schools in Vietnam, to improving the capabilities of primary school teachers in Brazil. Plan Nederland estimates that several thousand children aged three to 16 have directly benefited from quality pre-school and primary education provided by the Education Fund. In 2010, three new projects were initiated in Vietnam, India and Brazil to help young people – in many cases girls – find decent and safe employment that offers them longterm prospects. It is estimated that a special fundraising campaign in 2011 will raise around €150,000, which will enable us to provide around 500 young people with vocational training opportunities.

Over the last few years, we’ve been making the most of this power to create better living environments by helping to transform places and spaces in towns and cities all over the world, using little more than a few splashes of paint. Designed to add colour to people’s lives, our Let’s Colour campaign has been a huge success, engaging local communities and encouraging residents to revitalize their surroundings. It’s also helping to create employment opportunities for people and build awareness among professionals about the positive effects and benefits of using colour. Originally introduced in Brazil, the ongoing worldwide initiative has brought a new lease of life to streets, houses, schools and squares in countries such as India, Canada, France, China, South Africa, Taiwan and Turkey. By donating more than 200,000 liters of paint and training hundreds of people, we’ve already inspired many thousands around the world. Our own employees have also volunteered thousands of hours to make the campaign a success.
