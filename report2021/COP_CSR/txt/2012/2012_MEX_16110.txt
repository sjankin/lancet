We focus on high-potential projects that can be developed into low-cost, world-class mines. Having already exceeded our original goal for attributable gold production of 400,000 ounces, set at the time of the IPO, we now aim to produce 65 million ounces of silver and 500,000 ounces of gold per year by 2018, with 650 million ounces of silver and 5.0 million ounces of gold in reserves at that time. How we do it We aim to achieve our goal through ongoing investment in exploration and mine development, operational excellence, and a strong commitment to disciplined and sustainable growth. 1 Operate 2 Develop Maximise the potential Deliver growth through of existing operations development projects We seek to operate at full capacity, replenish The disciplined advancement of exploration reserves, generate continuous improvements projects towards mine development, construction, in productivity and cost controls, and leverage start-up and production.

Gold and silver prices increased by 28.1% and 74.4% respectively over 2010 ﬁgures as a result of strong investment demand for both metals, as well as growing industrial uses for silver. While the latter part of the year saw greater volatility and concern about the fundamentals supporting these prices, I believe that global ﬁnancial instability and demand for silver in technology applications is likely to support continued demand. Against this backdrop of a favourable price environment, Fresnillo plc continued to strengthen its operations and deliver on development projects, resulting in increased gold and stable silver production. This included the start-up of the Saucito mine, which was delivered on schedule and under budget. In July the President of Mexico, Felipe Calderón, joined in the dedication of this new mine, which will become an important contributor to the growth of Fresnillo plc. Cost control measures and efﬁciency gains in the year also contributed to our competitive cash-cost position. Substantial progress was made at exploration projects, enhancing our already robust resource base. The Group’s production and project delivery schedule is on track to meet our revised growth Alberto Baillères targets. Having already exceeded our original goal for attributable Non-executive Chairman gold production, set at the time of the IPO, of 400,000 ounces by 2018, our aim now is to grow this level of production to 500,000 “The Group’s strategy is aligned with our attributable ounces of gold by that time, as well as 65 million attributable ounces of silver, with 5.0 million ounces of gold and values of responsible and sustainable business 650 million ounces of silver in reserves.

The Board is committed to prudent ﬁnancial policies to ensure sufﬁcient investment capital even under more conservative price scenarios. With US$684.9 million in cash and no debt on the balance sheet as of 31 December 2011, our capital funding options remain ﬂexible for exploration and development, pursuing potential acquisitions and returning dividends to shareholders. Metals prices will remain volatile until global macroeconomic imbalances are properly addressed. The approach of our Board is to take the long view, with a value creation strategy that does not change with unpredictable short-term shifts in the market. Thus investing across price cycles will continue to be a hallmark of our strategy, as will the disciplined development of new, value-creating projects. Fundamental to this strategy is the social license to operate, which is earned by a profound and unwavering commitment to 06 sustainable development and to the wellbeing of our workforce.

We continue to maximise the potential of this operation in a sustainable way. 09 Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Report Our growth strategy seeks to optimise the mining value chain: exploration, development, construction and operations. We continue to strengthen our precious metals position with a commitment to disciplined and sustainable growth. Our continuous and growing investment in exploration in recent years has resulted in a strong pipeline of projects at all stages of exploration and development, ensuring long-term organic growth and advancing our strategic objectives. We begin 2012 well positioned in the precious metals industry with a low cost production proﬁle, rich resource base, robust growth pipeline and strong cash position. I believe the renewed focus on safety and corrective measures we are taking following our unacceptable 2011 safety performance, combined with a more deeply embedded risk management culture will support long-term value creation for all Fresnillo stakeholders. Our growth strategy The fundamentals of the precious metals market have signiﬁcantly changed in the past decade, with exchange traded funds and investment demand now seen as the primary drivers of pricing, which in turn are strongly inﬂuenced by global macroeconomic instability and geopolitical tensions rather than the once typical cycle of our industry: rising demand–higher prices–producer expansion–rising inventories–softer prices. See Market Overview pages 16–19 Jaime Lomelín Our strategy of consistent investment across precious metals cycles Chief Executive Ofﬁcer seems particularly prescient when those cycles are increasingly volatile and unpredictable. Given the typical 10+ year span from I am pleased to report strong ﬁnancial results in discovery of an ore body to commissioning of a mine and the 2011, driven by the strength of precious metal difﬁculty of predicting metal prices, we believe that consistent investment in exploration and low cost production is most likely prices and record gold production. While silver to ensure long-term, proﬁtable growth. Furthermore, this strategy production dropped at our ﬂagship Fresnillo has allowed us to continuously employ a stable and loyal workforce mine due to declining ore grades and additional with the skill mix required for all stages of the project cycle, which is safety measures, it was largely compensated for a competitive advantage during times such as these when skilled workers are in high demand. by the successful start-up of the Saucito mine. As a result of this strategy, in 2011 we commissioned the new Saucito mine (silver), completed construction of Noche Buena (gold) and expanded production capacity at Soledad-Dipolos (gold), all of which were early exploration prospects at a time when silver and gold prices were nowhere near their levels today. Maximising the potential of our operations Of course revenue generation is driven by prevailing prices at the time our concentrates reach the market. Our margins are driven by continued improvements in production, productivity, replacement of ore reserves and cost controls. 10 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 Overview Our ﬂagship Fresnillo silver mine has been in near continuous Strategic Review operation for almost 500 years and is still the world’s single largest Total attributable silver resources primary silver mine, producing 2.8% of global production in 2011. The challenge is to compensate for the trend of declining grades in 1.8 billion ounces +23.0% current reserves by identifying new high grade areas and increasing the volume of ore processed, while proﬁtably mining the plentiful, 2010: 1.5 lower grade resources. To do so, we continue to explore in the mine’s area of inﬂuence and plan to expand milling capacity from 8,000 to 10,000 tpd in 2013-2014. Performance To reinforce safety conditions in the mine, we restricted production at certain higher grade stopes at Fresnillo for several months to Total attributable gold resources ensure adequate backﬁlling and ground control. This resulted in 23.5 million ounces +16.9% annual silver production at this mine of 30.3 million ounces, lower than the expected 34.7 million, but reafﬁrmed our commitment 2010: 20.1 to the safety of our employees.

Over the course of 2012 the mine and plant operations should stabilise and concentrate quality improve as more ore becomes available from production stopes. Total attributable silver production in the year included 3.9 million ounces of silver accrued under the Silverstream Contract, 10.8% higher than in 2010. 2008 2011 The Group achieved record gold production of 448,866 attributable Silver 479.1 1,214.2 ounces, up 21.6% over 2010. This was due to the successful Gold 303.5 1,009.4 ramp-up of expanded production capacity at Soledad-Dipolos Lead 30.0 43.0 to 158,513 ounces, exceeding the target of 130,000 ounces Zinc 27.0 40.8 (attributable production at this mine was 88,767 ounces); higher volumes from Herradura and Saucito; and the commissioning of Ciénega’s plant expansion and development ore from its new satellite mining area, San Ramón. These results put us on track to meet our revised production targets for 2018 of 65 million ounces of silver and 500,000 ounces of gold per year, with 650 million ounces of silver and 5.0 million ounces of gold in reserves at that time. Lead and zinc production increased by 13.0% and 2.9% respectively, due to the increased volumes of ore processed and higher ore grades at Fresnillo and Saucito. These base metals are by-products of the Group’s core operations. 11 Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Report continued Silver continues to account for a majority of Group revenues, but the Capex 2011 share of gold rose from 36.1% in 2008 to 43.7% in 2011.

Financial Statements The pre-feasibility study for Juanicipio will be delivered in 1Q 2012, and for San Julián in 2Q 2012. Strengthening the sustainability framework Our business model is dependent on community support and constructive labour relations, sound environmental management, and exemplary safety and healthy performance. Indeed, a core pillar of our strategy is strengthening the Group’s sustainability framework. Yet our safety performance in 2011 was unacceptable, particularly in the context of our strong track record, with 11 fatalities in our mining operations during the year, and an additional fatality in early 2012. Whether these were contractors or employees, new or experienced personnel, the result of human error or equipment failure, no fatality is ever acceptable. With deep sadness, the Board of Directors and entire Senior Management team extends our condolences to the families and colleagues of the deceased. 13 Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Report continued As a result of our safety performance in 2011 we undertook a major I am personally committed to turning around our performance review of our health and safety programme. We solicited an in this area and see it as an important corollary to the work we are independent audit by a third party safety consultancy and asked doing in enterprise risk management and enhancing the overall Industrias Peñoles, S.A.B. de C.V to carry out an audit as part of sustainability framework.

Of the estimated 1,064.4 million ounces of silver produced 2010: 2,709 tonnes globally in 2011, the bulk was derived as a by-product from base metals and gold mining (~69%), and less than 31% from primary silver mines.

In 2011 gold mine production increased by 3.8% over 2010, and central banks were net buyers of the metal. Global gold production million ounces While investment in exploration has increased to meet the 2,800 continued rise in demand, there have been no new large-scale discoveries of silver or gold and exploration has become increasingly 2,600 dependent on junior companies.

Geopolitical insecurity and the Eurozone crisis, combined with a fall in the price of the dollar led many investors to this so-called safe haven for the ﬁrst nine months of the year, while strong ﬂows back into and demand for US dollars eased prices in the last quarter of 2011, as did liquidation by hedge funds to fund redemption requests and slack physical demand from India as a result of the sizeable depreciation of the rupee at the end of summer, among other factors.

Mining taxes have recently been implemented in several Latin American countries including Chile and Peru, and some Mexican legislators have proposed similar initiatives, although to date not successfully. The Mexican mining industry, through the Mining Chamber, will continue to petition against any mining tax as it affects employment creation, direct Governance foreign and local investment, and the industry’s ability to compete. Country environment: Mexico Mexico provides a favourable environment for mining: ﬂexible and well-structured mining and environmental legislation; a favourable political climate; strong mining tradition and expertise; a skilled workforce, currently in high demand due to increased mining and exploration activity in the sector; and solid infrastructure. Financial Statements The geological potential remains strong, and more than 300 mining companies and private exploration groups have projects and facilities in Mexico, with operations concentrated in the northern states of Durango, Sonora, Zacatecas and Chihuahua. Mining is an important contributor to the country’s economy, accounting for approximately 1.6% of GDP, and 286,000 direct jobs. As such the industry beneﬁts from a well-structured and supportive regulatory and ﬁscal framework. Security in Mexico has continued to deteriorate as drug cartels seek to control access routes to the United States, abetted by weak control in the ﬂow of weapons across the border. While we believe media reporting has exaggerated the extent of the security threat, we recognise the potential risk to our business and have put in place policies and procedures to protect our personnel, operations and assets. The security situation has had no signiﬁcant impact on the Group’s performance or production, although the measures we have taken do inﬂuence the way we operate and explore See Our Risk Management Framework pages 36–43. 19 Our Business Model Where we sit in the precious metals Fresnillo plc is a silver and gold mining value chain company operating in Mexico.

The construction of the Jarillas shaft remained on schedule for start-up in 2H 2012. This new shaft will have a 5,000 tonnes per day capacity and will reduce haulage and hoisting costs at the Saucito mine. Notwithstanding strong production results, there were three fatalities at Saucito in 2011 due to improper adherence to safety procedures, and the mine experienced higher than average personnel turnover in the year related to the perceived external security situation. The employee retention rate improved as the Company enhanced its security measures over the course of the year, which also helped strengthen safety performance given the correlation between tenure and participation in safety training. We also inaugurated the Occupational Health Unit during the year. 51 Our Mines in Operation continued Maximising the potential of existing operations Ciénega Ownership: 100% Fresnillo plc Strategy Location: Durango Maintain production in equivalent gold ounces; Facilities: Underground mine, ﬂotation and leaching plant compensate for lower average gold ore grade 2011 milling capacity: 2,800 tpd / 930,000 tpy Workforce: 452 employees, 334 contractors by exploring and extracting mineral from the San Ramón satellite and other areas of inﬂuence, Reserves and mine life controlling costs, and evaluating the leaching In operation since: 1992 of gold and silver from zinc concentrates.

This contributed to the increase in total gold production to 158,513 total ounces in 2011. Governance For 2012 a decrease in production volumes to the stated capacity of 130,000 ounces is expected due to the shifting of contractors from production activities to stripping. Average gold ore grade was 0.57g/t in 2011 and is expected to remain at similar levels for 2012. Attributable resources at this mine totalled 600,000 ounces of gold by year-end, a 22.1% decrease, while attributable reserves decreased Financial Statements from 590,000 to 580,000 ounces of gold resulting in an expected mine life of 4.3 years at the current production capacity. Notwithstanding, the Group continues to explore in the area of inﬂuence to expand the resource base at this mine. 57 Delivering Growth Through Development Projects 1 2 Our Development Projects 3 4 Noche Buena Ownership: Minera Penmont (56% Fresnillo plc, About the project 44% Newmont USA Limited) Noche Buena was acquired in 2008.

Our unaudited reserves estimate of 460,000 ounces of gold was deemed Anticipated annual average production: 42,000 attributable conservative by an independent mining consultancy. ounces of gold Unaudited total gold resources increased to 1.35 million ounces. The Noche Buena mine will be supported by the same communities as Herradura and Soledad-Dipolos. As with all our development projects, safety risk is increased due to the extensive reliance on contractors, some of whom are new and not accustomed to the Group’s safety policies and procedures. All contractors are subject to strict training and monitoring as part of our risk mitigation. What we did in 2011 Development remained on track to start commercial production in 1Q 2012. Positive exploration results indicate the potential for longer mine life, warranting the construction of a second leaching pad. Personnel were trained over the course of 2011, included truck operators who are currently working with the development team. Safety training courses for all new employees have already begun. Given the encouraging exploration results that indicate potential for longer mine life (460,000 total ounces of gold in reserves and 1.3 million total ounces in resources at year end 2011), the Executive Committee approved construction of a second leaching pad which will require an additional US$13.8 million investment and is expected to be completed in 2H 2012.

We believe that the sole way to secure a thriving and successful business is to safeguard the life and wellbeing of its stakeholders. Given the high social and environmental impact of the mining sector at the local level, we strive to earn and maintain our social licence to operate with responsible stewardship of Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations (HSECR). We also believe that a commitment to operational efﬁciency and improved performance in areas such as unit consumption of energy and water, recycling and waste management will beneﬁt our own productivity and reputation, as well as the development of Mexico. We are proud of our track record as a socially and environmentally responsible company and deeply value our relationships with all our stakeholders. Thus I am profoundly saddened by our safety performance in 2011. We lost 11 men, two employees and nine contractors, whom we also honour for their roles as husbands and fathers and friends in the communities where we operate. This performance signalled insufﬁcient compliance with our safety systems and procedures and we responded immediately, as per the Safety Action Plan described herein, recognising that strengthening Jaime Lomelín our precious metals position requires strengthening every component Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of our business model. Following an assessment by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) of “A core pillar of our strategy is strengthening our HSECR system we prepared a 2012–2016 Action Plan to ensure the Group’s sustainability framework; I am that gaps are closed and we achieve a fully integrated and effective personally committed to our performance corporate responsibility programme.

Governance Financial Statements Improving health at Fresnillo and Saucito Comprehensive Preventive Health Activities Programme To combat chronic diseases and promote better health among workers, the Fresnillo and Saucito mine units implemented the Comprehensive Preventive Activities Programme in 2011 with initiatives such as vaccination, de-parasitisation, disease screening and monitoring, reproductive health, dental care and nutrition. The campaign beneﬁted almost 5,200 unionised workers, contractors and their immediate families. We also scaled up the programme to a broader health campaign for educational institutions in collaboration with federal and local public agencies including the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), the Mexican Secretariat of Health (SSA), the Fresnillo municipality, Don Napoleón Gómez Sada trade union and Gilberto, A.C., an NGO. More than 2,000 students from surrounding schools took part, and we are committed to sustaining this programme over time. “Thank you very much for being interested in me and my family; I had breast cancer detected and access to social security was much easier.” Virginia Ibarra Arguelles, the mother of a Fresnillo plc employee, 30 November 2011 67 Sustainable Development Report continued Advancing our sustainable development Safety Objective How we do it Zero fatalities and lost time accidents through the By reinforcing safety policies and procedures, elimination of dangerous workplace conditions investing in safety equipment and training, and and behaviours conducting drills to reinforce safety behaviour What we said we would do in 2011 What we did in 2011 – Zero fatal accidents and a 20.0% improvement in other safety – Following 11 fatal accidents we implemented a comprehensive indices; OHSAS certiﬁcation at Fresnillo and 50.0% progress at Safety Action Plan that includes supplemental training, other operating mines; ﬁrst level of the Safe Enterprise Certiﬁcate enforcement of rules regarding violation of our Zero Tolerance at all operating mines policy, and operational improvements in the mine works What we plan to do in 2012 – Continue implementing the Safety Action Plan to improve, enhance and embed our safety culture and systems at all levels, with full compliance with our Zero Tolerance Rules for Safety – Complete the pending OHSAS 18001 certiﬁcation process at Fresnillo; 90% advance at Herradura and Soledad-Dipolos; 80% advance at Ciénega; initiate process at Saucito – Achieve Second Level of the Safety Self-Management Programme for Herradura and Soledad-Dipolos and First Level at all other mine units; register Noche Buena to the programme Performance indicator 2011 2010 2009 Comment Fatalities 11 2 0 Unacceptable performance led to immediate action being taken.

Financial Statements Process for Behavioural Change An institutional programme for a culture of safety We know that accidents are not caused by unsafe conditions or lack of training alone, but often from unsafe attitudes and behaviours. One of our key priorities is to promote a culture of safety. We have collaborated for over ﬁve years with an organisation called Integral Health Advisors in a programme called Process for Behavioural Change (PCCTM) that seeks to achieve “comprehensive behavioural change in each worker... making conscious what usually remains unconscious.” The programme includes a workshop facilitated by psychologists where skills such as trust, self-esteem, listening, empathy, teamwork, assertiveness, communication, conﬂict resolution and work performance are addressed. The workshop also increases awareness by exercising participants’ different emotions. PCCTM was brought to Ciénega in 2008 and extended to Herradura the following year, and in 2011 it was introduced at Fresnillo. “The workshop made me more conscious about my actions so I could stop myself in my path and modify inappropriate conduct.” A total of 2,181 workers in 124 groups have participated to date.

Extended ecosystem restoration Expansion in the Herradura district A core aspect of our mine development and expansion work is environmental impact analysis. The Herradura mine was commissioned in 1997 and has since undergone expansion and supported regional growth with the development of the Soledad-Dipolos mine and Noche Buena project. Operating in parallel with this growth was the Flora and Fauna Rescue and Relocation Programme, which concluded its work in March 2011 after more than three years. A total of 231,628 plants and 450 reptiles and mammals were relocated, and more than 400 hectares rehabilitated to serve as habitat for endangered species such as the Sonoran Pronghorn. The results of the programme were highly satisfactory with a general survival rate for relocated plants of more than 90%. In fact, part of the environmental land use permits granted us for the Noche Buena project by the Mexican Environmental Secretariat (SEMARNAT) included the donation and transport of 600 specimens to a public conservation park in central Mexico, which was coordinated by a local NGO. 71 Sustainable Development Report continued Advancing our sustainable development Community Relations Objective How we do it Provide development opportunities and workplace By providing professional development satisfaction for our personnel; enhance communities’ opportunities and workplace satisfaction for perception of Fresnillo plc as a responsible mining our personnel and maintaining sound relations company, and promote their self-sustainment with the communities where we operate What we said we would do in 2011 What we did in 2011 – Expand the family visit programme, enhance communications – We reinforced our social programmes, scheduled regular visits and complete an impact analysis of our community investments by employee families and communities and reinforced communications strategy at our mine units What we plan to do in 2012 – Conduct the biannual employee satisfaction survey – Conduct the biannual community perception survey – Launch the Community Relations Scorecard as a tool to measure the social impact of our activities Performance indicator 2011 2010 2009 Comment Human resources Professional development training 96 95 92 Leadership, teamwork, process improvement, Average hours/person productivity and management skills HSECR training 41 27 23 Primary focus on safety; substantial increase due to Average hours/person the implementation of the Process of Behavioural Change programme; continued module on Sustainable Development for unionised workers Investment in training programmes US$1.7 US$1.2 – Indicator added in 2010 million million Turnover rate 5.69 4.61 5.56 Reﬂects the launch of construction at Noche Number of union and non-union employees who left the Buena; new projects Company divided by the total number of employees normally involve large-scale hiring and thus an increase in turnover Employee satisfaction survey N/A 6.8 4.9 Conducted every two years (2008) by independent third party Survey of union and non-union workers and contractors Labour relations 0 0 0 All collective and contract negotiations were Total number of days in which operations were successfully conducted compromised due to disagreements with local unions and/ or contract negotiations 72 Fresnillo plc 1 Annual report 2011 2 3 4 Overview Human resources programme highlights 2011 workforce overview Selection, recruitment, retention and professional development – Total: 3,051 employees (2010: 2,449); 2,252 contractors (2010: are material issues for the Group, and the wellbeing of our people 1,972); of employees 80.4% are unionised directly correlates to the sound performance of the Company. – Gender: 90.7% men, 9.3% women (while the physical nature of Our human resources programme positions quality of life for our mining correlates to the gender breakdown, notably 60% of new personnel and their families as a competitive differentiator. hires at Herradura and Saucito in 2011 were women, as are 10.4% Human rights are a fundamental principle for us, and along with full of all supervisors and managers) compliance with human rights regulations, our Code of Conduct – Age: 21% 18–25; 62% 26–45; 17% 46+ Strategic Review requires gender equality, respect for freedom of thought and – Tenure: 57% 0–5 years; 15% 6–10 years; 28% 11+ years association, and prohibition of slavery, child labour and – Executives: 2.4% at management level discrimination of customs and cultures.

In geographically isolated Performance mines sites we provide basic services such as housing, medical services, education and transportation. Contractors are considered strategic partners and we continue to integrate them into our systems and culture through specialised training. To support the growth and safety of our operations, we hired 617 new employees and 455 new contractors in 2011. Total wages and salaries were US$25.1 million, excluding employee proﬁt sharing, a 21.3% increase from the previous year. We continued to partner with a Governance number of technical and academic institutions to train and develop the next generation of earth science and engineering graduates. Financial Statements The promotion of earth sciences The Technical Studies Centre at Fresnillo (CETEF) As part of our effort to develop personnel and support the expansion of the mining sector through academic alliances, we inaugurated the Fresnillo Technical Studies Centre in September 2011 with a ﬁrst cohort of 22 students specialising in the operation of technical mining equipment. Most students are family members of employees from our mine unit. The educational plan includes a dual system that incorporates 80% of empirical training done in the Company’s facilities and 20% of theoretical knowledge. Student housing was also inaugurated, with facilities such as a recreational yard and dining and TV rooms. “The inauguration of CETEF by Fresnillo is an excellent self-development opportunity for our students.” Saul Herrera, Trainer, Fresnillo, 14 February 2012 73 Sustainable Development Report continued Advancing our sustainable development Community relations continued Community programme highlights Efforts are divided into ﬁve pillars of action We see communities as our strategic partners because they supply – Environmental awareness vital services and a local labour force.

See Our Mines in Operation pages 48–57 for segment information. The power of partnerships Local development at Ciénega Ciénega is located in the middle of the Durango sierra, far from any major urban centre. As a result of this geographic isolation we have invested in basic social services such as drainage, electriﬁcation and paving. However, the risk of creating undue dependency on the Company, and our mission to foster self-sustaining communities, led to a strategy of investing in infrastructure projects through trilateral partnerships with government agencies and local organisations. Two such projects were inaugurated in 2011: a high school built in partnership with the College of Scientiﬁc and Technologic Studies for the State of Durango (CECyTED), and the paving of the main road in partnership with the municipal and federal government through a national programme sponsored by the Mexican Secretariat of Social Development. “Those who have seen the growth and sustained development at Ciénega de Nuestra Señora since the foundation of the mining company, are loyal witnesses of the improvement in the quality of life.” Carlos Gandarilla, Contractor, Ciénega, 5 October 2011 74 Fresnillo plc 1 Annual report 2011 2 3 4 Overview Performance indicator 2011 2010 2009 Comment Communities Community perception index N/A 86 85 Conducted every two years (2008) by independent third party; Average perception of four components – labour, most recent score is highest environmental, institutional and social – from three different possible ranking with sources – household surveys, anthropological observations “very positive” and personal interviews Strategic Review Total investment in community wellbeing US$8.7 US$6.1 – Indicator added in 2010 million million (includes the ﬁve pillars of action) Performance Governance Financial Statements Communication on Progress Chart – United Nations Global Compact Section in the Report 1.

As anticipated, exploration expenditure rose signiﬁcantly over 2010 to support the Group’s organic growth strategy. Cash ﬂow generated by our operations and the Silverstream Contract, combined with a healthy cash position, enabled the Company to continue investing in plant and equipment and to pay dividends. As of December, Fresnillo plc held US$684.9 million in cash which will continue to support our growth strategy in the future. 76 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 Overview Income Statement Foreign exchange rates Strategic Review The Group’s ﬁnancial performance is strongly determined by the In 2011, the average spot Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate operating performance of our assets, the skills of our personnel was MXN12.42 per US dollar, compared to MXN12.64 per US dollar and management’s efﬁciency in executing the Group’s strategy. in 2010.

Against this backdrop, the Nominations Committee will consider female candidates for future appointment to the Board as part of the process of succession planning and future changes to the Board as and when the composition of the Board is refreshed. The Nominations Commitee will consider Board succession at its meeting in April 2012 prior to recommending to the 104 Board proposals for the re-election of directors at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

The Report sets out information about the remuneration of the Directors and senior management of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2011. In accordance with the Regulations, the information provided in the section entitled ‘Directors’ Remuneration – 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011’ and accompanying notes has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP. This report will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the Company’s forthcoming Annual General Meeting. “The Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure Membership The Remuneration Committee consisted of the following Directors the senior executives of your company are in the year ended 31 December 2011: rewarded in a manner that is fair by the standards – Lord Cairns (chairman), Independent Non-executive Director of comparability with companies in the sector – Mr Fernando Ruiz, Independent Non-executive Director both nationally and internationally.

The Remuneration Committee approved a number of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each member of the Executive Committee, and KPI targets were set at which payments equivalent to 0% to 50% of annual salary could be earned. A scoring system is used whereby each objective set for the executive at the beginning of the year is allocated a points-rating which represents a median performance target for that objective. Upper and lower point thresholds are set to allow for outstanding performance and ensure that underperformance is not rewarded. For each member of the Executive Committee (including the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer), a bonus is only payable if the aggregate performance equals or exceeds 100 points. Bonus payments are paid for aggregate performance against target at or above 100 points as follows: Variable Pay Variable Pay Points (Month’s Salary) (% Annual Salary) 100–104 Two 16.67 105–109 Four 33.33 110–114 Five 41.67 115+ Six 50.00 The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer achieved 100.7 points for the year to 31 December 2011 (2010: 115 points) and therefore was awarded a bonus of two months’ salary for 2011. The objectives, as applied to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s short-term incentive payment, measures associated with each objective, and the relative weighting between objectives, are detailed below: Objective Measure Weighting 2011 Award Points Points Production Increase in equivalent ounces produced1 26 26.5 Exploration/growth Increase in total resources and resources upgraded from inferred to indicated1 30 33.2 Financial Net proﬁt adjusted2 17 14.3 Stakeholder Various 12 13.7 Teamwork No measure 10 14.0 Safety Fatal accidents3 5 0 TOTAL 100 101.7 Adjustments – (1.0) TOTAL 100 100.7 1 Any decrease in equivalent ounces produced and/or in reserves and resources will result in points being deducted from the total points scored. 2 Net proﬁt is adjusted to reﬂect currency ﬂuctuation, the effect of year-on-year changes in metals prices and to exclude any revaluation of the Silverstream contract in determining this measure. 3 A further penalty of one point will be deducted from the total bonus for each employee fatality. Recognising that a number of contractor fatalities occurred in 2011, this penalty will be extended to include contractors’ employees in 2012. 112 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 The Remuneration Committee has considered the effectiveness of KPIs and targets set in 2011 with a view to conﬁrming those to be set Overview for 2012. It continues to consider that the overall structure of the Short-Term Incentive Plan is appropriate however it has made adjustments to the criteria as follows: Criteria Change 2012 Reason for Change in 2012 Exploration/growth In 2011, 15 points was awarded for the Total Resource This is designed to place greater emphasis target and 15 points awarded for meeting target on maintaining the quality of resources. upgrades from inferred to indicated resources. In 2012 10 points will be awarded for the Total Resources target and 20 points awarded for the Strategic Review upgrade to Indicated Resources. Safety The criteria will include all fatalities, not just employees. The safety performance among contractors The points value for zero fatalities has been increased in 2011 was a particular cause for concern. from 5 to 10 points in order to give this higher priority. Long-Term Incentives Fresnillo does not offer any shareor cash-based long-term incentives to management. Performance Executive Director The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Jaime Lomelín, is the sole Executive Director and is employed under a contract of employment with Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S.A. de C.V., a subsidiary of Fresnillo plc. Mr Lomelín’s contract was entered into on 9 May 2008 and is governed by Mexican Federal Labour Law. It does not have a ﬁxed term. This means that it may be terminated in writing by either party on notice in writing and there is no entitlement to additional compensation for termination other than compensation payments required for termination without cause under Mexican labour laws. No beneﬁts are payable under the service agreement upon termination of employment. The salary payable under Mr Lomelín’s service agreement is MXN$1,062,600 per month, an increase of 5% on 2010 (2010: MXN$1,012,000). In addition, he received other payments for holidays, company-paid savings contributions and other cash beneﬁts. In 2011, his total salary Governance payments were MXN$17,849,322; US$1,436,299 (2010: MXN$17,094,433; US$1,352,761). Under his service agreement, Mr Lomelín is entitled to 26 working days’ paid holiday per year. He is not entitled to proﬁt-sharing. Beneﬁts-in-kind – Executive Director Mr Lomelín is entitled to life insurance, the use of a company car, the payment of medical expenses and medical beneﬁts. Pensions The Group operates two pension schemes: (i) a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme which was closed to new members on 1 July 2007 with beneﬁts Financial Statements frozen at this date for existing members, subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index; and (ii) a deﬁned contribution scheme (which was introduced on 1 July 2007). Membership of the latter scheme is voluntary, contributions of between 5% and 8% are made to this plan by its members and contributions are matched by the Company. Mr Lomelín is a deferred member of the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme in respect of service before 30 June 2007. He did not join the deﬁned contribution scheme when it was introduced in 2007 and has no accrued beneﬁts under that scheme. Chairman and Non-executive Directors The remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the Non-executive Directors consists of fees that are paid quarterly in arrears. The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, nor do they accrue any pension entitlement. Neither the Chairman nor any of the Non-executive Directors has a service contract with the Company; however each has entered into a letter of appointment with the Company. 113 Directors’ Remuneration Report continued Non-executive Directors’ Letters of Appointment On their initial appointment, each of the Non-executive Directors signed a letter of appointment with the Company, for an initial period of three years. In April 2011, the letters of appointment for all the Non-executive Directors were amended in accordance with provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, obliging them to retire at each Annual General Meeting and be subject to annual re-election by shareholders to serve for a further term of one year. The amendments have been drafted such that renewed appointment will not necessitate a new letter of appointment. The fees payable to each Non-executive Director are set by the Board in accordance with its Schedule of Reserved Matters, and have been set at a level to reﬂect the time commitment and level of involvement they are required to make in the activities of the Board and its committees. Unless otherwise determined, the Director concerned may give not less than three months’ notice of termination of the appointment. There are no special provisions that have been agreed with the Non-executive Directors or the Executive Director with regard to compensation for loss of ofﬁce. Copies of the Directors’ letters of appointment and service agreements are available for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce. The key terms of the Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment are as follows: Notice period from Duration Director Date of appointment Director to the Company of term* Fees p.a.

The current term expires on 18 May 2012, being the date of the next Annual General Meeting but the appointment will continue after that date provided that each Director is re-elected at the AGM. External Appointments It is the Board’s policy to allow Executive Directors to accept directorships of other quoted and non-quoted companies provided that they have obtained the consent of the Chairman of the Company. Any such directorships must be formally notiﬁed to the Board. Currently, Mr Lomelín is the sole Executive Director and he does not hold any appointments to the board of any other FTSE 100 quoted company.

Significant accounting policies (a) Basis of preparation and consolidation, and statement of compliance Basis of preparation and statement of compliance The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The consolidated financial statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial instruments and defined benefit pension scheme assets which have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$ and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) except when otherwise indicated. The Group uses a columnar approach to separately present the Silverstream revaluation effect, including related tax, in the income statement as in the Directors’ judgement this needs to be disclosed separately in this manner by virtue of its size and volatility, in order for users of the financial statements to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information and the underlying performance of the business. 129 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued In 2011, freight costs associated with ore transported from Fresnillo plc’s mines to Met-Mex facilities have been presented as selling expenses in the income statement in order to be consistent with the information reviewed by the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. These were previously presented as part of cost of sales. Comparative information has been amended to reflect this reclassification in order to be comparable with the presentation in 2011. As a result cost of sales as at 31 December 2010 has decreased by USD$4.9 million. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial position as of 31 December 2011 and 2010, and the results of operations and cash flows for the years then ended. Entities that constitute the Group are those enterprises controlled by the Group regardless of the number of shares owned by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Entities are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. These interests primarily represent the interests in Minera Penmont, S. de R.L. de C.V., Minera El Bermejal, S. de R.L. de C.V. and Minera Juanicipio, S.A. de C.V. not held by the Group. The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the amount attributed to such interests at initial recognition and the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Any losses of a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance. (b) Changes in accounting policies and disclosures The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010, except for the reclassifications of freight cost from cost of sales to selling expenses described in note 2 (a) and for the adoption of certain amendments to existing standards effective as of 1 January 2011. Those that are applicable or relevant to the Group, resulting in changes to accounting policies, but with no impact on its financial position or performance are as follows: Amendments for IFRSs – IAS 24 Related Party Transactions (Amendment): It clarifies the definitions of a related party. The new definitions emphasise a symmetrical view of related party relationships as well as clarifying in which circumstances persons and key management personnel affect related party relationships of an entity. Also, the amendment introduces an exemption from the general related party disclosure requirements for transactions with government and entities that are controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by the same government as the reporting entity. Other amendments to existing interpretations that are effective but not applicable to the Group are as follows: – IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement (Amendment): The amendment removes an unintended consequence when an entity is subject to minimum funding requirements (MFR) and makes an early payment of contributions to cover such requirements. The amendment permits a prepayment of future service cost by the entity to be recognised as a pension asset. Improvements to IFRSs In May 2010, the IASB issued its third omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording. There are separate transitional provisions for each standard. The adoption of the following amendments resulted in changes to accounting policies but did not have any impact on the financial position, performance or disclosures of the Group. – IFRS 3 Business Combinations: The measurement options available for a non-controlling interest (NCI) have been amended. Only components of NCI that constitute a present ownership interest that entitles their holder to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation shall be measured at either fair value or at the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. All other components are to be measured at their acquisition date fair value. The improvements to IFRS 3 will have an impact on the Group’s future acquisitions. – IFRS 7 Financial Instruments – Disclosures: The amendment was intended to simplify the disclosures provided by reducing the volume of disclosures around collateral held and improving disclosures by requiring qualitative information to put the quantitative information in context. The IASB and IFRIC have issued other amendments resulting from Improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group. 130 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 New and amended standards and interpretations Standards and amendments issued but not yet effective or early adopted up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed below. This listing is of standards and interpretations issued, which the Group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. The Group intends to adopt those standards when they become effective. – IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation – Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (‘OCI’): The amendments to IAS 1 change the grouping of items presented in OCI. Items that could be reclassified (or recycled) to profit or loss at a future point in time (for Overview example, upon derecognition or settlement) would be presented separately from items that will never be reclassified. The amendment affects presentation only and has no impact on the Group’s financial position or performance. The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012. The Group currently does not have items in OCI that will never be recycled through earnings and therefore, the adoption of this revised standard would not impact the current presentation of the statement of comprehensive income except for the potential impacts of IAS 19 (2011) described below, which requires that actuarial gains or losses arising from employee benefits that are currently recognised in the income statement would have to be presented in OCI as items that would never be recycled to the income statement. – IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Amendment): The IASB has issued numerous amendments to IAS 19. The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and is applicable retrospectively from the beginning of the earliest Strategic Review period presented. The most significant impacts of this standard as it relates to the Group’s consolidated financial position and results of operations are expected to be as follows: – Presentation changes to the statement of comprehensive income: the net actuarial gain recognised in the year will be presented within OCI, instead of being recognised in the income statement; and – Financial performance change: due to presentation changes, the profit/(loss) of the year and earning per shares will be impacted. The Group is currently assessing the full impact of the remaining standards and interpretations. Performance – IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (as revised in 2011): As a consequence of the new IFRS 10 and IFRS 12, (see below), what remains of IAS 27 does not change the recognition and presentation requirements as it relates to accounting for subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities, and associates in separate financial statements (cost method or fair value) and as a result the adoption of this revised standard is not expected to impact the separate financial statements of the Group. The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. – IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (as revised in 2011): As a consequence of the new IFRS 11 and IFRS 12, IAS 28 has been renamed IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, and describes the application of the equity method to investments in joint ventures in addition to associates. The other provisions within IAS 28 remain consistent as it relates to Governance accounting for investments in associates under the equity method. The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. – IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement: IFRS 9 reflects the first phase of the IASBs work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. In subsequent phases, the IASB will address hedge accounting and impairment of financial assets. The Group is in the process of identifying the potential impacts of the current changes to IFRS 9 and will quantify the effects on its consolidated financial position and results of operations in conjunction with the other phases, when issued, to present a comprehensive picture of such impacts on its consolidated financial statements. Financial Statements – IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 10 replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. It also includes the issues raised in SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 will require management to exercise significant judgement to determine which entities are controlled, and therefore, are required to be consolidated by a parent, compared with the requirements that were in IAS 27. This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The Group’s management does not expect impacts on its consolidated financial statements with the adoption of this new standard when it becomes effective. – IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities: IFRS 12 includes all of the disclosures that were previously in IAS 27 related to consolidated financial statements, as well as all of the disclosures that were previously included in IAS 31 and IAS 28. These disclosures relate to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities. A number of new disclosures are also required. This standard will become effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 with the adoption of IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IAS 27 (2011) and IAS 28 (2011). The Group will include the relevant disclosures required by IFRS 12 upon adoption. 131 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued – IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted. The Group is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its financial position and performance. This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. Given that the Group does not currently have non-monetary assets measured at fair value, the potential impacts of this new standard would be in relation to its financial instruments measured at fair value. – IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine (New interpretation): This interpretation provides guidance for the recognition of production stripping cost as a non-current asset. This interpretation establishes that stripping costs are recognised as a non-current asset, to the extent the benefit is improved access to ore and only if it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the stripping activity will flow to the entity, the component of the ore body for which access has been improved can be clearly identified and the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with that component can be measured reliably. This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The Group is in the process of analysing the impacts of IFRIC 20. The IASB has issued other amendments resulting from Improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group. (c) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These judgements and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Judgements Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are: – Determination of functional currencies note 2(d): The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. – Evaluation of projects status note 2(e): The evaluation of project status impacts the accounting for costs incurred and requires management judgement. This includes the assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals to justify the commencement of capitalisation of costs; the timing of the end of the exploration phase and the start of the development phase and the commencement of the production phase. These judgements directly impact the treatment of costs incurred and proceeds from the sale of metals from ore produced. Estimates and assumptions Significant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements include: – Determination of useful lives of assets for depreciation and amortisation purposes notes 2(e) and 13: Estimates are required to be made by management as to the useful lives of assets. For depreciation calculated under the unit-ofproduction method, estimated recoverable reserves are used in determining the depreciation and/or amortisation of mine specific assets. This results in a depreciation/amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the estimated remaining life of mine production. Each item’s life, which is assessed annually, has regard to both its physical life limitations and to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the asset is located. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including the amount of recoverable reserves. Changes are accounted for prospectively. – Estimation of the amount and timing of mine closure costs notes 2(l) and 22: The Group assesses its provision for mine closure cost annually. Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for mine closure cost as there are numerous factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable. These factors include estimates of the extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, technological changes, regulatory changes, cost increases, mine life and changes in discount rates. Those uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided. The provision at the balance sheet date represents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future closure costs required. Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting the mine closure cost liability and the related asset originally recognised. If, for mature mines, the revised mine assets net of mine closure cost provisions exceed the recoverable value, that portion of the increase is charged directly to expense. For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. 132 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 – Income tax notes 2(u) and 11: Judgement is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are recognised on the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date Overview could be impacted. – Silverstream note 15: The valuation of the Silverstream contract as a derivative financial instrument requires significant estimation by management. The derivative has a term of over 20 years and the value of this derivative is determined using a number of estimates, including the ore reserves and mineral resources and future production profile of the Sabinas mine, the estimated recoveries of silver from ore mined, estimates of the future price of silver and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. Expectations of future silver price is one of the key assumptions underlying the valuation of this contract and the strengthening of forward silver prices in 2011 significantly impacted the valuation, resulting in an unrealised pre-tax gain of US$159.9 million recognised in the income statement (2010: US$191.8 Strategic Review million). The fair value of this contract is US$478.1 million as at 31 December 2011 (2010: US$427.6 million) and changes in the underlying assumptions may change this value. For further detail of this arrangement, see note 15. For further detail on the inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value of this derivative, see note 31. The impact of changes in silver price assumptions, foreign exchange, inflation and the discount rate is included in note 32. – Contingent liabilities regarding claims from tax authorities note 27: By their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and estimates of the outcome of future events. Performance (d) Foreign currency translation The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the parent company’s functional currency. The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. For all operating entities, this is US dollars. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Governance Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined. For entities with functional currencies other than US dollars, as at the reporting date, assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency of the Group by applying the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in equity. On disposal of an entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that operation is recognised in the income statement. Financial Statements (e) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value. Cost comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. The cost less the residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item’s estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items. Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unit-ofproduction (UOP) basis for mine buildings and installations, plant and equipment used in the mine production process or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset when not related to the mine production process. Changes in estimates, which mainly affect unit of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively. Depreciation commences when assets are available for use. Land is not depreciated. The expected useful lives are as follows: Years Buildings 5–12 Plant and equipment 4–11 Mining properties and development costs 3–14 Other assets 2–14 133 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising at de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is de-recognised. Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. Assets are not depreciated when classified as held for sale. Disposal of assets Gains or losses from the disposal of assets are recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. Mining properties and development costs Payments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the development of the project when incurred. Purchased rights to ore reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination. Mining concessions, when capitalised, are amortised on a straight line basis over the period of time in which benefits are expected to be obtained from that specific concession. Mine development costs are capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment. Mine development activities commence once a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project. When an exploration prospect has entered into the advanced exploration phase and sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals has been obtained preoperative expenses relating to mine preparation works are also capitalised as mine development cost. The initial cost of a mining property comprises its construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the mining property into operation and the initial estimate of the provision for mine closure cost. Revenues from metals recovered from ore mined in the mine development phase, prior to commercial production, are credited to mining properties and development costs. Upon commencement of production, capitalised expenditure is depreciated using the unit of production method based on the estimated economically proven and probable reserves to which they relate. Mining properties and mine development are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value. Construction in progress Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. Construction in progress is not depreciated. Subsequent expenditures All subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is de-recognised. All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred. Stripping costs In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste in order to access the ore body. During development and pre-production phases, these costs are capitalised as part of the initial mine investment and they are depreciated based on the mine’s production once commercial operations begin. Removal of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a mine. This activity is referred to as production stripping and commences at the time that saleable material begins to be extracted from the mine. The costs of production stripping are charged to the income statement as operating costs. Further development of a mine may occur following initial extraction of saleable material and during the production phase. Stripping costs associated with such development activities are capitalised and depreciated based on the related production. (f) Determination of ore reserves The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by internal competent persons in conformity with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code. Reports to support these estimates are prepared each year and certified by an independent competent person. The latest certified ore reserves and mineral resources are used in the unit of production calculation of depreciation prospectively, in the determination of the timing of mine closure cost and for determining value in use for any impairment analysis. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves and mineral resources. Assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available. Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of ore reserves and mineral resources and may, ultimately, result in the ore reserves being restated. 134 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 (g) Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount. Such reviews are undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash flows independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level. If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reflect the asset Overview at the recoverable amount in the balance sheet. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount of an asset The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Fair value is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in a sale transaction on an arm’s length basis. In assessing value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independently of those from other assets, or groups of assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. The Group’s Strategic Review cash generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Reversal of impairment An assessment is made each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment Performance loss been recognised in previous years. Such impairment loss reversal is recognised in the income statement. (h) Financial assets Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held to maturity investments; or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. Governance Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets classified as held-for-trading and other assets designated as fair value through profit or loss at inception are included in this category. Financial assets are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired for sale in the short-term. Derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement. Financial Statements Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale. After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Long-term receivables are stated at amortised cost. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding categories and are not held to maturity investments. Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market; therefore a fair value can be reliably measured. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with mark-to-market unrealised gains or losses recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the financial asset is derecognised. Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are de-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense. 135 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Fair value In determining estimated fair value, investments in shares or portfolios of listed securities are valued at quoted bid prices. When quoted prices on an active market are not available (and for listed non-actively traded securities), fair value is determined using a valuation technique. Valuation techniques include using a recent arm’s length transaction, if available, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models. If the range of reasonable fair value is significant and the probabilities of the various estimates cannot be reliably assessed, the investment is not re-measured at fair value. (i) Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired receivables are de-recognised when they are assessed as uncollectible. Available-for-sale financial investments If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement. In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Group considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged, by considering the size of the decline in this value and the historic volatility in changes in fair value. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement. (j) Inventories Finished goods and work in progress inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method based on cost of production which excludes borrowing costs. For this purpose, the costs of production include: – personnel expenses, which include employee profit sharing, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore; – the depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore; and – related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). Operating materials and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventories is determined by reference to specific items of stock. A regular review is undertaken by management to determine the extent of such allowance. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. (k) Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 136 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 (l) Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Mine closure cost Overview A provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas) based on a mine closure plan, in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs. At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future economic benefit and depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates. The provision is reviewed on an annual basis by the Group for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations. Strategic Review Other Other provisions are accounted for when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation for which it is probable there will be an outflow of resources for which the amount can be reliably estimated. (m) Financial liabilities The Group recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred. Performance Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process. (n) Employee benefits Governance The Group operates the following plans: Defined benefit pension plan This funded plan is based on each employee’s earnings and years of service. This plan was open to all employees in Mexico and it is denominated in Mexican pesos. This plan was closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007. For members as at 30 June 2007, benefits were frozen at that date subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index (NCPI). Financial Statements The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an independent actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. The discount rate is the yield on mxAAA (Standard & Poors) and AAA-mex (Fitch Ibca) credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur. Past service costs are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. If the benefits have already vested following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, the past service cost is recognised immediately. The defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan. Defined contribution pension plan A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due. The contributions are based on the employee’s salary. This plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme. Seniority premium for voluntary separation This unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days of salary per year for those unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service. Non-unionised employees with more than 15 years of service have the right to a payment equivalent to 12 days for each year of service. For both cases, the payment is based on the legal current minimum salary. 137 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The cost of providing benefits for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an independent actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur. Other Benefits for death and disability are covered through insurance policies. Termination payments for involuntary retirement (dismissals) are charged to the income statement, when incurred. (o) Employee profit sharing In accordance with the Mexican legislation, companies in Mexico are subject to pay for employee profit sharing (‘PTU’) equivalent to ten percent of the taxable income of each fiscal year. PTU is accounted for as employee benefits and is calculated based on the services rendered by employees during the year, considering their most recent salaries. The liability is recognised as it accrues and is charged to the income statement. PTU, paid in each fiscal year, is considered deductible for income tax purposes. (p) Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date including whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies: a. There is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement; b. A renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term; c. There is a change in the determination of whether fulfilment is dependent on a specified asset; or d. There is a substantial change to the asset. Group as a lessee Finance leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property, or if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are reflected in the income statement. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Group as a lessor Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned. Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting commences or ceases from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios a), c) or d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario b) above. For arrangements entered into prior to 1 January 2005, the date of inception is deemed to be 1 January 2007, in accordance with the transitional requirements of IFRIC 4. (q) Contingencies Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated financial statements and are disclosed in the notes unless their occurrence is remote. Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated financial statements, but they are disclosed in the notes if they are deemed probable. (r) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes. Sale of goods Revenue is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes. 138 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 The Group recognises revenue on a provisional basis at the time concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are delivered to the customer’s smelter or refinery, using the Group’s best estimate of contained metal. Revenue is subject to adjustment once the analysis of the product samples is completed, contract conditions have been fulfilled and final settlement terms are agreed. Any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue once they have been determined. In addition, sales of concentrates and precipitates throughout each calendar month, as well as doré bars that are delivered after the 20th day of each month, are ‘provisionally priced’ subject to a final adjustment based on the average price for the month following the delivery Overview to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract. Doré bars that are delivered in the first 20 days of each month are finally priced in the month of delivery. For sales of goods that are subject to provisional pricing, revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have been met using the provisional price. The price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and hence separated from the sales contract. At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract until the quotation period ends. The selling price of the metals can be reliably measured as these are actively traded on international exchanges. The revaluing of provisionally priced contracts is recorded as an adjustment to revenue. Royalties Strategic Review Income derived from royalties is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received. Currently the Group receives royalties based on a percentage of the sales of concentrates from the El Cedros, Peregrina and Sirena small scale mines rented to a third party. Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases on a small scale mine rented to a third party is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term. Interest income Performance Interest income is recognised as interest accrues (using the effective interest method; i.e., the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset). Interest income is included as finance income in the income statement. Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established. (s) Exploration expenses Exploration activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial Governance viability of an identified resource. Exploration expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred and are recorded in the following captions: – Cost of sales: costs relating to in-mine exploration, that ensure continuous extraction quality and extend mine life, and – Exploration expenses: – Costs incurred in geographical proximity to existing mines in order to replenish or increase reserves, and – Costs incurred in regional exploration with the objective of locating new ore deposits in Mexico and Latin America and which are identified by project. Costs incurred are charged to the income statement until there is sufficient probability of the existence of Financial Statements economically recoverable minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project. (t) Finance income and costs Finance income and costs comprise, interest income on funds invested, interest expense on borrowings and the unwinding of the discount on provisions. Interest income and costs are recognised as accrued, taking into account the effective yield on the asset or liability. (u) Income tax Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: – where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and 139 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued – in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: – where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and – in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. (v) De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement. (w) Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group uses derivatives to reduce certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange which impact its financial and business transactions. Hedges are designed to protect the value of expected production against the dynamic market conditions. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement. Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles, European foreign exchange options are valued using the Garmar-Kohlhagen formula. The Silverstream contract is valued using a Net Present Value valuation approach. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for the undertaken hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: Cash flow hedges For derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded as a component of equity and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. For gains and losses related to the hedging of revenues, these are included as part of revenues and for those related to the hedging of foreign exchange risk, in the line item in which the hedged costs are reflected. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial 140 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised in the income statement of the related period. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in equity from the period that the hedge was effective remains separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. When hedging with options, the Group designates only the intrinsic value movement of the hedging option within the hedge relationship. Overview The time value of the option contracts is therefore excluded from the hedge designation. Changes in fair value of time value is recognised in the income statement in finance costs. Embedded derivatives Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract, with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand alone derivatives. Strategic Review (x) Dividend distribution Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company’s shareholders or Board as appropriate. Dividends payable to minority shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company’s subsidiaries. (y) Value added tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of value added tax. Performance The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet. (z) Borrowing costs Finance costs are generally expensed as incurred except where they relate to the financing of construction or development of qualifying assets requiring a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended future use. Governance In the case of such qualifying assets, finance costs are capitalised up to the date when the asset is ready for its intended use. The amount of finance costs capitalised (before the effects of income tax) for the period is determined by applying the interest rate applicable to appropriate borrowings outstanding during the period to the average amount of accumulated expenditure for the assets during the period. 3. Segment reporting For management purposes the Group is organised into operating segments based on producing mines. At 31 December 2011 the Group has five reportable operating segments following the successful conclusion of the development of the Financial Statements Saucito mine in March 2011 and commercial production starting in April 2011. These represent the Group’s five producing mines as follows: – The Fresnillo mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, the world’s largest primary silver mine; – The Herradura mine, located in the State of Sonora, an open pit gold mine; – The Cienega mine, located in the State of Durango, an underground gold mine; – The Soledad-Dipolos mine, located in the State of Sonora, an open pit gold mine; and – The Saucito mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine. The operating performance and financial results for each of these mines are reviewed by management. As the Group’s chief operating decision maker does not review segment assets and liabilities, the Group has not disclosed this information. The exploration services provided by Exploraciones Mineras Parreña, S.A. de C.V and projects under development have been aggregated into the Other segment on page 142. Management monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of performance assessment and making decisions about resource allocation. Segment performance is evaluated without taking into account certain adjustments included in Revenue as reported in the consolidated income statement, and certain costs included within Cost of Sales and Gross Profit which are considered to be outside of the control of the operating management of the mines. The table on page 142 provides a reconciliation from segment profit to Gross Profit as per the consolidated income statement. Other income and expenses included in the consolidated income statement are not allocated to operating segments. Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for on an arm’s length basis similar to transactions with third parties. In 2011 and 2010 all revenue was derived from customers based in Mexico. 141 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Operating segments The following tables present revenue and profit information regarding the Group’s operating segments for the year ended 31 December 2011 and 2010, respectively.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses amounting to US$63.6 million (2010: US$188.3 million). There are no unrecognised tax assets in either year. (d) Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls Financial Statements them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$992.5 million (2010: US$503.5 million). Income Tax (‘Impuesto Sobre la Renta’ or ‘ISR’) and Business Flat Tax (‘Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Unica’ or ‘IETU’) In accordance to the Mexican tax law, the Group companies in Mexico are subject to Income Tax (‘ISR’) and Business Flat Tax (‘IETU’). IETU is an alternative minimum corporate income tax effective in January 1, 2008 which replaced the business asset tax as a minimum tax. Companies are required to pay the greater of their mainstream corporate income tax liability for the year or their liability to IETU. On 7 December 2009 new temporary tax rates were published in the Official Daily of the Federal Government. The income tax rate for 2010 and 2011 is 30% and will continue in effect for 2012, the tax rate for 2013 will be 29% and the tax rate from 2014 will be 28%. Deferred taxes have been calculated at the rate applicable to the year the amounts are expected to materialise. IETU is calculated at the rate of 17.5% and applies to the sale of goods, rendering of independent services and temporary use or enjoyment of goods. In calculating the charge to IETU, deductions are allowed for certain expenses incurred in generating income. In respect of the Group, in 2011 and 2010 management undertook calculations to determine the impact of the IETU provisions on the Group. As a result of such analysis, management concluded that there was no material impact on the Group, since the mainstream corporate income tax liability for each Group company was forecast to be greater than the future potential IETU charge, accordingly, no IETU liability was recognised in either year. 149 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 12. Earnings per share Earnings per share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. The Company has no dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Silverstream contract On 31 December 2007, the Group entered into an agreement with Peñoles through which it is entitled to receive the proceeds received by the Peñoles Group in respect of the refined silver sold from the Sabinas Mine (‘Sabinas’), a base metals mine owned and operated by the Peñoles Group, for an upfront payment of US$350 million. In addition, a per ounce cash payment of $2.00 in years 1 to 5 and $5.00 thereafter (subject to an inflationary adjustment commencing on 31 December 2013) is payable to Peñoles. Under the contract, the Group has the option to receive a net cash settlement from Peñoles attributable to the silver produced and sold from Sabinas, to take delivery of an equivalent amount of refined silver or to receive settlement in the form of both cash and silver. If, by 31 December 2032, the amount of silver produced by Sabinas is less than 60 million ounces, a further payment is due from Peñoles of US$1 per ounce of shortfall. The Silverstream contract represents a derivative financial instrument which has been recorded at fair value and classified within non-current and current assets as appropriate. Changes in the contract’s fair value, other than those represented by the realisation of the asset through the receipt of either cash or refined silver, are charged or credited to the income statement. In the year ended 31 December 2011 total proceeds received in cash were US$103.1 million, of which US$7.2 million was in respect of proceeds receivable as at 31 December 2010 (2010: US$ nil as there were not proceeds receivable from the prior year). Cash received in respect of the year of US$95.9 million corresponds to 2.9 million ounces of payable silver (2010: 3.1 million ounces). As at 31 December 2011, a further US$13.6 million (2010: US$7.2 million) of cash corresponding to 520,088 ounces of silver is due (2010: 265,331 ounces). The most significant driver of the US$159.9 million unrealised gain taken to income (2010: US$191.8 million) was the strengthening of expectations of the forward price of silver during the year. A future downturn in the forward price of silver, which may happen given the cyclical nature of prices, would result in recognising an unrealised loss in the income statement.

The present value of the provision at 31 December 2011 has been calculated using an annual real discount rate of 4.33 percent (2010: 4.33 percent). The unwinding of discount charge in 2011 has been calculated using a nominal discount rate of 7.75 percent (2010: 8.50 percent). Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning, dismantling, and reclamation alternatives and timing and the levels of discount and inflation rates. Mexican regulations regarding the decommissioning and rehabilitation of mines are limited and less developed in comparison to regulations in many other jurisdictions. It is the Group’s intention to rehabilitate the mines beyond the requirements of Mexican law, and estimated costs reflect this level of expense. The Group intends to fully rehabilitate the affected areas at the end of the life of the mines. The provision is expected to become payable at the end of the production life of each mine, which ranges from 4 to 38 years from 31 December 2011 (6 to 27 years from 31 December 2010).

Operating leases (a) Operating leases as lessor The Group leases certain small mines to third parties and certain equipment to contractors. Future minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: As at 31 December Overview 2011 2010 US$ thousands US$ thousands Within one year 1,183 929 After one year but not more than five years – 2,043 1,183 2,972 (b) Operating leases as lessee Strategic Review The Group has financial commitments in respect of non-cancellable operating leases for land, offices and equipment. These leases have renewal terms at the option of the lessee at lease payments based on market prices at the time of renewal. There are no restrictions placed upon the Group by entering into these leases. The Group has put in place several arrangements to finance mine equipment through loans and the sale of mine equipment to contractors. In both cases, contractors are obligated to use these assets in rendering services to the Group as part of the mining work contract, during the term of financing or credit, which ranges from 2 to 6 years. The Group considers that the related mining work contracts contain embedded operating leases. Performance The future minimum rental commitments under these leases are as follows: As at 31 December 2011 2010 US$ thousands US$ thousands Within one year 8,633 1,070 After one year but not more than five years 8,662 651 17,295 1,721 As at 31 December Governance 2011 2010 US$ thousands US$ thousands Minimum lease payments expensed in the year 4,741 1,612 27. Contingencies Financial Statements As of 31 December 2011, the Group has the following contingencies: – The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. – Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods. In addition, because a number of tax periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest. It is not practical to determine the amount of any such potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable. – On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the ‘Separation Agreement’). This agreement relates to the separation of the Group and the Peñoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 (‘Admission’). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the case of Peñoles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Peñoles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate. Peñoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to (i) any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation (including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo 159 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Group, provided that Peñoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peñoles Group on or after Admission), the Global Offer or Admission and (ii) certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions. Peñoles’ liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 million. If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peñoles’ tax consolidation pays an intra-group dividend in excess of its net income tax account (‘Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta’ or ‘CUFIN’) account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation, it is required to pay Peñoles an amount in respect of that tax. 28.

(b) Fair value hierarchy Performance The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of the financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and Governance Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorised into the fair value hierarchy as at 31 December as follows: As of 31 December 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total US$ thousands US$ thousands US$ thousands US$ thousands Financial assets: Financial Statements Derivative financial instruments: Option and forward foreign exchange contracts – 217 – 217 Silverstream contract – – 478,083 478,083 – 217 478,083 478,300 Financial investments available-for-sale: Quoted investments 94,861 – – 94,861 94,861 217 478,083 573,161 Financial liabilities: Derivative financial instruments: Embedded derivatives within sales contracts – – (14,479) (14,479) Options and forward foreign exchange contracts – (13,762) – (13,762) – (13,762) (14,479) (28,511) 163 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued As of 31 December 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total US$ thousands US$ thousands US$ thousands US$ thousands Financial assets: Derivative financial instruments: Option and forward foreign exchange contracts – 4,056 – 4,056 Embedded derivatives within sales contracts – – 6,162 6,162 Silverstream contract – – 427,681 427,681 – 4,056 433,843 437,899 Financial investments available-for-sale: Quoted investments 141,777 – – 141,777 141,777 4,056 433,843 579,676 Financial liabilities: Derivative financial instruments: Options and forward foreign exchange contracts – (152) – (152) – (152) – (152) There have been no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements. A reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance for Level 3 financial instruments other than Silverstream (which is disclosed in note 15) is shown below: 2011 2010 US$ thousands US$ thousands Balance at 1 January: 6,162 (3,348) Changes in fair value 6,162 35,573 Realised embedded derivatives during the year (26,803) (26,063) Balance at 31 December (14,479) 6,162 Silverstream contract: The fair value of the Silverstream contract is determined using a valuation model (for further information relating to the Silverstream contract see note 15). This derivative has a term of over 20 years and the valuation model utilises a number of inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the nature of these inputs and/or the duration of the contract. Inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the future price of silver, future foreign exchange rates between the Mexican peso and US dollar, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. The sensitivity of the valuation to the inputs relating to market risks, being the price of silver, foreign exchange rates, inflation and the discount rate is disclosed in note 32. The estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable silver reserves and resources, the related production profile based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of silver from ore mined. The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time. Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Peñoles, the operator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine, and provided to the Company. The production profile and estimated payable silver that will be recovered from ore mined is based on the latest plan and estimates, also provided to the Company by Peñoles. The inputs assume no interruption in production over the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years. Embedded derivatives within sales contracts: Sales of concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are ‘provisionally priced’ and revenue is initially recognised using this provisional price and the Group’s best estimate of the contained metal. Revenue is subject to final price and metal content adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery (see note 2 (r)). This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and is separated from the sales contract. At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the relevant sales contract. The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a non observable input to this valuation. At 31 December 2011 the fair value of embedded derivatives within sales contracts was US$(14.5) million (2010: US$6.2 million). The revaluation effects of embedded derivatives arising from these sales contracts are recorded as an adjustment to revenues. 164 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 (c) Hedging activities – cash flow hedges The Group enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with costs incurred in Mexican pesos and other currencies. The Group entered into a number of forward derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The outstanding contracts as at 31 December 2011 are as follows: Overview As at 31 December 2011 Contract value Contract 2011 Fair value Term Currency (thousands) exchange rate (US$ thousands) MX$12.21:US$1 to Mexican peso denominated forward contracts 2012 US$ 38,500 MX$12.62:US$1 (4,188) EUR€1.36:US$1 to Strategic Review Euros denominated forward contracts 2012 EUR€ 2,556 EUR€1.42:US$1 (231) SEK6.42:US$1 to Swedish krona denominated forward contracts 2012–2014 SEK 481,163 SEK7.07:US$1 (2,752) The Group’s Mexican peso denominated forwards derivative instruments mature over the period from 6 February 2012 to 7 May 2012 with a weighted average rate of MX$12.52: US$1. Euro denominated forward derivative instruments mature over the period from 13 June 2012 to 14 September 2012 with a weighted average rate of US$1.41:€1. The Group also entered into a number of SEK-US dollar forward contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These derivative instruments mature over the period from 13 March 2012 to 12 March 2014 with a weighted average rate of SEK6.69:USD$1. The Group does not apply hedge accounting for Performance SEK:USD forward contracts, therefore the fair value is recognised in the income statement of the year. The Group also entered into Mexican peso-US dollar collars to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Collar derivative instruments mature over the period from 9 April 2012 to 12 November 2012. The collar instruments hedge costs denominated in Mexican pesos amounting to US$82 million with a range of floor prices from MX$12.00 to MX$13.50:US$1 and a range of capped prices from MX$12.65 to MX$16.04:US$1. The fair value of the Put options at 31 December 2011 was an asset of US$0.1 million, and the fair value of the Call options at 31 December 2011 was a liability of US$6.2 million. The Group also entered into Euro-US dollar collars which mature on 2 July 2012.

Financial risk management Overview The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale assets and trade payables. The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: – Market risk, including foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks – Credit risk – Liquidity risk This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. (a) Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates will affect the Group’s income or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. 166 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 Foreign currency risk The Group has financial instruments that are denominated in Mexican pesos, UK pounds sterling, Euros and Swedish krona (2010: only Mexican peso) which are exposed to foreign currency risk. Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar include the purchase of services, dividends, fixed assets, spare parts and other items. As a result, the Group has financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso. Overview In order to manage the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk on expenditure denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, the Group has entered into certain forward and option derivative contracts with maturity dates from 2012 to 2014 (see note 31 for additional detail). The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Group’s profit before tax and equity, with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods for the purposes of calculating the sensitivity with relation to derivative financial instruments.

These prices are subject to global economic conditions and industry-related cycles. Historically the Group used derivative instruments to hedge against precious metals commodity price fluctuations. This practice was discontinued in 2007, when the Group assumed precious metals commodity risk exposure in response to favourable price trends. The table below reflects the aggregate sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible change in gold and silver prices, reflecting the impact on the Group’s profit before tax with all other variables held constant.

The financial assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, the Silverstream contract and available-for-sale financial assets. The Group’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties’ failure to honour their obligations. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Group’s financial assets are with counterparties with what the Group considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 28, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Group’s financial assets were neither impaired nor past due, other than ‘Other receivables’ as disclosed in note 17. The Group’s policies are aimed at minimising losses from foreign currency hedging contracts. The Company’s foreign currency hedging contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings. The Group has a high concentration of trade receivables with one counterparty, Met-Mex Peñoles, the Group’s primary customer throughout 2011 and 2010. A further concentration of credit risk arises from the Silverstream contract. Both Met-Mex and the counterparty to the Silverstream contract are subsidiaries in the Peñoles group which currently owns 77 percent of the shares of the Company and is considered by management to be of appropriate credit rating. Refer to note 17 for analysis of trade receivables ageing. The Group’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in a number of financial institutions. In order to minimize exposure to credit risk, the Group only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of P-1 (Moody’s) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poors) and above, and only for periods of less than 30 days. As at 31 December 2011 the Group had concentrations of credit risk as 52 percent of cash and cash equivalents was deposited with one financial institution and 47 percent was held in short-term Mexican government paper. On an ongoing basis the Group deposits cash and cash equivalents on a short-term basis with a range of financial institutions, depending on market conditions. The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See note 14 for the maximum credit exposure to available-for-sale financial assets, note 19 for cash and cash equivalents and note 28 for related party balances with Met-Mex. The maximum credit exposure with relation to the Silverstream contract is the value of the derivative as at 31 December 2011, being US$478.1 million (2010: US$427.6 million). (c) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows from operations and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Management considers that the Group has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities. Capital management Performance The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value. Management considers capital to consist only of equity as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains and losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders’ capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Group’s dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows, including cash flows from the Silverstream contract.

Corporate information Fresnillo plc (‘the Company’) is a public limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 6. Industrias Peñoles S.A.B. de C.V. (‘Peñoles’) currently owns 77 percent of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baillères family, whose beneficial interest is held through Peñoles. The country of incorporation of Peñoles Overview is Mexico. Copies of Peñoles’ accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx. The primary activity of the Company is as holding company for the Fresnillo Group of companies. The financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2011 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 5 March 2012. 2. Significant accounting policies (a) Basis of preparation and statement of compliance Strategic Review The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s financial statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which considers the realisation of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at 31 December 2011, the Company is in a net current liability position due to an increase in the intercompany loan . The Company’s Directors confirm that Fresnillo plc’s subsidiaries have funds and distributable earnings available for distribution sufficient to repay the intercompany loan and to fund other forecast liabilities of the Company to be incurred Performance in the next twelve months. Further, given that the loan counter-party is a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that it will not request a repayment of the loan until such time as the Company has sufficient cash balances to make the repayment. As such the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements of the Company is deemed appropriate. The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial instruments which have been measured at valued at fair value. The financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$000) except when otherwise indicated. Governance The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated. (b) Standards, interpretations and amendment. The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010, except for the adoption of certain amendments to existing standards effective as of 1 January 2011. Those that are applicable or relevant to the Company, resulting in changes to accounting policies, but with no impact on its financial position Financial Statements or performance are as follows: Amendments for IFRSs – IAS 24 Related Party Transactions (Amendment): It clarifies the definitions of a related party. The new definitions emphasise a symmetrical view of related party relationships as well as clarifying in which circumstances persons and key management personnel affect related party relationships of an entity. Also, the amendment introduces an exemption from the general related party disclosure requirements for transactions with government and entities that are controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by the same government as the reporting entity. Improvements to IFRSs In May 2010, the IASB issued its third omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording. There are separate transitional provisions for each standard. The adoption of the following amendments resulted in changes to accounting policies and certain disclosures, but did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Company. – IFRS 7 Financial Instruments – Disclosures: The amendment was intended to simplify the disclosures provided by reducing the volume of disclosures around collateral held and improving disclosures by requiring qualitative information to put the quantitative information in context. This amendment did not have an impact on the current disclosures to the Parent’s consolidated financial statements. The IASB and IFRIC have issued other amendments resulting from Improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Company. 177 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued New and amended standards and interpretations Standards and amendments issued but not yet effective or early adopted up to the date of issuance of the Company’s financial statements are listed below. This listing is of standards and interpretations issued, which the Company reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. The Company intends to adopt those standards when they become effective. – IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation – Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (‘OCI’): The amendments to IAS 1 change the grouping of items presented in OCI. Items that could be reclassified (or ’recycled’) to profit or loss at a future point in time (for example, upon derecognition or settlement) would be presented separately from items that will never be reclassified. The amendment affects presentation only and has there no impact on the Company’s financial position or performance. The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012. The Company currently does not have items in OCI that will never be recycled through earnings and therefore, the adoption of this revised standard would not impact the current presentation of the statement of comprehensive income. – IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (as revised in 2011): As a consequence of the new IFRS 10 and IFRS 12 (see below), what remains of IAS 27 does not change the recognition and presentation requirements as it relates to accounting for subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities, and associates in separate financial statements (cost method or fair value) and as a result the adoption of this revised standard is not expected to impact the Parent Company financial statements. The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with early adoption permitted. – IFRS 7 Financial Instruments – Disclosures (Enhanced Derecognition Disclosure Requirements): The amendment requires additional disclosure about financial assets that have been transferred but not derecognised to enable the user of the Company’s financial statements to understand the relationship with those assets that have not been derecognised and their associated liabilities. In addition, the amendment requires disclosures about continuing involvement in derecognised assets to enable the user to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, the Company’s continuing involvement in those derecognised assets. The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011. – IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement: This reflects the first phase of the IASBs work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. In subsequent phases, the IASB will address hedge accounting and impairment of financial assets. The Company is in the process of identifying the potential impacts of the current changes to IFRS 9 and will quantify the effects on its financial position and performance in conjunction with the other phases, when issued, to present a comprehensive picture of such impacts on its financial statements. – IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 10 replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. It also includes the issues raised in SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 will require management to exercise significant judgement to determine which entities are controlled, and therefore, are required to be consolidated by a parent, compared with the requirements that were in IAS 27. This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with early adoption permitted. The Group’s management does not expect impacts on its consolidated financial statements with the adoption of this new standard when it becomes effective. – IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities: This includes all of the disclosures that were previously in IAS 27 related to consolidated financial statements, as well as all of the disclosures that were previously included in IAS 31 and IAS 28. These disclosures relate to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities. A number of new disclosures are also required. This standard will become effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 with the adoption of IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IAS 27 (2011) and IAS 28 (2011). The Company will include the relevant disclosures required by IFRS 12 upon adoption. – IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on the financial position and performance. This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with early adoption permitted. Given that the Company does not currently have non-monetary assets measured at fair value, the potential impacts of this new standard would be in relation to its financial instruments measured at fair value. (c) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimation and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These judgements and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimation is in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the financial statements. Judgements Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are: – Determination of functional currency note 2(d): The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. 178 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 Estimates and assumptions Significant areas of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the consolidated financial information include: – Impairment and subsequent reversal of impairment of investments in subsidiaries notes 2(e) and 6: The Company assesses the investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. A value in use assessment requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as Overview long-term commodity prices, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an impairment charge. At 31 December 2011, no impairment has been recognised. At 31 December 2010, an impairment reversal of US$108.0 million was recognised. – Valuation of derivative financial instruments notes 2(p) and 17: Strategic Review Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. – Contingent liabilities regarding claims from tax authorities note 13: By nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and estimates of the outcome of future events. Performance (d) Foreign currency translation The Company’s financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company. The functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date Governance when the fair valued is determined. (e) Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and financial policies, generally by owning more than 50% of voting rights. Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment. When the Company incurs increases in or return of share capital, to/from its subsidiaries, such as movements are recognised as an addition or return of capital to the original cost recognised in investment in subsidiaries. Financial Statements At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the investment in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. When this information is not available the fair value is determined based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries, using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount. Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss is reversed to the income statement to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. (f) Financial assets Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held to maturity investments; or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 179 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets classified as held-for-trading and other assets designated as fair value transactions through profit and loss at inception are included in this category. Financial assets are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term. Derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale. After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Long-term receivables are stated at amortised cost. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding categories and are not held-to-maturity investments. Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market; therefore a fair value can be reliably measured. After initial measurement, available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value with mark-to-market unrealised gains or losses being recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the financial asset is derecognised. Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are de-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense. Fair value In determining estimated fair value, investments in shares or portfolios of listed securities are valued at quoted bid prices. When quoted prices on an active market are not available (and for listed non-actively traded securities), fair value is determined using a valuation technique. Valuation techniques include using a recent arm’s length transaction, if available, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models. If the range of reasonable fair value is significant and the probabilities of the various estimates cannot be reliably assessed, the investment is not re-measured at fair value. (g) Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. The Company first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired receivables are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible. Available-for-sale financial investments If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement. In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Group considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged by considering the size of the decline in this value and the historic volatility in changes in fair value. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement. 180 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 (h) Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Overview (i) Share capital Ordinary shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue. The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue. (j) Financial liabilities Strategic Review The Company recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest Performance method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process. (k) Contingencies Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial information and are disclosed in notes unless their occurrence is remote. Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial information, but they are disclosed in notes if they are deemed probable. Governance (l) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes. Trademark royalties Trademark royalty income is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received. Interest income Interest income is recognised as interest accrues (using the effective interest method; i.e. the rate that exactly discounts estimated future Financial Statements cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset). Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established. (m) Finance income and costs Finance income and costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, interest income on funds invested, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments and the unwinding of the discount on provisions. Interest income and costs are recognised as accrued, taking into account the effective yield on the asset or liability. (n) Income tax Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. 181 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: – where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and – in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: – where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and – in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. (o) De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement. (p) Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. In the Group’s consolidated financial statements these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Company’s stand-alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges. Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement. Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. Embedded derivatives Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Company first becomes party to the contract, with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives. 182 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 (q) Dividend distribution Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. (r) Value added tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of value added tax. Overview The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet. (s) Borrowing costs Finance costs are generally expensed as incurred except where they relate to the financing of construction or development of qualifying assets requiring a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended future use. Strategic Review In the case of such qualifying assets, finance costs are capitalised up to the date when the asset is ready for its intended use. The amount of finance costs capitalised (before the effects of income tax) for the period is determined by applying the interest rate applicable to appropriate borrowings outstanding during the period to the average amount of accumulated expenditure for the assets during the period. 3. Profit or loss attributable to the parent Company The profit for the Company is US$507.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 (2010: US$483.9 million). In accordance with the Performance exemption granted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 a separate income statement for the Company has not been presented. 4. Segment reporting Segmental information is not presented in the Company’s stand-alone financial statements as this is presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 5. Income tax Governance (a) Income tax reported in other comprehensive income Year ended 31 December 2011 2010 US$ thousands US$ thousands Deferred income tax related to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income: Unrealised gain on available-for-sale assets (note 7) 13,137 (20,536) Financial Statements Income tax charge reported in other comprehensive income 13,137 (20,536) (b) The movements in the deferred income tax liability are as follows: Year ended 31 December 2011 2010 US$ thousands US$ thousands Beginning balance (21,129) (817) Income statement (credit)/charge (1,714) 224 Unrealised gain on available-for-sale financial assets (note 7) 13,137 (20,536) Ending balance (9,706) (21,129) Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities. 183 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued The amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities before offset as at 31 December considering the nature of the temporary differences are as follows: Year ended 31 December 2011 2010 US$ thousands US$ thousands Prepayments and other (5,660) (120) Derivative financial instruments 4,064 238 Available-for-sale financial assets (8,110) (21,247) Net deferred tax balances (9,706) (21,129) (c) Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries The Company has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$992.5 million (2010: US$503.5 million). Income Tax (‘ImpuestoSobre la Renta’ or ‘ISR’) and Business Flat Tax (‘Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Unica’ or ‘IETU’) In accordance to the Mexican tax law, the Company is subject to Income Tax (‘ISR’) and Business Flat Tax (‘IETU’). IETU is an alternative minimum corporate income tax effective in January 1, 2008 which replaced the business asset tax. Companies are required to pay the greater of their mainstream corporate income tax liability for the year or their liability to IETU. On 7th December 2009 new temporary tax rates were published in the Official Daily of the Federal Government. The tax income rate for 2010 and 2011 is 30% and will continue in effect for 2012, the tax rate for 2013 will be 29% and the tax rate for 2014 will be 28%. The deferred taxes have been calculated at the rate applicable to the year the amounts are expected to materialise. IETU is calculated at the rate of 17.5% and applies to the sale of goods, rendering of independent services and temporary use or enjoyment of goods. In calculating the charge to IETU, deductions are allowed for certain expenses incurred in generating income. In respect of the Company, in 2011 and 2010 management undertook calculations to determine the impact of the IETU provisions on the Company. As a result of such analysis, management has concluded that there was no material impact on the Company, since the mainstream corporate income tax liability of the Company is forecast to be greater than the future potential IETU charge. Accordingly no IETU liability was recognised in either year. 6.

Contingencies As of 31 December 2011 the Company has the following contingencies: Financial Statements – The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. – Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of the corporate income tax return, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods. In addition, because a number of tax periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest. It is not practical to determine the amount of any such potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Company has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable. – On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the ‘Separation Agreement’). This agreement relates to the separation of the Fresnillo Group (‘the Group’) and the Peñoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 (‘Admission’). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the case of Peñoles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Peñoles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate. Peñoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to (i) any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation (including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo Group, provided that Peñoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peñoles Group on or after Admission), the Global Offer or Admission and (ii) certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions. Peñoles’ liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising 187 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 million. If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peñoles’ tax consolidation pays an intra-group dividend in excess of its net income tax account (‘Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta’ or ‘CUFIN’) after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation, it is required to pay Peñoles an amount in respect of that tax. 14. Related party balances and transactions Related parties are those entities owned or controlled by the ultimate controlling party and include the Company’s subsidiaries disclosed in note 6, as well as those entities who have a minority participation in Fresnillo Group companies. There were no balances or transactions (other than dividends paid) with the parent company. Related party balances will be settled in cash.

(b) Fair value hierarchy Performance The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of the financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and Governance Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorised into the fair value hierarchy as at 31 December as follows: As of 31 December 2011 US$ thousands Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets: Financial Statements Derivative financial instruments: Option and forward foreign exchange contracts – 217 – 217 Financial investments available-for-sale: Quoted investments 94,861 – – 94,861 94,861 217 – 95,078 Financial liabilities: Derivative financial instruments: Option and forward foreign exchange contracts – (13,762) – (13,762) – (13,762) – (13,762) 191 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued As of 31 December 2010 US$ thousands Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets: Derivative financial instruments: Option and forward foreign exchange contracts – 4,056 – 4,056 Financial investments available-for-sale: Quoted investments 141,777 – – 141,777 141,777 4,056 – 145,833 Financial liabilities: Derivative financial instruments: Option and forward foreign exchange contracts – (152) – (152) – (152) – (152) There have been no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements. (c) Derivative financial instruments The Company enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its subsidiaries’ exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from the activities of its subsidiaries. In the Group’s consolidated financial statements these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Company’s stand alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges. The Company entered into a number of forward derivative contracts to hedge its subsidiaries’ exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Strategic Review 18. Financial risk management Overview The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, are comprised of trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale assets and trade payables. The Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing foreign exchange risk arising on the activity and transactions of its subsidiaries. The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Performance – Market risk, including foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risks – Credit risk – Liquidity risk This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework. Governance The Company’s risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. Financial Statements (a) Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, or interest rates will affect the Company income or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. Foreign currency risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar (Mexican peso, UK pound sterling, Euro and Swedish krona). Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchase of services, dividends and other items. As a result, the Company has financial liabilities denominated in Mexican pesos. The Company also holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican pesos. 193 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Company’s profit before tax with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable exchange rates for the purposes of calculating the sensitivity with relation to derivative financial instruments. It is assume that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods. There is no impact on the Company’s equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.

The financial assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale financial assets. Governance The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties’ failure to honour their obligations. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Company’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Company’s financial assets are with counterparties with what the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. At each balance sheet date, the Company’s financial assets were neither impaired nor past due. The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising losses from the foreign currency hedging contracts. The Company’s foreign currency hedging contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings The Company’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash Financial Statements equivalents investing in a number of financial institutions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Company only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of P-1 (Moody’s) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poor’s) and above, and only for periods of less than 30 days. The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See note 7 for the maximum credit exposure for available-for-sale investments, note 9 for cash and cash equivalents and note 14 for related party balances. (c) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities. 195 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities. Capital management The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value. Management considers capital to consist only of equity as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains and losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder’s capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Company’s dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows. 196 Reserves and Resources Tables Fresnillo plc Fresnillo plc Consolidated Audited Mineral Resource Statement Annual report 2011 As at 31 December 2011 Quantity Grade Contained Metal Gold Silver Lead Zinc Tonnes Gold Silver Lead Zinc Ounces Ounces Tonnes Tonnes Resource Category1 Cut-off Grade* (000s) (g/t) (g/t) (%) (%) (000’s) (000’s) (000’s) (000’s) Fresnillo Underground Measured 73 g/t AgEq 9,484 0.77 692 0.78 1.33 234 211,085 74 127 Overview Indicated 28,018 0.80 310 2.03 4.02 717 279,632 570 1,125 Measured & Indicated 37,502 0.79 407 1.72 3.34 950 490,716 643 1,252 Inferred 73 g/t AgEq 27,177 0.73 296 1.71 3.60 634 258,911 464 979 Minera Ciénega Underground Measured 1.22 g/t AuEq 5,520 3.11 106 0.88 1.38 553 18,853 49 76 Indicated 15,595 1.41 115 0.49 0.80 707 57,479 76 125 Measured & Indicated 21,116 1.86 112 0.59 0.95 1,260 76,332 125 201 Inferred 1.22 g/t AuEq 12,134 1.06 118 0.43 0.84 414 45,946 52 102 Strategic Review Minera Saucito Underground Measured 94 g/t AgEq 408 5.38 655 0.44 0.76 71 8,593 2 3 Indicated 1,471 3.49 526 0.76 1.10 165 24,873 11 16 Measured & Indicated 1,879 3.90 554 0.69 1.03 236 33,466 13 19 Inferred 44,101 1.66 354 1.55 2.44 2,347 502,420 682 1,075 Minera Penmont Underground – Herradura Veins2 Measured 1.5 g/t Au – – – – – – – – – Indicated 5,870 3.15 0 0 0 595 – – – Performance Inferred 1.5 g/t Au 8,009 3.32 0 0 0 855 0 0 0 Minera Penmont Open Pit2 Herradura (Disseminated) Measured 0.3 g/t Au 39,947 0.78 – – – 996 – – – Indicated 41,635 0.78 – – – 1,044 – – – Soledad & Dipolos Measured 0.3 g/t Au 14,574 0.64 – – – 300 – – – Governance Indicated 15,290 0.57 – – – 279 – – – Noche Buena3 Measured 0.3 g/t Au – – – – – – – – – Indicated 13,310 0.60 – – – 258 – – – Total Measured & Indicated for Minera Penmont Open Pit 124,755 0.72 – – – 2,877 – – – Herradura (Disseminated) Financial Statements Inferred 0.3 g/t Au 11,902 0.66 – – – 253 – – – Soledad & Dipolos Inferred 0.3 g/t Au 1,172 0.47 – – – 18 – – – Noche Buena3 Inferred 0.3 g/t Au 30,808 0.50 – – – 497 – – – Total Inferred for Minerva Penmont Open Pit 43,882 0.54 – – – 768 – – – Totals – Underground4 Measured & Indicated 66,367 1.43 281 1.18 2.22 3,041 600,515 781 1,472 Inferred 91,421 1.45 275 1.31 2.36 4,250 807,278 1,198 2,156 Totals – Open Pit 5 Measured & Indicated 124,755 0.72 0 0.00 0.00 2,877 0 0 0 Inferred 43,882 0.54 0 0.00 0.00 768 0 0 0 1 Mineral resources are reported inclusive of mineral reserves.
