The photos illustrating this report refer to the i.lab project, the Italcementi Group's new Research and Innovation Center in Bergamo, designed by architect Richard Meier. The i.lab building, which covers a surface area of 23,000 square meters, has been build under LEED standards, the most authoritative rating system assessing the energy and environmental sustainability of buildings. Letter to the stakeholders Innovation, the lever for growth and competitiveness For the fifth year running, 2011 was a particularly difficult one which affected the construction business. In this context, the Group continued to counter the negative effects of lower turnover on profitability through cost containment and recovering industrial efficiency. The innate industrial spirit that has carried us through almost 150 years of operations in various economic conditions has once again been the catalyst to react against unfavourable situations, also as a result of the geographic diversification of the Group. We therefore look forward in the short term to fuse our traditional values with a focus on the Giampiero and Carlo Pesenti visiting the i.lab Research Centre future through innovation, the strategic lever the Group intends to use to develop its competitive advantage, while contributing to improved quality of life and the environment. Innovation and sustainability, together with a new programme of selective investments involving Group production in Bulgaria, Italy, India and Morocco, are the key aspects of 2012. This year saw the inauguration of i.lab, Italcementi’s new innovation and research centre, designed by the architect Richard Meier and built to be compliant with Leed, the leading energy and environmental certification standard for construction, which enables energy savings of up to 60%, compared to a traditional building. i.lab is an engine of growth and competitiveness, focusing on research and the transfer of technology to construction materials, where cement is the generator of sustainable architecture and intelligent buildings. i.lab offers the area and the community the Group’s core vocation for innovation and, at the same time, the message that industry can be the driver for sustainability, benefitting the economy, the environment and society. i.lab’s engineers, researchers and technical staff work together to integrate know-how with good practices and experience to drive technological innovation while implementing a strategy of sustainability. 2012 marks ten years of Italcementi Group documenting sustainability policies with detailed publication of the results achieved and a continuous constructive relationship with all its stakeholders. 4 The Group has decided to take a further step in this direction by publishing the Report on Sustainability together with the Directors’ Annual Report. In the ten-year period, the quality and detail of information have been improved, in line with the provisions of the Global Reporting Initiative, having adopted in 2010 the new United Nations Global Compact, which convenes global companies excelling in sustainability issues. Specifically, the Ten Principles of the Global Compact adopted have been confirmed as founding elements of Group Policies and the operating codes of good practice, and the annual Report on Sustainability publishes the Communication on Progress of all the initiatives implemented to contribute to the Millennium Development Goals. Alongside these initial commitments, based upon the new developments in a rapidly and continually evolving world, and an uncertain economic climate, in 2012 we shall continue the operating and industrial efficiency plans including rigorous financial management, in order to support the Group’s commitment to future growth.

The Board of Directors ((Notice published on 8th March 2012 on “Il Sole 24 Ore, Milano Finanza and Eco di Bergamo” and on the Company’s website) 25 www.italcementigroup.com 26 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report 27 www.italcementigroup.com Directors’ report Following the adoption by the European Union of Regulation no. 1606 of 2002, Italcementi consolidated financial statements for 2011, and the comparatives for 2010, have been drawn up in compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In accordance with the aforementioned Regulation, the principles to be adopted do not include the standards and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) at December 31, 2011, but not endorsed by the European Union at that date. Furthermore, the European Union has endorsed additional standards/interpretations that Italcementi S.p.A. will apply at a subsequent time, having decided not to elect early application. The main changes with respect to the financial statements at December 31, 2010, are set out in detail in the notes, in the section “Statement of compliance with the IFRS”. With regard to the scope of consolidation, the Calcestruzzi group has been consolidated (on a line-by-line basis) as from January 1, 2011, while the Group operations in Turkey headed by Set Group were deemed available-for-sale (application of IFRS 5) as from the beginning of the year and subsequently sold at the end of March. In compliance with IFRS 5 the gains or losses relating to discontinued operations have been presented as a separate item on the income statement both for the period under examination and for 2010. A similar presentation has been adopted for cash flows. In December, Axim-branded cement and concrete additives operations in Italy, France, USA, Canada, Morocco and Spain were sold. Full details about the changes in the scope of consolidation are provided in the notes (note 3). Earnings indicators To assist comprehension of its financial data, the Group employs a number of widely used indicators, which are not contemplated by the IFRS. Specifically, the income statement presents the following intermediate results / indicators: recurring EBITDA, EBITDA, EBIT, computed as the sum of the preceding items. On the face of the statement of financial position, similar considerations apply to net debt, whose components are detailed in the specific section of the notes. Since the indicators employed by the Group are not envisaged by the IFRS, their definitions may not coincide with and therefore not be comparable to those adopted by other companies/groups. This report contains many financial and non-financial earnings indicators, including those mentioned above. The financial indicators, taken from the financial statements, are used in the tables summarizing the Group’s financial performance, in relation to comparative amounts and other amounts from the same period (e.g., change in revenue, recurring EBITDA and EBIT with respect to the previous year, and change in their return on revenue). The use of amounts not directly apparent from the financial statements (e.g., the exchange-rate effect on revenue and on earnings) and the presentation of comments and assessments assist qualification of the trends in the amounts concerned. 28 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 The directors’ report also provides a series of financial ratios (gearing, leverage, coverage) that are clearly of importance for a better understanding of Group performance, especially in comparison with previous periods. The non-financial indicators refer to external and internal elements: the general economic situation and the situation of the industry in which the Group operates, trends on the various markets and lines of business, trends in sales prices and key cost factors, acquisitions and disposals, other significant events in the period, organizational developments, the introduction of laws and regulations, etc.. In the notes, the section on the net debt provides information about the effects of changes in interest rates and the main exchange rates on the statement of financial position and the income statement. Results and significant events for the year Results Inevitably, the Group’s results were affected by the continuing difficulties in the international economic scenario in 2011. Sales volumes, on a like-for-like basis, were down in aggregates and cement, but grew slightly in ready mixed concrete. Revenue, at 4,720.5 million euro (4,660.0 million euro in 2010), was up 1.3% (-1.3% on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates), largely due to the change in the Group scope of consolidation. Recurring EBITDA, at 697.3 million euro (841.7 million euro), was down 17.2%. After amortization and depreciation charges of 474.8 million euro (461.2 million euro) and impairment losses of 134.3 million euro (8.0 million euro), EBIT was 129.0 million euro (370.2 million euro), a reduction of 65.2%. Profit before tax, at 53.0 million euro (276.5 million euro), was down 80.8%. After income tax expense of 68.8 million euro (60.6 million euro), the loss relating to continuing operations amounted to 15.8 million euro (profit of 215.8 million euro in 2010). Thanks to the net gain of 106.9 million euro from the sale of Set Group, profit for the period was 91.2 million euro (197.1 million euro). The loss attributable to owners of the parent was 3.1 million euro (profit of 45.8 million euro), while profit attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased to 94.3 million euro, from 151.3 million euro in 2010. Net debt at December 31, 2011, amounted to 2,093.0 million euro, down by 137.9 million euro from December 31, 2010 (2,230.9 million euro). Total equity was 4,894.9 million euro, a decrease of 91.0 million euro from December 31, 2010, while equity attributable to owners of the parent was 3,494.9 million euro, down by 30.2 million euro from December 31, 2010 (3,525.1 million euro). Significant events for the year Significant events in the first nine months of the year, previously illustrated in the halfyear financial report and the quarterly reports at the end of March and September, are described below. 29 www.italcementigroup.com The Calcestruzzi group returned to the scope of consolidation of Italcementi S.p.A. as from January 1, 2011. With a ruling on April 20, 2011, the court of Caltanissetta ordered the full cancellation of the preventive seizure on Calcestruzzi S.p.A. and the restitution of company assets to the owners. In May, the Calcestruzzi S.p.A. shareholders approved a share capital increase from 59.2 million euro to 110 million euro, which was subscribed and simultaneously paid in full by Italcementi S.p.A. for 99.90% and by SICIL.FIN.S.r.l. (now Italcementi Ingegneria S.r.l.) for 0.10%. At the end of January, in view of the political unrest in Egypt, the Group suspended local production operations for about one week. In March Set Group Holding was sold to the Turkish group Limak Holding and Italgen Elektrik Uretim was sold to Enerjisa (a Sabanci-Verbund joint venture). As a result of the sale on the stock market of the shares held in Afyon Cimento Sanayii Turk A.S., Ciments Français S.A. reduced its controlling interest from 76.51% to 51.0%. At the end of June, Mediobanca was engaged as financial advisor for sale of the entire remaining shareholding in the Turkish company. In August and September respectively, Moody’s Investor Services and Standard and Poor’s confirmed their Baa3 and BBB-/A-3 ratings assigned to Italcementi and Ciments Français, but downgraded the outlook from stable to negative. In September, through the Indian company Zuari Cement, the Group acquired from Zuari Industries a 74% stake in Gulbarga Cement, a company based in the region of Karnataka, which is planning to build a new cement plant with an annual cement capacity of 3 million metric tons. Significant events in the fourth quarter are described below, some of which were illustrated in the quarterly report at September 30, 2011. In October, Italcementi Finance S.A., the French company that acts as the Group’s treasury vehicle, received Banque de France authorization to launch commercial paper under a program for a maximum amount of 800 million euro. The program, with a shortterm Moody’s NP rating and Standard & Poor’s A3 rating, is unconditionally guaranteed by Italcementi S.p.A.. With regard to action to raise efficiency and optimize facilities, the Group formulated a series of measures on costs designed to strengthen profit margins. These initiatives – some of which were launched during the fourth quarter of the year – will bring benefits in the order of 160 million euro when fully implemented. In December, in line with the rating review policy adopted for almost all the major cement players, Moody’s Investor Services downgraded its long-term ratings for Italcementi and Ciments Français, and its senior unsecured ratings for Italcementi Finance and Ciments Français to Ba1. Also in December all operations in the sector of Axim-branded ready mixed concrete and cement additives were sold to the Swiss group Sika. The operations in question were organized in six companies with industrial facilities and commercial divisions active in Italy, France, USA, Canada, Morocco and Spain, with revenue of approximately 61 million euro in 2010 and 150 employees. The agreement also provides for a strategic partnership in R&D, sales and marketing and the supply of additives for the Group. 30 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 The international economy and industry trends World economic trends in 2011 varied greatly, not only from one region to another, but also from one quarter to the next. The first half remained lively, but was followed by a significantly slower second half, due to financial stability risks in some euro zone countries, the restrictive fiscal policies adopted in most of the euro zone, the more cautious monetary policies in a number of emerging countries, as well as the geo-political unrest especially in the Middle East. For the year as a whole, global economic growth, which in 2010 had returned to more than 5%, was, according to preliminary estimates, once again close to its long-term values (around 3.5%); the growth rate in the advanced economies (1.6%) was half that of the previous year. Raw material prices largely reflected the general cyclical weakening; nevertheless, oil prices displayed a notable resistance to decline, influenced in part by the important recovery of the dollar. Falls in exchange rates, weak stock markets and tighter capital flows were the main features of many emerging countries in the last part of the year. Despite widespread moderation in wages and salaries, in the advanced area inflation rose faster than expected, due to the previous increases in the basic input prices and the rises in indirect taxation imposed by fiscal austerity policies. In the advanced economies, the deterioration in the macroeconomic climate hit the construction sector in the final phase of the longest recession of the postwar period, contributing, in many countries, to a further postponement in the upturn. Nevertheless, the most evident feature was the divergence in the cyclical positions of the countries in which the Group operates, both emerging and mature. Among the mature countries, there was a moderate construction recovery in France and Belgium, while the southern euro zone countries reported a further significant fall in activity. The USA was in an intermediate position, with the recessionary pressures of the last six years probably fading, but signs of a recovery, even from the very low levels reached, still appearing to be very weak. In the emerging countries, the economic trends in the construction sector were generally favorable; in some cases, however, signs of a slowdown emerged as economic policies paid greater attention to avoiding excessive speculative bubbles in real estate. The Group results in the area were also critically affected by events relating to the complex political transition taking place in Egypt, whose influence was also felt in the construction sector. 31 www.italcementigroup.com Financial performance in 2011 Key consolidated figures 2011 2010 % change (in millions of euro) (IFRS 5) vs. 2010 Revenue 4,720.5 4,660.0 1.3 Recurring EBITDA 697.3 841.7 (17.2) % of revenue 14.8 18.1 Other operating income (expense) 40.7 (2.3) n.s.

In Emerging Europe, North Africa and Middle East, the growth in Morocco and Bulgaria did not counterbalance the decline in Egypt. In Asia, the rise in sales volumes in India was not sufficient to cover the contraction on the other markets, which were also affected by the floods that hit Thailand. Trading operations also reported a downturn, primarily in intragroup trading. In aggregates, the growth achieved with respect to the fourth quarter of 2010 arose mainly from the strong performance in France – Belgium, Italy and North America, set against sharp falls in Greece and Spain. The small improvement in ready mixed concrete, on a like-for-like basis, arose in part from the trends already described for aggregates, with increases in France – Belgium, Italy and North America, and falls in Greece and Spain. The sector also reported strong progress in Morocco and Kuwait, and a significant contraction in Egypt. Fourth-quarter results Fourth-quarter revenue amounted to 1,120.3 million euro (+2.9%), with growth reported in Central Western Europe as a result of the upward trend in prices and the perimeter effect in Italy, and in North America, thanks to positive sales volumes. Conversely, a decline was reported on the emerging markets as a whole, penalized chiefly by Egypt and Thailand, despite the progress in Morocco and India. On a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates, revenue would have been 1.7% down from the fourth quarter of 2010. Recurring EBITDA, at 133.4 million euro, was down 24.6% from the year-earlier quarter. EBIT was negative at 107.3 million euro, compared with positive EBIT of 54.1 million euro in the year-earlier fourth quarter. The downturn arose mainly from significant impairment losses (134.4 million euro) on property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill, compared with 7.4 million euro in the year-earlier quarter. As a result of these impairment losses, a loss of 121.6 million euro was posted for the fourth quarter (profit of 63.6 million euro in the fourth quarter of 2010). Full-year sales volumes and internal transfers As noted in the remarks on the fourth quarter, the figures and changes in full-year volumes do not include Set Group operations, but reflect the re-inclusion of the Calcestruzzi group in the scope of consolidation. 34 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

The small improvement in Asia was driven by India, while Thailand was stable (penalized in the fourth quarter as mentioned above) and the other countries slowed. The Emerging Europe, North Africa and Middle East area was influenced above all by the decline in Egypt, countered only in part by the healthy trend in Morocco. A reduction in sales volumes was reported for Trading, mainly on intragroup trading. The decline in aggregates, at constant size, stemmed from the general reduction in sales volumes in Central Western Europe (where only France – Belgium reported growth) and in Morocco. The downturn was contained in part by the progress in North America. In ready mixed concrete, on a like-for-like basis, there was a small improvement. The healthy performance in France – Belgium, Morocco and Kuwait more than made up for the decline in other markets. 35 www.italcementigroup.com Revenue and operating performance Contribution to consolidated revenue 2011 2010 Change (in millions of euro) 2011/10 % % % % (*) Line of business Cement and clinker 3,056.3 64.7 3,315.0 71.1 (7.8) (2.7) Ready mixed concrete and aggregates 1,387.9 29.4 1,037.5 22.3 33.8 3.5 Miscellaneous 276.4 5.9 307.4 6.6 (10.1) (2.2) Total 4,720.5 100.0 4,660.0 100.0 1.3 (1.3) Geographical area Central Western Europe 2,596.3 55.0 2,337.6 50.2 11.1 1.3 North America 404.7 8.6 414.6 8.9 (2.4) 2.5 Emerging Europe, North Africa and Middle East 1,009.5 21.4 1,237.7 26.6 (18.4) (13.2) Asia 497.9 10.5 445.3 9.5 11.8 16.2 Cement and clinker trading 138.6 2.9 136.2 2.9 1.8 1.0 Other 73.5 1.6 88.5 1.9 (16.9) (10.6) Total 4,720.5 100.0 4,660.0 100.0 1.3 (1.3) (*) at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation Revenue and operating results by geographical area Revenue Recurring EBITDA EBITDA EBIT (in millions of euro) 2011 % chang e 2011 % change 2011 % change 2011 % change vs. 2010 vs. 2010 vs. 2010 vs. 2010 Central Western Europe 2,680.8 11.4 307.1 (6.4) 340.3 3.4 (4.1) n.s.

A factor in revenue performance was the fall in sales volumes, countered in part by a favorable sales prices trend in some countries, notably India, Italy, Thailand and Morocco. At constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation, the mature countries reported an improvement, thanks to France – Belgium and North America. The negative exchange-rate effect arose chiefly from the depreciation of the Egyptian pound, US dollar and rupee against the euro. 36 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 The operating performance was supported by industrial efficiency and growing profit margins in Italy, but adversely affected by events on the Egyptian market, the consolidation of the Calcestruzzi group and, at EBIT level, by heavy impairment losses. Compounding this complex situation were higher energy costs and the depreciation of some currencies against the euro, while a positive contribution came from CO2 emission rights and the valorization of energy efficiency credits for a total of 87.6 million euro (55.2 million euro in 2010). Recurring EBITDA was 697.3 million euro, down 17.2% from 2010. After net non-recurring income of 40.7 million euro (net expense of 2.3 million euro in 2010), EBITDA was 738.1 million euro, a decrease of 12.1% from 2010. The non-recurring items were net gains from the sale of assets (66.3 million euro) and net expense for corporate restructurings (25.6 million euro), mainly in Italy. After amortization and depreciation of 474.8 million euro (461.2 million euro) and impairment losses of 134.3 million euro (8 million euro), EBIT was 129.0 million euro, down 65.2% from 2010. Impairment losses related to goodwill (82.6 million euro), property, plant and equipment (36.6 million euro) and intangible assets (15.1 million euro); details are provided in the notes. Impairment losses on goodwill referred to non-recent acquisitions in Spain, Greece and Italy, the countries most affected by the market crisis. Among the individual countries, the most significant progress in recurring EBITDA was reported in Morocco, India, Thailand, while by far the largest reduction was in Egypt. Finance costs and other items In 2011 net interest expense on net debt decreased to 85.4 million euro (90.4 million euro in 2010) as described in notes (note 30). Overall, finance costs net of finance income rose from 89.8 million euro to 102.1 million euro (+13.7%). The trend was also due to net exchange rate losses of 10.6 million euro (gains of 8.4 million euro in 2010), with a negative increase of 19.0 million euro from 2010, and to net derivatives for hedges on CO2 emission rights and Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), with a negative effect of 6.5 million euro. The share of profit/(loss) of equity-accounted investees, 18.6 million euro, was up from 2010 (17.1 million euro). Reversal of impairment losses on financial assets amounted to 7.5 million euro (losses of 21.0 million euro in 2010). This arose as a result of the reversal, in the 2011 income statement after the consolidation of the Calcestruzzi group as from January 1, 2011, of the impairment loss on the Calcestruzzi group posted in the fair value reserve on December 31, 2010. Profit for the period Profit before tax was 53.0 million euro, down by 80.8% from 2010 (276.5 million euro). Income tax expense, at 68.8 million euro, was up 13.5% from 2010 (60.6 million euro), largely as a result of the income contribution of countries with higher tax rates, nondeductible expense and the change in the tax rate in Egypt, which was increased to 25% at the end of June 2011 from the previous rate of 20%. 37 www.italcementigroup.com The loss relating to continuing operations came to 15.8 million euro (a profit of 215.8 million euro in 2010). The net gain of 106.9 million euro from the sale of Set Group generated a profit for the period of 91.2 million euro (197.1 million euro), with a loss attributable to the owners of the parent of 3.1 million euro (profit of 45.8 million euro) and a profit attributable to noncontrolling interests of 94.3 million euro (151.3 million euro). Total comprehensive income Starting from the profit for the period, the comprehensive income for 2011 showed a negative balance of 57.9 million euro (a positive balance of 223.9 million euro in 2010) arising mainly from: translation losses of 26.2 million euro, fair value losses on availablefor-sale financial assets for 49.3 million euro, fair value gains on derivatives for 20.1 million euro. Considering the profit for the period of 91.2 million euro described in the previous section and the components described above, 2011 total comprehensive income was positive at 33.2 million euro (a negative amount of 47.2 million euro attributable to owners of the parent and a positive amount of 80.4 million euro attributable to non-controlling interests), compared with a positive total of 420.9 million euro in 2010 (200.9 million euro attributable to owners of the parent and 220.0 million euro attributable to non-controlling interests).

Chief Executive Officer, to improve its ability to create value for stakeholders by optimizing enterprise risk management (ERM). The mission of the function is to guarantee a structured approach to risk management, integrated with the Group growth strategy, and to support the improvement of Group performance by identifying, measuring, managing and controlling key risks. The creation of the Risk Management Department is part of the “Risk & Compliance” program set up in 2008, based on the methodology developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tradeway Commission (COSO), and consisting of the following phases. 1. Identification of the main areas of risk for Group strategic goals and development of methods and tools to analyze and assess the correlated risk events. 2. Assessment, at country level and at aggregate level, of identified risk events in terms of impact, probability and timeframe, in order to acquire an overall vision of the Group risk portfolio. 3. Selection of priority risks and definition of response strategies, Group governance rules and action to integrate and improve risk management systems; some operating risks are managed at individual company level, while others requiring specific competences or involving a variety of responsibilities are managed at Group level. 41 www.italcementigroup.com 4. Implementation of defined mitigation strategies and action and development of the Enterprise Risk Management process. 5. Reporting to Top Management and the governance bodies on the main risks, and their management and evolution; in this phase quantification of risks and opportunities is integrated with the enterprise management process, for example in the budget, in results forecasting reviews and in assessment of strategic projects. Sustainable development and risk management: protection of people and assets Sustainable development favors a corporate approach that balances economic growth, protection of the environment and social sustainability. By constantly pursuing an optimal balance among these elements and ensuring that benefits extend to everyone involved, companies enhance their long-term value, ability to survive and competitive advantage, thus helping to prevent industrial risks. The Group checks that its protection and prevention programs are consistently applied to all personnel in production sites (employees and other) and to all operations in its companies. Regulatory limits and Group sustainable development goals and initiatives are examined in a special report (Sustainability Report) and also summarized in a specific section in this report. The Asset Protection Program continued in 2011; it qualifies the importance of risks and develops a suitable prevention and protection policy, thereby limiting damage to assets and consequent operating losses. The program is now a consolidated Group process. Risks relating to the general economic and industry situation The economic and financial situation represents an element of risk for the Group, also in relation to its specific area of business, which is sensitive to changes in the economic situation. Household and business propensity to invest in construction is affected by the uncertainty and constraints of the general scenario. Risks associated with energy factors The cost of energy factors, which represents a large portion of Group variable costs of production, can vary significantly as a result of factors beyond the Group’s control. The Group has adopted measures to mitigate risks for certain energy factors by entering into medium-term supply contracts. Furthermore the centralized procurement organization enables the Group to benefit from more efficient relations with suppliers and to obtain competitive conditions. Risks relating to availability of raw materials The availability of raw materials is a strategic factor in investment decisions. The Group generally sources its raw materials – limestone, clay, gypsum, aggregates and other materials used in the production of cement, ready mixed concrete and aggregates – from quarries it owns (the majority) or quarries rented from third parties. For these and other significant materials, the Group has also reached specific agreements with suppliers to guarantee continuous, stable procurement, under terms and conditions at the best market levels. 42 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 Environmental risks The “Sustainability Report” and the section on Sustainable Development in this report illustrate the measures taken by the Group to manage environmental risks and control and reduce emissions. With regard to CO2 emissions, the Group’s European companies are exposed to price fluctuations on emission rights depending on its own rights surplus or deficit. The Group’s position is therefore constantly monitored to ensure correct risk management (see note 22 in the notes). Financial risks The current period of crisis puts corporate cash flows at risk, endangering companies’ selffinancing ability and creating difficulties for normal, orderly operations on the financial market. The Group procures sources of finance and manages interest rates, currency and counterparty risk, for all the companies in the scope of consolidation. The Group uses derivatives to reduce the risk of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates with respect to debt and its international operations. Detailed analysis of this type of risk is provided in note 22 of the notes, on net debt. Ratings risks The Group’s ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for funding depends on various factors, including its credit ratings assigned by recognized ratings agencies. Its credit ratings may change to reflect changes in its results, financial position, credit structure and liquidity profile. As a result, a rating downgrade may have negative repercussions on the Group’s ability to raise funding. Legal risks Suitable provisions and impairment losses have been applied with regard to existing risks and their related economic effects. Estimates and valuations are based on available information and are in any case regularly reviewed, with immediate recognition in the financial statements of any variations. Conformity risks The Group is subject to specific regulations concerning the quality of the products it markets; special monitoring activities have been set up to ensure compliance with the regulations in the countries where it operates. At a general level, the “Risk and Compliance” program has introduced specific training and circulates procedures and recommendations in the Group countries, to ensure compliance with legislation and with tax, social and environmental regulations. The program is reviewed on an annual basis to take account of regulatory changes. Political risks The Group has taken out insurance covers to limit the financial consequences of possible political measures that might prevent normal management of some subsidiaries in emerging countries. 43 www.italcementigroup.com Financial disclosure risks The main characteristics of the risk management system and the internal control system with respect to the financial disclosure process are illustrated in a specific chapter of the “Corporate Governance” report in the Italcementi S.p.A. annual report. Insurance In the interest of all Group subsidiaries, Italcementi has taken out policies with leading insurance companies to cover risks to people and assets, as well as product and general third-party liability covers. As part of its risk coverage policy, the Group aims to optimize risk management costs by assessing direct assumption and transfer to the market. All policies are negotiated under a framework agreement to ensure a balance between the probability of a risk occurring and the damage that would ensue for each subsidiary. 44 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

The difficult economic and financial situation provoked a strong slowdown in building, both in the private sector, due to the high level of unsold stock and the growing squeeze on credit, and in the public sector, due to the constraints of the stability pact and the resulting cut in capital spending. In 2011, demand for cement fell for the fifth year running, most notably in the second half of the year. On the trading front, material reductions emerged both in exports and in imports of cement. Our cement and clinker sales volumes fell by 6% from 2010, essentially due to the reduction in the second half of the year, with a more negative trend than the market, in part as a result of compliance with rigorous commercial risk assessment criteria. The sales price trend reversed as from the beginning of 2011, making further progress in the second half after the introduction of the new price list at the beginning of June, thus counterbalancing 45 www.italcementigroup.com the negative trend in sales volumes. The improvement in sales prices brought healthy progress in recurring EBITDA, which was also supported by management of CO2 emission rights, valorization of energy efficiency credits (white certificates), income from power interruptability and savings on fixed costs as a result of measures already taken and due to continue in 2012. This was also achieved through a re-organization of HQ operations and the production and sales networks, providing for absorption of personnel surpluses with recourse to a series of welfare benefits. In connection with these measures, a net amount of 8.1 million euro was recognized in 2011 under non-recurring expense. Among negative effects, apart from the fall in sales volumes, there was an increase in variable costs, largely due to the rise in energy costs, counterbalanced by continuous efficiency improvements in production through use of alternative fuels, replacement raw materials and improvements in specific use. Overall operating results reflected the impact of the consolidation, as from the beginning of the year, of the ready mixed concrete and aggregates sector, with negative recurring EBITDA. The ready mixed concrete market has been experiencing a severe crisis for a number of years. In addition to the decline in demand, again a notable feature of 2011, other factors were the difficulties encountered by small and medium construction companies in obtaining credit. On a like-for-like basis, although Group sales recovered in the fourth quarter, they were down 2.7%, as a result of the general market decline, offset in part by the lively sales trend in major works. Trends in aggregates volumes were similar: a reduction of 4.1% for the year, with growth reported in the fourth quarter. In 2011, after regaining full control of operations, the Group drew up a plan to recover high levels of industrial efficiency and organizational effectiveness. To achieve this, a re-organization will begin in 2012 with the disposal of non-strategic plants, with recourse to welfare benefits to mitigate the impact on employees (recourse to state-subsidized layoff for a two-year period). Non-recurring expense was also provided for the ready mixed concrete and aggregates sector, for 14.6 million euro. France – Belgium In France and in Belgium cement consumption made good progress in 2011 thanks to very favorable meteorological conditions at the start and end of the year, and a healthy trend in residential building and public works. In France, Group overall cement and clinker sales volumes (including marginal export volumes) increased by 6.4%; in Belgium cement sales volumes grew by 10.0% (+8.4% including cement and clinker exports). Average sales prices fell slightly, in both France and Belgium, in part due to growing competitive pressures. Operating results in the cement sector slackened as operating expenses rose, especially for energy and maintenance, and as sales prices showed a slight decrease. These trends were offset only in part by the increase in sales volumes. In France Group ready mixed concrete sales volumes progressed by 10.5%, while aggregates were up 5.6%; in Belgium, on a like-for-like basis , ready mixed concrete sales volumes increased by 15.6%, while the rise in sales of aggregates was 2.7%. This positive trend fuelled the improvement in operating results. 46 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 Spain In Spain the fall in cement demand continued in 2011, with another sharp reduction, stemming largely from the difficult situation in the residential sector and the difficult financial situation of the state administration, which had a negative impact on infrastructure. In these conditions, Group domestic cement sales volumes were down 16.3% on 2010. Exports, supported by Group Trading operations, made it possible to contain the reduction in cement and clinker sales at 6.8%. Average cement sales prices made good progress in southern Spain and fell slightly in the Basque Country. The crisis in the construction sector had a particular significant impact on sales volumes of ready mixed concrete and aggregates, which fell by 23.2% and 30.3% respectively. In a particularly difficult market, the Group proceeded with renewed energy with its support activities and measures to rationalize and improve the efficiency of industrial operations, which will continue during 2012. Overall operating results decreased due to the reduction in sales volumes and the rise in energy costs, counterbalanced only in part by measures to contain fixed costs and by the favorable sales prices trend on markets in southern Spain. Others In Greece, the economic crisis continued with no signs of a recovery. This was reflected in Group overall cement and clinker sales, which fell by approximately 40%. A significant reduction was also recorded in sales volumes in ready mixed concrete (-40.5%) and aggregates (-51.0%). Operating results, affected mainly by the large fall in sales volumes, declined sharply.

In this context, Group cement sales volumes improved by 5.1% from 2010, also helped by a gradual recovery of market share. Average revenue per unit slackened from 2010, due to more intense competition and higher logistic expenses. 47 www.italcementigroup.com Ready mixed concrete sales volumes were down 1.4%, while sales of aggregates rose by 40.7%, sustained by a series of major road works in Canada. Recurring EBITDA was down on 2010, reflecting the fall in sales prices and higher operating expense (primarily energy and maintenance), offset only in part by higher sales volumes and action to contain fixed costs. In preparation for the expected economic turnaround and consequent improvement in cement demand, the Group took further steps in its distribution and logistics reorganization. The program began in the fourth quarter and will begin to produce significant effects in the first half of 2012.

Group overall cement and clinker sales volumes, including modest export flows, fell by 10.9%, reflecting a fall in demand and, above all, the market entry of new production capacity. In an increasingly aggressive competitive environment, prices fell particularly significantly in the middle part of the year. Sales volumes in ready mixed concrete were down 20.1%. The sharp reduction in operating results arose from a number of factors. There was a significant fall in revenue (price and volume effects), higher energy costs, and higher payroll and general expenses, in part as a result of the policies introduced by the Group to help its employees during the most difficult period of the transition in 2011. Another negative factor was the depreciation of the Egyptian pound, reflected in the translation into euro of amounts denominated in local currency. 48 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 Nevertheless, these trends were countered by continuing programs to recover industrial and procurement efficiency, associated with the elimination of clinker purchases. Morocco In Morocco, cement consumption in 2011 was very healthy, upheld chiefly by private investment in housing and by the public works sector. At the end of March, the Agadir plant was permanently shut down, replaced by the new cement plant in Ait Baha. In October, the Laâyoune wind farm was officially opened (5.25 MW); the farm provides power for the neighboring grinding center. Group domestic cement sales volumes rose by 8.1%. The increase in overall cement and clinker volumes, including exports, was 9.1%. Sales volumes of ready mixed concrete, sustained largely by activities in the Casablanca area, were up 10.9%, while sales of aggregates fell by 17.0% on a highly competitive market. Operating results made significant progress, thanks to higher revenue (volume and price effects) and the sharp reduction in clinker purchases as a result of the additional capacity provided by the Ait Baha plant, whose overall efficiency produced benefits sufficient to counter the large increase in fuel costs. Others In Bulgaria, cement consumption decreased, but at a much slower rate than in 2010. Group overall cement and clinker sales volumes were significantly lower at the end of the first half but then made a strong recovery to keep the full-year reduction at 3.8%. Operating results made healthy progress thanks to management of CO2 emission rights. In Kuwait, in an upbeat economic scenario, Group cement sales volumes increased by 4.5%, although sales prices were affected by the large decrease at the end of 2010. Operating results were helped by sales in ready mixed concrete, in terms both of volumes (+22.8%), and of sales prices, and were up with respect to 2010. 49 www.italcementigroup.com ASIA Thailand India Others (1) Total Asia Full-cycle cement plants 2 2 2 6 Grinding centers 1 1 2 Quarries RMC plants 33 1 34 Revenue Recurring EBITDA EBIT Capital Employees EBITDA expenditure 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 Thailand 194.1 180.2 23.5 15.0 24.5 14.7 8.0 (7.3) 11.4 7.2 863 846 India 223.5 169.8 57.2 36.0 57.2 35.9 38.7 20.2 42.7 68.9 797 787 (1) Others 81.8 98.9 1.0 17.3 1.1 17.1 (8.6) 7.2 6.5 7.5 604 758 Eliminations Total 499.4 449.0 81.8 68.2 82.8 67.7 38.1 20.0 60.6 83.6 2,264 2,391 (1) China and Kazakhstan Thailand The consequences of the floods that hit the country in the fourth quarter slowed the economy, which reported only modest progress in 2011; the policies adopted by the Government should stimulate new economic growth this year. In 2011 Group domestic cement sales volumes showed a small improvement (+0.4%); total cement and clinker sales were slightly down (-0.2%) as a result of lower clinker exports, offset only in part by cement sales to Cambodia. Average domestic cement sales prices were up on 2010, largely thanks to the first nine months of the year. Ready mixed concrete sales volumes fell by 7.2% from 2010. Overall operating results made progress, helped by the positive trend in sales prices, which counterbalanced the rise in costs for fuel and operating expenses. India In 2011 the economy slowed, with repercussions in the construction sector, where results failed to meet expectations. India was also troubled by inflationary pressures, which led to numerous interventions by the central bank, while the local currency depreciated significantly against the euro. Political instability and tensions contributed to the mood of uncertainty. In a competitive arena where pressure was intensified by the arrival of new production capacity, the healthy trend on markets in southern India in the fourth quarter meant the year closed with a slight increase in cement consumption compared with 2010. In June the Group began production at the Chennai grinding center and benefited from higher production levels in 2010. Its domestic cement sales increased by 7.8%, while total cement and clinker sales rose by 8.5%. After collapsing in the first nine months of the previous year, average sales prices made a significant recovery, which continued throughout the year, stabilizing in the fourth quarter. 50 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 Operating results showed healthy progress largely due to the rise in average sales prices, countered only in part by the increase in the cost of coal (especially in the fourth quarter) and an unfavorable exchange-rate effect. Others In China, the economic growth of 2011 supported the construction sector. Group overall cement and clinker sales volumes, however, fell by 5.2%, due to the entry of new production capacity. The fall in average sales prices, associated with the negative volume effect and the rise in fuel costs, generated a sharp reduction in operating results. In Kazakhstan, despite higher demand, Group cement and clinker sales volumes dropped by 18.8% from 2010. This was due to the distance from the capital city, Astana, where major infrastructure projects were concentrated, and to the entry of new production capacity in the south of the country. Despite the healthy sales prices trend, the negative volume effect and the rise in operating expenses caused a large reduction in operating results.

The sharp fall in sales volumes arose largely in intragroup clinker sales, particularly with regard to Egypt and Thailand. Operating results were down on 2010. Energy project As reported above, in March Italgen Elektric Uretim, the company that developed the 142.5 MW wind farm project in Balikesir, Turkey, was sold to a third party. The main Italgen projects in 2011 are described below. Italy: Guiglia (Modena) – Photovoltaic plant (6 MW) At the end of July, two months ahead of schedule, work was completed on the photovoltaic plant in Guiglia (Modena), by the i.Fotoguiglia S.r.l. company owned 30% by Italgen and 51 www.italcementigroup.com 70% by Fotowatio Italy, a subsidiary of the Spanish group Fotowatio Renewable Ventures S.A.. From July-December 2011, the plant, which involved a total investment of 20 million euro and is run jointly by the two partners, generated 4,600 MWh of electrical energy, 30% above the forecast volume, thanks in part to very favorable meteorological conditions. The Italian Electric System Authority is currently assessing the project’s eligibility for government incentives. Morocco: Laayoune – Wind farm (5 MW) Consistently with the business model drawn up by Italgen and Ciments du Maroc, in 2011 the Laayoune wind farm was completed. In the period July-December, it generated a total of approximately 7.5 GWh, in line with the volume projected in the feasibility study. Morocco: Ait Baha – Solar concentrator project (0.1 MW) At the beginning of 2011 preliminary studies began to assess installation of a solar concentrator plant next to the Ait Baha cement plant and a technical partner was identified with an innovative technology based on parabolic reflectors. The pilot plant will comprise 3 solar modules with a total surface of approximately 6,000 m2. Planned peak power is 150 kW and projected annual production is approximately 1 million kWh, for a total investment of 2.7 million euro. Egypt: Gulf El Zeit – Wind farm (120 MW) Despite some delays due to the political difficulties in Egypt, the authorization process for the project continued, the preliminary farm project was completed for the preparation of the documents and the tender specifications for the supply of the plant, and negotiations continued with the Egyptian authorities on the drafting of the usufruct agreement, which we hope will be signed in the next few months. Bulgaria: Kavarna I and Kavarna II – Wind farms (18 MW) During 2011 commercial operations began for the Kavarna II wind farm. The reliability test was completed successfully and in the first two months of activity the farm exceeded the contractually planned volume. Operations at the two farms were hampered, however, by unplanned interruptions caused by the inability of the local grid to cope with power generation peaks and low wind levels during the year. Total production was 32.5 GWh, 20% below projected production. In 2011, Italgen S.p.A. reported revenue of 57.4 million euro, an increase of 22.4% from 2010, thanks to higher volumes of transported power and the rise in the transportation charge. Recurring EBITDA was 17.7 million euro, 10.5% above 2010; profit for the year was 19.7 million euro, a sharp increase from 2010 (7.3 million euro), thanks to the gain from the above-mentioned sale of Italgen Elektric Uretim. Italgen closed 2011 by successfully meeting its “Zero accidents” target. 52 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

Information systems Important results were obtained in 2011 for the plan for the renewal of the Group information systems. The new management control model was activated in most of the main Group countries. The project aims to make performance analysis faster and more effective by rationalizing rules and automating information management and processing. The model roll-out will be completed by the end of 2012 with activation in the minor locations. At the end of 2011, application of an integrated budget and planning system was operational in the main Italian and French companies; the system will be rolled out to the rest of the Group by the end of 2012. The focus of the 2011 projects also targeted areas for efficiency improvements, with initiatives covering for example spares management and production control, and the commercial areas, with initiatives to build more effective relations with customers. The latter looks likely to be a constantly changing area for almost all Group countries, taking priority in development of IT solutions in 2012. With regard to compliance, further advances were made in internal procedures for Disaster Recovery, Management of transfer to production, and Segregation of Duties. 2011 also saw a constant focus on efficiency and simplification, leading to a review of the main outsourcing contracts with a significant reduction in costs. 54 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 Sustainable development In 2011, the Group maintained and strengthened its commitment to sustainable development in all countries and lines of business, with initiatives coordinated by the Group’s “Sustainable Development Steering Committee”. Details on objectives, initiatives and results are provided in the “Sustainability Report”. Membership of the United Nation Global Compact (UNGC) and participation in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) are cornerstones of the Group commitment to sustainability. The Group companies also take an active part in the regional UNGC and WBCSD networks. The new Sustainability Policies adopted at the end of 2010 are being introduced and implemented at local level. The Italcementi Group was reconfirmed in “The Sustainability Yearbook 2012”, the most complete publication on corporate sustainability issued annually by Sustainable Asset Management (SAM); it was ranked in the “SAM Bronze Class” category. Social initiatives The Group takes active steps to improve quality of life for its employees, support local communities and cooperate with customers and suppliers. No form of discrimination is applied in any area and employee health and safety are considered of fundamental importance. Key aspects of workers rights are managed with policies compliant with the top international standards, like the International Labor Organization regulations and the guidelines of the Organization for Economic Co-operation Development. With the contribution of the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the implementation continued of the agreement signed by Italcementi S.p.A. with Building and Wood Workers International in 2008, to promote and safeguard worker rights. The Group is also completing formulation of a program to raise awareness of human rights and establish an internal reporting and monitoring system. Health and safety Improvement of safety is a constant Group objective. Since the introduction of the “Zero accidents” project in 2000, the accident frequency rate has fallen significantly (about 74%). Confirming the strength of its commitment to improving safety conditions not only for its own employees but also for its contractors’ workers, in order to prevent fatal accidents and foster a safety and awareness culture among its own workforce and other workers, the Group has decided to adopt a new approach promoting safety as a “way of life”, closely related to daily activities. Beginning with the new Safety Policy and applying the new Safety Management Manual, a growing number of compulsory standards have gradually been adopted by all the subsidiaries. Environmental management systems At the end of 2011, 47 plants out of 53 had ISO 14011 certification for their environmental management systems. Other certification procedures are in the final stage of implementation. Environmental management systems are being gradually extended to all Group operations in cement, aggregates, ready mixed concrete and other areas. Risk management is also handled through environmental audits conducted by the Sustainable Growth Division as part of a long-term program. In 2011, these audits covered cement plants in China, Egypt and North America. 55 www.italcementigroup.com Raw materials and alternative fuels To ensure responsible use of raw materials and fuels, many subsidiaries are taking action to increase use of alternative sources and thereby minimize impact on the environment and on the health and safety of employees and other parties using these materials. In 2011, the proportion of alternative fuels to total Group energy consumption increased with respect to 2010. In Egypt and India, a number of promising activities began. Emissions control and reduction At the end of 2011, 59 out of 78 active kilns were equipped with complete continuous emissions monitoring systems to measure dust, NOx and SO2, in line with the requirements of the Cement Sustainability Initiative. The remaining kilns are kept under constant control through partial continuous systems or regular spot checks. In addition to dust, NOx and SO2, spot monitoring of minor elements such as volatile organic pollutants, metals and dioxins is conducted in a growing number of plants, in order to set improvement targets and keep ahead of future legislation. CO2 emissions monitoring and European Union trading system The CO2 emissions generated by Group operations directly (e.g., production) and indirectly (e.g., transport) are closely monitored. 2011 saw a significant improvement in CO2 emissions in countries where recently revamped plants resumed full operation. European clinker production plants are subject to the European Directive on greenhouse gas emissions trading, now in the second period of application (2008-2012). The downturn in the European cement market continued in 2011, leading to a fall in clinker production volumes and consequently in CO2 emissions in all Group countries in Europe. In 2011, the Group had a quota surplus for more than 4 million metric tons of CO2, on a total allocation of approximately 18 million metric tons. The Group manages this availability compatibly with its carbon risk management strategy, covering the entire period from 2008 to 2020 (EU ETS application phases 2 and 3). The strategy includes EUA-CER forward swaps (forward EUA sales and CER forward purchases) to diversify and optimize the CO2 emission rights portfolio, for use after 2012. Human resources The Group workforce stood at 19,896 persons at December 31, 2011, a decrease of 243 from December 31, 2010. On a like-for-like basis, in relation above all to the re-inclusion of the Calcestruzzi group, the reduction would have been 830 heads (-4.1%). The downsizing, which was of significant proportions in the companies affected by the crisis, was achieved largely through special exit incentives, retirement support or restructuring agreements with the unions to limit social repercussions. This enabled the Group to maintain a healthy internal climate and keep strikes and forms of union unrest to an immaterial level. The corporate climate improvement projects drawn up after the 2010 “Group Opinion Survey” were introduced into the companies. The strong attention devoted to reducing fixed costs and jobs did not prevent the necessary personnel development measures, to enhance key competences and retain the most qualified employees. Although budgets were limited, new initiatives began at local and international level, especially for the professional “supply chain” family and to boost 56 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 leadership and performance management. This helped the Group keep turnover of key personnel to a physiological minimum, confirming the strong sense of belonging in the organization, even during this difficult period. An important improvement was made in the personnel information systems with the introduction of the SAP system in the Egyptian subsidiary. In 2011, thanks in part to funding for training provided under current laws, the Group provided a total of 364,040 hours of training involving 18,524 people on at least one course for a total of 32,563 participants. Activities were developed consistently with the re-organization of the Training Management System, which covers four areas: Human Capital Development, Compliance and Risk Mitigation, Efficiency, Sustainable Development and Innovation. Also, for the 80th anniversary of the “Studi & Ricerche” publication by Scuola Master F.lli Pesenti, a meeting was organized at Milan Polytechnic on synergies between the corporate sector and universities. In cooperation with the Cav. Del Lavoro Carlo Pesenti foundation, work continued with schools and universities, with the assignment of scholarships, internships, degree theses and visits for students to Group offices, laboratories and plants. Initiatives continued in 2011 to improve the corporate governance system, using a methodology that defines the organizational structure, responsibilities and powers and describes company processes, in order to identify suitable measures to prevent commission of offences and mitigate operating and compliance risks. Integration continued of the Management Systems (Quality, Environment, Safety) from a process viewpoint, and integration also began of the requirements for the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) standard to provide IT solutions in line with the top international standards, in part to mitigate IT offences as per Legislative Decree 231/01. Implementation of the company processes was conducted in a more systematic fashion for all Group subsidiaries, which are equipped with their own improvement Action Plan in line with local business needs and corporate governance rules. In areas where the program has achieved the highest level of implementation, the spread of the corporate process culture is facilitating management of improvement, control and mitigation of activities at risk, and also generating a high level of employee engagement. To date, the availability of consolidated operating corporate governance tools together with the assessment reports from the various bodies and functions performing control activities is enabling the Group to direct the development and review of corporate processes to the areas at greatest risk. 57 www.italcementigroup.com Engineering, technical assistance, research and development (CTG S.p.A. – Group Technical Center) In 2011 CTG S.p.A. carried out engineering, construction, technical assistance and R&D activities for the Group companies in Italy and abroad, providing services for 55.2 million euro (61.8 million euro in 2010). Staff at December 31, 2011, numbered 398 (404 at December 31, 2010), of whom 306 in Bergamo, 86 in Guerville and 6 at Suez Cement in Egypt. Regarding projects set up in previous years and now in operation, Martinsburg (USA), Matera (Italy), Yerraguntla (India) and Ait Baha (Morocco), CTG S.p.A. played a limited role in realization, focusing more on fine-tuning; for the new projects too, its involvement was limited, since these projects are still in the early stages. With regard to the revamping of the Devnya cement plant in Bulgaria, work is focusing on engineering, in relation to the changed dimensions of the plant (4,000 mt of clinker per day) and on preparation of documentation to begin requests for tenders. For the revamping of the Rezzato plant in Italy (3,000 mt of clinker per day + 20% maximum), basic engineering, investment scheduling, preparation of the requests for tenders and approvals have been completed. Operations for the new plant in Gulbarga, India, comprised basic engineering and preparation of the request for tenders. Regarding the project for the opening of the Barry quarry (Belgium), work continued on basic engineering and approval applications; for the Gaurin – Milieu project, building work was completed and the plant was commissioned. Assistance operations included action to improve product quality and raise efficiency at a number of cement plants. R&D work focused on materials and processes; nine patent applications were filed during the year. New mortar and concrete formulations were developed and are currently being tested. Regarding TX Active products, work continued on new formulations, paint and roofing tests, as well as road paving formulations. Monitoring of the new technologies and assessment of their applications in the cement sector continued. Special attention was devoted to cement formulations and to the production of clinker with lower CO2 emissions. Regarding process innovation, work is underway on filters for high-temperature gases, and dust recovery and treatment. 58 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 Innovation In 2011 the Group continued to promote the use of innovative products, applications and services in its companies to contribute to the creation of value, guaranteeing the best construction material solutions in compliance with policies to respect the environment and optimize resources. The rationalization of operations and growing integration among the functions concerned led to a reduction in development times and a stronger research and assistance focus on the most promising and profitable areas, including new business areas. After finalization of agreements for marketing of i.light, the transparent panel used at the Italian Pavilion at Expo Shanghai 2010, the optimization and diversification of the basic product continued; alternative channels are also being studied to enhance the offer. Sales volumes of sulfoalluminate cement-based products (ALIPRE range) rose significantly, thanks in part to the gradual expansion of the range and markets. Development also continued of new products based on TX Active, especially for coatings. Despite the unfavorable scenario, revenue from products classified as innovative, based on the third-party certified internal procedure, was in line with targets, at approximately 180 million euro in 2011. A project began during the year to valorize the link between innovation and sustainability. A sustainable production assessment process was developed using criteria consistent with the main international systems to determine the percentage of sustainable products in the Group. The Sustainable Production Index will be presented to the certifier by the end of March and tested in a number of countries during 2012 to become a fully operational parameter as from 2013. E-business In 2011 BravoSolution group revenue amounted to 55.5 million euro, an increase of 3.4% from 2010 (53.7 million euro). EBITDA was 6.8 million euro, as in 2010, while EBIT was 2.7 million euro (2.9 million euro). Profit before tax was 2.2 million euro (2.6 million euro) and profit for the year was 1.1 million euro (1.4 million euro). Profit margins were maintained thanks to the improvement in revenue and costs compatible with business levels. Specific action was taken to contain overheads, without penalizing the acquisition of resources active in operating efficiency, customer service and development of new markets. During the year the BravoSolution group confirmed its excellent commercial positioning as a supplier of customized software platforms and professional value-added services. In 2011 BravoSolution S.p.A. posted revenue of 24.6 million euro (+1.0%) and further growth in earnings, confirming its undisputed leadership on the Italian market. On a market where customers encountered operating and financial difficulties, BravoBus S.r.l., which operates on the e-sourcing market in the Italian local public transport area and serves public companies and institutions in the Rome area, reported a reduction in revenue (-20.5%), but a substantial breakeven. BravoSolution France, which in 2008 merged with Mobile Workers S.A. (a spend analysis company acquired in 2007), reported revenue of 9.1 million euro (+4.4%) and a profit for the eighth consecutive year. 59 www.italcementigroup.com After a revenue decline in 2009 and in 2010, BravoSolution Espana S.A. reported growth in 2011 (+14.7%), and also managed to improve earnings by containing costs and developing commercial operations in South and Central America to support the Mexican subsidiary and move on to the Brazilian market. In 2011, despite the difficult economic and financial conditions, BravoSolution UK continued to operate profitably on the British market, with a reduction in revenue (-6.2%), but posted a profit for the year. The group of companies headed by BravoSolution US (USA, Canada, UK) closed 2011 with consolidated revenue of 12.5 million euro, an increase of 7.4% from 2010, and positive EBITDA. The more recently established subsidiaries in Benelux, Mexico and China reported important growth in 2011. In February 2011, BravoSolution GmbH was established in Munich, to operate on German-speaking markets. The company began operations and posted its first revenue. BravoSolution do Brasil Servicos de Tecnologia Ltda, owned 99.99% by BravoSolution Mexico, was established in December as a commercial operation on the Brazilian market to begin work in 2012 with a tender for the Rio Olympics in 2016. Disputes and pending proceedings A summary of the main current disputes is provided below. Further details are provided in the notes (note 20). Europe Regarding the investigation begun in November 2008 by the European Commission into some cement producers, including Italcementi S.p.A. and the subsidiaries Ciments Français S.A., Ciments Calcia S.A. and Compagnie des Ciments Belges S.A., in December 2010 the European Commission notified the decision for the formal opening of the proceeding to Italmobiliare S.p.A. (and, indirectly through Italmobiliare, to the above-named Group companies and the Spanish subsidiary Financiera Y Minera). In April 2011, the Commission served a further formal notice on Italmobiliare of its decision to request extensive additional economic, financial and commercial information. Italmobiliare provided the information within the required term and, simultaneously, lodged an appeal with the EU General Court against the decision. Both the investigation and the proceedings are still underway. Turkey As a result of the non-closure of the 2008 agreement for the sale of the Turkish operations (Set Group) by Ciments Français to Sibcem, a number of proceedings are pending. Sibconcord, the main shareholder of Sibcem, has begun a proceeding in Russia to annul the agreement. On September 26, 2011, the ruling annulling the contract obtained in first instance by Sibconcord against which Ciments Français filed an appeal become effective. After an unsuccessful petition to the regional court of cassation, Ciments Français filed an appeal with the Russian Supreme Court. In December 2011, on the 60 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 basis of the favorable ruling obtained in Russia, Sibconcord filed for compulsory execution in Kazakhstan, which was rejected by the courts in January 2012. Sibconcord has appealed against this ruling. As contemplated by the contract, Ciments Français began arbitration proceedings (in Istanbul) in accordance with the regulation of the International Chamber of Commerce. On December 7, 2010, it obtained a favorable arbitration award recognizing the validity of the resolution of the contract by Ciments Français with the right to retain the 50 million euro paid by Sibcem. On May 31, 2011, Sibcem obtained the annulment of the arbitration award from the territorially competent Turkish court; Ciments Français filed an appeal and in the meantime continued proceedings for the recognition of the award in a number of countries. Significant events after December 31, 2011 In February, Ciments Français and the subsidiary Parcib s.a.s. signed an agreement with Cimsa Cimento Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. for the sale of the outstanding 51% of the capital of Afyon Cimento Sanayii Turk A.S.. The overall value of the sale has been determined as 57,530,000 Turkish lire, equivalent to approximately 25 million euro. The transfer of the shares and the payment will take place at closing, once the necessary approval has been obtained from the Antitrust Authority and all the conditions of the agreement have been fulfilled. The closing price will be subject to the usual contractual adjustment conditions. With the closing of this sale and following the sale of Set Group, the Group will have no further operations on the Turkish market as a cement producer. 61 www.italcementigroup.com Outlook The markets on which the Group operates should be relatively stable in 2012. Sales volumes will be slightly below the 2011 levels, with positive performance in North America and Morocco offsetting in part the slowdown expected on markets in Southern Europe and Italy. Sales prices should be positive, a trend already confirmed by performance in the early months of the year in Italy, Egypt and the USA. Inflationary pressures on production costs should be outweighed by the improvements in industrial efficiency planned by the Group and already introduced in part. Consequently, foreseeable operating results for 2012 will be up on 2011. The Group’s expectations of an improvement could, however, by influenced by the effects of the political transition in Egypt and by the adverse meteorological conditions that have already occurred since the beginning of the year. In 2012 the Group launched a new program of investments intended to bring further improvements in its industrial operations in Italy and Bulgaria and raise production capacity in India and Morocco. The program will be funded with internal resources and is not expected to affect the Group’s capital and financial ratios.

Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 Notes The Italcementi S.p.A. consolidated financial statements as at and for the year to December 31, 2011, were approved by the Board of Directors on March 2, 2012. At the meeting the Board authorized publication of a press release dated March 2, 2012, containing key information from the financial statements. Italcementi S.p.A. is a legal entity established in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Italy. It has been listed on the Stock Exchange since 1925 and is subject to management and coordination by Italmobiliare S.p.A., whose key data from the most recently approved financial statements are provided in an annex to the parent’s separate financial statements. Italcementi S.p.A. and its subsidiaries form the “Italcementi Group”, an international player whose main lines of business are hydraulic binders, ready mixed concrete and aggregates. The Group is also active in other areas, some of which are instrumental to its core businesses: materials for the construction industry, transport, energy, engineering and e-business. The financial statements have been drawn up on a going-concern basis. Despite the difficult economic and financial situation, by virtue of the measures already in place to respond to the changes in demand, and its business and financial flexibility the Group has no material uncertainties about its ability to continue as a going concern . 1. Accounting policies 1.1. Statement of compliance with the IFRS These consolidated financial statements have been drawn up in compliance with the International Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRS) applicable at December 31, 2011, endorsed by the European Commission. In compliance with European Regulation no. 1606 of July 19, 2002, the policies adopted do not include the standards and interpretations published by the IASB and the IFRIC through December 31, 2011, that had not been endorsed by the European Union at that date. Since December 31, 2010, the following standards, amendments and interpretations endorsed by the European Union have come into force and have been applied in the 2011 financial statements: x IAS 24 revised “Related party disclosures” which simplifies disclosure requirements relating to related parties in which public entities are present and provides a new definition of related parties that also includes the subsidiaries of associates and joint ventures. x Amendment to IAS 32 “Financial instruments presentation” regarding classification of rights issues. The changes permit classification of rights issues (e.g., options and warrants) as equity instruments independently of the currency in which the exercise price is denominated. x Amendment to IFRS 1 “First-time adoption of IFRS” and the related amendment to IFRS 7 “Financial instruments: disclosures” relating to the exemption from comparative disclosure allowed by IFRS 7 on firsttime adoption. The amendment exempts the reporting entity, on first-time adoption of IFRS, from providing the comparative data required by IFRS 7 for fair value measurement and liquidity risk. x Amendments to a number of IAS/IFRS/IFRIC as part of the improvement of the same: IFRS 1 “First-time adoption of IFRS”, IFRS 3 “Business combinations”, IFRS 7 “Financial instruments: disclosures”, IAS 1 “Presentation of financial statements”, IAS 27 “Consolidated and separate financial statements”, IAS 34 “Interim financial reporting”, IFRIC 13 “Customer loyalty programs”. The above changes had no material effects for the Group. x Amendment to IFRIC 14 “Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement” governing cases where an entity subject to a minimum funding requirement on defined benefit plans, makes prepayments to guarantee the 71 www.italcementigroup.com limits in question. The benefits arising from the prepayments may be recognized as assets. This case does not apply to the Group. x IFRIC 19 “Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments” which provides guidelines for accounting treatment of extinction of a financial liability through issue of own equity instruments. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability to be extinguished and the initial measurement of the equity instruments to be issued must be reflected in the income statement. The application of the new standards, amendments and interpretations has not had a material impact on the Group’s annual accounts. At December 31, 2011, the European Union had approved an amendment to IFRS 7 “Financial instruments: disclosures” concerning disclosures to be made on the transfer of financial assets. This amendment is not yet in effect and the Group has not elected early application. It will be applicable as from the financial statements as at and for the year ending December 31, 2012, and will not have a material effect on the Group accounts. Standards, amendments and interpretations published by the IASB but not yet endorsed by the European Union are: x Amendment to IAS 1 “Presentation of financial statements” relating to the presentation of other components recognized under equity. x Amendment to IAS 12 “Income taxes” with reference to deferred tax: recovery of underlying assets. x Amendments to IAS 19 “Employee benefits”. The main change is the elimination of the “corridor” for defined benefit plans with obligatory immediate and full recognition of actuarial gains and losses in the statement of comprehensive income. x Review of IAS 27 “Consolidated and separate financial statements” and IAS 28 “Investments in associates”. x Amendment to IAS 32 “Financial instruments presentation”, offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. x Amendments to IFRS 1 “First-time adoption of IFRS” for situations subsequent to hyperinflationary periods and suppression of fixed dates on first-time adoption. x IFRS 10 “Consolidated financial statements”. This new standard replaces IAS 27 “Consolidated and separate financial statements” with regard to consolidated financial statements. IAS 27 has been renamed “Separate financial statements” and deals exclusively with preparation of separate financial statements. x IFRS 11 “Joint arrangements”. The new standard replaces IAS 31 “Interests in joint ventures”, and identifies two categories of arrangement, with separate accounting treatments. x IFRS 12 “ Disclosure of interests in other entities” which re-organizes and supplements disclosures on subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and other equity investments. x IFRS 13 “Fair value measurement”. This new standard provides guidelines for measurement and disclosure of fair value. x IFRIC 20 “Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine”. 1.2. Accounting policies and basis of presentation The consolidated accounts adopt the cost principle, with the exception of derivatives and financial assets held for trading or for sale, which are stated at fair value. The carrying amounts of hedged assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in fair value on the basis of the hedged risks. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro. All amounts in the accounting schedules and in the notes are rounded to thousands of euro, unless otherwise specified. 72 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 The basis of presentation of the Group financial statements is as follows: Ɣ current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities are presented as separate classifications on the face of the statement of financial position. Current assets, which include cash and cash equivalents, are assets that the Group intends to realize, sell or consume during its normal business cycle; current liabilities are liabilities that the Group expects to settle during the normal business cycle or in the twelve months after the end of the reporting period; Ɣ on the income statement, costs are analyzed by the nature of the expense; Ɣ with regard to comprehensive income, the Group presents two statements: the first statement reflects traditional income statement components and the profit (loss) for the period, while the second statement, beginning with the profit (loss) for the period, presents other components of comprehensive income, previously reflected only in the statement of changes in consolidated equity: fair value gains/losses on available-for-sale financial assets and derivatives, currency translation differences; Ɣ on the statement of cash flows, the indirect method is used. Use of estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the notes in conformity with the international financial reporting policies requires management to make discretional assessments and estimates that affect the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense, such as amortization, depreciation and provisions, and the disclosures on contingent assets and liabilities in the notes. Since these estimates are determined on a going-concern basis, using the information available at the time, they could diverge from the actual future results. This is particularly evident in the present financial and economic crisis, which could generate situations diverging from those estimated today and require currently unforeseeable adjustments, including adjustments of a material nature, to the carrying amounts of the items in question. Assumptions and estimates are particularly sensitive with regard to measurement of non-current assets, which depend on forecasts of future results and cash flows, measurement of contingent liabilities, provisions for disputes and restructurings and commitments in respect of pension plans and other long-term benefits. Management conducts regular reviews of assumptions and estimates, and immediately recognizes any adjustments in the financial statements. Given that the Italcementi Group applies IAS 34 “Interim financial reporting” to its half-year reports, with consequent identification of a six-month interim period, any reductions in amounts are recorded at closure of the half year. 1.3. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements are based on the statements of the parent Italcementi S.p.A. and the consolidated companies as at and for the year ended December 31 2011. Where necessary, the financial statements are adjusted to ensure alignment with the Group’s classification criteria and accounting policies. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are companies in which the Group has the power to determine, directly or indirectly, administrative and management decisions and to obtain the benefits thereof. Generally speaking, control is assumed to exist when the Group holds, directly or indirectly, more than one half of voting rights, including potential voting rights deriving from convertible securities. Subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis as from the date at which control is obtained and until control is transferred out of the Group. 73 www.italcementigroup.com Associates Associates are companies in which the Group has significant influence over administrative and management decisions even though it does not hold control. Generally speaking, significant influence is assumed to exist when the Group holds, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of voting rights or, even if it holds a lower percentage of voting rights, when it is entitled to take part in financial and management policy decisions by virtue of a specific juridical status including, but not limited to, participation in voting trusts or other forms of material exercise of rights of governance. Investments in associates are measured using the equity method, whereby they are recognized initially at cost, and subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s interest in the associate’s equity. The Group’s share of an associate’s profit or loss is recognized in a specific income statement line item from the date at which the Group exerts significant influence until it relinquishes such influence. Joint ventures Joint ventures are companies whose business operations are controlled by the Group jointly with one or more other parties, under contractual arrangements. Joint control presupposes that strategic, financial and management decisions are taken with the unanimous consent of the parties that control the venture. Interests in joint ventures are consolidated on a proportionate basis, whereby assets, liabilities, income and expense are recognized proportionately to the Group’s interest. The equity and income of joint ventures are consolidated from the date on which joint control is assumed and until such control is relinquished. Transactions eliminated during consolidation All intragroup balances and transactions, including any unrealized gains in respect of third parties, are eliminated. Unrealized losses deriving from intragroup transactions are eliminated, except in cases where it will not subsequently be possible to recover such losses. Unrealized gains deriving from transactions with associates are eliminated against the equity investment carrying amount, while losses are eliminated proportionately to the Group’s interest, unless it will not subsequently be possible to recover such losses. Scope of consolidation A list of the companies consolidated on a line-by-line basis, on a proportionate basis and with the equity method is provided in the annex to these notes. Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations are classified as such when their carrying amount will be recovered chiefly through sale rather than through continuing use; such operations must be an important autonomous business operation or geographical area of operation. The conditions indicated are deemed to exist when the sale is considered highly likely and the assets and liabilities are immediately available for sale in their current condition. Available-for-sale assets are recognized at the lower of net carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Once property, plant and equipment and intangible assets have been classified as available-for-sale, no further amortization and depreciation may be applied. In the consolidated income statement, profit (loss) relating to discontinued operations, together with profit or loss from fair value measurement net of costs to sell and the profit or loss arising from the sale of the operation, are reflected in a single item separately from profit (loss) relating to continuing operations. Cash flows relating to discontinued operations are shown separately in the statement of cash flows. A similar disclosure is also presented for the comparative period. 74 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 1.4 Business combinations On first-time adoption of the IFRS, as allowed by IFRS 1, the Group elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations that took place before January 1, 2004. Until December 31, 2009, business combinations were accounted for with the purchase method in IFRS 3. Since January 1, 2010, business combinations have been accounted for with the acquisition method in IFRS3 revised. Cost of business combinations Under IFRS 3 revised, acquisition cost is the sum of the acquisition-date fair value of the contingent consideration and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired entity. For each business combination, any non-controlling interests in the acquired entity must be measured at fair value or in proportion to their interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity. IFRS 3 revised provides that costs relating to the acquisition be expensed in the periods in which they are incurred and the services are received. Allocation of the cost of business combinations Goodwill is measured as the positive difference between: x the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired entity, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquired entity, with respect to x the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. If the difference is negative, it is recognized in the income statement. If on initial recognition the acquisition cost of a business combination can only be determined provisionally, the allocated amounts are adjusted within twelve months of the acquisition date (measurement period). Business combinations achieved in stages When a business combination is achieved in stages, through a series of share purchases, for each transaction the fair value of the previously held interest is re-determined and any gain or loss is taken to the income statement. Changes in equity interests in subsidiaries Acquisitions of additional shares after acquisition of control do not require re-determination of identifiable asset and liability amounts. The difference between the cost and the acquired equity interest is recognized as equity attributable to owners of the parent. Transactions that reduce the percentage interest held without loss of control are treated as sales to non-controlling interests and the difference between the interest sold and the price paid is recognized in equity attributable to owners of the parent. Purchase commitments on non-controlling interests A put option granted to non-controlling interests of a company controlled by the Group is initially recognized by recording the acquisition amount as a liability, since the amount in question is the present value of the put option exercise price. The complementary acquisition of non-controlling interests with put options is in the financial statements: Ɣ the non-controlling interests are reclassified under liabilities and the difference between the fair value of the purchase commitment liabilities and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests is recognized under equity attributable to owners of the parent; Ɣ subsequent changes in liabilities are recognized under equity attributable to owners of the parent with the exception of adjustments to the present value, which are taken to the income statement. 75 www.italcementigroup.com 1.5 Translation of foreign currency items The functional currency of the subsidiaries located outside the euro zone is usually the local currency. Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are initially translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate at the transaction date. At the reporting date, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated to the functional currency at the closing rate. Exchange rate gains and losses are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities measured at cost are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the transaction date; those measured at fair value are translated with the exchange rate at the date fair value was determined. Translation of the financial statements of foreign entities At the reporting date, the assets, including goodwill, and liabilities of consolidated companies that report in currencies other than the euro are translated to the presentation currency of the Group’s consolidated financial statements at the exchange rate ruling at such date. Income statement items are translated at the average rate for the period. Gains and losses arising from the translation of opening equity at the closing rates and those arising from the different method used to translate profit or loss for the period are recognized in a specific equity caption. In the event of subsequent disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative translation differences are taken to the income statement. As allowed under IFRS 1, cumulative translation differences at the date of first-time adoption of the IFRS have been reclassified in “Retained earnings” under equity and therefore will not be taken to the income statement in the event of subsequent disposal. 1.6 Property, plant and equipment Recognition and measurement Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes the purchase or production cost and the directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and the conditions required for its operation. Production cost includes the cost of materials and direct labor costs. Finance costs relating to the purchase, construction and production of qualifying assets are capitalized. The carrying amount of some assets existing at the IFRS first-time adoption date of January 1, 2004, reflects revaluations applied in prior periods in connection with specific local laws, based on the real economic value of the assets in question. Assets acquired through business combinations are stated at fair value, determined on a provisional basis at the acquisition date and subsequently adjusted within the following twelve months. Subsequent to initial recognition, property, plant and equipment are carried at cost and depreciated over the asset’s useful life, less any impairment losses. Assets under construction are recognized at cost; depreciation begins when the assets enter useful life. When an asset consists of components with a significant cost and different useful lives, initial recognition and subsequent measurement are carried out separately for each component. Subsequent expense Repair and maintenance expense is normally recognized as incurred. Component replacement costs are treated as separate assets and carrying amount of the replaced component is expensed. 76 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 Depreciation Depreciation is generally calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each component of an asset. Land is not depreciated, with the exception of land used for quarrying operations. Asset useful life determines the depreciation rate until a subsequent review of residual useful life. The useful life range adopted for the various categories of assets is disclosed in the notes. Quarries Costs for the preparation and excavation of land to be quarried are amortized as the economic benefits of such costs are obtained. Quarry land is depreciated at rates reflecting the quantities extracted in the period in relation to the estimated total to be extracted over the period in which the quarry is to be worked. The Group makes specific provision for quarry environmental restoration obligations. Since the financial resources required to settle such obligations are directly related to the degree of use, the charge cannot be defined at inception with a balancing entry to the asset cost, but is provided to reflect the degree of use of the quarry. 1.7 Leases Finance leases, which substantially transfer to the Group all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset, are recognized from the lease inception date at the lower of the leased asset fair value or the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs and reductions against the residual liability so as to obtain a constant rate of interest on the outstanding liability. The policies used for depreciation and subsequent measurement of leased assets are consistent with those used for the Group’s own property, plant and equipment. Leases where all risks and rewards incidental to ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 1.8 Investment property Investment property is land and/or buildings held to earn rental income and/or for capital appreciation, rather than for use in the production or supply of goods and services. Investment property is initially recognized at cost, including costs directly attributable to the purchase. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured at amortized cost, based on asset useful life less any impairment losses. 1.9 Goodwill Goodwill recognized in accordance with IFRS 3 revised is allocated to the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies created by the acquisition. Goodwill is stated at the original value less any impairment losses identified as a result of tests conducted on an annual basis or more frequently if indications of impairment emerge. When goodwill is allocated to a cash-generating unit part of whose assets are disposed of, the goodwill associated with the sold assets is taken into account when determining the gain or loss arising from the transaction. 1.10. Intangible assets Intangible assets purchased separately are capitalized at cost, while those acquired through business combinations are recognized at provisionally estimated fair value at the acquisition date and adjusted where necessary within the following twelve months. 77 www.italcementigroup.com Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost amortized over the asset’s useful life. Other than goodwill, the Group has not identified intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. 1.11. Impairment Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indications of impairment emerge. Property, plant and equipment and investment property, and amortizable intangible assets, are tested for recoverability if indications of impairment emerge. Impairment is the difference between the asset carrying amount and its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the greater of fair value, less costs to sell, of an asset or cash-generating unit, and its value in use, determined as the present value of future cash flows. Fair value less costs to sell is determined through application of relevant valuation models adopting appropriate income multipliers, quoted share prices on an active market for similar enterprises, comparable transactions on similar assets or other available fair value indicators applicable to the assets being measured. In determining value in use, assets are measured at the level of cash-generating units on a continuing operations basis. Estimated future cash flows are discounted at a rate determined for each cash-generating unit using the weighted average cost of capital method (WACC). If an impairment loss on an asset other than goodwill subsequently reverses in full or in part, the asset carrying amount is increased to reflect the new estimated recoverable amount, which may not exceed the amount that would have been reflected in the absence of the impairment loss. Impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses are taken to the income statement. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed. 1.12. Financial assets All financial assets are recognized initially at cost at the trade date. Cost corresponds to fair value plus additional costs attributable to the purchase. Subsequent to initial recognition, assets held for trading are classified as current financial assets and carried at fair value; any gains or losses are taken to the income statement. Held–to-maturity investments are classified as current financial assets, if they mature within one year; otherwise they are classified as non-current assets and subsequently carried at amortized cost. Amortized cost is determined using the effective interest rate method, taking account of any acquisition discounts or premiums, which are apportioned over the entire period until maturity, less any impairment losses. Other financial assets are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value. Any gains or losses are shown in a separate equity caption until the assets are sold, recovered or discontinued, or until they are found to be impaired, in which case the cumulative gains or losses in equity are taken to the income statement. Equity instruments that are not listed on an active market and whose fair value cannot be measured reliably are carried at cost. 1.13. Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of purchase/production cost (using the weighted average cost method) and net realizable value. Purchase cost includes costs incurred to bring assets to their present location, less allowances for obsolete and slow-moving items. Production cost of finished goods and semi-finished goods includes the cost of raw materials, direct labor and a portion of general production costs, determined on the basis of normal plant operations. Financial costs are not included. The net realizable value of raw material, consumables and supplies is their replacement cost. 78 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 The net realizable value of finished goods and semi-finished goods is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated cost of completion and estimated costs to sell. 1.14. Trade receivables and other receivables Trade receivables and other receivables are stated at fair value plus transaction costs, less allowances for uncollectible amounts, which are provided as doubtful debts are identified. Derecognition of financial assets: The Group derecognizes all or part of the financial assets when: Ɣ the contractual rights on the assets in question have expired; Ɣ it transfers the near totality of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset or does not transfer and does not even substantially maintain all the risks and rewards but transfers control of the assets. 1.15. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash on hand, bank demand deposits and other treasury investments with original maturity of not more than three months. Current account overdrafts are treated as financing and not as a component of cash and cash equivalents. The definition of cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows is identical to that in the statement of financial position. 1.16. Income taxes Current income taxes are provided in accordance with local tax laws in the countries where the Group operates. Deferred tax is recognized using the liability criterion, based on temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the statement of financial position. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which such differences, losses or credits may be reversed. Taxable or deductible temporary differences do not generate recognition of deferred tax liabilities or assets only in the following cases: Ɣ taxable temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, unless goodwill is taxdeductible; Ɣ taxable or deductible temporary differences arising from initial recognition of an asset or a liability in transactions that are not business combinations and affect neither accounting profit nor taxable profit at the transaction date; Ɣ equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures when: a) the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the taxable temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; b) it is not probable that the deductible temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and that taxable income will be available against which the temporary difference can be used; Ɣ deferred tax assets are reviewed at the end of every reporting period and reduced to the extent that sufficient taxable income is no longer likely to be available in the future against which the assets can be used in full or in part. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined at tax rates expected to apply when the deferred tax asset (liability) is realized (settled), based on rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. Taxes relating to items recognized directly in equity are recognized in equity, not in the income statement. 79 www.italcementigroup.com Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are not discounted to present value. 1.17. Employee benefits The Group operates pension plans, post-employment medical benefit plans and post-employment benefits. It also has other commitments, in the form of bonuses payable to employees on the basis of length of service in some Group companies (“Other long-term benefits”). Defined contribution plans Defined contribution plans are structured post-employment benefit programs where the Group pays fixed contributions to an insurance company or pension fund and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not dispose of sufficient assets to pay all the employee benefits accruing in respect of services rendered during the current year and in previous years. These contributions are paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees and recognized as expense as incurred. Defined benefit plans Defined benefit plans are structured post-employment benefit programs that constitute a future obligation for the Group. In substance, the company assumes the actuarial and investment risks of the plan. In accordance with IAS 19, the Group uses the unit credit projection method to determine the present value of obligations and the related current service cost. These actuarial calculations require use of consistent and objective actuarial assumptions about demographic variables (mortality rate, personnel turnover rate) and financial variables (discount rate, future increases in salaries and medical benefits). When a defined benefit plan is funded in full or in part by contributions paid to a fund that is a separate legal entity or to an insurance company, the plan assets are estimated at fair value. Benefit obligations are therefore recognized net of the fair value of the plan assets that will be used to settle the obligations. The post-employment benefits of Italian companies (TFR, trattamento di fine rapporto) are treated in the same way as benefit obligations arising from defined benefit plans. Termination benefits Termination benefits include provisions for restructuring costs recognized when the Group company in question has approved a detailed formal plan that has already been implemented or notified to the third parties concerned. Actuarial gains and losses Actuarial gains and losses on post-employment defined benefit plans may arise as a result of changes in the actuarial assumptions used in two consecutive periods or as a result of changes in the obligation value or in the fair value of any plan asset in respect of the actuarial assumptions used at the beginning of the period. The Group uses the corridor method whereby actuarial gains and losses are recognized as income or expense when their unrecognized cumulative net value, for each plan, at the end of the previous period exceeds 10% of the greater of present value of the defined benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets at that date. These gains or losses are taken to profit or loss over the estimated average residual working life of the employees participating in the plans. Actuarial gains and losses relating to “Other long-term benefits” (service medals, length of service benefits) and to early retirement benefits are recognized as income or expense immediately. 80 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 Past service cost Changes in liabilities resulting from a change to an existing defined benefit plan are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over an average period until the benefits have vested. Costs for benefits that vest immediately upon changes to a plan are recognized as expense as incurred. Curtailment and settlement Gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognized as income or expense when the curtailment or settlement occurs. The gain or loss includes changes in the present value of the obligation, changes in the fair value of plan assets, actuarial gains or losses and past service costs not previously accounted for. At the curtailment or settlement date, the obligation and the fair value of the plan assets are re-measured using current actuarial assumptions. 1.18. Share-based payments The Group has applied IFRS 2 as from January 1, 2004. Options for the subscription and purchase of shares granted by Group companies to employees and directors give rise to recognition of a cost classified under employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity. In accordance with IFRS 2, only options granted after November 7, 2002, whose rights had not vested at December 31, 2003, have been measured and recognized at the transition date. Options for the subscription and purchase of shares are measured at fair value at the grant date and amortized over the vesting period. Fair value is determined using the binomial method, and taking account of dividends. Future volatility is determined on the basis of historic market prices, after adjustment for extraordinary events or factors. The cost of granted options is reviewed on the basis of the actual number of options that have vested at the beginning of the exercise period. 1.19. Provisions for risks and charges The Group recognizes provisions for risks and charges when a present legal or constructive obligation arises as a result of a past event, the amount of which can be reliably estimated, and use of resources is probable to settle the obligation. Provisions reflect the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation or transfer it to third parties at the reporting date. If the present value of the financial resources that will be used is material, provisions are determined by discounting expected future cash flows at a rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is performed, movements in provisions due to the effect of time or changes in interest rates are recognized in financial items. Changes in estimates are recognized in the income statement for the period. The Group recognizes a separate provision for environmental restoration obligations on land used for quarry work, determined in relation to the use of the quarry in question. Pending publication of a standard/interpretation on accounting treatment of greenhouse gas emission allowances, after the withdrawal of IFRIC 3 by the International Accounting Standards Board, the Group recognizes a separate provision when emissions are greater than the allowance. 1.20. Loans and borrowings Loans and borrowings are initially recognized at the fair value of the consideration paid/received less charges directly attributable to the financial asset/liability. After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. 81 www.italcementigroup.com 1.21. Trade payables and other payables Trade payables and other payables are stated at the fair value of the original consideration received. 1.22. Derivatives The Group uses derivatives such as foreign currency forward contracts and interest-rate swaps and options to hedge currency and interest-rate risks. Derivatives are measured and recognized at fair value. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined on the basis of the current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest-rate contracts is determined on the basis of discounted flows using the zero coupon curve. Hedging transactions Derivatives are designated as hedging instruments or as non-hedging instruments. Transactions that qualify for application of hedge accounting are classified as hedging transactions; other transactions are designated as trading transactions, even if they are performed for the purposes of risk management. For accounting purposes, hedging transactions are classified as “fair value hedges” if they cover the risk of changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability; or as cash flow hedges” if they hedge cash flows arising from an existing asset or liability or from a future transaction, which are exposed to variability. With regard to fair value hedges, fair value gains and losses on the derivatives are taken to the income statement immediately. Similarly, the underlying assets or liabilities are measured at fair value and any gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk is recognized as an income or expense balancing entry. If the movement refers to an interest-bearing financial instrument, it is amortized in the income statement until maturity. With regard to cash flow hedges (foreign currency forward contracts, fixed-rate interest swaps), the effective component of a change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is reflected in a separate equity caption, while time-based changes and the non-effective hedge component are recognized in the income statement. The effective component and non-effective component are calculated using the methods indicated in IAS 39. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives designated for trading are recorded as income or expense. When the financial instrument matures, is sold, settled, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, the derivative is no longer treated as a hedging contract. In this case, gains or losses on the derivative are retained in equity until the hedged transaction takes place. If the Group no longer expects the hedged transaction to take place, the net gain or loss in equity is taken to the income statement. 1.23. Revenue, other revenue, interest income and dividends Sale of goods and services Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale of goods or rendering of services are collected by the Group and the amount in question can be reliably determined. Revenue is recognized at the fair value of the consideration received or due, taking account of any trade discounts given and volume discounts. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the company transfers the material risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the goods to the purchaser. Rental income Rental income is recognized as other revenue, as received. 82 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 Interest income Interest income is classified as finance income on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. Dividends Dividends are recognized as finance income as shareholders’ right to receive payment arises, in accordance with local laws. 1.24. Government grants Government grants are recognized when there is a reasonable certainty that they will be received and all the requirements on which receipt depends have been fulfilled. Grants related to the purchase or production of non-current assets (grants related to assets) are recognized as deferred income and taken to the income statement over the useful life of the underlying assets. 1.25. Management of capital The Group monitors its capital using the gearing ratio: net financial position/equity. The net financial position reflects financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets (as described in note 22). Equity consists of all the items presented in the statement of financial position. Group strategy aims to keep the gearing ratio at a level such as to ensure the smooth running of business operations, funding of investments and creation of maximum value for shareholders. To maintain or modify its capital structure, the Group may decide to vary the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, redeem capital, issue new shares, raise or reduce its investment in subsidiaries, purchase or sell investments. 83 www.italcementigroup.com 2.

Changes in the scope of consolidation Sale of operations in Turkey Through the subsidiary Ciments Français, on March 25, 2011, the Group sold the companies in Set Group Holding – Turkey; consequently the operations in question have been accounted for in compliance with IFRS 5 “Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations” presenting separate items in the income statement and the statement of cash flows reflecting the earnings and the cash flows arising from the sale. Also in compliance with IFRS 5, the amounts in the income statement and the statement of cash flows for 2010 have been restated accordingly. To ensure clarity, for comparative purposes the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income present both the information restated as required by IFRS 5 and as published in the 2010 consolidated financial statements. During 2011, through its subsidiary Ciments Français the Group reduced its controlling interest in the listed Turkish company Afyon Cimento from 76.5% to 51.0% for proceeds, net of tax, of 60.8 million euro; the difference between the carrying amount of the sold equity investment and the sum collected was recognized under equity attributable to owners of the parent. 84 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 Changes in the scope of consolidation The main changes in 2011 were: x the line-by-line consolidation of the Calcestruzzi group – Italy, as from January 1, 2011. At December 31, 2011, the Calcestruzzi group comprised the subsidiaries: Calcestruzzi S.p.A., Esa Monviso S.p.A. (consolidated on a line-by-line basis), the associates: Mantovana Inerti S.r.l. and Ecoinerti S.r.l. (consolidated on a proportionate basis) and the associates: General Cave S.r.l., Safra S.r.l. and Commerciale Inerti S.r.l. (accounted for with the equity method); x the withdrawal of Set Group Holding – Turkey and its subsidiaries: Set Cimento and Met Teknik Servis, after the sale to third parties on March 25, 2011; x the withdrawal of Bares and Italgen Elektrik – Turkey, after the sale to third parties on March 31, 2011; x the withdrawal, after the sale to third parties in December, of the six companies in the Axim group, active in additives for ready mixed concrete and cement in Italy, France, USA, Canada, Morocco and Spain. The main changes in 2010 were x the line-by-line consolidation as from January 1 of Beton Ata LLP (Kazakhstan) in the ready mixed concrete sector; x the withdrawal from the Group of Cementos Capa S.L. (Spain) after the sale in January; x the line-by-line consolidation as from August of the Star. Co. S.r.l. company (Italy) in the ready mixed concrete sector; x the measurement with the equity method of the Gardawind S.r.l. group (Italy) as from September 30. Gardawind is active in wind energy and is part of the Italgen group. The equity investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, and the respective method of consolidation, are listed in the annex. 85 www.italcementigroup.com 4. Operating segment disclosure The Group operating segments are: Italy France-Belgium Spain Others Central Western Europe (C.W.E.) Greece North America Egypt Morocco Others Emerging Europe, North Africa and Middle East (EE.NA.ME.) Bulgaria, Turkey, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia Thailand India Others Asia China and Kazakhstan Cement and clinker trading Other operations Cement & clinker trading includes cement and clinker marketing activities in countries where Group terminals are located: Gambia, Mauritania, Sri Lanka and Albania, as well as direct exports to markets not covered by Group subsidiaries. The “Other operations” segment comprises the operations of the Ciments Français S.A. sub-holding, consisting essentially of provision of services to subsidiaries. It also includes liquid and solid fuel procurement operations for Group companies, the BravoSolution in the e-business sector, Italcementi Finance S.A., other international holdings and other minor operations in Italy. The Group management and organizational structure essentially reflects the operating segment structure. Finance income and costs, impairment on financial assets and income taxes are not allocated to the operating segments. The Group business sectors are: x operations relating to the production and sale of cement/clinker, x operations relating to construction materials: ready mixed concrete and aggregates, x other operations such as: transport, engineering, e-business and energy. The operating segments and business sectors are organized and managed by country. The operating segments consist of the fixed assets of the individual entities located and operating in the countries indicated above; sales refer mainly to the local market, exports are generally with other Group entities; exports to external countries are conducted through the Group companies of the international Trading segment. Consequently the revenue of the entities in each operating segment, net of revenue within the Group, arise essentially in the areas in which the non-current assets are located. The cement/clinker business delivers a portion of its production to the ready mixed concrete segment. The transfer prices applied to trading of goods and services among the segments are regulated on the basis of arm’s length transactions. Consolidated cement/clinker revenue is present in all the operating segments with the exception of “Other operations”, which consists largely of fuel sales and e-business revenue. Consolidated ready mixed concrete and aggregates revenue is present in almost all the operating segments with the exception of: Bulgaria, India and China.

Assets under construction at December 31, 2011, was 458,245 thousand euro (511,629 thousand euro at December 31, 2010); the decrease for the year, in the line “Change and other”, related mainly to the reclassifications to the final categories of assets relating to the productions sites in Morocco, India, France/Belgium and North America. “Depreciation and impairment losses” includes net impairment losses arising from impairment losses of 36.3 million euro (8.0 million euro in 2010, of which 5.2 million euro largely in Egypt and Saudi Arabia) relating to production sites in Italy for 27.5 million euro, Bulgaria, North America and Spain. Property plant and equipment held under finance leases and rental contracts were carried at a net amount of 27.8 million euro at December 31, 2011 (27.7 million euro at December 31, 2010). They consist of plant and machinery for 25.3 million euro and buildings for 2.4 million euro. Expenses included under “Property, plant and equipment” amounted to 28.9 million euro at December 31, 2011 (58.7 million euro at December 31, 2010). Property plant and equipment pledged as security for bank loans were carried at 195.8 million euro at December 31, 2011 (200 million euro at December 31, 2010). The useful life adopted by the Group for the main asset categories is as follows: Civil and industrial buildings 10 – 33 years Plant and machinery 5 – 30 years Other property, plant and equipment 3 – 10 years The range between the above minimum and maximum limits indicates the presence of components with separate useful lives within each asset category. 91 www.italcementigroup.com 5.2 Investment property (in thousands of euro) Carrying amount at Dec. 31,10 33,098 Gross amount 58,147 Accumulated depreciation (25,049) Carrying amount at Dec. 31,10 33,098 Additions 150 Disposals (8,553) Depreciation and impairment losses (683) Translation differences (452) Reclassifications (103) Carrying amount at Dec.31,11 23,457 Gross amount 46,841 Accumulated depreciation (23,384) Carrying amount at Dec.31,11 23,457 Investment property is carried at cost net of amortization; fair value at December 31, 2011, was 114 million euro (134.3 million euro at December 31, 2010).

The companies in the Calcestruzzi group have been consolidated and treated as if they were being consolidated for the first time; consequently, in compliance with the acquisition method contemplated by IFRS 3 revised, they have been measured at fair value. The net assets of the Calcestruzzi group as at January 1, 2011, are stated at fair value estimated on the basis of market transactions with the assistance of a fairness opinion issued by an independent consultant. 92 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

The Group tests goodwill recoverability at least once a year or more frequently if indications of impairment emerge. The methods used to determine the recoverable amount of CGUs are described in the basis of consolidation under the section “Impairment” (note 1.11). The recovery slowdown that emerged in 2010 intensified during 2011, especially in the construction industry; consequently, while the measures contemplated in the 2010-2014 Business Plan remain valid, a number of macroeconomic and sector assumptions in the Plan have been reviewed. For the purposes of impairment testing, determination of the future cash flows to be used was based on the 2012 Budget and, where necessary for future year projections, on new assumptions and economic assessments deemed to reflect the new conditions on the Group markets. 93 www.italcementigroup.com As in 2010, for the CGUs in the EU countries and North America, a 9-year explicit forecast period was used; in this way we believe that projected cement consumption is structurally balanced and aligned with the related long-term estimate implicit in the cement structural demand curve for each country. For the CGUs in the emerging countries, also subject in part to a change in cyclical patterns compared with the recent past, but with cement consumption more likely to be influenced by exogenous factors relating to specific macroeconomic events, the tests were based on expected growth in cement demand over a five-year period. Terminal value was generally estimated on the basis of CGU activity on its mid-cycle market and takes account of the market cycle and the changes in the country in question after the explicit forecast period. The projections are management’s best estimate of future trends and possible economic conditions in the countries in which the Group operates. For all CGUs, recoverable value coincides with value in use, with the exception of the CGUs in Turkey and China, for which fair value less costs to sell, determined on the basis of comparable market transactions or offers received from third parties, was used. The discount rates, determined country by country, are obtained by applying the estimated long-term inflation rate, adjusted in some cases with the country-risk premium, to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). WACCs are computed on the basis of the market value of own funds and of sector debt, to which the mean sector coefficient based on the debt/stock market capitalization ratio is applied. The assumptions used for the computation for the CGUs in the main countries are set out below: Discount rate Growth rate (in %) before tax including inflation Cash-generating units by country 2011 2010 2011 2010 Italy 8.9 7.7 2.0 1.1 France/Belgium 9.4 8.7 2.0 1.1 Spain 9.3 8.5 2.0 1.0 Greece 14.0 11.0 2.0 1.2 North America 7.7 7.4 1.8 1.2 Egypt 13.2 13.4 5.0 6.0 Morocco 10.7 9.8 2.5 2.4 Kuwait 9.8 9.2 3.5 3.4 Thailand 10.6 9.5 3.5 2.5 India 14.5 12.3 6.3 5.0 Goodwill testing for 2011 generated a goodwill impairment loss of 54.4 million euro for Spain and of 12.1 million euro for Greece. The Group considered the specific potential risks of the sector of activity, any market values on the basis of comparable transactions and conducted a sensitivity analysis on recoverable amount in the event of an increase in the discount rates. 94 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 The table below sets out the most significant goodwill amounts for Group CGUs by country: (in thousands of euro) Carrying amount of goodwill Cash-generating units by country December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Italy* 31,664 26,519 France/Belgium 587,244 587,383 Spain 171,086 225,564 Greece 12,100 North America 144,728 140,398 Egypt 583,980 594,289 Morocco 108,327 107,679 Kuwait 29,277 24,706 Thailand 88,502 90,310 India 88,004 98,640 Others 86,476 109,026 Total 1,919,288 2,016,614 * in 2011 the Italy CGU comprised cement, ready mixed concrete and aggregates operations Finally, since the Italcementi Group has costs not allocated to individual CGUs, a second-level impairment test was conducted to check recoverability for the Group as a whole. The test included all assets and cash flows that cannot be specifically allocated to an individual CGU. No indications of impairment emerged from the test. Market capitalization Like most of the companies in the sector listed on markets in the mature countries, during the year Italcementi S.p.A. recorded a material reduction in market capitalization with respect to 2010, which has eased somewhat since December 31, 2011. Equally, the results of the impairment tests conducted at December 31, 2011, found a significant reduction in the Group’s aggregate recoverable value compared with the tests conducted in 2010; the decrease in recoverable value was, however, smaller than the reduction in market capitalization. The impairment tests take account of the long-term expectations in cement consumption that can be assumed from the structural demand curve and, for this reason, are less influenced overall by short-term changes. Shortterm changes, on the other hand, correspond to the timeframe now typically adopted by many investors and, together with the volatility in risk propensity levels, have an incisive influence on share prices, which are particularly sensitive during exceptional periods of financial panic such as the closing months of 2011. We therefore believe that the differential in relative evolution found in the two valuations, which in any case is consistent as indication of a trend, can be considered normal. 95 www.italcementigroup.com Sensitivity analysis With reference to the current and expected industry situation and to the results of the 2011 impairment tests, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on recoverable amount, using the discounted cash flow method. At December 31, 2011, a 1% increment in the WACC would determine a surplus difference in carrying amount with respect to recoverable amount for the following CGUs: Italy 41 million euro, Spain 59.1 million euro, Greece 9.0 million euro, North America 73.0 million euro and Kuwait 10.5 million euro. A 5% reduction in demand in the explicit forecast period with respect to the projections would determine a surplus difference in carrying amount with respect to recoverable amount for the following CGUs: Spain 19.7 million euro and Greece 5.4 million euro. On the basis of this analysis, the Group deems it unnecessary to reduce the goodwill of the CGUs in question. The discount rates that equate the CGUs’ recoverable amount with carrying amount are as follows: Italy 9.59%, Spain 9.3%, Greece 14.0%, North America 8.3% and Kuwait 9.9%. 7.

Employee benefits Employee benefits at December 31, 2011, amounted to 202,955 thousand euro (184,822 thousand euro at December 31, 2010). The Group’s main employee benefit plans are described below. Defined benefit plans The Group operates pension plans, post-employment medical benefit plans and post-employment benefit plans. The most important pension plans are in the USA and France; they are financed by contributions paid by the company and by employees to external entities responsible for the administration and management of the pension funds; early retirement schemes also operate, pursuant to local laws, in France and Belgium. With regard to the post-employment benefits for staff of the Group’s Italian companies (TFR), liabilities in respect of TFR accrued and optioned by employees as from 2007 no longer qualify as defined benefit plans. They are treated as quotas of defined contribution plans. Some Group companies in the USA operate plans providing post-employment medical and life insurance benefits. In France and, to a lesser extent, in Belgium similar benefits are provided for certain classes of workers, specifically the companies pay a portion of contributions to the insurance company, which then reimburses workers, after retirement, for a portion of medical expenses. In some companies in France and Italy, the Group also recognizes liabilities in respect of future commitments, in the form of bonuses payable to employees on the basis of length of service; these liabilities are measured with actuarial assumptions. Net liabilities for pension plans and post-employment benefit plans are determined with actuarial calculations performed by independent actuaries. 101 www.italcementigroup.com Net liabilities determined on the basis of actuarial calculations at December 31, 2011, are set out below: Pension plans and other longPost-employment medical Total term benefits benefits (in millions of euro) Dec.31, 11 Dec.31, 10 Dec.31, 11 Dec.31, 10 Dec.31, 11 Dec.31, 10 Discounted value of funded plans 148.9 129.7 148.9 129.7 Fair value of plan assets (88.1) (86.1) (88.1) (86.1) Discounted net value of funded plans 60.8 43.6 60.8 43.6 Discounted value of unfunded plans 66.9 71.0 91.0 81.7 157.9 152.7 Net value of obligation 127.7 114.6 91.0 81.7 218.7 196.3 Unrecognized actuarial losses (51.3) (29.5) (12.2) (5.8) (63.5) (35.3) Unrecognized past service costs (1.3) (1.6) (0.7) (0.5) (2.0) (2.1) Net liabilities 75.01 83.5 78.2 75.5 153.2 159.0 of which: Liabilities 75.4 84.0 78.2 75.5 153.6 159.4 Assets 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 Net (assets)/liabilities 75.0 83.5 78.2 75.5 153.2 159.0 With reference to “post-employment medical benefits”, a change of +/1 percentage point in the rates relating to changes in medical expenditure would generate changes of +0.4 and -0.3 million euro respectively in liabilities on the statement of financial position and +4.5 and -3.8 million euro respectively in related expense.

The Group is not aware of other disputes, legal controversies or other exceptional facts that might have a material impact on its financial position, results and operations. Europe Regarding the investigation begun in November 2008 by the European Commission into some cement producers, including Italcementi S.p.A. and the subsidiaries Ciments Français S.A., Ciments Calcia S.A. and Compagnie des Ciments Belges S.A., in December 2010 the European Commission notified the decision for the formal opening of the proceeding to Italmobiliare S.p.A. (and, indirectly through Italmobiliare, to the abovenamed Group companies and the Spanish subsidiary Financiera Y Minera). In April 2011, the Commission served a further formal notice on Italmobiliare of its decision to request extensive additional economic, financial and commercial information. Italmobiliare provided the information within the required term and, simultaneously, lodged an appeal with the EU General Court against the decision. Both the investigation and the proceedings are still underway. Regarding the proceeding begun in 2009 by the General Directorate of the Belgian Competition Authority against cement producers (including Compagnies des Ciments Belges (CCB), no further developments have taken place after the charges were formally notified in April 2010. The parties exchanged briefs and hearings took place. The Belgian Competition Authority is expected to make a decision in the first half of 2012. Turkey As a result of the non-closure of the 2008 agreement for the sale of the Turkish operations (Set Group) by Ciments Français to Sibcem, a number of proceedings are pending. Sibconcord, the main shareholder of Sibcem, has begun a proceeding in Russia to annul the agreement. On September 26, 2011, the ruling annulling the contract obtained in first instance by Sibconcord against which Ciments Français filed an appeal become effective. After an unsuccessful petition to the regional court of cassation, Ciments Français filed an appeal with the Russian Supreme Court. In December 2011, on the basis 105 www.italcementigroup.com of the favorable ruling obtained in Russia, Sibconcord filed for compulsory execution in Kazakhstan, which was rejected by the courts in January 2012. Sibconcord has appealed against this ruling. As contemplated by the contract, Ciments Français began arbitration proceedings (in Istanbul) in accordance with the regulation of the International Chamber of Commerce. On December 7, 2010, it obtained a favorable arbitration award recognizing the validity of the resolution of the contract by Ciments Français with the right to retain the 50 million euro paid by Sibcem. On May 31, 2011, Sibcem obtained the annulment of the arbitration award from the territorially competent Turkish court; Ciments Français filed an appeal and in the meantime continued proceedings for the recognition of the award in a number of countries. India On the proceedings begun in 2006 by the Indian Antitrust Authority, Zuari Cement Ltd. has drawn up its defense. No new developments took place. For the investigation begun in August 2010 by the Indian Antitrust Authority against cement producers, including the Zuari Cement Ltd. and Sri Vishnu Cement companies, for alleged unfair trading, no developments took place after the response to the request for information. At the end of 2007, Zuari signed a contract with Larsen & Toubro (L&T) concerning civil and mechanical works for the Yerraguntla cement plant. During execution of the contract, L&T requested an additional amount for alleged extra costs and extended duration of work. In turn, the contract awarder, Zuari Cement, presented a request for compensation of 29 million euro including penalties for delays and breaches in execution of the work; also, in July 2011, Zuari Cement terminated the contract for non-fulfillment. In August 2011 L&T sent Zuari a request for arbitration followed in January 2012 by a request for compensation of 31 million euro. The proceeding, which is taking place in India, is still underway. 21.

Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 Italcementi S.p.A. has been assigned a public rating since 2006, by the Moody’s and Standards & Poors ratings agencies. At December 31, 2011, the rating was, respectively, Ba1 outlook negative-NP and BBBoutlook negative-A3. During 2011 the ratings were reviewed on, respectively, September 14, 2011, by Standards & Poor’s, which confirmed the rating and downgraded the outlook from stable to negative, and December 15, 2011, by Moody’s, which downgraded the long-term rating from Baa3 to Ba1, outlook negative.

Bank loans and drawings on lines of credit: a) On April 29, 2011, Italcementi Finance S.A. arranged a 50 million euro floating-rate five-year bilateral line of credit, guaranteed by Italcementi S.p.A.. No drawings had been made at December 31, 2011; b) During 2011, Italcementi Finance S.A. arranged bilateral lines of credit with leading international banks for a total amount of 200 million euro at 364 days. No drawings had been made at December 31, 2011; c) During 2010, Italcementi S.p.A. arranged a three-year line of credit for an original amount of 100 million euro, subsequently reduced to 25 million euro after the counterparty joined the syndicated line of credit headed by Italcementi Finance S.A. No drawings had been made at December 31, 2011; d) in the third quarter of 2010, Italcementi Finance S.A. was granted a five-year floating-rate 920 million euro syndicated line of credit guaranteed by Italcementi S.p.A. The group of banks was coordinated by Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Intesa Sanpaolo, Natixis, Société Générale, The Royal Bank of Scotland and Unicredit. The arrangement of the syndicated line of credit extinguished the similar facility for 700 million euro granted to Ciments Français S.A. in May 2005. 109 www.italcementigroup.com No drawings had been made on the syndicated line of credit at December 31, 2011; e) On November 30, 2010, Zuari Cement Ltd. refinanced a 4.2 billion rupee amortizable syndicated line of credit, negotiating bilateral lines of credit with a pool of international banks for a total amount of 5.1 billion Indian rupees, repayable in five years. It also arranged a bilateral line of credit repayable in five years for 20 million US dollars (approximately 900 million rupees). Full drawings had been made on these long-term facilities at December 31, 2011. Bond loans f) The Italcementi Group covers its financial requirements through recourse to diversified instruments. It covers its long-term financing requirements largely through bond issues. Specifically, Italcementi S.p.A. has launched a Euro Medium Term Notes program (EMTN) targeting qualified investors on the European market, for a maximum amount of 2 billion euro. This replaces the program previously in operation at Ciments Français S.A.. The launch of the program, on March 9, 2010, is part of a broader project to optimize management of financial operations, under which Italcementi S.p.A. has been assigned a greater role as parent responsible for the coordination and direct implementation of financing programs for all Group operations. Under this program, on March 16, 2010, Italcementi Finance S.A., a French subsidiary of Italcementi S.p.A., closed the placement of a ten-year bond loan at a fixed rate of 5.375%, for a nominal value of 750 million euro. The bond, guaranteed by Italcementi S.p.A., is listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The program reference material was renewed on June 30, 2011. The placement was managed by Banca IMI, BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Société Générale and Unicredit. The proceeds from the issue have been transferred to Italcementi S.p.A. and Ciments Français S.A. through medium/long-term intercompany loans for 210 million euro and 540 million euro respectively. The terms and issue conditions of the program include a coupon step-up clause for 125 basis points should the rating go beneath “investment grade”. After the downgrade of the Moody’s rating on December 15, 2011, the clause will be applied as from the next annual coupon due on March 19, 2013. At December 2011, Italcementi S.p.A had effected a partial repurchase of the bonds for an overall nominal value of 11 million euro; g) Ciments Français S.A. covers its long-term financial requirements largely through Italcementi Finance S.A., the company that coordinates and implements programs to provide funding for the entire Italcementi Group. Consequently, it has not renewed the EMTN program reference material since July 17, 2008. The maximum amount authorized under this program is 1,500 million euro. At December 31, 2011, notes issued under the program totaled 515 million euro, including 500 million euro issued on March 21, 2007, assisted by ABN Amro, Natixis and The Royal Bank of Scotland, at a fixed rate of 4.75% with a ten year maturity; h) on February 24, 2010, Ciments Français S.A. launched an offer for holders of its 2002 and 2006 US private placements to repurchase any and all outstanding notes. It also reached an agreement with the note holders permitting it to borrow funds from the parent Italcementi S.p.A. and from subsidiaries of the parent. On April 7, 2010, the offer obtained an uptake for a nominal value of 183.5 million US dollars out of a total 200 million US dollars of notes issued in 2002, and for a nominal value of 300 million US dollars out of a total of 300 million US dollars of notes issued in 2006. Ciments Français S.A. repurchased all the tendered notes at a price of 1,065 US dollars for each note with a nominal value of 1,000 US dollars, in addition to accrued interest. The amount was paid on April 14, 2010. The remaining notes for 16.5 million US dollars relate to the ten-year issue of 110 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 November 15, 2002, at a fixed rate of 5.63%. They continue to be regulated by the issue contracts and related supplementary agreements; Billets de Trésorerie issue program i) On October 17, 2011, Italcementi Finance S.A. was authorized by the Bank of France to issue a Billets de Trésorerie program for a maximum amount of 800 million euro. The program, guaranteed by Italcementi S.p.A., has an NP Moody’s rating and an A3 Standards & Poors rating. The operation was managed by Natixis, with Bred Banque Populaire, Credit Agricole CIB, Credit Industriel et Commercial, HSBC France, ING Belgium S.A., Natixis and Société Générale as bookrunners. The program was granted a STEP label on October 24, 2011. The program (reference number #0002214) meets the criteria of the STEP market convention. Main intragroup relations j) In 2011, after finalization of a bilateral bank line of credit arranged by Italcementi Finance S.A., Italcementi S.p.A. obtained from Italcementi Finance S.A. a 50 million euro five-year renewable line of credit. No drawings had been made on the line at December 31, 2011; k) In the third quarter of 2011, Ciments Français S.A. obtained a 200 million euro short-term line of credit from Italcementi Finance S.A. maturing on July 31, 2012, replacing the previous facilities at 364 days. No drawings had been made on the line at December 31, 2011; l) In the first half of 2010, concomitantly with the Italcementi Finance S.A. bond issue, Italcementi S.p.A. obtained two ten-year loans from Italcementi Finance S.A., one at a fixed rate and one at a floating rate, for a total amount of 210 million euro; m) During the first half of 2010, Italcementi S.p.A. took part in financing the repurchase offer on the Ciments Français S.A. US Private Placements, granting Ciments Français S.A. a long-term 5-year floating-rate loan for 100 million euro; n) In the third quarter of 2010, concomitantly with the finalization of the Italcementi Finance S.A. syndicated line of credit, Italcementi S.p.A. obtained from Italcementi Finance S.A. a five-year 220 million euro renewable line of credit. No drawings had been made on the line at December 31, 2011. o) In the first half of 2010, Ciments Français S.A. financed the repurchase of the US Private Placements and the reimbursement of part of the short-term loans with a five-year long-term floating-rate loan granted by Italcementi S.p.A. for an amount of 100 million euro and with a ten-year long-term floating-rate loan granted by Italcementi Finance S.A. for an amount of 540 million euro; p) In the third quarter of 2010, Ciments Français S.A. replaced the 700 million euro five-year syndicated line of credit maturing in May 2012, with a 700 million euro five-year renewable line of credit granted by Italcementi Finance S.A. This made it possible to extend the average life of available lines of credit, giving Ciments Français S.A. debt coverage for the following 4 years. No drawings had been made on the line at December 31, 2011; All loans and lines of credit between Ciments Français S.A., Italcementi S.p.A. and their subsidiaries are arranged at arm’s length conditions. 111 www.italcementigroup.com As a result of the Moody’s rating downgrade on December 15, 2011, the loans granted by Italcementi Finance S.A. to Italcementi S.p.A. and Ciments Français S.A. respectively for a total amount of 210 million euro and 540 million euro, will be subject to the applicable interest rate-increase of 125 basis points, in compliance with the step-up clause of the 750 million euro bond issued by Italcementi Finance. The rating downgrade had no other direct consequences on the cost of Group financing. 22.2 Management of liquidity, credit and counterparty risks 22.2.1 Liquidity risk Cash and cash equivalents for 613.3 million euro at December 31, 2011, consist largely of short-term assets such as short-term deposits, certificates of deposit, mutual funds. At December 31, 2011, the maximum exposure to a single counterparty was 20%. Due to currency regulations in Egypt, Morocco, Thailand and India, the cash and cash equivalents of the Group companies in these countries may not be immediately available to the Ciments Français S.A. holding (note 38.1). Group centralized financial policy is designed to ensure that at any time debt maturing in less than two years is less than or equal to undrawn confirmed lines of credit and liquidity. As from 2010, under the financial policy review, Italcementi S.p.A. and Ciments Français S.A. are the recipients of the fund-raising activities of Italcementi Finance S.A., enabling them to improve their access to credit and benefit from the synergies of a centralized financial policy. The policy aims to obtain loans at competitive conditions and to ensure a balance between average debt maturity, flexibility and diversification of sources. Consequently, Italcementi S.p.A. and Ciments Français S.A. obtain refinancing from Italcementi Finance S.A. through shortand long-term intragroup loans, arranged at arm’s length conditions. 112 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

Short-term liabilities included billets de trésorerie for 70 million euro (177 million euro at December 31, 2010, classified under long-term liabilities). At December 31, 2011 the Group had 2,506 million euro of confirmed lines of credit, of which 1,907 million euro undrawn and immediately available (2,777 and 2,061 million euro respectively at December 31, 2010). 22.2.2 Covenants In addition to the customary clauses, some of the Group’s financing contracts include covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios, fixed for the most part at the year end. For bilateral or syndicated lines of credit and borrowings, failure to comply with covenants leads to termination and consequent early repayment, however these clauses also include a stand-by period prior to actual execution. Lines of credit and financing contracts do not contain rating triggers that would lead to early repayment. Some financing contracts involve assumption of negative pledges to the counterparty, although these are limited to specific instances that do not substantially compromise the Group’s ability to finance or refinance its operations. 113 www.italcementigroup.com At December 31, 2011, lines of credit and loans subject to covenants accounted for 14% of total drawings represented by gross debt (2,721 million euro at December 31, 2011, expressed at nominal value, excluding the fair value effects of derivatives). At December 31, 2011, the Group complied with all contractual commitments; covenant-related financial ratios were well within the contractual limits agreed by the loans in question. The Group expects to comply with its covenants for the next 12 months and will provide information as appropriate should its financial situation deteriorate. 22.2.3 Credit risk In compliance with Group procedures, customers electing extended terms of payment are vetted for credit worthiness before and during the life of the contract. Credit checks take the form of customer-balance monitoring by the administrative department, whose procedures also regulate provisions for overdue receivables at regular intervals. The concentration of trade credit risks is limited by virtue of the Group’s broadly based and uncorrelated customer portfolio. For this reason, management believes that no further provisions for credit risks will be necessary beyond the amounts normally provided for uncollectible and doubtful receivables. 22.2.4 Counterparty risk Currency and interest-rate instruments are transacted only with counterparties with high ratings, selected on the basis of a number of criteria: ratings attributed by specialist agencies, assets and equity as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. The majority of counterparties are leading international banks. No financial instruments are negotiated with counterparties in geographical regions exposed to political or financial risks. All counterparties are in Western Europe or in the USA. 114 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

The fair value of forward currency purchase contracts is based on the current exchange rates of contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of foreign currency payables and receivables is determined using closing rates. The fair value of fixed-rate payables and receivables is based on a fixed rate with no credit margin, net of transaction costs directly related to the financial asset or liability. 115 www.italcementigroup.com 22.3.1 Fair value of derivatives The table shows the fair value of financial instruments reflected in the statement of financial position, subdivided by type of hedge: December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 (in thousands of euro) Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Derivatives interest rates 379 3,023 200 5,368 Future cash flow hedges 379 2,728 5,017 Trading 295 200 351 Derivatives exchange rates 5,614 20,466 4,507 13,572 Future cash flow hedges 4,237 37 1,393 882 Fair value hedges 1,377 20,301 3,079 12,359 Trading 128 35 331 Total current instruments 5,993 23,489 4,707 18,940 Derivatives interest rates 95,257 13,786 46,986 28,640 Future cash flow hedges 5,498 105 8,716 Fair value hedges 95,257 8,288 46,881 19,924 Derivatives exchange rates 769 Fair value hedges 769 Total medium/long-term instruments 95,257 13,786 47,755 28,640 Total 101,250 37,275 52,462 47,580 Medium/long-term derivatives on interest rates reflected under assets for 95.3 million euro mainly refer to fixedrate to Euribor-indexed floating-rate interest-rate swaps hedging part of the 500 million euro bond loan issued by Ciments Français S.A. for 22.0 million euro and part of the 750 million euro debenture issued by Italcementi Finance S.A. for 72.4 million euro; both bond loans were fixed-rate issues under the respective EMTN programs; at December 31, 2010, the derivatives were carried under assets at 15.0 million euro and 15.6 million euro respectively. The Group does not set up hedges on sales and purchases of shares. Derivatives on trading exchange rates and interest rates refer to assets that do not qualify for recognition with hedge accounting criteria. The fair value of derivatives relating to EUA and CER transactions was 6.6 million euro at December 31, 2011, of which -13.9 million euro reflected under “Other current liabilities”, 22.6 million euro under “Other current assets”, -11.7 million euro under “Other non-current liabilities” and 9.6 million euro under “Other non-current assets”. 2011 derivative transactions on emission rights had a negative impact of 5.9 million euro on profit before tax and an impact of 11.0 million euro on equity. The fair value of derivatives relating to transactions on electricity at December 31, 2011, was –0.5 million euro, reflected under “Other current liabilities” for –0.8 million euro and “Other current assets” for 0.3 million euro. In 2011 derivative transactions on electricity generated an immaterial impact on profit before tax and an impact of -0.5 million euro on equity. The fair value of derivatives relating to transactions on tin(II) sulfate at December 31, 2011, was immaterial. 116 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Consolidated financial statements 63 22.3.2 Fair value – hierarchy In determining and documenting the fair value of financial instruments, the Group uses the following hierarchy based on different measurement methods: level 1: financial instruments with prices quoted on active markets; level 2: prices quoted on active markets for similar financial instruments, or fair value determined with other measurement methods where all significant inputs are based on observable market data; level 3: fair value determined with measurement methods where no significant input is based on observable market data. At December 31, 2011, financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value were subdivided as follows: December 31, Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 2011 (in millions of euro) Mutual funds (note 38.1) 252.0 252.0 Derivatives assets (note 22.3.1) 101.2 101.2 Equity investments, bonds and financial assets 9.1 9.1 Other equity investments (note 9) 88.2 35.1 53.1 Derivatives liabilities (note 22.3.1) 37.3 37.3 Purchase commitments on non-controlling interests (note 23) 67.8 67.8 No portfolio reclassifications of financial assets from categories measured at fair value to categories measured at amortized cost were made by the Group, either in 2011 or in 2010. 22.4 Interest-rate risk management The Group interest-rate risk management policy is designed to minimize the cost of net financial liabilities and reduce exposure to fluctuation risks. It hedges two types of risk: 1. The risk of variations in the market value of fixed-rate borrowing and lending transactions. Group fixed-rate debt is exposed to an “opportunity cost” risk in the event of a fall in interest rates. A change in interest rates will affect the market value of fixed-rate assets and liabilities and impact the consolidated profit or loss in the event of liquidation or early repayment of these instruments; 2. The risk linked to future flows arising from floating-rate borrowing and lending transactions. A change in interest rates will have a negligible impact on the market value of floating-rate financial assets and liabilities but will affect finance costs and, consequently, future profits. The Group manages this dual risk as part of its general policy, performance targets and risk reduction targets by giving priority to hedges on future flows over the shortand medium-term and to hedges against the market value risk over the long term, within the specified limits. It hedges interest-rate risks mainly by arranging interest-rate swaps, forward-rate agreements and interest-rate options with top-ranking banks. Exposure in derivatives may never exceed the value of the underlying. 117 www.italcementigroup.com 22.4.1 Interest-rate risk hedging The table below sets out the notional value of interest-rate derivatives by maturity: Maturity Maturity Maturity Maturity Total less then 1 to 2 2 to 5 more then (millions of euro) 1 year years years 5 year Fair value hedges SWAPs riceive Fixed / pay Floating 165 M€ 4,75% Euribor 3M+ 0,626% 165.0 165.0 650 M€ 5,375% Euribor 3M+2.284% 650.0 650.0 Total 815.0 815.0 Cash flow hedges SWAPs riceive Floating / pay Fixed 200 M€ Euribor 3M 2,479% 100.0 100.0 200.0 100,6 M€ Euribor 6M 2,697% 25.2 25.2 50.2 100.6 25 MUSD Libor 3M 2,06% 19.3 19.3 133,5 MUSD Libor 3M 1,25% 100.7 100.7 Cash flow hedges OPTIONS Cap/Floor Euribor 3M 120.0 120.0 Total 365.2 25.2 150.2 540.6 Trading SWAPs riceive Floating / pay Floating 114 M€ Euribor 3M + 0,50% Euribor 3M+ 0,325% SWAPs riceive Floating / pay Fixed 0,8 M€ Euribor 3M 1,95% 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.8 Trading OPTIONS Cap/Floor Euribor 3M 75.0 Total 75.2 0.2 0.4 75.8 Total 440.4 25.4 150.6 815.0 1,431.4 22.4.2 Exposure to interest-rate risk At December 31, 2011, 56% of Group net debt (not including the fair value of derivatives) was at a fixed rate or hedged against the risk of rate increases. 42% of fixed-rate commitments arose from swapped contracts initially arranged at floating rates. Hedges are stated at nominal value for the period in question (consistently with instrument maturity) and do not include fixed-rate to fixed-rate contracts. 118 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

The impact on interest-rate derivatives in portfolio would be +5.9 million euro on equity and -3.8 million euro on profit before tax; the latter effect would be countered by an effect of +4.4 million euro on fixed-rate liabilities with fair value hedges. At December 31, 2011, a -0.5% change in the interest-rate curve would have an impact of +4.8 million euro, that is, 5.6% of 2011 net finance costs. The impact on interest-rate derivatives in portfolio would be -6.2 million euro on equity and -5.0 million euro on profit before tax; the latter effect would be countered by an effect of -4.5 million euro on fixed-rate liabilities with fair value hedges. 22.5 Management of currency risk The Group companies are structurally exposed to currency risk on cash flows from business operations and financing operations denominated in currencies other than their respective reporting currencies. The Group companies operate chiefly on their respective local markets. Consequently, invoiced amounts and operating expenses are denominated in the same currency and exposure of operating cash flows to currency risk is not particularly significant, with the exception of fuel, spare parts and investments for construction of new plants. Group policy requires borrowings or investments to be made in local currency, except in the case of hedges of foreign-currency cash flows. However, the Group may adapt this general policy to take account of specific macro-economic conditions in certain geographical areas (hyperinflation, high interest rates, liquidity, translations). 119 www.italcementigroup.com With regard to financing for subsidiaries, the Group may also arrange facilities in a currency other than that of the loan to the subsidiary. Group policy is to hedge exposure whenever the market makes this possible. Net exposure of each entity is determined on the basis of expected net operating cash flows over one to two years and financing denominated in currencies other than the local currency. The Group hedges exposure to currency risk with forward currency purchase and sale contracts, currency swaps that translate loans and borrowings generally denominated in euro at inception into foreign currency, as well as options. These hedges are arranged with leading banks. The impact of foreign currency translation on subsidiaries’ equity is recorded in a separate equity caption. 22.5.1 Exposure to currency risk Consolidated net exposure by currency of financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency is illustrated below: (in millions of euro) Euro (*) USD (*) Other (*) Financial assets (°) 3.1 689.5 9.8 Financial liabilities (°) (27.8) (39.5) (97.8) Derivatives (566.7) 89.2 Net exposure (24.7) 83.3 1.2 (*) assets and liabilities are expressed at nominal value in euro when the local currency is not euro (°) excluding trade payables and receivables Foreign currency exposure refers mainly to the US dollar, the Thai baht, the Moroccan dirham, the Egyptian pound and the Indian rupee. No hedging is set up on net investments in these subsidiaries. At December 31, 2011, a 1% change in the exchange rate with the euro, in cases where the local currency is not euro, would have had an impact of +35.6 million euro on equity, of which +8.3 million euro on noncontrolling interests. At December 31, 2011, a 10% rise in the US dollar would have an impact on exchange-rate derivatives in portfolio of +9.9 million euro on equity and -39.3 million euro on profit before tax. A 10% decrease in the US dollar would have an impact on exchange-rate derivatives in portfolio of -9.9 million euro on equity and +39.3 million euro on profit before tax. 120 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

Trades on emission rights markets are transacted by the parent, Italcementi S.p.A., which since 2010 has also operated on behalf of the Group’s other European subsidiaries under an agency basis. From 2008 to 2011, the Group transacted forward EUA-CER swaps (forward EUA sales and forward CER purchases) distributed in the period 2009-2013, to diversify and optimize its CO2 emission rights portfolio. Furthermore, in 2010 and 2011, the Group arranged price risk hedges with respect to the sales of surplus emission rights planned in the fourth quarter of 2010 for 2011 and 2012. 121 www.italcementigroup.com In 2011, in view of the surplus accumulated and the macroeconomic and industry scenario, the Group sold EUAs on the spot market for 62.1 million euro (55.8 million euro in 2010). Electricity In 2011, the Group arranged price risk hedges on electric power purchases for 2011 and 2012. Tin(II) sulfate In 2011, the Group arranged a modest volume of price risk hedges on tin(II) sulfate purchases for 2011 and 2012. 22.7 Management of equity risk The Group is exposed to market fluctuations on listed shares held in portfolio recognized under “Other equity investments”. Treasury shares held by Italcementi S.p.A. are measured at cost and deducted against equity under the “Treasury shares” reserve (note 16). Equity investments treated as available-for-sale financial assets are recognized under “Other equity investments” (see note 9) and refer mainly to the Goltas Cimento listed equity investment. The risk of fluctuations in the value of these equity investments is not actively managed with financial hedging instruments. 22.8 Hedge Accounting The effects arising from application of hedge accounting rules are summarized below. The specific equity reserve reflects fair value gains and losses on the effective component of cash flow hedges only. New derivatives recognized in equity totaled +3.3 million euro at December 31, 2011 (+2.2 million euro at December 31, 2010). The eliminated portion of the reserve relating to instruments that expired in 2010 amounted to +12.0 million euro at December 31, 2011, compared with +21.4 million euro at December 31, 2010. The changes in equity relating to derivatives traded in 2010 and still in portfolio at December 31, 2011, amounted to -1.8 million euro (-12.0 million euro at December 31, 2010). The non-effective component of cash flow hedges in portfolio at December 31, 2011, recognized in profit or loss was immaterial in both 2011 and 2010. With reference to fair value hedges in portfolio at December 31, 2011, the amount taken to profit or loss totaled +3.1 million euro for 2011 (+6.5 million euro for 2010). Recognized amounts attributable to underlying risk hedged during the year totaled -3.3 million euro at December 31, 2011 (-6.7 million euro at December 31, 2010). These amounts are taken to profit or loss as gains and losses on interest-rate and currency derivatives (note 30). 122 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 28 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

The undersigned Carlo Pesenti, Chief Executive Officer and Carlo Bianchini, the Manager in charge of preparing the company’s financial reports, of Italcementi S.p.A., having also taken into account the provisions of Article 154-bis, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Italian Legislative Decree February no. 58 of 24 February 1998, hereby certify: x the adequacy in relation to the legal entity features and x the effective implementation of the administrative and accounting procedures for the preparation of the consolidated financial statement over the course of the period from January 1st, 2011 and December 31st, 2011. 2. The representation of the adequacy of the administrative and accounting procedures adopted in the preparation of consolidated financial statements as at December 31st, 2011 is based on a form identified by Italcementi according to the CoSO framework (illustrated in the CoSO Report) and also takes into account the document “Internal Control over Financial Reporting – Guidance for Smaller Public Companies”, both issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, representing a generally accepted international framework. 3. It is also certified that: 3.1 the consolidated financial statement: a) has been drawn up in accordance with the international accounting standards recognised in the European Union under the EC regulation 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002; b) is consistent with the entries in the accounting books and records; c) is capable of providing a true and fair representation of the assets and liabilities, profits and losses and financial position of the issuer and the group of companies included in the consolidation. 3.2 The directors’ report includes a reliable analysis of the performance and the results of operations, and the overall situation of the issuer and the group of companies included in the consolidation, together with a description of the main risks and uncertainties they are exposed to.

Annual Report 149 www.italcementigroup.com Directors’ report Any changes in the standards and regulations, compared to 2010, are detailed in the notes under the heading “Statement of compliance with the IFRS”. In accordance with the provisions of European Union Regulation no. 1606 of 2002, the principles to be adopted do not include the standards and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) at December 31, 2011, but not endorsed by the European Union at that date. Furthermore, the European Union has endorsed additional standards/interpretations that Italcementi S.p.A. will apply at a subsequent time, having decided not to elect early application. Earnings indicators To assist comprehension of its financial data, Italcementi S.p.A. employs a number of widely used indicators, which are not contemplated by the IFRS. Specifically, the income statement presents the following intermediate results / indicators: recurring EBITDA, EBITDA, EBIT, computed as the sum of the preceding items. On the face of the statement of financial position, similar considerations apply to net debt, whose components are detailed in the specific section of the notes. Since the indicators employed by the company are not envisaged by the IFRS, their definitions may not coincide with and therefore not be comparable to those adopted by other companies/groups. This report contains many financial and non-financial earnings indicators, including those mentioned above. The financial indicators, taken from the financial statements, are used in the tables summarizing Italcementi S.p.A.’s financial performance, in relation to comparative amounts and other amounts from the same period (e.g., change in revenue, recurring EBITDA and EBIT with respect to the previous year, and change in their return on revenue). The use of amounts not directly apparent from the financial statements (e.g., amounts of subsidiaries’ financial statements) and the presentation of comments and assessments assist qualification of the trends in the amounts concerned. The non-financial indicators refer to external and internal elements: the general economic situation and the situation of the industry in which the company operates, trends in sales prices and key cost factors, acquisitions and disposals, other significant events in the period, organizational developments, the introduction of laws and regulations, etc.. In the notes, the section on the net debt provides information about the effects of changes in interest rates and the main exchange rates on the statement of financial position and the income statement. 150 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 Results and significant events for the year Results Italcementi S.p.A. ended 2011 with a 7.0 million euro profit (against a 34.4 million euro loss in 2010) primarily as a result of a positive sales price effect, income relating to CO2 emission rights, an increase in finance income, while being penalized by higher impairment losses on financial assets.

After a positive – albeit considerably slower – first half, the second part of the year saw the return of recessionary conditions. At the core of the new downward cycle was the progressive decline in foreign demand and, above all, a contraction in domestic demand. Specifically, consumer demand was affected by a further employment deterioration and measures to further contain public spending, which immediately affected confidence, and finally by the considerable reduction in household spending power as a result of the losses witnessed in all types of business. In the second half of the year, production and investments were significantly affected by the tightening of lending conditions resulting from the sovereign debt crisis in some euro zone countries. The construction recession was severe, if partially alleviated in the first few months of the year by favorable weather conditions. The decline in business indices slowed down only in the residential construction segment – largely due to contributions towards restructuring, 151 www.italcementigroup.com which remained the most dynamic component of demand as a result of confirmed tax incentives – while it was accentuated in the other segments, especially in public works, which suffered from the increasing restrictions regarding both local and central public spending. In 2011, cement consumption fell for the fifth year running, down some 30% from its peak, to below 33 million metric tons, according to the most recent estimates. One needs to go back to the early 1970s to find such weak demand. It is worth noting that this drop compares to a smaller contraction in construction during the same five-year period; the difference is largely attributable to a shift in construction towards areas requiring less cement (in particular, to the increase in the proportion of restructuring projects to the total, while the proportion of civil engineering projects decreased). Cement production fell even more sharply, although somewhat irregularly from a geographical viewpoint. International cement trading also fell, and the trade surplus by volume was essentially halved, as a result of a more rapid contraction in exports; meanwhile, clinker imports increased slightly. Domestic production * 2011 2011/2010 (millions of metric tons) (% change) Northern Italy 15.5 (3.2) Central Italy 6.5 (0.2) Southern Italy 7.6 (5.1) Italian islands 3.2 (14.7) Total 32.8 (4.3) * source: AITEC In this scenario, Italcementi S.p.A. recorded revenue of 613.8 million euro, comparable to 2010 (614.1 million euro), as a result of a considerable recovery in prices and a fall in sales volumes. This situation led to a substantial breakeven in recurring EBITDA (-0.5 million euro), against -54.5 million euro in 2010. The improvement in recurring EBITDA was primarily achieved on better prices, as well as on income from CO2 emissions rights, regarding both rights trading, and income from reimbursement of “new entrant” CO2 quotas, awarded to three production plants for the period 2008-2012. Other important contributions arrived from energy efficiency credits (white certificates) and income from electricity interruptibility. Additional savings were achieved in overheads, part of a plan started in 2008, which will continue in 2012, in part through a re-organization of central activities, as well as those of the production and marketing networks. This plan aims to absorb excess personnel by implementing various redundancy arrangements, such as the special state-subsidized layoff fund (CIGS) and a mobility procedure, with a view to limiting the ensuing social repercussions. Beyond the drop in volumes, other negative aspects were the increase in variable costs, primarily due to an increase in energy items, leading to continued efforts to boost efficiency in production, for example through increased use of alternative fuels, substitute raw materials and energy savings, assisted by the new clinker production line at the cement plant in Matera coming fully on-line. 152 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 EBITDA was 7.7 million euro (-51.4 million euro in 2010), with a return on revenue of 1.3% (-8.4% in 2010). The 2011 figure includes a non-recurring expense for a net amount of 8.1 million euro, relating to the re-organization plan described above. After amortization and depreciation of 81.6 million euro, a slight increase (+1.2%) compared to the previous year (80.7 million euro), and impairment losses of 0.7 million euro (reversals of impairment losses of 1.7 million euro in 2010), EBIT was -74.6 million euro (a 42.7% reduction compared to the negative EBIT of 130.3 million euro in 2010). Net finance income was 109.8 million euro (78.8 million euro in 2010). Alongside a 3.7% reduction from 32.6 million euro to 31.4 million euro in net finance costs relating to the net financial position, the largest contributing item to the increase in net finance income was dividends received, which totaled 148.7 million euro (+42.5%, compared to 104.3 million euro in 2010). Loss before tax amounted to 17.1 million euro (89.7 million euro in 2010). The figure was affected by impairment losses on financial assets for 52.3 million euro (38.2 million euro in 2010), primarily relating to Calcestruzzi S.p.A. (38.4 million euro), which was returned to Italcementi S.p.A. at the beginning of the year, and Nuova Sacelit S.r.l. (10.0 million euro). After a 24.1 million euro positive income tax effect (a positive effect of 55.4 million euro in 2010), 2011 closed with a 7.0 million euro profit (against a loss of 34.4 million euro in 2010). In 2011, the items which, starting from the profit/loss for the period, determine comprehensive income showed a negative balance of 2.7 million euro (-22.2 million euro in 2010) comprising: fair value losses on available-for-sale financial assets for 7.5 million euro, fair value gains on derivatives for 2.9 million euro and a related positive tax effect of 1.9 million euro (for a comparison with 2010, see the statement of comprehensive income in the “Financial statements” section). Considering the 7.0 million euro profit for the period and the items described above, total comprehensive income for 2011 was 4.3 million euro, compared to a total comprehensive expense of 56.5 million euro in 2010. Significant events Significant events during the period and after December 31, 2011, are illustrated in the relevant sections of the consolidated directors’ report. Capital expenditure Investments in property, plant and equipment and investment property totaled 61.9 million euro in 2011 (83.7 million euro in 2010). They related to extensive industrial safety and rationalization projects, and the establishment of the new i.lab research and innovation center at the Kilometro Rosso. Investments in intangible assets were 18.9 million euro (15.0 million euro), primarily related to software development associated with the various IT projects implemented in 2011.

Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 External monitoring and renewal audits were carried out on the company’s cement plants’ environmental certificates. The proportion of alternative fuels to the total mix was greater than in 2010, especially as a result of the increase in fuels obtained from the processing of tires, urban solid waste and animal flours; this raised the ensuing financial contribution, which continues to be a major factor in reducing production energy costs. The increase in the financial contribution arising from the use of substitute raw materials was also significant. Human resources The Italcementi S.p.A. workforce stood at 2,511 persons at December 31, 2011, a decrease of 146 from the end of 2010 (2,657). (heads) 2011 2010 Managers 150 153 Middle managers and clerical staff 1,012 1,065 Blue collar 1,349 1,439 Total 2,511 2,657 Recourse to special state-subsidized layoff benefits (Cassa integrazione guadagni ordinaria e straordinaria) totaled 181,156.00 hours in 2011 (197,783.5 hours in 2010). On March 9 and October 25, 2011, documents were signed by FEDERMACO with the national trade unions jointly recognizing the severe crisis in the sector, a direct consequence of the wider construction crisis. These documents were the basis for the contacts made by the Italian cement industry association, AITEC, with the Ministry for Production and the Environment pressing for projects and subsidies to combat the negative situation. On March 9, 2011, another agreement was signed between FEDERMACO and the trade unions, extending throughout 2011 the validity of the group collective agreements regarding performance incentives. During the year, initiatives continued to manage the personnel surpluses resulting from the termination of operations at the grinding centers in Savignano sul Panaro, Civitavecchia, Catania (converted into a delivery center) and Scala di Giocca, as well as the kiln line in Borgo San Dalmazzo. In agreement with the trade unions, to limit social repercussions, recourse was made to special state-subsidized layoff benefits and, during the period in question, to intragroup relocations, exit incentives and retirement support. Close control was exercised to limit overtime work and ensure use of vacation days, paid leave (retribuzione orario lavoro, ROL) and former holidays. Italcementi S.p.A., as the provider of treatment, states that the Data Protection Document was updated for 2011, in compliance with the provisions of law 196/2003 and the minimum security measures technical specifications. 157 www.italcementigroup.com Risks and uncertainties Italcementi S.p.A.’s management of risks (internal and external, social, industrial, political, financial) is an integral part of Group growth strategy and a key element of the continuous process of evolving the governance system. Risk management, in part through improvement of rules of conduct, aims to respect the environment, protect stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders), and protect corporate assets. Italcementi operates in a sector exposed to risks and uncertainties of various kinds (connected with external factors, operational, financial, organizational, compliance with regulations, etc.). In May 2010, Italcementi S.p.A. formed a Risk Management Department, reporting to the Chief Executive Officer, to improve its ability to create value for stakeholders by optimizing enterprise risk management (ERM). The mission of the function is to guarantee a structured approach to risk management, integrated with the Group growth strategy, and to support the improvement of Group performance by identifying, measuring, managing and controlling key risks. The creation of the Risk Management Department is part of the “Risk & Compliance” program set up in 2008 and consists of the following phases: 1. identification of the main areas of risk for Group strategic goals and development of methods and tools to analyze and assess the correlated risk events; 2. assessment, at country level and at aggregate level, of identified risk events in terms of impact, probability and timeframe, in order to acquire an overall vision of the Group risk portfolio; 3. selection of priority risks and definition of response strategies, Group governance rules and action to integrate and improve risk management systems; 4. implementation of defined mitigation strategies and action and development of the Enterprise Risk Management process; 5. reporting to Top Management and the governance bodies on the main risks, and their management and evolution; in this phase quantification of risks and opportunities is integrated with the enterprise management process, for example in the budget, in results forecasting reviews and in assessment of strategic projects. Sustainable development and risk management: protection of people and assets Sustainable development favors a corporate approach that balances economic growth, protection of the environment and social sustainability. By constantly pursuing an optimal balance among these elements and ensuring that benefits extend to everyone involved, companies enhance their long-term value, ability to survive and competitive advantage, thus helping to prevent industrial risks. The Group checks that its protection and prevention programs are consistently applied to all personnel in production sites (employees and other) and to all operations in its companies. Regulatory limits and Group sustainable development goals and initiatives are examined in a special report (Sustainability Report) and also summarized in a specific section in the consolidated annual report. 158 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 The Asset Protection Program continued in 2011; it qualifies the importance of risks and develops a suitable prevention and protection policy, thereby limiting damage to assets and consequent operating losses. The program is now a consolidated Group process. Risks relating to the general economic and industry situation The economic and financial situation represents an element of risk for the Group, also in relation to its specific area of business, which is sensitive to changes in the economic situation. Household and business propensity to invest in construction is affected by the uncertainty and constraints of the general scenario. Risks associated with energy factors The cost of energy factors, which represents a large portion of Group variable costs of production, can vary significantly as a result of factors beyond the Group’s control. The Group has adopted measures to mitigate risks for certain energy factors by entering into medium-term supply contracts. Furthermore the centralized procurement organization enables the Group to benefit from more efficient relations with suppliers and to obtain competitive conditions. Risks relating to availability of raw materials The availability of raw materials is a strategic factor in investment decisions. The Group generally sources its raw materials – limestone, clay, gypsum, aggregates and other materials used in the production of cement, ready mixed concrete and aggregates – from quarries it owns (the majority) or quarries rented from third parties. For these and other significant materials, the Group has also reached specific agreements with suppliers to guarantee continuous, stable procurement. Environmental risks The “Sustainability Report” and the section on Sustainable Development in the consolidated annual report illustrate the measures taken by the Group to manage environmental risks and control and reduce emissions. With regard to CO2 emissions, the Group’s European companies are exposed to price fluctuations on emission rights depending on its own rights surplus or deficit. The Group’s and Italcementi S.p.A.’s positions are constantly monitored to ensure correct risk management (see note 19 in the Italcementi S.p.A. notes). Financial risks The current period of crisis puts corporate cash flows at risk, endangering companies’ selffinancing ability and creating difficulties for normal, orderly operations on the financial market. The Group procures sources of finance and manages interest rates, currency and counterparty risk, for all the companies in the scope of consolidation. The Group uses derivatives to reduce the risk of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates with respect to debt and its international operations. Detailed analysis of this type of risk is provided in the notes, specifically in note 19 dedicated to net debt. 159 www.italcementigroup.com Ratings risks The Group’s ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for funding depends on various factors, including its credit ratings assigned by recognized ratings agencies. Its credit ratings may change to reflect changes in its results, financial position, credit structure and liquidity profile. As a result, a rating downgrade may have negative repercussions on the Group’s ability to raise funding. Legal risks Suitable provisions and impairment losses have been applied with regard to existing risks and their related economic effects. Estimates and valuations are based on available information and are in any case regularly reviewed, with immediate recognition in the financial statements of any variations. A review of the main current disputes (legal and tax-related) may be found in the relevant sections of this report and in the consolidated annual report, with specific details in the notes. Conformity risks The Group is subject to specific regulations concerning the quality of the products it markets; special monitoring activities have been set up to ensure compliance with the regulations in the countries where it operates. At a general level, the “Risk and Compliance” program has introduced specific training and circulates procedures and recommendations in the Group countries, to ensure compliance with legislation and with tax, social and environmental regulations. The program is reviewed on an annual basis to take account of regulatory changes. Political risks The Group has taken out insurance covers to limit the financial consequences of possible political measures that might prevent normal management of some subsidiaries in emerging countries. Financial disclosure risks The main characteristics of the risk management system and the internal control system with respect to the financial disclosure process are illustrated in a specific section of the “Report on corporate governance and ownership structure” in the Italcementi S.p.A. annual report. Insurance In the interest of all Group subsidiaries, Italcementi has taken out policies with leading insurance companies to cover risks to people and assets, as well as product and general third-party liability covers. As part of its risk coverage policy, the Group aims to optimize risk management costs by assessing direct assumption and transfer to the market. All policies are negotiated under a framework agreement to ensure a balance between the probability of a risk occurring and the damage that would ensue for each subsidiary. 160 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 Disputes and pending proceedings With regard to the most important tax disputes arising from tax inspections and audits (covering financial years 1996 to 1999) in July 2011 the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation rejected the appeals filed by the State and confirmed in full the rulings of the Milan Regional Tax Commission. The proceedings therefore closed with an additional tax charge of 0.8 million euro, compared with the initial amount of 68 million euro for additional tax and fines requested by the tax authorities. As regards financial years where the findings were upheld, Italcementi S.p.A. has complied with the inspections, thereby obtaining a reduction in the fines imposed. The inspections relating to financial years 1987 and 2003 to 2006 are still open, with proceedings so far in favor of the company. Italcementi Cav. Lav. Carlo Pesenti foundation The Italcementi Cav. Lav. Carlo Pesenti foundation is an independent non-profit entity established in 2004 by Italcementi and Italmobiliare, with the aim of “promoting scientific research and education with a special emphasis on the sustainable economic and social development of enterprises”. The foundation’s mission also envisages the promotion and implementation of humanitarian aid for communities struck by natural disasters or in other emergency situations. In 2011, as in the previous year, the foundation employed the resources made available to it by the founding members primarily to develop and complete major projects initiated in previous years. Specifically, in the most important sector of activities, “school and university education and training”, the fourth and last of the three-year research doctorates in “Logistics and Supply Chain Management”, funded by the foundation at the University of Bergamo, in collaboration with the Bocconi University and the Zaragoza Logistics Center, a partner of Boston’s M.I.T., began. In 2011, the four students of the first three-year course were awarded their doctorates by an international commission. The foundation continued providing grants for university education at the MIP-School of Management of Milan Polytechnic and, in collaboration with the Intercultura association, grants for overseas studies for the children of Group employees. A significant initiative implemented in 2011 involved financial support along with other organizations and entities of the “Adopt talent” project of the University of Bergamo, which aims to attract foreign talent, promote international mobility and establish three teaching degrees in the English language. Regarding humanitarian projects, the new Professional Training Center inaugurated in Sri Lanka with an investment of 3 million euro, providing local youths with accommodation, education and the skills to succeed in the workplace, commenced operations at the beginning of 2011 and is developing its academic curriculum. The students attend specialized courses in worksite topography, planning, duties and accounting. Preparatory English-language courses for students already in possession of the diploma required to attend the Professional Training Center were also promoted. Some of the activities envisaged by the foundation’s charter are the promotion and organization of conferences and seminars on current social and economic topics. In this regard, the foundation has, since its creation, organized important annual conferences attended by leading institutional, business and academic figures. A conference was held in 161 www.italcementigroup.com January 2011 entitled “Europe at the limits of development” with discussions on the strengths and weaknesses that may affect the future of Europe. In January 2012, the foundation’s annual conference focused on the role of the real economy and industry from the present day to the near future, with an interesting debate on the possibility of doing business to create value and employment, and to recover Italy’s competitiveness. The above initiatives and a variety of other recurring projects, such as support for the “Bergamo Scienza” show, involved an overall financial commitment of about 850,000 euro in 2011 (1.6 million euro in 2010). 162 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 Report on Corporate Governance and ownership structure ITALCEMENTI S.P.A. PROFILE The Corporate Governance system adopted by Italcementi S.p.A. is based not only on the company by-laws, but also on the following codes and/or polices: 1) Code of Conduct; 2) Code of Ethics; 3) Treatment of Confidential Information; 4) Internal Dealing Code of Conduct; 5) Procedure for Transactions with Related Parties; 6) «Insider register» Procedure; 6) Regulation for the manager in charge of preparing the company’s financial reports; 7) Organizational, Management and Control Model. The above documents are all available on the company’s website www.italcementigroup.com, except for the Regulation for the manager in charge of preparing the company’s financial reports, available to all the Group companies on the company intranet and for the special part of the Organizational, Management and Control Model. The Company has been actively committed in modernizing its business culture over the years in order to respond to the challenges arising from developments in corporate governance rules. This process fostered and enhanced the sharing of values and the recognition that the adoption of good rules of governance goes hand in hand with the dissemination of a business culture built on transparency, adequate management and effective controls. As part of the broader process of integrating and agreeing common principles and rules within the Group, the company’s Board of Directors, at its meeting of December 22, 2010, resolved to adopt a common Framework of corporate governance (Corporate Governance Framework) representing the minimum corporate governance principles applicable to Group companies. These principles were elaborated on the basis of a comparative review of national and international best practices as well as taking into account the different local laws of the countries where the Group is present. The Corporate Governance Framework has been initially distributed to 22 companies operating in 14 countries, which are considered a sufficiently representative sample on the basis of pre-set relevance indicators (revenues, assets, EBIT and employees). Next step of the project is the definition and dissemination of Group guidelines drafted to better clarify Framework principles and criteria and to facilitate its application in both the parent company and in its subsidiaries. The proper execution of these guidelines will be further verified by means of a yearly audit plan which foresees, at the beginning, the 22 “in-scope companies” and, gradually, the other group companies. The corporate governance structure of the Company, as set up in the binding articles of the by-laws and in the provisions of the above mentioned codes and policies confirms and bears witness to Italcementi S.p.A.’s commitment to comply with generally agreed national and international best practices. 165 www.italcementigroup.com INFORMATION ON OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE This section includes the information required by art. 123-bis of Leg. Decree no. 58 of February 24, 1998 («TUF»). a) Share capital structure, indicating the various share categories, related rights and obligations, as well as the percentage of share capital represented Italcementi S.p.A. share capital is equal to 282,548,942 euro, divided into 282,548,942 shares with a nominal value of 1 euro each, of which 177,117,564 are ordinary shares, equal to 62.69% of the entire share capital, and 105,431,378 are savings shares, equal to 37.31% of the entire share capital. Ordinary shares carry voting rights at the Company’s ordinary and extraordinary shareholders’ meetings. Shareholders who, even jointly, own at least one fortieth of the share capital represented by shares with voting rights, may ask, within the deadlines envisaged by the law in force, for the items on the agenda of the shareholders’ meeting to be supplemented, stating in their request which further issues are being suggested. In addition, shareholders who, individually or with other shareholders, can prove that they hold an overall stake in the share capital with voting rights that is no lower than that established by the law in force, have the right to present lists for the appointment of the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors in accordance with the provisions of the law and the by-laws. Savings shares do not carry voting rights. In the event of an increase in share capital against consideration for which option rights have not been excluded or limited, the holders of savings shares have option rights on the newly issued savings shares or, in their absence or to cover the difference, on other categories of shares. Resolutions to issue new savings shares with the same characteristics as those already outstanding, either through a share capital increase or through the conversion of other categories of shares, do not require approval by the meetings of the holders of the different share categories. Should ordinary and/or savings shares be excluded from trading, savings shares maintain the rights granted to them by law and by the by-laws, unless otherwise provided for by the shareholders’ meeting. When the net profit for the year is allocated, savings shares are entitled to a dividend up to 5% of the nominal share value, increased with respect to that of ordinary shares, by an amount equivalent to 3% of the nominal share value. When in a financial year a lower dividend than the one indicated in article 32 of the by-laws is allocated to savings shares, the difference is calculated as an increase to the savings dividend paid in the following two years. In the event of distribution of reserves, savings shares have the same rights as other shares. A reduction in share capital owing to losses does not cause a reduction in the nominal value of the savings shares, except for that part of the loss in excess of the overall nominal value of the other shares. In case of dissolution of the company, savings shares have priority in the repayment of the share capital for the full nominal value. The Company does not have outstanding stock option plans either for directors or for officers. However, based on the assignments resolved in the last few years for the stock option plans in force from time to time, as at the date hereof 960,900 options on the stock option plan for directors – 2001, 2,269,316 options on the stock option plan for officers – 2000 and 1,564,750 options on the stock option plan for officers – 2008 are exercisable. Outstanding options granted to directors can only be exercised through assignment to the recipients of treasury shares, while those granted to officers can also be exercised through the execution of the power, recognized to directors as per art. 2443 of the Italian civil code, to increase the share capital. 166 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

FEATURES OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM REGARDING THE FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE PROCESS 1. Foreword As already noted in the section on “Risks and uncertainties”, in 2010 Italcementi S.p.A. set up the Risk Management Department with the aim of improving the creation of value for stakeholders, also by optimizing enterprise risk management. This initiative is part of the Group’s “Risk & compliance” program launched in 2008, which classified risks related to the financial disclosure process as one of the key risks. For this type of risks, in 2010 the following were realized: appropriate mitigation measures, the assignment of responsibility to a main reference point (“Primary Risk Owner”), the definition of common guidelines, actions and controls for the various risk areas (“Risk Management Guidelines”), the definition of strategies and the realization of measures to align risk management systems to the standards sought. The setting up of the Risk Management Department is part of the “Risk&Compliance” program launched in 2008, which followed the COSO methodology (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) which is structured on the following phases: Identification of the main risk areas in relation to the Group strategic targets and definition of methodologies and tools for the analysis and evaluation of the events of risk related thereto; Evaluation, both at country and Group level, of identified events of risk in terms of impact, chance of happening and time frame, in order to have an overall picture of the Group risks; 169 www.italcementigroup.com Selection of priority risks and definition of relevant reaction strategies, of the governance rules within the Group as well as the necessary actions necessary to supplement and improve risk management systems; several risks are managed locally at the subsidiaries, while the management of those requiring specific expertise or a cross coordination, is centralized; Implementation of the mitigation actions/strategies defined from time to time and development of the Enterprise Risk Management process; Report to the top management and control bodies on the main risks and their management and evolution. The risk quantification and occurrence are integrated in the management system, like budget, provisions and analysis studies on the most important investment projects. The risk management and internal control system relating to the financial disclosure process also benefited from: the continuous development of an integrated organizational governance system (organization notices, job descriptions, corporate powers and processes) whose tools are available in a Knowledge Management Database, B.E.S.T. (Business Excellence Support Tool), which allows easy access to information and encourages cross-circulation within the Group; a more timely organization and planning relating to the provisions of Law no. 262 of December 28, 2005, stating “Provisions for the protection of savings and the regulation of the financial markets” and the following corrective decrees (hereinafter the “Law on Savings”) issued by lawmakers with the aim of increasing the transparency of corporate disclosure and enhancing the internal control system of listed companies. In regard to this law, far-back Italcementi S.p.A. launched a series of activities, described in section 2 below, which are included in an action plan integrated into the Company’s processes. The existing control procedures guarantee the effectiveness of the current system and the data reliability. The Company therefore believes to comply with legal requirements, and guarantees the completeness and reliability of its financial disclosures. 2. Description of the main features of the system 2.1 Stages in the risk management and internal control system Italcementi has established its own model for the assessment of the internal control system relating to disclosure about financial position and results of operations (hereinafter the “Operational model”) and has established the operational approach for undertaking these activities. This model is based on the CoSO framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tradeway Commission (CoSO), and also takes into account the document “Internal Control over Financial Reporting Guidance for Smaller Public Companies”, which was also drafted by the CoSO. The Operational model defined by Italcementi is based on the following main elements: a) Preliminary analysis. This is undertaken annually or whenever considered necessary and aims to identify and assess risks relating to the internal control system with regard to financial position and results of operations’ disclosure , so as to establish the priorities for documenting, assessing and testing the administrative and accounting procedures and the related controls. Identification of the relevant entities and processes is based on quantitative elements (weight of revenues and assets of a single entity on consolidated amounts, amount of the consolidated financial statement items related to a particular process) and on qualitative elements (country where an entity operates, specific risks, risk levels attributed to the various items); 170 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 b) Operational planning. Every year the activities are planned on the basis of the priorities identified through the preliminary analysis and any other assumptions; c) Analysis of company controls. The individual entities in the area for action identified in the preliminary analysis are responsible for assessing the effectiveness of the internal control system in relation to the governance principles used at entity level (Entity Level Controls), as well as for the overall management of the information systems used in the main financial reporting processes and the related IT structure (Information Technology General Controls). This must be carried out in accordance with the deadlines established during operational planning and on the basis of the guidelines, instructions and templates provided; d) Analysis of controls at process level. The individual entities in the area for action identified in the preliminary analysis are responsible for: a) documenting, with varying levels of detail depending on the level of risk allocated, the administrative and accounting processes which have been identified, b) performing tests to check the effective operation of the key controls, in accordance with the deadlines established during operational planning and on the basis of the guidelines, instructions and templates provided by the manager in charge; e) Assessment of the adequacy and effective operation of the administrative and accounting procedures and the related controls: in order to guarantee compliance with the key requirements for financial reporting (“financial statement assertions”), the manager in charge, on the basis of the results of the work carried out and the documentation obtained, assesses the overall adequacy and effective operation of the system of administrative and accounting procedures and the related controls, and more generally, the internal control system for these areas. 2.2. Roles and Functions involved The financial disclosure related to the risk management system is supervised by various Company bodies/functions, each with specific roles and responsibilities. In particular, as already stated in other sections of this corporate governance report: 1) The Board of Directors, to which the Code of Conduct assigns, among other things, the task of: a) checking and approving the strategic, business and financial plans of the company; b) assessing the forecasts on operations and the adequacy of the organizational, administrative and general accounting system of the company and subsidiaries; c) evaluating and approving the periodic accounting reports; assessing the company’s operational structure; d) establishing the guidelines for the internal control system so that the main risks for the company and the subsidiaries are correctly identified, as well as adequately measured, managed and monitored, and, also, determining criteria for the suitability of these risks with safe and appropriate management of the company; e) assessing, at least on an annual basis, the adequacy, effectiveness and effective functioning of the internal control system with respect to the characteristics of the company. 2) The Chief Executive Officer, who, as executive director responsible for overseeing the functioning of the internal control system, has the task of: a) identifying the main company risks, taking into account the characteristics of the activities carried out by the company and by the subsidiaries, and periodically submitting them for examination to the Board of Directors; 171 www.italcementigroup.com b) implementing the guidelines defined by the Board of Directors, taking care of the planning, achievement and management of the internal control system, constantly checking its overall adequacy, effectiveness and efficiency; also, adapting this system to changes in operating conditions and the legal and regulatory framework; c) issuing, with the manager in charge, certificates on the adequacy and effective application of the administrative and accounting procedures, the compliance of documents with applicable IFRS, the correspondence of documents to entries in the accounting books and records, the suitability of documents in providing a true and fair representation of financial position and results of operations of the company and Group, etc. 3) The Internal control committee, to which the Code of Conduct assigns, among other things, the task of: a) assessing, together with the manager in charge of preparing the company’s financial reports and the external auditors, the correct application of accounting policies and their uniformity for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements; b) examining the audit plan and periodic reports prepared by the controller; c) reporting, at least every six months, to the Board of Directors called to approve the financial statements and the half-year report, on the activities undertaken and on the adequacy of the internal control system; 4) The Chief Operating Officer, who is responsible, among other things, for overseeing Italcementi S.p.A. activities and the activities of the industrial companies directly or indirectly controlled by Italcementi S.p.A. and of the companies in which the latter has, directly or indirectly, an equity interest which enables the exercise of significant influence. Moreover, the Chief Operating Officer and the Deputy Chief Operating Officer, together with the heads of functions who report directly to them and who are involved in the process of drafting financial disclosures have to issue specific attestations on the data and information provided, both in relation to their correct representation and in relation to the effective and efficient application of the administrative and accounting procedures in their areas of assignment; 5) The Manager in charge of preparing the company’s financial reports, who, as envisaged in the regulation approved by the Board of Directors, is responsible, among other things, for: a) planning adequate administrative and accounting procedures for the drafting of the financial statements, the limited half-year financial statements and the consolidated financial statements, as well as any other financial communication, by updating such procedures and ensuring dissemination and compliance, as well as verifying their effective application; b) assessing, together with the Internal Control Committee and the external auditors, the correct application of accounting policies and their uniformity for the purposes of the consolidated financial statements; c) handling the periodic reporting to senior management and the Board of Directors on the activities undertaken; d) managing the periodic review of the assessment activities and updating the risk map relating to financial disclosure; e) taking part in the development of information systems that have an impact on the company’s financial positions and results of operations. 6) The Controller, who has the task of verifying that the internal control system is always adequate, fully operational and functional.

The controller reports on the way risk management is handled, 172 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 in compliance with the plans established to contain such risks and, in compliance with the legally prescribed terms and procedures, to the Internal Control Committee, the executive director in charge of overseeing the functioning of the internal control system, and the Board of Statutory Auditors and states his opinion on the suitability of the internal control system to achieve an acceptable overall risk profile. 7) Compliance committee, who is responsible for continuously overseeing the effective functioning and enforcement of the organizational, management and control model pursuant to Leg.

Finally, against this background and in connection with the duties assigned by law, the Board of Statutory Auditors oversees, among other things, the financial disclosure process and the effectiveness of the internal control system, the internal audit and the risk management. The circulation and integration of the information produced in the various areas is ensured by a structured information flow. In this sense, an important role is played, for example, by the quarterly report of the manager in charge, setting out, among other things, the results of the activities undertaken, problems that came out, the action plans established and their progress. THE CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RULES Italcementi complies with the Code of Conduct of the Italian Corporate Governance committee, promoted by the Italian stock exchange, Borsa Italiana S.p.A., since its first edition. The Company adopted its own Code of Conduct (the “Code”), last updated by the Company Board of Directors in February 2007, which constitutes a self-regulation system including legal and regulatory framework provisions, which Italcementi S.p.A. and its corporate bodies voluntarily comply with. Its end is to highlight the corporate governance model of the Company established to achieve its primary goal of maximizing value for shareholders. The Code is based on the Code of Conduct, in its version of March 2006. The Code of Conduct of the Italian Corporate Governance committee was updated in March 2010 with reference to the sole art. 7 and, further, in December 2011, it has been completely renewed also to the extent of eliminating discrepancies with current law provisions. The Company, although it did not include the new art. 7 provisions (subsequently remunerated in art. 6) in its Code, has already been complying with them, submitting to the examination (i) of the Board of Directors in March 2011, upon proposal of the Remuneration Committee, the Remuneration policy for directors, officers and managers vested with special powers and (ii) of the shareholders at their meeting in April 2011, the Report on remuneration policy. On the other hand, the Company will comply with the new recommendations within the deadline envisaged therein. The Code envisages the establishment of corporate bodies and offices as well as the adoption of specific procedures and conduct, with the sole exceptions described below and with the amendments required by the specific features of Italcementi S.p.A. The Board of Directors, moreover, is always willing to assess further trends introduced in the Code of Conduct and their possible implementation in the Company’s Corporate Governance system, provided that, in respect with the current company situation, the recommendations allow the Company’s standing with investors to be further enhanced. 173 www.italcementigroup.com A) ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE Board of Directors The Company by-laws provide for the company to be managed by a Board of Directors consisting of 11 up to 21 directors who serve for the period established on their appointment, and in any case no more than three financial years, and who terminate their office on the date of the shareholders’ meeting called to approve the financial statements for the final year of their appointment, they may be re-elected. The Company by-laws, in compliance with the law currently in force, provide for the appointment of the Board of Directors to occur on the basis of lists that ensure for minority shareholders the minimum number of directors envisaged by the law. In addition, the Code of Conduct recommends that this must occur in accordance with a transparent procedure to ensure, among other things, timely and adequate information on the personal and professional skills of candidates. The lists must be filed at the company head offices at least 25 days before the date set for the shareholders’ meeting on first or single call; this, together with the conditions and minimum stake required to file the lists, must be mentioned in the notice of call. Lists may be filed only by shareholders who, alone or together with other shareholders, are able to provide evidence that they hold a percentage of the share capital with voting rights no lower than that determined by CONSOB pursuant to the regulations in force. For 2012, the threshold established for the presentation of candidates’ lists for the election of the Board of Directors of Italcementi S.p.A. is 2% of the ordinary share capital. No shareholder may file or participate in the filing of more than one list, directly or through third parties or trust company, or vote for different lists. Shareholders belonging to the same group and shareholders who join a shareholders’ agreement on the Company shares may not file or vote for more than one list, neither through third party or trust companies. Lists filed in violation of these restrictions will not be accepted. Each candidate may be filed on one list only under penalty of ineligibility. At the time of their filing, lists must include: a) statements by which individual candidates: * accept their candidature * under his/her own responsibility state: the non-existence of causes for ineligibility entitlement of the good reputation requirements established by the law entitlement of the independence qualification required by the law and by the Code of Conduct, if any; b) a brief resume on the personal and professional skills of each candidate with indication of their position as director and statutory auditor in other companies; c) information on the identity of shareholders who have presented lists. The intermediary certification or statement proving ownership of the shareholding prescribed by the law in force when the list is presented may also be produced after the filing of the list provided that it reaches the Company within the term envisaged by the regulation in force for the publication of lists by the Company; d) a statement of the shareholders who do not hold, even jointly, a controlling or majority stake, bearing witness to the absence of any connection with the majority shareholder, as defined by the law in force. 174 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 The Company by-laws do not provide for good reputation or independence qualification requirements additional to those required for the Statutory Auditors by TUF. A list filed not in compliance with the above provisions will be considered as not presented. At least 21 days before the shareholders’ meeting date, the Company shall make available at the Company premises, at the stock exchange and on its website, the lists of candidates which have been filed by shareholders along with supporting documentation. In the event of filing of more than one list: all the directors are elected from the list that obtains the highest number of votes at the shareholders’ meeting, in the order in which they are listed, except for the minimum number reserved by law for the minority shareholders’ list; the minimum number of directors reserved by law to minority shareholders are elected from the minority shareholders’ list that obtains the highest number of votes and is not connected in any way, directly or indirectly, with the majority shareholders; should more than one list obtain the same number of votes, a runoff is held on these lists among all the shareholders present at the shareholders’ meeting, and the candidates are elected from the list that obtains the majority of the share capital represented at the shareholders’ meeting. For the purposes of the apportioning of the directors to be elected, the lists that have not achieved a percentage of votes at least equal to half of the percentage required for the presentation of lists will not be considered. Should a party connected to a majority shareholder vote for a list of the minority shareholders, the connection is significant for the purposes of excluding the minority shareholders’ elected director, only if this vote was crucial for the election of the said director. Should a single list be presented, all the candidates included in that list are elected with a simple majority vote of the share capital represented at the shareholders’ meeting. In the absence of lists, and whenever by means of the voting list mechanism, the number of candidates elected is lower than the minimum number envisaged by the by-laws, the Board of Directors is respectively appointed or supplemented by the shareholders at their meeting with the legal majority, provided that at least the minimum number of directors holding the independence qualification required by the law is guaranteed. If during the year, owing to resignation or other reasons, one or more directors cease to serve, the others, provided that the majority is still represented by directors appointed by the shareholders at their meeting, shall arrange to replace them by means of a resolution approved by the Board of Statutory Auditors. Directors are replaced, in compliance with the above requirements of good reputation and independence, with the appointment of unelected candidates belonging to the same list as the directors who no longer serve, following the original order of presentation. Should this not be possible, the Board of Directors shall act pursuant to the law. Directors appointed in this manner hold office until the following shareholders’ meeting. The shareholders’ meeting resolve upon the replacement of directors, in compliance with the above principles, with a simple majority of the share capital represented at the shareholders’ meeting. The term of directors appointed by this way ends at the same time as that of the directors serving at the time of their appointment. 175 www.italcementigroup.com No limits to re-eligibility of directors are envisaged, although directors holding the same position for more than nine years in the last twelve years could be considered on voluntary basis no longer to meet the independence qualification pursuant to the Code of Conduct. Pursuant to the current regulations, at least one of the members of the Board of Directors, or two if the Board of Directors consists of more than seven members, must be vested with the independence qualification established by the law for the members of the Board of Statutory Auditors, while the law requires all directors to meet the good reputation requirements established by the Minister of Justice for statutory auditors’ regulation. The Code, as stated by the Corporate Governance Committee, requires an adequate number of non-executive directors to be independent in the sense that they do not have, nor have recently had, directly or indirectly, relationships with the company or with parties linked to it, such as to influence their independence of judgment. Should an elected director during their term of office no longer satisfy the good reputation requirements established by the law or the by-laws, their office shall terminate. Should the independence criteria prescribed by the law no longer be met, the director concerned must immediately inform the Board of Directors. In the event, the office of the director shall terminate, except in cases where such criteria are still held by at least the minimum number of directors envisaged by the current regulation. No exception to the ban on competition envisaged by art. 2390 of the Italian Civil Code has been authorized by the shareholders’ meeting or is envisaged by the Company by-laws. Moreover, no director is a shareholder with unlimited responsibility in competitors or runs a competing business on their own or on behalf of third parties, or is a director or chief operating officer in competitors. Pursuant to the Company by-laws, the Board of Directors is vested with full powers of ordinary and extraordinary company management. It may, therefore, perform all acts which it deems necessary to achieve the business purpose with the sole exclusion of those expressly reserved by law to the shareholders’ meeting. Besides the powers vested with the Board of Directors by law and by the Company by-laws regarding the issue of shares and bonds, in compliance with art. 2436 of the Italian Civil Code, resolutions on the matters listed below are assigned not only to the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting, but also to the Board of Directors: incorporation of wholly owned or at least ninety percent owned companies; transfer of the registered office, provided that it remains within Italy; establishment or removal of secondary offices, in Italy and abroad; reduction of the share capital in the case of withdrawal by a shareholder; amendment of the company by-laws to comply with legal requirements. The Board of Directors, in compliance with the by-laws, meets at least once every quarter. At these meetings, the executive directors report to the Board and Board of Statutory Auditors on significant transactions undertaken in execution of the powers granted to them. The Code underlines the key role played by the Board of Directors and sets out and supplements its specific duties which include, among other things: the assignment and termination of delegated powers to senior officers; the evaluation and approval of strategic, business and financial plans as well as the assessment of business forecasts and the adequacy of the organizational, administrative and general accounting arrangements of the company and subsidiaries; the examination and approval of the accounting entries for the period; the prior evaluation and approval of strategic transactions; the assessment of the company operational structure; the determination of the remuneration of directors vested with special powers and the manager in 176 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 charge of preparing the company’s financial reports; reports presented at shareholders’ meetings; the examination and approval of the Corporate Governance system. In addition, the Board of Directors is required to evaluate and approve in advance: the transactions with related parties undertaken by the company itself and by its subsidiaries when such transactions are of strategic or financial importance for Italcementi S.p.A.; other transactions with related parties when expressly required by the specific company procedure and in compliance with the methods therein. Finally, the Board of Directors must review, at least once a year, the size, composition and functioning of the Board itself and of its Committees. The Board of Directors mainly consists of non-executive members and among these a sufficient number are independent. Should the Chairman of the Board of Directors be the primary officer responsible for company management, as also whenever the position of Chairman is held by the person who controls the company, the Code envisages that the Board appoints an independent director as the “lead independent director”, to be a reference for and to coordinate the requests and contributions of non-executive directors and, in particular, independent directors. The Chairman coordinates the activities and chairs meetings of the Board of Directors and ensures that its members are provided in due time with information on the related important items in order to assure a useful attendance, subject to any needs of urgency or confidentiality. To this extent, the supporting documentation on the items on the agenda is sent by e-mail to each member of both the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors some days before each meeting (generally two days before the meeting). Moreover, when the supporting documentation is particularly complex and/or heavy, explanatory notes are provided with. In addition, the Chairman, through the competent company departments, acts to ensure that the directors take part in initiatives aimed at increasing their knowledge of the company and its dynamics and are informed about the main amendments to the legislative and regulatory framework concerning the company and its corporate bodies. Directors act and pass informed resolutions independently, pursuing the primary goal of creating value for shareholders. They accept their offices acknowledging that they can devote the due time to diligent performance of their duties. Pursuant to the Code, effective performance of the duties of director is deemed to be consistent with no more than: 5 offices as executive director, 10 offices as non-executive director or independent director or statutory auditor in companies listed also abroad on regulated markets, in financial, banking, insurance or major companies, excluding subsidiaries of Italcementi S.p.A., parents and companies subject to joint control. A list of the positions as director, statutory auditor, and chief operating officer held by each director in other companies listed on regulated markets, in financial, banking, insurance or major companies is set out below: Giampiero Pesenti * Italmobiliare S.p.A.

Legal representation – Executives According to the by-laws, legal representation of the Company vis-à-vis third parties and in lawsuits lies with the Chairman and, if appointed, the Deputy Chairman (or Deputy Chairmen) and the Chief Executive Officer (or Chief Executive Officers). The Board of Directors has granted to an Executive Committee all its powers, except those that the Italian Civil Code and the by-laws do not allow to be delegated. The resolutions of the Executive Committee are reported to the Board of Directors at the first following meeting. The Board of Directors has appointed an Executive Deputy Chairman, a Deputy Chairman, a Chief Executive Officer and a Chief Operating Officer. 179 www.italcementigroup.com The Code provides for the Board of Directors, at its first possible meeting and, in any case, at least on a quarterly basis, to be informed on the activities carried out by the Chief Executive Officer and the other executive directors, and in particular on the most important transactions with an impact on the financial statements undertaken by the company or by the subsidiaries, on the main transactions with related parties and those with a potential conflict of interest which have not been submitted to the Board for its prior approval. Upon proposal of the Remuneration committee, the Board of Directors, in the absence of those directly concerned, establishes the remuneration, grants monetary benefits for directors vested with special powers in compliance with the articles of association, based on the opinion of the Board of Statutory Auditors and, when required, upon further evaluation of the Committee for Transactions with Related Parties. A significant part of the remuneration of the Chairman, Executive Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is tied to business results and to achievement of specific targets. A consistent approach and coordination of activities are ensured by the presence of the Chairman, Executive Deputy Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, directors or officers of Italcementi S.p.A. on the Boards of Directors of the main subsidiaries. Transactions with related parties Without prejudice to the provisions of the Procedure for Transactions with Related Parties last approved by the Board of Directors in its session of November 2010, transactions with related parties must be carried transparently and in compliance with the criteria of formal and substantial accuracy. Therefore, directors who have an interest, even if only potential or indirect, in a transaction are required to: a) provide timely and exhaustive information to the Board on the existence of the interest and on its circumstances; b) to leave the Board meeting at the time the resolution is taken. In specific circumstances, however, the Board of Directors may allow the participation of the director concerned in the discussion and/or the vote. Moreover, according to the by-laws and the above mentioned procedure, the Board of Directors may undertake significant transactions with related parties notwithstanding a negative opinion of the Committee for Transactions with Related Parties, upon authorization of the shareholders’ meeting, provided that, without prejudice to the majorities of law, the shareholders who are not related parties present at the meeting represent at least 10% of the share capital and those do not vote against the transaction (the so-called “whitewash”). In cases of urgency, the Board of Directors, or the competent body, may, directly or through subsidiaries, execute transactions with related parties, that are not under the prerogatives of the shareholders’ meeting and do not require its authorization, by applying the simplified rules envisaged by the Procedure for Transactions with related parties adopted by the Company. Appointment of committees Italcementi S.p.A., in its own Code, provides for the Board of Directors to appoint a Remuneration committee and an Internal control committee from among its members. Their resolutions are of advisory or propositional role and do not bind the following Board resolutions. 180 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 The Committees shall be composed of no fewer than three members and, in carrying out their duties, may access the supporting corporate information and functions, and also request the assistance of external advisors. Each Committee elects its own Chairman and a secretary (who is not required to be a member of the committee) and meets at request of its Chairman or his/her delegate. The meeting may be called informally (including by unwritten means). The meetings of each committee are validly convened with the participation of the majority of its members, in person or via an audio or video-conference link. Each committee carries resolutions by an absolute majority vote of the members participating at the meeting. The Remuneration committee, consisting of non-executive directors, the majority of whom are independent, has the task of proposing to the Board, in the absence of those directly involved, the remuneration of directors vested with special powers, as well as of the Chief Operating Officer and Officers with strategic responsibilities. It also enforces their application on the basis of the information supplied by the executive directors. The Remuneration committee also performs additional advisory functions on remuneration and related matters which the Board of Directors may request from time to time. The Internal control committee, consisting of independent directors, has the task, in addition to the above, of verifying, together with the manager in charge of preparing the company’s financial reports and the external auditors, the correct application of accounting policies and their consistency for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements; of expressing, at request of the Chief Executive Officer, opinions on specific aspects regarding identification of the main company risks as well as the planning, realization and management of the internal control system; of examining the activities’ program and periodic reports prepared by the Controller. In addition, the Internal control committee performs further duties assigned by the Board of Directors and reports, at least on a half-yearly basis, during approval of the yearly and half-yearly reports, on the activities undertaken and on the adequacy of the internal control system. The Internal Control committee also supports the Board of Directors with the activities related to the functioning of the internal control system. The meetings of the committee are attended by the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors or other auditor appointed by him/her; the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer may also take part, as well as, if invited, the Chief Operating Officer, the internal control staff and the heads of other company functions. Among the committees recommended by the Corporate Governance Committee, the Italcementi S.p.A. Code does not provide for a «Nomination committee», given that the shareholding structure of the Company has a permanent majority shareholder holding the absolute majority of voting rights. Moreover, the appointment of the Board of Directors is now governed by the Company by-laws which envisage, among other things, that upon presentation of the list a brief resume is attached for each candidate with their personal and professional skills. These resumes, pursuant to the law and the Code, must be duly published on the company website; in addition, it is now current practice that during the shareholders’ meeting the Chairman or, at their request, the Chief Executive Officer provide data and professional details on candidates and their eligibility as independent directors. Further, in inviting issuers to evaluate the setting-up of a Nomination committee within the Board of Directors, the Corporate Governance Committee stated that “... this solution has its origin in systems with widespread shareholdings, to ensure an adequate level of independence of the directors in relation to management ...”. 181 www.italcementigroup.com Lastly, the Board of Directors, in compliance with the regulation envisaged for transactions with related parties, set up from among its members, during the adoption of the related procedure, a Committee for Transactions with Related Parties, which consists of independent directors only and the composition of which coincides with that of the Internal control committee. The Committee for Transactions with Related Parties has the task of assessing the formal and substantial accuracy of the transactions undertaken directly by the Company, or through its subsidiaries, with other related parties. The members of the Committee were asked to express their approval on the procedure prior to its adoption. The committee elects its own Chairman and, at the latter’s request, a secretary who is not necessarily a member of the committee and who has the task of preparing the minutes of meetings. The members of the committee for Transactions with Related Parties are required to promptly declare the existence of any dealings in relation to the specific transaction with related parties, in order to permit application of the equivalent controls. In order for the meetings of the committee to be valid, it is necessary for the majority of the serving members to be present. The meetings of the committee can also be held using broadcasting technology channels. The committee passes resolutions with the majority of those with voting rights. Lead independent director The Code envisages, in relation to independent directors, that should the Chairman of the Board of Directors be the primary officer responsible for company management, and also when the position of Chairman is held by the person who controls the company, the Board appoints an independent director as «Lead independent director», to provide a reference for and coordinate requests and contributions of non-executive directors and, in particular, independent directors. At the meeting of April 16, 2010, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Alberto Clô, an independent director, as «Lead independent director». Control system For this information on the Internal control system, please refer to section «Features of the Risk management and internal control system regarding the financial disclosure process». Executive director responsible for overseeing the internal control system With reference to the control system, during the meeting of April 16, 2010, pursuant to the Code and with the assistance of the Internal control committee, the Board of Directors appointed the Chief Executive Officer as the executive director responsible for overseeing the internal control system. Manager in charge of preparing the company’s financial reports The Consolidated Law on Finance (TUF) provides that, within the corporate organization of companies listed on regulated markets which have Italy as their homemember state, should be appointed a manager in charge of preparing the company’s financial reports who is assigned with specific responsibilities, in particular for corporate disclosure. On April 16th, 2010, the Board of Directors confirmed Carlo Giuseppe Bianchini, the head of Central Group Administration & Control, as Manager in charge of preparing the company’s financial reports, pursuant to art. 154-bis of TUF and art. 30 of the Company by-laws. The office of Mr. Bianchini will end with the term of the current Board of Directors, i.e., with the approval of the financial statements for 2012. 182 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 Pursuant to the Company by-laws, the Manager in charge of preparing the company’s financial reports must: 1) be a manager and meets the good reputation requirements established by law for the members of the Board of Directors; 2) have at least three consecutive years’ experience in the exercise of administrative/accounting and/or financial and/or control activities at the company and/or its subsidiaries and/or at other joint stock companies. At the time of the appointment, the Board of Directors provided the Manager in charge with autonomous financial resources to exercise the powers granted to him and with the duty of reporting half-yearly to the Board of Directors on the resources utilized. Furthermore, the Board, upon proposal of the Remuneration committee, defines, at the time of the appointment and then annually, the remuneration of the Manager in charge. Board of Statutory Auditors The Code takes up and supplements the laws and by-laws with reference to the appointment of the Board of Statutory Auditors which shall occur in accordance with a transparent procedure guaranteeing, among other things, timely and adequate information on the personal and professional skills of the candidates. The Board of Statutory Auditors is appointed on the basis of lists aimed at ensuring for minority shareholders the appointment of one acting auditor and one substitute auditor. Lists must be filed at the company head offices or by sending notice to the address of certified electronic mail indicated in the notice of call, at least 25 days before the date set for the shareholders’ meeting in first or single call; this, together with the means and minimum stake required to file the lists, must be mentioned in the notice of call. Lists may be presented only by shareholders who, alone or together with other shareholders, are able to provide evidence that they hold a percentage of the share capital with voting rights no lower than that determined by CONSOB pursuant to the regulations in force for the appointment of the Board of Directors. For 2012, the established threshold is 2% of the ordinary share capital. No shareholder may file or participate in the presentation of more than one list, directly or through a third party or trust company, or vote for different lists. Shareholders belonging to the same group and shareholders who join a shareholders’ agreement on the company shares may not file or vote for more than one list, neither through a third party or trust companies. Lists filed in violation of these restrictions will not be accepted. Each candidate may be filed on one list only under penalty of ineligibility. At the time of their filing, lists must include: a) statements by which individual candidates: * accept their candidature * under his/her own responsibility state: entitlement of the professional requirements envisaged by the by-laws, the non-existence of causes for ineligibility or incompatibility, entitlement of the good reputation requirements established by the law, entitlement of the independence criteria required by the law and by the Code of Conduct; 183 www.italcementigroup.com b) a brief resume on the personal and professional skills of each candidate with an indication of their position as director and statutory auditor in other companies; c) information on the identity of the shareholders who have presented lists. The certification or statement proving ownership of the shareholding prescribed by the law in force when the list is presented may also be produced further to the file of the list provided that it reaches the company within the term envisaged by the regulation in force for the publication of lists by the company; d) a statement by the shareholders who do not hold, even jointly, a controlling or majority stake, bearing witness to the absence of any connection, as defined by the law in force. A filed list that does not comply with the above provisions will be considered as not presented. In the event that, by the deadline of 25 days preceding the date of the shareholders’ meeting, a single list has been filed, or only lists presented by shareholders who are connected to each other pursuant to current regulations, further lists can be presented until the following third day and the participation threshold indicated in the notice of call will be halved. At least 21 days before the date envisaged for the shareholders’ meeting which is called to appoint the Board of Statutory Auditors, the Company shall make available at the company head offices, at the Italian stock exchange and on its website, the lists of candidates which have been submitted by shareholders and the belonging documentation. In the event of filing of more than one list: the list that obtains the highest number of votes at the shareholders' meeting elects two acting auditors and two substitute auditors, in the order in which they are listed in the sections of the list; the minority shareholders’ list that obtains the highest number of votes among the lists presented and voted by shareholders who are not connected in any way, directly or indirectly, with the majority shareholders, elects the third acting auditor and the third substitute auditor, in the order in which they are listed in the sections of the list; should more than one list obtain the same number of votes, a runoff is held on these lists among all the shareholders present at the shareholders’ meeting, and the candidates are elected from the list that obtains the majority of the share capital represented at the shareholders’ meeting. Should a party connected to a majority shareholder vote for a list of the minority shareholders, the connection is relevant for the purposes of excluding the minority shareholders’ elected auditor only if this vote was crucial for the election of the said auditor. Should a single list be presented, all the candidates included in that list are elected with a majority vote of the share capital represented at the shareholders’ meeting. Should no lists be presented, the shareholders’ meeting appoints the Board of Statutory Auditors with a majority vote of the share capital represented at the shareholders’ meeting. The chairmanship of the Board of Statutory Auditors lies with the person indicated in first place on the list presented and voted by the minority shareholders, or to the first name in the single list presented or to the person appointed as such by the shareholders’ meeting should no lists be presented. Pursuant to the by-laws of Italcementi S.p.A., those who are in situations of incompatibility as envisaged by the law or those who have exceeded the limit of engagements established by the regulation in force, cannot be elected as auditors, and if elected cease to serve. 184 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 Should an elected auditor during his/her term of office no longer satisfy the requirements envisaged by the law or the by-laws, his/her office shall terminate. When it is necessary to replace an acting auditor, the substitute auditor belonging to the same list as the removed auditor takes over. In their absence, in accordance with the original order of presentation, the candidate from the same list as the ceased auditor takes over, without taking the initial section into account. Should the replacement concern the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors, the position will be taken over by the auditor of the minority shareholders. Auditors appointed in this manner hold office until the following shareholders’ meeting. Should it be necessary to supplement the Board of Statutory Auditors: to replace an auditor elected from the majority shareholders list, the appointment takes place with a simple majority vote of the share capital represented at the shareholders’ meeting, choosing among the candidates indicated in the original majority list; to replace an auditor elected from the minority shareholders list, the appointment takes place with a simple majority vote of the share capital represented at the shareholders’ meeting, choosing among the candidates indicated in the original minority shareholders’ list; for the simultaneous replacement of auditors elected in the majority and the minority shareholders’ lists, the appointment occurs with a simple majority vote of the share capital represented at the shareholders’ meeting, choosing among the candidates indicated in the list belonging to which each auditor was part of, with a number of auditors equal to the number of ceased auditors belonging to the same list. Whenever would not be possible to proceed as above, the shareholders’ meeting called to supplement the Board of Statutory Auditors passes a resolution with a simple majority of the share capital represented at the shareholders’ meeting, without prejudice to the principle by which one acting auditor and one substitute auditor must be appointed by minority shareholders . In any case, the Chairmanship of the Board of Statutory Auditors must be assigned to the auditor representing the minority shareholders. Auditors shall accept their appointment when they believe they can devote the appropriate time to the diligent performance of their duties. The Code recommends the statutory auditors to be chosen among those who qualify as independent on the basis of the criteria provided for directors and, as mentioned above, upon filing of the list they submit a statement to confirm that they meet the independence criteria. The Board of Statutory Auditors shall verify the proper application of and compliance with these criteria upon appointment and then annually; the outcome of this assessment and of that performed by the Board of Directors to assess the independence criteria of directors so defined will be disclosed in the corporate governance report or in the auditors’ report to the shareholders’ meeting. The Code states that auditors, too, are bound by an obligation of confidentiality and are prohibited by law from using, directly or indirectly, confidential information for immediate or future personal or financial gain. Besides the duties envisaged by the law and the by-laws, the Code requires the Board of Statutory Auditors to: a) oversee the independence of the external auditors by verifying both compliance with relevant laws and the nature and extent of services other than account auditing provided to the company and its subsidiaries by the external auditors and companies belonging to its group; 185 www.italcementigroup.com b) evaluate the proposals made by external auditors for their appointment to this position, as well as the audit plan and the results set out in their report and any letter of recommendations; c) oversee the effectiveness of the audit process. Under the Code of Conduct approved by the Corporate Governance Committee, these last two duties could have been entrusted to the Internal control committee rather than to the Board of Statutory Auditors. The Company believed to be more consistent with the actual functions of the corporate bodies the assignment of these duties to the Board of Statutory Auditors, which already reviews the proposals of the external auditors and their activity program and, pursuant to the current regulations, proposes the engagement and termination of the external auditors at the shareholders' meeting; finally, this interpretation has been confirmed by Leg. Dec. 39/2010 by which VIII directive on statutory audits has been acknowledged in Italy. The Code provide for the Auditor who has, directly or through third parties, any interest in a specific Company transaction, to timely and exhaustively inform the other Auditors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors about nature, terms, cause and value of his/her interest. Shareholders’ Meetings The Code envisages that all the Directors regularly attend shareholders’ meetings and encourage and facilitate the broadest possible participation by shareholders smoothing the process of exercising voting rights. To this extent, the Board of Directors reports to the shareholders’ meeting on the fulfillment of their duties as performed and planned and ensures shareholders to have adequate information in order to them to wellinformed resolve upon the matters within their prerogatives. Shareholders who hold voting rights as certified by the communication envisaged by law and received by the Company no later than the end of the third trading day prior to the date set for the shareholders’ meeting on first or single call, are entitled to vote and attend shareholders' meetings. The legitimacy to vote and attend shareholders’ meetings is in any case entrusted with when the company has received the communication after the terms fixed by current regulations, provided that this is before the beginning of the proceedings for each individual meeting. For each shareholders’ meeting the Company may appoint, with a specific indication in the notice of call, a subject to whom entitled shareholders may confer a proxy, with voting instructions on all or some of the items on the agenda, as envisaged by the current regulations. No regulations have been envisaged for the proceedings of shareholders’ meeting since the broad powers assigned to the Chairman by law and current practices, as well as the by-law (art. 13) that expressly grants to the Chairman the power to lead the discussions, keep order and establish the voting method, as long as pursuant to disclosed proceeds, are considered adequate tools for the orderly running of shareholders’ meetings. Relationships with institutional investors and shareholders The Company seeks continuous dialogue with shareholders, based on a mutual understanding of their respective roles. To this end, the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, within their respective corporate duties and assignments, provide for the general guidelines to be adopted by company departments in dealings with institutional investors and other shareholders. To this extent, the Investor relations function, lead by Mr. Giancarlo Berera, has been established within the Group Finance department. In addition to that and in order to provide timely and easy access to company information and thus allow shareholders to exercise their rights well-informed, a specific website section has been created, in which 186 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 corporate information and documentations are available, in particular the procedures to participate and exercise voting rights at shareholders’ meetings, documentation relating to the items on the agenda, including Reports on the latter, lists of candidates to director and statutory auditor positions, with their curricula, financial reports, press releases issued by the company pursuant to the Consolidated Law on Finance, the corporate calendar, etc. B) IMPLEMENTATION OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RULES Board of Directors composition and its meetings The shareholders’ meeting of April 16, 2010, appointed the Board of Directors for 2010 2012, setting the number of members at 19. On that occasion, in compliance with the procedure set out in the Company by-laws, two lists of candidates were presented, one by the majority shareholder, Italmobiliare S.p.A., the other by the minority shareholder First Eagle Investment Management LLC. Therefore, among the elected directors, 18 represented the majority shareholder and one the minority. The Board of Directors, at its first meeting upon appointment and then annually during examination of the draft financial statements for the year, assessed, in compliance with the Code, the good reputation and independence qualification of its members taking into account the information supplied by each director. With reference to the independence evaluation, the Board agreed upon the declaration provided by Mr. Ettore Rossi, Mr. Attilio Rota and Mr. Emilio Zanetti, who considered themselves to be vested with the independence qualification despite the fact that they hold the office for more than 9 years out of the last 12 years. The outcome of this assessment has been disclosed to the market and is underlined in the Corporate Bodies table at the premise of this Report as well as in the table attached to this section. The shareholders’ meeting of April 19, 2011 increased the Board of Directors’ members up to 20 directors appointing Mr. Renato Guerini, later named Deputy Chairman on September 15. Following the early decease of director Mr. Pietro Ferrero, occurred on April 18, 2011, the Board of Directors, at its meeting of May 5 , 2011, according to art. 16 of the by-laws, co-opted Mr. Carlo Garavaglia, first and sole remaining candidate of the list presented by the majority shareholder at the time of appointing the Board members currently in office. On April 27, 2011, Mr. Antonio Carosi, sole candidate of the list presented by the minority shareholder First Eagle Investment Management LLC, resigned from his office. The Board of Directors, retained the opportunity of ensuring, also at this stage, the minority representation at the Board, asked the sole minority shareholder who presented the list directly to get proposals on the replacement of the resigning director. During the Board meeting of July 29, 2011, Mr. Giulio Antonello was then co-opted. As envisaged by the Code, on March 2, 2012, the Board of Directors assessed the size, composition and functioning of the Board and its Committees. To this extent, the Company circulated among the directors a self-evaluation questionnaire made up of statements, for which their level of agreement has been marked. The outcome of this assessment and the comments, sometimes expressed, showed a clearly positive judgment on the functioning of the Board of Directors and its Committees. In particular, note was made of the following: i) the Board of Directors is made up of an adequate numbers of non-executive and independent directors so that their judgment has a particular weight on the adoption of the resolutions, ii) the Chairman ensures a proper management of the discussions, giving each member the same 187 www.italcementigroup.com time to express their point of view, and iii) the information flow among Board of Directors, Statutory Auditors and External auditors is positive and fruitful. During 2011 the Board of Directors met 6 times in total; 16 directors, of whom 7 independents, attended all the meetings, 2 directors, both independent, attended 5 meetings, 1 independent director attended 4 meetings, 1 director attended 3 meetings. The average length of meetings of the Board of Directors held during the year was of approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes. The entire Board of Statutory Auditors attended 5 of the meetings; two auditors were present at the other meeting. Upon invitation, the Chief Operating Officer of the Company attended all the meetings of the Board of Directors, as did the Manager in charge of preparing the company’s financial reports. Moreover, some officers of the Company and of subsidiaries and managers responsible for Company functions, from time to time involved, took part at the meetings to refer upon the items on the agenda of their fields. The Board, at the time of examining and approving the periodic financial reports, also evaluated the overall management’s performance, taking into account information provided by the executives and comparing results achieved with ones targeted. During 2012 the Board of Directors has so far met twice, the first time to examine revenues for 2011 and the outlook for 2012, the second to approve – among other things – the draft financial statements for 2011. During the year no fewer than a further three meetings are currently planned to approve the interim accounts. During 2011 the Executive committee has so far met twice, once with all its members present and the other time with the attendance of 5 members. The average length of meetings of the Executive committee held during the year was of approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes. During 2012, Executive committee has not met yet. During 2011, the «Lead independent director» met once with the other independent directors. Assignment of duties and granting of powers The Italcementi S.p.A. Board of Directors has 16 non-executive directors out of a total of 20. Among the nonexecutive directors, 10 are independent. The Chairman, the Executive Deputy Chairman and the Deputy Chairman are deemed as executive directors in consideration of the duties and powers granted to them. The Chief Executive Officer belongs to the executive directors. The Board of Directors, upon his/her appointment, determines duties and powers and sets any quantitative limits on the exercise of such powers. The granting of powers (including those of the Chief Operating Officer) is based on the principle of segregation of duties. The granting of powers, i.e., the assignment of operational powers to one or more directors and/or to the Executive Committee does not exclude the prerogative of the Board of Directors, which in any case holds a greater power of guidance and control over the general business of the company in its various aspects. Three of the 6 members of the Executive Committee, are executive directors; the others, two of whom independent, are, in any case, deemed non-executive directors. That because the Company’s Executive Committee does not meet on a regular basis and in fact only meets when it is necessary to promptly adopt specific resolutions. The Code of Conduct promoted by Borsa Italiana S.p.A., also, agrees with this interpretation provided that, as in this case, the director is not granted individual executive powers. 188 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 Legal representation of the Company is granted by the by-laws, severally, to the Chairman, Deputy Chairman (or Deputy Chairmen) and to the Chief Executive Officer (or Chief Executive Officers).

Composition and activities of the Committees The Remuneration committee is made up of three non-executive members, the majority of whom independent. All of them are vested with a specific competence on financial and accounting matters, as envisaged by the Code of conduct for at least one member. During the fiscal year, it met 5 times; the average length of its meetings was of approximately 1 hour. All the members took part in all the meetings, while the entire Board of Statutory Auditors attended 2 of the meetings; one auditor at least was present at the other meetings. The committee, in the absence of the recipients, examined, and then approved, the Remuneration policy for executive directors, other directors vested with special powers and key management personnel and proposed the remuneration to be granted to them at the Board of Directors. The Chief of Human resources and organizational development department is always invited to participate at the meetings. During 2012 the Remuneration committee has so far met twice, to resolve upon the proposals to the Board of Directors on the remuneration of Directors and Officers as well as on the remuneration for 2012 of the Controller, upon proposal of the executive director responsible for overseeing the functioning of the internal control system in agreement with the Chairman of the Internal control committee. The Internal control committee consists of four members, all non-executive and independent. All of them are vested with specific competence in financial and accounting matters, as envisaged by the Code of conduct for at least one member. 191 www.italcementigroup.com During 2011 the Internal control committee met 5 times; the average length of its meetings was of approximately 1 hour and 35 minutes. All the members attended 4 meetings and one was held with one member absent; the Board of Statutory Auditors attended with two of its members at 4 of the meetings; at the other one it was present in its whole. The Committee was updated on developments in the legal proceedings concerning the subsidiary Calcestruzzi S.p.A. (whose seizure has been revoked following the decision of the court of Caltanissetta on April 20, 2011); it examined the reports prepared by the Controller and by the external auditors to verify the adequacy, effectiveness and correct functioning of the internal control system, and reported to the Board of Directors during approval of the annual report and the half-year financial report, on the activities undertaken and on the adequacy of the internal control system. Some officers of the Company and of its subsidiaries and managers responsible for Company functions, from time to time involved, are invited to attend the meetings to refer upon the items on the agenda of their fields. During 2012 the Internal control committee has so far met twice, to examine, among others, the 2011 impairment test methodology and results, the accounting methods adopted to draft the 2011 consolidated financial statements, the final balance of 2011 audit and the three-year audit plan for 2012-2014. The Committee for Transactions with Related Parties is made up of four members, all of whom are nonexecutive and independent. During 2011 the Committee met 3 times, with all members present. The average length of its meetings was of approximately 1 hour and 25 minutes. The meetings of the Remuneration committee, the Internal control committee and the committee for Transactions with Related Parties were duly minuted. Internal control system The internal control system is defined as the set of rules, procedures and organizational structures designed to ensure, through adequate identification, measurement, management and monitoring of key risks, healthy and proper management of the company in line with objectives, thus guaranteeing the safekeeping of the company assets, the efficiency and effectiveness of company transactions, the reliability of financial information, and compliance with laws and regulations. The Board of Directors exercises its functions in relation to the internal control system based on national and international reference models and best practice and pays particular attention to the organizational, management and control model adopted pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231 of June 8, 2001. The Board of Directors, with the assistance of the Internal control committee, sets the guidelines for the internal control system so that the main risks regarding the Company and the subsidiaries are correctly identified and adequately measured, managed and monitored. It also sets the criteria to ensure the compatibility of these risks with correct and proper management of the Company and assesses, at least on an annual basis, the adequacy, effectiveness and functioning of the internal control system with respect to the characteristics of the Company. As envisaged by the Code, the executive director responsible for overseeing the functioning of the internal control system was actively involved, also with reference to the Risk & Compliance project described in the section «Risks and uncertainties» of this Report, to identify the main corporate risks and to verify the overall adequacy, effectiveness and efficiency of this system, by asking in particular the Controller to undertake specific controls of the procedures regarding both Italcementi S.p.A. and its subsidiaries. Some time ago, the Company set up an internal audit department. The Board of directors, upon proposal of the executive director responsible for overseeing the functioning of the internal control system and based on the positive opinion of the Internal control committee, confirmed as Controller, on its meeting of May 6, 2010, the 192 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 head of the internal audit department. The Controller, performing his duties, got access to all the necessary information to execute them. He reported periodically to the Internal control committee, the Board of Statutory Auditors as well as to the executive director responsible for overseeing the functioning of the internal control system. During 2011 the Controller implemented the audit plan, as presented to the Internal control committee, and undertook the appropriate measures within his duties, as assigned from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer in his capacity as the executive director responsible for overseeing the internal control system. During 2011 the executive director responsible for overseeing the internal control system attended – together with the Controller – the meetings of the Internal control committee of the Company. The Board of Directors, to which the Internal control committee reports on a half-yearly basis, deems the internal control system adequate for the structure and kind of Company and Group business. Board of Statutory Auditors During the renewal of the Board of Statutory Auditors at the shareholders’ meeting of April 17, 2009, the majority shareholder presented its own list of candidates. The minority shareholders did not present a list. Therefore, none of the auditors currently in office represents the minority shareholders. It is to be noted that, although the provisions of art. 148, par. 1-bis of TUF on the Board of Statutory Auditors composition are not in force yet, the actual composition of the Board of Statutory Auditors is already in compliance with this regulation as it is made up of two female acting auditors and one representing the male gender. As envisaged by the Code, during 2011, the Board of Statutory Auditors, among other things, oversaw the independence of the external auditors, by verifying both compliance with the relevant regulatory provisions and the nature and extent of the non-audit services provided to the Company and its subsidiaries by the external auditors and bodies belonging to their group. During the year, the internal audit manager took part in several meetings of the Board of Statutory Auditors, as the Board of Statutory Auditors attended all the meetings of the Internal control committee and of the Remuneration committee. This enabled a continuous information flow among the various bodies involved in monitoring the whole control system. 193 www.italcementigroup.com TABLE 1 STRUCTURE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES Committee for Executive Internal Control Remuneration Board of Directors Committee Committee Committee Transactions with Related Parties Non No. other Position Member Executives executives Indipend.

Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 TABLE 2 BOARD OF STATUTORY AUDITORS Position Member Attendance at meetings Chairman Maria Martellini 10/11 Acting Auditor Mario Comana 9/11 Acting Auditor Luciana Gattinoni 10/11 CODE OF ETHICS The Code, approved for the first time in 1993 and further modified, envisages that all employees and those who deal with the Group or act to achieve its objectives shall base their dealings and conduct on principles of honesty, fairness, integrity, transparency, confidentiality and mutual respect. To this end, at its meeting of February 2, 2001, the Italcementi Board of Directors approved the current version of the Code of Ethics which defines the rules for loyalty and fidelity, impartiality, protection of privacy and confidentiality of information, protection of people, the environment and company assets. The Code establishes the provisions which are the basis of the control processes and the accounting/operational information, and introduces rules to govern dealings with customers, suppliers, public institutions, political organizations and unions, and the media. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION In terms of managing confidential information, the Code, after recalling the obligation of confidentiality and the prohibition on using such information for personal gain, envisages the adoption of procedures for the disclosure of documents and information, with particular reference to price-sensitive information which may be disclosed only by people who are generally or specifically authorized to do so. At its meeting of February 2, 2001, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a specific procedure requiring strict compliance with the disclosure procedures and terms envisaged by the provisions in force, in full alignment with the principle of fairness and contextuality. Regarding relationships with institutional investors and other shareholders, based, as envisaged by the Code, on continuous attention, the organization notices issued by the Chief Executive Officer have established general guidelines and identified the Company structures dedicated to this activity. INTERNAL DEALING CODE OF CONDUCT The Company adopted its own ‘Internal Dealing Code of Conduct’, originally in application of the provisions issued by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. and then to take account of the new regulatory provisions adopted by CONSOB in execution of the new European regulation (so-called Market abuse) introduced by the Law on Savings of 2005. The ‘Internal Dealing Code of Conduct’ governs the information to be disclosed to the Company, and by the Company to the market, on any transactions involving Italcementi shares and other financial instruments connected to them undertaken by ‘Relevant persons’ on their own behalf. Pursuant to the ‘Internal Dealing Code of Conduct’, ‘Relevant persons’ are the members of the Board of Directors, the Board of Statutory Auditors and the Chief Operating Officer of Italcementi S.p.A. and any subject holding an equity investment of at least 10% of the voting share capital of Italcementi S.p.A., as well as any other subject who controls Italcementi S.p.A. In particular, ‘Relevant persons’ must inform Italcementi S.p.A., which in turn informs the market, about completed transactions of an aggregate amount crossing the 5,000 euro threshold by the end of the year. It is 195 www.italcementigroup.com to be noted that CONSOB, the Italian watchdog, with its resolution no. 18079 of last January 20, introduced an exemption to the disclosure of these transactions to the market establishing that only the further transactions executed during the year and crossing the previous mentioned threshold (5,000 euro) within the same reference period shall be disclosed. Given the particular structure of the Group, the ‘Internal Dealing Code of Conduct’ is associated with the Code adopted by Italmobiliare S.p.A., in the sense that market disclosures made by Italcementi S.p.A. regarding transactions on Italcementi shares by parties who are ‘Relevant persons’ for both companies, are considered as made also pursuant to the provisions contained in the Code of Conduct adopted by the parent company Italmobiliare S.p.A. In addition, the ‘Internal Dealing Code of Conduct’ envisages that ‘Relevant persons’ must abstain from transactions that are subject to disclosure to the Company: * during the 30 calendar days preceding the meeting of the Board of Directors of Italcementi S.p.A. called to approve the full-year and half-year financial statements, including the day on which the meeting is held; * during the 15 calendar days preceding the meeting of the Board of Directors of Italcementi S.p.A. called to approve the quarterly reports, including the day on which the meeting is held. PROCEDURE FOR TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES On November 5, 2010, based on the positive opinion of the specifically appointed Committee for Transactions with Related Parties, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the Procedure for Transactions with Related Parties envisaged by the CONSOB Regulation of March 12, 2010. The Procedure, in compliance also with art. 2391-bis of the Italian Civil Code, sets out the measures adopted by the Company to ensure that transactions undertaken with related parties, whether directly or through subsidiaries, are carried out transparently and in compliance with the criteria of substantial and procedural correctness. In particular, with the exception of some situations which are described below, the Procedure provides for the authorization process and the disclosure requirements for transactions between i) a party related to Italcementi, on the one hand, and ii) Italcementi, on the other, or one of its subsidiaries when, prior to completing the transaction, the prior examination or authorization by a corporate body of Italcementi or by an officer of Italcementi with relevant delegated powers is requested. The Procedure is also applied to transactions undertaken by Italcementi with a subsidiary or associate, as well as among its subsidiaries, when the transaction involves significant interests of a related party of Italcementi. The Procedure distinguishes «significant» transactions from «minor» transactions on the basis of specific quantitative criteria predetermined by CONSOB. This distinction is also relevant for the different kind of rules applicable on transparency transactions, which are simplified for minor transactions and more stringent for significant transactions, although both envisage prior opinion of the Committee for Transactions with Related Parties. The Committee has: the duty to give and explain its opinion on both minor (non-binding opinion) and significant (binding opinion) transactions; the right, for significant transactions, to take part in the negotiations and in the preliminary investigation stage through a complete and prompt information flow , and the right to ask for information and to submit its remarks to the delegated bodies and to those in charge of the negotiations or the preliminary investigation; 196 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 the right to seek the assistance, at the Company’s expense, of independent experts of its choosing. In the case of minor transactions, the Procedure envisages the right, in any case, to execute the transaction even if the Committee for Transactions with Related Parties expresses a negative opinion, provided that this is disclosed to the market through a specific document setting out the reasons for this divergence. For significant transactions, on the other hand, should the Committee express a negative opinion, the Board of Directors may approve the transaction only with the prior authorization of the shareholders’ meeting. Finally, in application of the determination powers provided by the CONSOB Regulation, the Company has identified the following main exemptions: transactions of a negligible amount (transactions that do not exceed 500,000 euro); ordinary transactions (which fall within the sphere of ordinary business and the related financial transactions of the Company and of the Group generally) provided that they are completed on arms-length terms and equivalent to market standards; transactions with or between subsidiaries or with associates, unless in the counterpart subsidiaries or associates there are significant interests of other related parties of the Company; urgent transactions. The Procedure is available on the company website at www.italcementigroup.com. At their meeting last year, in accordance with the proposal of the Board of Directors, the shareholders integrated the by-laws provisions stating that: x the significant transactions with related parties can be performed despite the negative opinion of the Committee for Transactions with related parties provided that the execution is authorized by the shareholders meeting and, without prejudice to the majorities of law, the non-related shareholders present at the shareholders’ meeting represent at least 10% of the share capital with voting rights and that a contrary vote is not expressed by the majority of the non-related shareholders (so called whitewash); x the Company may, in cases of urgency, execute transactions with related parties, that are not under the prerogatives of the shareholders’ meeting and do not require its authorization, by applying the simplified rules envisaged by the Procedure for Transactions with related parties. REGULATION OF THE MANAGER IN CHARGE OF PREPARING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL REPORTS As mentioned in another part of the report, the Company, in connection with Law no. 262/05, the so-called «Law on Savings», appointed a «Manager in charge of preparing the company’s financial reports» and adopted a specific «Regulation» which, in compliance with legal provisions, the by-laws and following current best practices, as well as taking into consideration the arrangements for similar activities at the parent company Italmobiliare S.p.A., among other things: * defines the responsibilities of the «Manager in charge» of Italcementi and specifies his/her related powers; * identifies the responsibilities and method for the appointment, removal and termination of office of the «Manager in charge», the length of service and the requirements in terms of professional skills and good reputation: * reports on the principles of conduct which the Company «Manager in charge» must comply with in the event of conflicts of interest as well as the confidentiality obligations to be observed in carrying out his/her activities; 197 www.italcementigroup.com * indicates the responsibilities, powers, and resources granted to the «Manager in charge» for the exercise of his/her duties, identifying the financial and human resources needed to carry out the mandate; * defines dealings with other Company bodies/functions, with the corporate bodies, the internal and external control bodies and with subsidiaries, as well as, in compliance with the mutual areas for independent action, the procedures for interrelating with the parent company Italmobiliare, regulating information flows; * recalls the general principles of the Operational model used by the Italcementi Group, which has been established in order to fulfill the regulatory provisions on preparing the financial reports; * illustrates the internal and external attestation process in reference to: a) the statements of the «Manager in charge» regarding the correspondence of the disclosed acts and communications of the Company to the documents and the accounting books and entries; b) the attestations of the «Manager in charge» and of the executives, relating to the financial statements, the limited half-year financial statements and the consolidated financial statements. The «Regulation» has been approved by the Board of Directors and refers to all the entities, functions, corporate bodies of Italcementi S.p.A., as well as all the companies that it directly or indirectly controls. The Regulation has been circulated to the staff of the Company, the subsidiaries, as well as to all those considered affected by its contents. ORGANIZATIONAL, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL MODEL In order to make the control system and Corporate Governance more effective, and prevent corporate offenses and offenses against the public administration, during 2004, in application of Legislative Decree no. 231/01, the Company Board of Directors adopted an «Organizational, management and control model» (the «Model»). This was subsequently updated in 2006 in line with the law on market abuse and failure to disclose a conflict of interest by directors. By adopting the «Model», the Company intends to disseminate and establish a corporate culture based on legality, with the express censure of all conduct contrary to the law and the regulations of the «Model». In 2008 the «Model» was also extended to crimes connected to violation of the laws on workplace health and safety, transnational crimes, conspiracy to handle stolen goods and money-laundering. At its meeting on February 3, 2010, the Board of Directors updated the special section of the «Model» on safety. Following the introduction of new categories of crimes related to racketeering, industry and commerce, copyrights and hacking into the Leg. Decree 231/01, the Board of Directors, in its meeting of February 3, 2012, recently updated the «Model» which will be further amended in order to include environmental crimes, recently introduced by the lawmaker in Leg. Decree 231/01 as crimes relevant for the purposes of applying the Decree itself. To this extent, the Company already appointed a specialized consultancy company to perform a risk assessment on the risks connected to these areas. The duty of ongoing overseeing the effective functioning and enforcement of the «Model», as well as proposing amendments, is entrusted to a Compliance Committee, which operates on an autonomous, professional and independent basis. In accordance with the provisions of the «Model», the Compliance Committee is currently composed of an independent director (subsequently appointed Chairman), an external qualified advisor and the company’s Internal Audit manager. 198 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

Where appointed, also the other committees, as recommended by corporate governance codes promoted by regulated market managers or by category associations, shall consist solely of independent directors. With reference to the provisions set out at art. 36, at Italcementi S.p.A., the scope of application involves as of today 31 subsidiaries, located in 13 countries outside the European Union.

Thus, all the by-laws of subsidiaries located in countries that do not belong to the European Union, which are relevant for the purposes of the captioned regulation, as well as the composition and powers of the corporate bodies have been acquired and are stored in the Company records. Furthermore, it has been verified that the subsidiaries based in countries outside European Union, and relevant according to the last Audit plan: * provide the company’s external auditor with the information needed to verify the annual and interim accounts of Italcementi S.p.A., * have an administrative-accounting system suitable to provide the management and external auditor of the parent company, on a regular basis, with the business, financial and equity information needed to draft the 199 www.italcementigroup.com consolidated financial statements.

However, this last provision, introduced with CONSOB resolution no. 17389 of June 23,2010, provides that companies comply with the new composition conditions within thirty days of the first shareholders’ meeting called after October 1, 2010, to renew the Board of Directors.

Taking into consideration that, in accordance with art. 7 -paragraph 5of the company by-laws, in financial years when a dividend of less than 5% of nominal share value is assigned to the savings shares, the difference is computed as an increase in the preferred dividend in the two following financial years, the above profit for the year enables us to assign to the savings shareholders the entire preferred dividend for financial year 2009 and part of the preferred dividend for financial year 2010, and thus to propose the distribution of a dividend to outstanding savings shares, net of treasury shares held by the company, of 0.066478 euro per share, gross of legally required withholdings.

Taking into consideration that, in accordance with the above-mentioned art. 7 of the company by-laws, in the event of distribution from reserves, savings shares have the same rights as other shares, we propose the allocation, for financial year 2011, of 0.12 euro to every outstanding ordinary and savings share, net of treasury shares held by the company, gross of legally required withholdings. * * * To the Shareholders, if you agree with our proposals, we invite you to carry the following resolution: The Italcementi S.p.A.

The Policy is consistent with the principles and related application criteria of the Group’s “Corporate Governance Framework”, aimed at encouraging a responsible and sustainable approach to remuneration, consistent with the Group values. By executing the Policy, the Company pursues: compliance with regulations of both legal and self-regulatory sources, as well as with the regulators’ recommendations; governance of the Policy’s definition and implementation process, in line and consistent with current best practices; an ongoing dialogue with market practices; a strong link between remuneration and results and sound risk management as a guarantee of its sustainability. The definition of the Policy is the result of a fully outlined process in which the Company’s Remuneration Committee and Board of Directors play a central role. The Company’s Remuneration Committee held on February 21, 2011 examined, and on February 24, 2011 subsequently approved, a Policy consistent with the provisions of the Code of Conduct issued by Borsa Italiana (i.e. the Italian stock exchange); an explanatory memorandum of such Policy (the remuneration report) was subsequently submitted to the advisory opinion of the shareholders’ meeting called to approve the 2010 financial statements held on April 19, 2011. Following the new regulations introduced by CONSOB Resolution No. 18049 of December 23, 2011 in execution of the powers granted by Legislative Decree No. 259/2010, the Company considered adjusting its Remuneration Policy, by confirming the principles and guidelines already expressed in the previous version of the same, but expressing them according to the new legal framework. e) Description of the policies in terms of fixed and variable components of remuneration, with particular reference to the indication of the relative weight within the overall remuneration and distinguishing between short and medium-long term variable components. 205 www.italcementigroup.com A) VARIABLE COMPONENTS Under the Policy, the variable components of remuneration are the following: 1) Short-Term Variable Component (MBO) i) Directors vested with special powers and Officers with strategic responsibilities The yearly variable remuneration for Directors vested with special powers and Officers with strategic responsibilities is established by the Board of Directors upon proposal of the Remuneration Committee and based on the opinion of the Board of Statutory Auditors, in relation to the achievement of the annual targets assigned. Such targets are predetermined and measurable, and they are in any case linked to value creation for the Company and shareholders in the medium to long term; by way of example, but not limited thereto, these targets may be linked to the Company's and/or the Group’s financial position and results of operations, the adoption of governance best practices, sustainable development and implementation of strategic projects for the Company. ii) Officers directly reporting to the Chairman, the Executive Deputy Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer The yearly variable remuneration in favor of Officers directly reporting to the Chairman, the Executive Deputy Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer is established by the latter with the support of the Human Resources and Organizational Development Department, in connection to the achievement of annual targets assigned and in compliance with the principles and guidelines of the Group’s Remuneration Policy. Such targets are predetermined and measurable, and are in any case linked to value creation for the Company and the shareholders in the medium to long term; by way of example, but not limited thereto, these targets may be linked to the Company's and / or the Group’s financial position and results of operations, the adoption of governance best practices, sustainable development and implementation of strategic projects for the Company. 2) Medium-Long Term Variable Component (LTI) Two different long-term incentive plans are currently in place: one for Directors vested with special powers and Officers with strategic responsibilities and one for the other officers – Officers directly reporting to the Chairman, Executive Deputy Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer. i) Directors vested with special powers and Officers with strategic responsibilities Among the Directors vested with special powers, the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer were the recipients of a stock option plan for directors over a three-year period approved by the shareholders' meeting of June 20th, 2007. The above plan consisted of three-year cycles, and the first cycle ended in 2009. The Officers with strategic responsibilities were the recipients of a stock option plan for top management approved by the shareholders’ meeting of April 28, 2008. The aforesaid plan consisted of three-year cycles, the first of which was closed in 2010. The Company’s Board of Directors deemed it appropriate to replace such incentive systems with a new system on a monetary basis (“Long-Term Monetary Incentive Plan for Directors and Officers with Strategic Responsibilities of Italcementi S.p.A.”). 206 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 In making its assessments, the Board of Directors took into account the findings of the analyses carried out on behalf of the Company by independent advisors, with extensive experience and international standing, on executive compensation. The new long-term monetary incentive plan is based on three-year cycles depending on the mediumlong term performance of the Company and/or the Group. This plan aims at: tying the overall remuneration package of recipients to the Company’s medium-long term performance, by rewarding the achievement of strategic targets, and to the corresponding “value creation” for shareholders; ensuring maximum transparency and compliance with best governance criteria of the overall remuneration package for recipients. The corporate body in charge for decisions relating to the plan is the Board of Directors, which adopts resolutions upon proposals of the Remuneration Committee with the technical and operational support of the Head of Human Resources and Organizational Development Department. The plan functioning is aligned, after the necessary adjustments suggested by the Remuneration Committee, with the mechanism adopted for the annual incentive plan (points system with minimum access threshold, target assigned and maximum target). The right to obtain the granting of premium linked to the long-term monetary incentive plan is indeed subject to: a) the achievement of long-term targets assigned to each recipient by the Board of Directors at the beginning of the cycle upon proposal of the Remuneration Committee. Such targets, established consistently with the powers granted to each of them, are linked to the Company’s financial position and results of operations and other targets specifically assigned such as, for example, targets regarding governance, risk management and sustainable development, complementary targets to those established in the annual incentive plan. The control over the achievement of such targets is made by the Remuneration Committee and, where appropriate, by independent experts; b) the expiration of the entire three-year period of each of the plan’s cycles and the uninterrupted holding of the office or employment relationship for each individual recipient. Before the expiration of such period no right accrues to partial or pro rata disbursements. The allocation of the amount actually accrued takes place in April of the year following the end of the three-year reference period. ii) Officers directly reporting to the Chairman, the Executive Deputy Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer Officers directly reporting to the Chairman, the Executive Deputy Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer are the recipient of the long-term monetary incentive plan linked to the performance of the security “Italcementi S.p.A. – Ordinary shares” (“Long-Term Monetary Incentive Plan, linked to the appreciation of Italcementi shares, for executives”) approved by the shareholders’ Meeting of April 28, 2008. The latter, on the basis of the above resolution dated April 28, 2008 were initially the recipients of a stock option Plan for executives subsequently cancelled, for the not executed portion, by resolution of the shareholders’ meeting of April 19, 2011. The new long-term monetary incentive plan provides for three-year cycles based on the Company’s and/or the Group’s medium-long term performance and the allocation to the beneficiaries of a certain number of phantom stock in proportion to the results achieved. 207 www.italcementigroup.com This plan aims at: tying the overall treatment of executives to the Company’s medium-long term performance, by rewarding the achievement of certain strategic targets, and to the corresponding “value creation” for shareholders; ensuring maximum transparency and compliance with best governance criteria of the overall remuneration package of recipients. The corporate body responsible for decisions relating to the plan is the Board of Directors, which passes resolutions upon proposals of the Remuneration Committee with the technical and operational support of the Head of Human Resources and Organizational Development Department. The Board of Directors delegates the operational management of the plan to the Chief Executive Officer. The functioning of the plan provides for the allocation to each beneficiary of a minimum-maximum range of phantom stock whose underlying are Italcementi shares. The right to obtain the granting of the premium linked to the long-term monetary incentive plan is subject to: a) the achievement of long-term targets assigned to each recipient by the Chairman, the Executive Deputy Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer at the beginning of the cycle, proposed with the support of the Department of Human Resources and Organizational Development. Such targets, defined consistently with the powers granted to each of them, are linked to the Company’s financial position and results of operations and other targets specifically attributed such as, for example, targets regarding governance, risk management and sustainable development, targets additional to those established in the annual incentive plan. Control over the achievement of these targets will be made by the Department of Human Resources and Organizational Development; b) the expiration of the full three-year period of each of the plan’s cycles and the uninterrupted holding of office or employment relationship for each individual recipient. Before the expiration of such period no right accrues to partial or pro rata granting of phantom stock. The amount of the incentive is then calculated by multiplying the number of phantom stock actually accrued by the current value of Italcementi stock in December 2013 (last month of the 2nd cycle of the plan). Allocation of the amount awarded normally takes place within the month of April of the year following the end of the three-year reference period.

Such remuneration is made up of an annual fixed component, an annual variable component and a longterm variable component (over three years). 209 www.italcementigroup.com The variable components are aligned to the Group’s MBO and Long-Term Incentive systems and do not provide for any target related to the Company's results of operations, but only targets linked to the improvement of the Internal Control system’s effectiveness and functionality .

Ordinary” shares, also subject to the achievement of specific targets as the previous one.

Full representation of the remuneration components, including the treatment provided for termination of office or termination of the employment agreement, and their consistency with the reference Policy has already been given in Section I of this report; With respect to incentive plans based on financial instruments, please find below information concerning the plans in place. Incentive plans for Directors and Officers A stock option Plan for directors -2001, a stock option Plan for executives -2000, a stock option plan for top management 2008, a long-term monetary incentive Plan for directors and Officers with strategic responsibilities and a long-term monetary incentive Plan linked to the appreciation of Italcementi shares for executives, are currently in place at Italcementi S.p.A.. During 2011, none of the Company Directors and Officers beneficiary of stock option plans exercised the respective rights already accrued. Stock Option Plan for Directors 2001 In execution of the shareholders’ resolution of April 24, 2001, the Company’s Board of Directors meeting of May 9, 2001, approved the stock option plan for directors who are vested with special powers in accordance with the articles of association, or those who perform specific operating duties. By resolution of the shareholders meeting of June 20, 2007, the Plan discussed herein was replaced, with respect to the not executed part, by the “Stock Option Plan for Directors 2007”. During the year no options were exercised. Overall, in execution of the stock option Plan for directors, 1,339,825 options equal to 0.47% of share capital were granted; the options granted as of December 31, 2008 and not yet exercised amounted to a total amount of 960,900. 214 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 Stock Option Plan for Directors 2007 The shareholders' meeting held on June 20, 2007 approved a second stock option plan for directors vested with special powers in accordance with the articles of association, or those who perform specific operating duties, which, for the not executed part, replaces the Stock Option Plan for directors described above. With reference to such stock option Plan, in 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors assigned the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer targets based on which, once their achievement has been verified, a number of options from a minimum of 555,000 up to a maximum of 1,050,000 could have been exercised upon expiry of the three-year period. If the minimum targets set by the Board of Directors were not met, the beneficiary would have lost the right to exercise all the options granted. Having assessed the degree of achievement of performance targets that were originally assigned, the Board of Directors, in its meeting held on March 5, 2010, upon proposal of the Remuneration Committee, granted: * 401,250 options to the Chairman; * 300,000 options to the Chief Executive Officer. Both the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer waived the granting of stock options in their favor. No new option grant has been approved by the Board of Directors. Following the resolution of the Board of Directors and the subsequent waiver of the award by the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, no further options on the Stock Option Plan for Directors 2007 are outstanding. The shareholders' meeting held on April 19, 2011 approved the cancellation of the Plan, for the not executed part. Long-term monetary incentive Plan for directors and managers with strategic responsibilities of Italcementi S.p.A. By resolution of February 3, 2011, the Board of Directors, upon proposal of the Remuneration Committee and based on the favorable opinion of the Committee for Transactions with Related Parties, adopted a “long-term monetary incentive Plan for directors and Officers with strategic responsibilities of Italcementi S.p.A.” whose main features are listed below. At the same meeting of February 3, 2011, the Board of Directors, in execution of said Plan, assigned the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer the targets for their term of office. Moreover, at the meeting held on March 4, 2011, the Chief Operating Officer and the Manager in charge of preparing the company’s financial reports were assigned targets for the 2011-2013 period. In any case, no award will be granted in the absence of the achievement of acceptable results, likewise, in case results are significantly better than forecast, a total bonus higher than the one established at the assignment of targets will be granted. The main features of the Plan are the following. a) Reasons for the adoption of the plan They can be summarized as follows: • to tie the overall treatment of participants to the Company’s performance in the medium-long term by rewarding the achievement of certain strategic targets, and the consequent “value creation” for shareholders; • to ensure maximum transparency and compliance with best governance criteria of the overall salary package of participants. 215 www.italcementigroup.com b) Plan Management The corporate body responsible for decisions relating to the Plan is the Board, acting upon proposal of the Remuneration Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) with the technical and operational support of the Head of Human Resources and Organizational Development Department, and, when applicable, having heard the opinion of the Committee for Transactions with Related Parties. The Plan’s working mechanism will be aligned, after the necessary adjustments suggested by the Committee, with the mechanism adopted for the annual incentive plan (points system, with minimum access threshold, target assigned and maximum target). More specifically, the Board will be responsible for: i) identifying the individual participants for each cycle; ii) establishing the long-term monetary incentive bonus for each of them; iii) approving for each participant individual targets for each cycle; failure to achieve them constitutes a an express termination condition for the bonus grant; iv) assessing the degree of achievement of the targets by each participant; v) approving proposed amendments, where necessary, to the functioning mechanisms of the plan. The assessment as to whether to revise the plan is left to the discretion of the Board. c) Beneficiaries of the Plan Beneficiaries of the plan are certain Directors and Officers with strategic responsibilities of Italcementi S.p.A. The plan is offered to participants considering the relevance of the functions attributed to them for the achievement of the Company’s strategic targets. Being a member of the Company’s Board of Directors or having an office within the Company as Officer with strategic responsibilities are eligibility requirements to be admitted to the monetary incentive plan. d) Term and Constraints of the Plan The plan term is 3 (three) three-year cycles from 2010 to 2019. The term of the first cycle will be: i) for the Directors, the period 2010-2012, ii) for Officers with strategic responsibilities identified by the Company’s Board of Directors (hereinafter, the Board), the period 2011-2013. For each participant, the Board will, upon the Committee's proposal and, when applicable, having heard the opinion of the Committee for Transactions with Related Parties, establish the amounts of monetary bonuses related to the achievement of the assigned targets. These amounts will have to be established consistently with, among other criteria, the following: i) market-based remuneration practices for senior Management positions of comparable corporations; ii) consistency with the principles of the Company’s “Remuneration Policy”, in force from time to time; iii) certainty of maximum possible cost for the Company, corresponding to a submultiple significantly lower than the value generated for the Company by achieving the targets related to disbursement of the bonus. The right to obtain a pay-out of the bonus in connection with the long-term monetary incentive plan is subject to the achievement of the targets, linked to the Company’s financial position and results of 216 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 operations and to the other targets specifically assigned to the participant, as approved by the Board at the beginning of the cycle. The Board, based on the opinion of the Committee, the Head Director of Human Resources and Organizational Development Department and, when applicable, the Committee for Transactions with Related Parties, will assess and evaluate the degree of achievement of targets which will be in no way linked to the performance / price of the Italcementi shares on the stock market achieved during the three-year term of each cycle, thus calculating the bonus actually accrued in favor of each participant. e) Plan Implementation Procedures and Terms The plan provides for the assignment of a monetary premium to participants at the end of each threeyear cycle, once the conditions for the expected performance as established at the beginning of the cycle have been met. The amount of the bonus will be directly linked to the degree of achievement of the targets assigned. Without limitation to the right of the Board to decide otherwise, participation in the long-term monetary incentive plan, under this regulation, is inherently and functionally related to, and conditioned by, the permanence of each participant in the position held at the time of assignment for the entire duration of the cycle. Subject to any exceptions for specific cases established by the Board having heard the Committee and, when applicable, the opinion of the Committee for Transactions with Related Parties, the following provisions will be applied to the cases mentioned below: a) in case of revocation of, or change in, position during the cycle, the Board may, at its discretion, based on the Committee’s opinion, and in consideration of the reasons motivating the revocation or change, evaluate the possibility of paying out a compensatory lump sum bonus, commensurate with the portion of period and the transitional partial degree of achievement of targets assigned; b) in case of death of the participant during the cycle, the above will apply; if death occurs after the assigned targets have been achieved, the participant’s heirs will be acknowledged the right to obtain payment of any bonus accrued. f) Other Responsibilities of the Board of Directors The Board, having heard the Committee’s opinion, may temporarily suspend the long-term monetary incentive plan in case of specific and particular circumstances. The suspension of the effects coming from the right to bonus grant accrual under the long-term monetary incentive plan will occur in any case in which such circumstances may affect the conditions governing the execution of the plan, possibly altering the economic and financial preconditions and jeopardizing its aims as defined in letter a) above. The Board may, in all cases mentioned above and having heard the Committee’s opinion, amend or integrate the plan, the cycle and this Regulation, or order the lapse of the same plan if it is no longer consistent with the Company’s situation, subject to any rights acquired in the meantime as a result of the three-year period of reference having elapsed and the other requirements and conditions of this Regulation being met. 217 www.italcementigroup.com g) Any Support for the Plan by the Special Fund for the Encouragement of Employee Participation in Enterprises, pursuant to Art. 4, paragraph 112 of Law No. 350 dated December 24, 2003 Not applicable Stock Option Plan for Officers 2000 By resolution of the Board of Directors held on March 20, 2000, the Company approved a stock option plan for officers, which, by resolution of the shareholders’ meeting held on April 28, 2008 was replaced, only for the not executed part, by the stock option Plan for top management” and by the “long-term monetary incentive Plan linked to the appreciation of the Italcementi shares for officers”, whose main elements will be reported hereunder. Overall, in execution of such Plan, 3,483,223 options were granted to the Group’s management. The figures mentioned above do not take into account the options granted to the former Chief Operating Officer and to the Chief Executive Officer when he was an employee of the Company. Including also such offices, the total options granted amount to 4,196,823, i.e. 1.496% of share capital. No options were exercised during the year. The options granted in execution of the Plan and not yet exercised amount to a total of 2,269,316. Stock Option Plan for the Top Management 2008 The shareholders' meeting held on April 28, 2008 approved a second stock option plan for officers, which, for the not executed part, replaces the Stock Option Plan for officers described above. With reference to this stock option Plan, the Company’s Board of Directors, at its meeting held on June 4, 2008 regarding the three-year period 2008-2010, granted the Chief Operating Officer and 10 officers a total number of options ranging from a minimum of 1,180,000 to a maximum of 2,000,000. If the recipient does not reach the minimum targets assigned to him/her, he/she loses the right to exercise all of the options granted. The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on March 4, 2011, upon proposal of the Remuneration Committee, assessed the degree of achievement of performance targets originally assigned to the Chief Operating Officer, granted 375,000 options to the Chief Operating Officer and 80,000 options to the Manager in charge of preparing the Company’s financial reports. The shareholders' meeting held on April 19, 2011 approved the cancellation of the Plan, for the not executed part. Long-Term Monetary Incentive Plan linked to the Appreciation of the Italcementi Shares for Officers This Plan was approved by the shareholders’ meeting on April 28, 2008. The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on June 4, 2008, granted 20 officers, with respect to the threeyear period 2008-2010, from a minimum of 180,000 up to a maximum of 300,000 overall rights. If the beneficiary fails to achieve the minimum targets assigned, he/she loses the right to obtain payment of the entire cash bonus. Having assessed the degree of achievement of assigned targets, the Chief Executive Officer granted 17 recipients (in the meantime, the remaining 3 had left the Company) a total number of 221,000 rights, of a value of € 6.272 per unit, equal to a total of € 1,386,134. 218 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 Moreover, the Chief Executive Officer, executing the powers provided by the Plan, identified, for the 2nd cycle of validity of the same 2011/2013 28 officers of Italcementi S.p.A., to whom a minimum of 1,000,000 rights would be granted. The main features of the Plan are the following. a) Reasons for the Adoption of the Plan These may be summarized as follows: • to tie the overall treatment of beneficiaries to the Company’s medium-long term performance and to value creation for shareholders; • to reward the achievement of targets of each beneficiary, ensuring the highest involvement of the Company’s entire top management on its performance and increasing the sense of belonging of beneficiaries, encouraging them to remain at the Company. b) Plan Management The corporate body responsible for decisions relating to the Plan is the Board of directors which delegates the Chief Executive Officer to manage the Plan, including through the technical support of the Head of Human Resources and Organizational Development Department. More specifically, the Chief Executive Officer will be responsible for: i) establishing the maximum number of Rights to participate in the long-term monetary incentive plan linked to the appreciation of Shares, altogether attributable as part of the Cycle; ii) identifying the individual Beneficiaries for each Cycle as well as to decide the number of Rights to participate in the long-term monetary incentive plan linked to the appreciation of Shares, granted to each Beneficiary; iii) approving for each Beneficiary the individual Targets for each Cycle, whose failure to achieve will be an express termination condition of the Rights granted to participate in the long-term monetary incentive plan linked to the appreciation of Shares made in favor of the same Beneficiary within the Cycle, with the consequent forfeiture of the right to obtain the cash bonus linked to the same rights; iv) assessing the degree of achievement of the Targets by each Beneficiary; v) deciding the date of commencement of the Availability Period. The management of the Plan is carried out by the Company’s Human Resources and Organizational Development Department in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations. c) Beneficiaries of the Plan Beneficiaries of the plan are the Company’s employees identified by the Chief Executive Officer, to whom Rights are granted to participate in the long-term monetary incentive plan linked to the appreciation of Shares. d) Term and Availability Restrictions on the Shares and on the Granted Option Rights The term of the Plan is of three three-year Cycles from 2008 to 2016. The end of the Plan is set for late 2017 (the first year following the end of the last three-year Cycle). The Chief Executive Officer, under the Plan, decides the number of rights to participate in the Plan to be granted to each of the beneficiaries on the basis of an overall evaluation, which, taking into account the Company’s general performance as an essential prerequisite, and the strategic and organizational 219 www.italcementigroup.com position of the role of each beneficiary in order to pursue the Company’s strategic targets, will regard: i) the Company’s performance achieved in the period, ii) the Beneficiary’s organizational level in the Company’s structure, iii) consistency with the principles of overall remuneration underlining the Company’s remuneration policy. The accrual of the rights granted to each beneficiary is subject to the achievement of the targets linked to the financial position and results of operations and other individual targets specifically assigned. The Chief Executive Officer, with the support of the Human Resources and Organizational Development Department, is in charge of the verification and evaluation, during each cycle, of the degree of achievement of the targets, accordingly defining the amount of rights to participate in the plan previously granted to each beneficiary. e) Procedures for the Value of Rights determination and Clauses for the Plan Implementation The Plan provides for the offer, free-of-charge and reserved to the beneficiaries, of rights to participate in the Plan which, once they reach maturity in accordance with the requirements and conditions laid down by the Regulations, will enable the beneficiaries to obtain payment of a cash bonus equal to the value of the shares as resulting from the arithmetic average of official prices of the same on the stock exchange market managed by Borsa Italiana (i.e. the Italian stock exchange market) within the thirty calendar days preceding the date of payment. The rights to participate in the Plan are nominative and non-transferable. In case of a) termination of the employment relationship due to dismissal or resignation occurring after the Performance Monitoring Period has elapsed but before the beginning of Availability Period, the general principle will apply and therefore the Beneficiary will automatically and permanently lose the right to receive the cash bonus linked to the Rights to participate in the long-term monetary incentive plan linked to the appreciation of Shares, granted but not yet accrued; b) termination of the employment relationship by mutual consent or resignation for retirement or further to invalidity, howsoever occurred after the end of the Performance Monitoring Period, or if the Beneficiary has achieved the assigned Targets, the same Beneficiary will maintain the right to obtain the cash bonus linked to the Rights to participate in the long-term monetary incentive plan tied to the appreciation of Shares, granted but not yet accrued, if, after the date of termination of the employment, the accrual of the same actually takes place; c) death of the Beneficiary after the end of the Performance Monitoring Period, or upon attainment of the Targets assigned, the Rights to participate in the long-term monetary incentive plan linked to the appreciation of Shares granted to the same under this Plan which may have been accrued will be awarded to the same Beneficiary’s heirs upon submission by the latter of the necessary documentation proving such qualification. If, during the course of the assignment cycle, the transfer of the Beneficiary’s employment relationship occurs between the Company and its Italian and foreign subsidiaries or its parent company or between the latter, regardless of the manner by which such transfer occurred, or the Beneficiary’s organizational position is changed with a consequent change in the latter’s responsibilities, the Targets will also be updated in line with the new position. 220 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 In any case, the Chief Executive Officer may define an equitable amount payable to the Beneficiary in relation to the activities carried out till then. For each three-year cycle a maximum of 223,000 Rights to participate in the Plan may be granted. f) Other Powers Assigned to the Board of Directors The Chief executive Officer may temporarily suspend the effects deriving from the accrual of Rights to participate in the plan in case of specific and particular needs such as, by way of example but not limited to, changes in legal and regulatory provisions, excluding tax provisions, applicable to the legal relationships arising from the Plan. The suspension of the effects deriving from the accrual of Rights to participate in the plan will also take place in any case in which such circumstances may occur as, by way of example but not limited to, corporate transactions, mergers and demergers having an effect on the Company's share capital, increase and reduction of the Company's share capital, changes to the Bylaws relating to the Shares such as to affect the conditions governing the implementation of the Plan, possibly altering the economic and financial conditions and jeopardizing its aims as previously defined. In any case, the suspension will be promptly communicated to the Beneficiaries. g) Any support for the plan by the special Fund for the encouragement of employee participation in enterprises, pursuant to Art. 4, paragraph 112, of Law No. 350 dated December 24, 2003 Not applicable. 1.2.

Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 Authorization to purchase and dispose of treasury shares Dear Shareholders, The ordinary shareholders' meeting of April 19, 2011, renewed the authorization for the Company to acquire and dispose of treasury shares for a period of 18 months as of the resolution date. In connection with the aforementioned shareholders’ resolution, the Company has not purchased any ordinary and savings shares nor has it sold those held in portfolio to stock option beneficiaries during the fiscal year, since no options were exercised. As a consequence, as at March 2, 2012, the Company holds 3,793,029 ordinary treasury shares and 105,500 savings treasury shares. The carrying amount of treasury shares in portfolio at date thereof is equal to a total amount of Euro 58,689,585.56, as reflected in the accounts in accordance with the applicable laws. Since the authorization expires on October 18, 2012, in order to enable the Company to maintain its right to acquire and dispose of treasury shares, we invite you to resolve upon the renewal of such authorization for the next 18 months. This proposal does not contain any differences in respect to the proposal approved by the shareholders' meeting of last year. 1) Reasons underlying the proposed authorization to acquire and dispose of treasury shares. The authorization is requested in order to: • dispose of treasury shares * to be granted to employees and/or directors in connection with stock option plans reserved to them; * for medium/long-term investment purposes; • operate, in compliance with current regulations, directly or through intermediaries, in order to limit anomalous trends in share prices and to regularize stock exchange prices caused by temporary distortions linked to excessive volatility or low trading liquidity; • create a treasury stock portfolio to serve extraordinary financial transactions or for other purposes deemed to be in the financial, business and /or strategic interest of the Company; • offer an additional tool to monetize their investments to the shareholders. 2) Maximum number, category and nominal value of the shares which the authorization refers to; compliance with paragraph 3, art. 2357 of the Italian Civil Code Purchases refer to ordinary and/or savings shares of the Company whose maximum number, including treasury shares already held as at the date hereof by the Company and by the subsidiaries (which will receive specific instructions for timely disclosure of the shares they hold), shall not exceed an overall nominal value of one tenth of the entire share capital. In any case, purchases shall be made, in accordance with article 2357 of the Italian Civil Code, within the limits of the distributable earnings and available reserves reflected in the latest approved financial statements of the Company. The consideration paid or received with respect to treasury shares purchase or sale shall be directly reflected in equity in compliance with IAS 32 and it shall in any case be accounted for in the manner established by the laws in force from time to time. 231 www.italcementigroup.com 3) Term of the authorization. The authorization to purchase treasury shares is requested for a period of 18 months as of the date on which the shareholders adopts the resolution, while the authorization for their disposal is requested without time limits. 4) Minimum and maximum consideration and market values on which such considerations have been determined. The purchase price of each share shall not be lower nor exceed 15%, as peak, than the average reference share price occurred on the same regulated market in the last three sessions preceding each transaction. The overall consideration to be paid by the Company for the purchase shall in no case exceed the amount of Euro 100 million. The shares may be sold, whether or not purchases have been completed, and on one or more occasions (also through public offers or offers to the shareholders or through placement of warrants and depositary receipts representing shares and/or similar securities), at a price no lower than the lowest purchase price. This price limit shall not apply in the event of sale of shares offered to the employees of Italcementi S.p.A. and its subsidiaries, parent companies and the other companies controlled by the latter or to members of the Board of Directors of Italcementi S.p.A. and its subsidiaries who are vested with special offices in compliance with the Articles of Association or who perform specific operating duties, in connection with stock option plans for employees and for directors. 5) Terms and Conditions according to which purchases shall be made. Purchases of treasury shares shall be normally made, unless otherwise indicated below, so that equal treatment of shareholders is ensured and offers to purchase, directly matched with pre-determined offers to sell, are not allowed. Moreover, in consideration of the various purposes illustrated in this proposal, the Board of Directors proposes to be authorized to purchase in accordance with any other manner allowed under current laws and regulations governing the stock market on which the transaction is performed and, therefore, as at the present time: • through public tender or exchange offers; • through the purchase and sale of derivatives traded on regulated markets which provide for physical delivery of the underlying shares; • through the proportional allocation to shareholders of put options to be exercised within the term of the authorization as per paragraph 3 above. With regard to sale transactions, the Board of Directors proposes that the authorization shall allow the adoption of any procedure deemed appropriate to achieve the intended objectives to be executed either directly or through intermediaries, in compliance with national and European laws and regulations. The treasury shares acquisitions and sales which the authorization is requested for will be executed in compliance with applicable laws, especially, in compliance with national and European laws and regulations including those on market abuse. Appropriate disclosure of treasury shares acquisitions and sales will be provided in compliance with the applicable disclosure requirements. 232 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

In light of these forecasts, this hypothesis does not apply. * * * Dear Shareholders, If you agree with our proposal, we invite you to resolve upon the following resolution: “Italcementi S.p.A. shareholders' meeting held on April 18, 2012, having acknowledged the Directors’ proposal, taking into account articles 2357 and 2357-ter of the Italian Civil Code hereby resolves 1) to revoke the resolution authorizing the acquisition and disposal of treasury shares adopted by the ordinary shareholders' meeting of April 19, 2011; 2) to authorize, pursuant to art. 2357 of the Italian Civil Code, the purchase of ordinary and/or savings treasury shares, for the amounts, at the price, according to the terms and conditions indicated herein below: the purchases shall be made once or in more times, within 18 months of the resolution date; the purchase price of each share shall not be more than 15% above or below the average reference price as recorded on the same regulated market in the three sessions preceding each transaction; the overall amount paid shall in no case exceed Euro 100 million; the maximum number of ordinary and/or savings shares acquired shall not have an overall nominal value, including treasury shares already held as of the date hereof by the Company and by the subsidiaries, in excess of one tenth of the share capital; 3) to authorize, pursuant to art. 2357-ter, paragraph 1 of the Italian Civil Code, the Chairman, Executive Deputy Chairman, the Deputy Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer in office from time to time to severally dispose of the purchased treasury shares, even if the purchase has not been completed yet, in compliance with current laws and without time limits. The sale price shall not be lower than the lowest purchase price. This price limit shall not apply, however, in the event of a sale of shares to the employees of Italcementi S.p.A. and its subsidiaries, parent companies and the other companies controlled by the latter or to members of the Board of Directors of Italcementi S.p.A. and its subsidiaries who are vested with special offices in compliance with the Articles of Association or who perform specific operating duties, in connection with stock option plans for employees and for directors. 4) to establish that: • the purchases shall be normally conducted so that equal treatment of shareholders is ensured and offers to purchase directly matched with pre-determined offers to sell are not allowed, or, taking into account the various possible purposes, in any other manner allowed under current laws and regulations governing the stock market on which the transactions are performed; • the shares shall be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate to achieve the objectives pursued, directly or through intermediaries, in compliance with current applicable national and European laws and regulations; • treasury shares purchases and sales shall be executed in compliance with applicable laws and, 233 www.italcementigroup.com specifically, with laws and regulations governing the stock market on which the transactions are performed; 5) to establish that the consideration paid or received with respect to treasury shares purchases or sales transactions shall be reflected directly in equity in compliance with IAS 32 and shall in any case be accounted for in the manner established by the laws in force from time to time; 6) to severally grant to the Chairman, Executive Deputy Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in office from time to time any power to proceed with the purchases and sales and in any case to execute the above resolutions, also through attorneys-in-fact, complying with any requirements provided for by the competent authorities”. Supplement to the Board of Directors Dear Shareholders, Last year’s shareholders meeting of April 19 resolved, inter alia, to increase the number of Board members to 20 by appointing Mr. Lorenzo Renato Guerini as Director for the remaining part of the Board’s mandate. However, the day before Mr. Pietro Ferrero prematurely deceased. At their meeting of May 5, 2011, the Board of Directors co-opted Mr. Carlo Garavaglia to replace him, according to law and the Bylaws, as being the first and sole unelected candidate on the list presented by the majority shareholder at the time of the election of the Board members currently in office. Moreover, on April 27, 2011, Mr. Antonio Carosi, sole candidate of the list presented by the minority shareholder First Eagle Investment Management LLC, resigned from his office of Director. The Board of Directors deemed it appropriate to ensure, even at this stage, a representation on the Board of Directors to minority shareholders, it asked the sole minority shareholder who presented the list directly to get proposals on the replacement of the resigning director. During the Board meeting of July 29, 2011, Mr. Giulio Antonello, therefore, was co-opted as Director. Mr. Garavaglia and Mr. Antonello, in accordance with law and the Bylaws, will remain in office until the next shareholders’ meeting. For the purposes of supplementing the Board of Directors, two articles of the Bylaws are relevant: the principle invoked by Art. 15 of the Bylaws, which aims at ensuring a minimum number of Directors to be appointed by minority shareholders as required by law, and the provision of Art. 16 of the same Bylaws, under which the shareholders shall act by a majority of the share capital represented therein. The voting list mechanism does not apply to the Board of Directors’ supplements. Regarding the replacement of the Director elected from the majority list, the shareholder Italmobiliare informed the Company of its intention to confirm Mr. Carlo Garavaglia as Director. With reference, however, to the replacement of the minority Director, whose principle of representativeness is expressly provided for in the Bylaws, limits on participation and time set for the presentation of candidates do not apply. In order to facilitate the appropriate development of the shareholders’ meeting, however, we call upon the minority shareholders holding a stake in the share capital with voting rights no lower than 2% of the ordinary share capital, to submit their own candidates at the registered office (via G. Camozzi 124, 24121 Bergamo, Corporate Affairs) or to file them by means of the certified email address affarisocietari@italcementi.legalmail.it, at least five days before the shareholders’ meeting on first call (i.e. by April 13, 2012 ), along with the following documentation: 234 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 a) statements by which individual candidates accept their candidature and, under his/her own responsibility, state the non-existence of causes for ineligibility and the entitlement of the good reputation requirements established by the law; b) a brief resume on the personal and professional skills of each candidate with indication of their position as director and statutory auditor in other companies; c) statements by which individual candidates declare entitlement of the independence qualification required by the law and by the Code of Conduct; d) information on the identity of shareholders who have presented candidates; e) a statement of the shareholders who do not hold, even jointly, a controlling or majority stake, bearing witness to the absence of any connection with the majority shareholder, as defined by the law in force. The intermediary certification proving ownership of the shareholding prescribed at the date on which candidates are presented may also be produced after the filing provided that it reaches the company at least 5 days before the shareholders’ meeting date on first call (i.e. by April 13, 2012). In any case, shareholders can present candidates directly at the venue of the Meeting. During the Meeting, the Chairman will summarize the candidates of the minority shareholders and will submit them to poll, according to the order in which they have been received by the Company. To this end, Italmobiliare communicated its intent to abstain from any vote on candidates submitted by shareholders holding at least 2% of the ordinary share capital. In the event that no candidates are submitted nor any other candidates by holders of shares under 2% of the ordinary share capital are filed, the shareholders’ meeting will act under the usual majorities without prejudice to the possibility of reducing by one unit the number of members of the Board of Directors. Appointment of Statutory Auditors, the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors and determining their remuneration Dear Shareholders, Upon approval of the financial statements as at December, 31st 2011, the office of the entire Board of Statutory Auditors will expire. We invite you to appoint, for the 2012-2014 three-year period, three acting Auditors and three substitute Auditors, and the Chairman of the Board, after determining their respective annual remuneration. According to the Bylaws, the Board of Statutory Auditors is appointed on the basis of lists aimed at assuring the appointment of one acting Auditor and one substitute Auditor by the minority shareholders. Only shareholders who, alone or together with other shareholders, provide documented evidence that they own, as at the date on which lists are filed with the Company, a percentage of the share capital with voting rights not lower than 2%, are entitled to file the lists. Each shareholder cannot file or concur in the filing of more than one list, directly or through third parties or trust company, or vote for different lists. Shareholders belonging to the same group and shareholders who are party to a shareholders’ agreement concerning the company shares may not file or vote for more than one list, neither through third party or trust companies. Lists presented in violation of these restrictions will not be accepted. Each list consists of two sections: one for candidates as acting Auditors, and the other for candidates as substitute Auditors. 235 www.italcementigroup.com Each section shall list in progressive order the names of no more than three candidates as acting Auditors and no more than three candidates as substitute Auditors. Each candidate may be presented on one list only under penalty of ineligibility. Lists must be filed with the registered office or sent by means of certified electronic mail to: affarisocietari@italcementi.legalmail.it, by the twenty-fifth day prior to the date of the shareholders’ meeting convened in first call along with the following documentation: a) statements by which each candidate accepts his/her candidature and, under his/her own responsibility, states the non-existence of causes for ineligibility or incompatibility as well as the entitlement of further requirements established by the law, Company bylaws and Code of Conduct; b) a brief resume on the personal and professional skills of each candidate with indication of their position as director and statutory auditor in other companies; c) information on the identity of shareholders who have filed lists. The intermediary certification proving ownership of the share capital percentage required under the rules and regulations in force at the time the list is filed can be produced also after the filing thereof, provided that this is delivered to the Company within the terms provided for by the rules and also regulatory provisions in force for publication of lists by the Company; d) a statement of the shareholders who do not hold, even jointly, a controlling or majority stake, bearing witness to the absence of any connection with the majority shareholder, as defined by the applicable law. A list presented not in compliance with the above provisions will be considered as not presented. In the event, on expiry of the 25 day term prior to that fixed for the Meeting in first call, a sole list has been filed, or only lists filed by shareholders who are connected to each other under current regulations, additional lists can be filed until following third day, and the threshold of 2% above mentioned will be halved. Proposal to increase the total amount of rights to be allocated to the “Long-term monetary incentive Plan for Officers, linked to the appreciation of Italcementi shares” Dear Shareholders, The shareholders' meeting held on April 28, 2008 had approved the adoption of a “Stock option Plan for Top Management , later revoked by the shareholders’ meeting on April 19 last year for the unexecuted part, and of a Long-term monetary incentive Plan for Officers linked to the appreciation of Italcementi shares” (the “Plan”). The Plan currently contemplates an overall maximum allocation, for each three-year cycle, of 223,000 rights, equal to a grand total of 669,000 attributable rights. In 2011, having made an assessment as to the degree of achievement of targets assigned in 2008, the Chief Executive Officer granted a total of 221,000 rights to 17 recipients to be claimed for the first cycle (2008-2010) of the “Plan”. With reference to the second cycle (2011-2013), however, last September the Chief Executive Officer informed the Board of Directors he had granted 1,000,000 rights to 28 officers to participate in the “Plan”. Among these are included 6 officers originally beneficiaries of the stock option Plan which was canceled last year. The recognition of these rights was subject to an authorization by the shareholders’ meeting to increase the number of overall rights to be subjected to the aforesaid Plan both for this cycle of allocations and for the next one (2014-2016). 236 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 Thus, when the period of validity of the Plan (financial year 2016) expires, taking into account 221,000 rights granted at the end of 1st cycle, a maximum number of 2,221,000 rights will be allocated overall in proportion to the achievement of the targets assigned to each recipient. * * * Dear Shareholders, If you agree with our proposal, we invite you to adopt the following resolution: “The Shareholders’ General Meeting of Italcementi S.p.A. held on April 18, 2012, having acknowledged the proposal of the Directors, hereby resolves to increase the total amount of rights to participate in the “Long-term monetary incentive Plan for Officers, linked to the appreciation of Italcementi shares” from the current 669,000 to 2,221,000.

Events after December 31, 2011 245 www.italcementigroup.com Notes The Italcementi S.p.A. financial statements as at and for the year to December 31, 2011, were approved by the Board of Directors on March 2, 2012. At the meeting, the Board authorized publication of a press release dated March 2, 2012 containing key information from the financial statements. Italcementi S.p.A. is a legal entity established in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Italy. It has been listed on the Milan Stock Exchange since 1925, belongs to the S&P/Mib index of leading Italian companies and is subject to management and coordination by Italmobiliare S.p.A., whose key data from the most recently approved financial statements are provided in an annex to the separate financial statements. Italcementi S.p.A. and its subsidiaries form the “Italcementi Group”, an international player whose main lines of business are hydraulic binders, ready mixed concrete and aggregates. The Group is also active in other areas, some of which are instrumental to its core businesses: materials for the construction industry, additives, transport, energy, engineering and e-business. The Italian laws that implement EEC Directive IV are also applied, where compatible, to the companies that draw up financial statements in accordance with the IFRS. Consequently the financial statements are compliant with the articles of the Italian Civil Code and the corresponding indications of the Consolidated Finance Act (TUF, testo unico della finanza) for listed companies with regard to the Directors’ Report (art. 2428 Italian Civil Code), Audit (art. 2409-bis Italian Civil Code) and Publication of the Financial Statements (art. 2435 Italian Civil Code). The separate financial statements and related notes also set out the details and additional disclosures required under art. 2424, 2425 and 2427 of the Italian Civil Code and art. 27, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 127/1991, since such requirements are not in conflict with the IFRS. The financial statements have been drawn up on a going-concern basis. Despite the difficult economic and financial situation, by virtue of the measures already in place to respond to the changes in demand, and its business and financial flexibility the company has no material uncertainties about its ability to continue as a going concern. 1. Accounting policies 1.1. Statement of compliance with the IFRS These financial statements have been drawn up in compliance with the International Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRS) applicable at December 31, 2011, endorsed by the EC Commission. In compliance with European Regulation no. 1606 of July 19, 2002, the principles adopted do not include the standards and interpretations published by the IASB and the IFRIC through December 31, 2011, that had not been endorsed by the European Union at that date. Since December 31, 2010, the following standards, amendments and interpretations endorsed by the European Union have come into force and have been applied in the 2011 financial statements: x IAS 24 revised ““Related party disclosures” which simplifies disclosure requirements relating to related parties in which public entities are present and provides a new definition of related parties that also comprises the subsidiaries of associates and joint ventures. x Amendment to IAS 32 “Financial instruments presentation” regarding classification of rights issues. The changes permit classification of rights issues (e.g., options and warrants) as equity instruments independently of the currency in which exercise price is denominated. x Amendment to IFRS 1 “First-time adoption of IFRS” and the related amendment to IFRS 7 “Financial instruments: disclosures” relating to the exemption from comparative disclosure allowed by IFRS 7 on 246 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 first-time adoption. The amendment exempts the reporting entity, on first-time adoption of IFRS, from providing the comparative data required by IFRS 7 for fair value measurement and liquidity risk. x Amendments to a number of IAS/IFRS/IFRIC as part of the improvement of the same: IFRS 1 “Firsttime adoption of IFRS”, IFRS 3 “Business combinations”, IFRS 7 “Financial instruments: disclosures”, IAS 1 “Presentation of financial statements”, IAS 27 “Consolidated and separate financial statements”, IAS 34 “Interim financial reporting”, IFRIC 13 “Customer loyalty programs”. The above changes had no material effects for the company. x Amendment to IFRIC 14 “Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement” governing cases where an entity subject to a minimum funding requirement on defined benefit plans, makes prepayments to guarantee the limits in question. The benefits arising from the prepayments may be recognized as assets. This case does not apply to the company. x IFRIC 19 “Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments” which provides guidelines for accounting treatment of extinction of a financial liabilities through issue of own equity instruments. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability to be extinguished and the initial measurement of the equity instruments to be issued must be reflected in the income statement. The application of the new standards, amendments and interpretations has not had a material impact on the company’s annual accounts. At December 31, 2011, the European Union had approved an amendment to IFRS 7 “Financial instruments: disclosures” concerning disclosures to be made on the transfer of financial assets. This amendment is not yet in effect and the Group has not elected early application. Standards, amendments and interpretations published by the IASB but not yet endorsed by the European Union are: x Amendment to IAS 1 “Presentation of financial statements” relating to the presentation of other components recognized under equity. x Amendment to IAS 12 “Income taxes” with reference to deferred tax: recovery of underlying assets. x Amendments to IAS 19 “Employee benefits”. The main change is the elimination of the “corridor” for defined benefit plans with the requirement for immediate and full recognition of actuarial gains and losses in the statement of comprehensive income. x Review of IAS 27 “Consolidated and separate financial statements” and IAS 28 “Investments in associates”. x Amendments to IFRS 1 “First-time adoption of IFRS” for situations subsequent to hyperinflationary periods and suppression of fixed dates on first-time adoption. x IFRS 10 “Consolidated financial statements”. This new standard replaces IAS 27 “Consolidated and separate financial statements” with regard to consolidated financial statements. IAS 27 has been renamed “Separate financial statements” and deals exclusively with preparation of separate financial statements. x IFRS 11 “Joint arrangements”. The new standard replaces IAS 31 “Interests in joint ventures”, and identifies two categories of arrangement, with separate accounting treatments. x IFRS 12 “Disclosure of interests in other entities” which re-organizes and supplements disclosures on subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and other equity investments. x IFRS 13 “Fair value measurement”. This new standard provides guidelines for measurement and disclosure of fair value. x IFRIC 20 “Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine”. 247 www.italcementigroup.com 1.2. Accounting policies and basis of presentation The accounts adopt the cost principle, with the exception of derivatives and financial assets held for trading or for sale, which are stated at fair value. The carrying amounts of hedged assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in fair value on the basis of the hedged risks. The financial statements are presented in euro. All amounts in the accounting schedules and in the notes are rounded to thousands of euro, unless otherwise specified. The basis of presentation of the financial statements is as follows: Ɣ current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities are presented as separate classifications on the face of the statement of financial position. Current assets, which include cash and cash equivalents, are assets that the company intends to realize, sell or consume during its normal business cycle; current liabilities are liabilities that the company expects to settle during the normal business cycle or in the twelve months after the end of the reporting period; Ɣ on the income statement, costs are analyzed by the nature of the expense; Ɣ on the statement of cash flows, the indirect method is used. Since the Italcementi Group applies IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” to its half-year reports, with the consequent identification of a six-month interim period, any reductions in value are recorded at closure of the half year. 1.3. Use of estimates The preparation of the separate financial statements and the notes in conformity with the international financial reporting standards requires management to make estimates that affect the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense, such as amortization, depreciation and provisions, and the disclosures on contingent assets and liabilities in the notes. Since these estimates are determined on a going-concern basis, using the information available at the time, they could diverge from the actual future results. This is particularly evident in the present financial and economic crisis, which could generate situations diverging from those estimated today and require currently unforeseeable adjustments, including adjustments of a material nature, to the carrying amounts of the items in question. Assumptions and estimates are particularly sensitive with regard to measurement of non-current assets, which depend on forecasts of future results and cash flows, provisions for disputes and restructurings and commitments in respect of pension plans and other long-term benefits. Management conducts regular reviews of assumptions and estimates, and immediately recognizes any adjustments in the financial statements. 1.4. General policies Subsidiaries and associates Subsidiaries are companies in which the company has the power to determine, directly or indirectly, administrative and management decisions and to obtain the benefits thereof. Generally speaking, control is assumed to exist when the company holds, directly or indirectly, more than one half of voting rights, including potential voting rights deriving from convertible securities. Associates are companies in which the company has significant influence over administrative and management decisions even though it does not hold control. Generally speaking, significant influence is assumed to exist when the company holds, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of voting rights or, even if it holds a lower percentage of voting rights, when it is entitled to take part in financial and management policy decisions by virtue of a specific juridical status including, but not limited to, participation in voting trusts or other forms of material exercise of rights of governance. Investments in subsidiaries and associates are measured using the cost method, whereby they are recognized initially at cost, and subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in amount whenever, following impairment testing, conditions are found such as to make it necessary to adjust the carrying amount to the effective value 248 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 of the equity investment. The original cost is restored in subsequent periods if the grounds for the adjustments no longer exist. Adjustments and any restatements of value are charged to the income statement. Joint ventures Joint ventures are companies whose business operations are controlled by the company jointly with one or more other parties, under contractual arrangements. Joint control presupposes that strategic, financial and management decisions are taken with the unanimous consent of the parties that control the venture. Interests in joint ventures are measured on a cost basis and, as with investments in subsidiaries and associates, this amount is subjected to periodic impairment testing. They are included in investments in subsidiaries or associates as from the date on which joint control is assumed and until such control is relinquished. 1.5. Business combinations On first-time adoption of the IFRS, as allowed by IFRS 1, the company elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations that took place before January 1, 2004. Until December 31, 2009, business combinations were accounted for with the purchase method in IFRS 3. Since January 1, 2010, business combinations have been accounted for with the acquisition method in IFRS3 revised. Cost of business combinations Under IFRS 3 revised, acquisition cost is the sum of the acquisition-date fair value of the contingent consideration and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired entity. For each business combination, any non-controlling interests in the acquired entity must be measured at fair value or in proportion to their interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity. IFRS 3 revised provides that costs relating to the acquisition be expensed in the periods in which they are incurred and the services are received. Any costs incurred in 2009 relating to business combinations in 2010 were expensed in 2009. Allocation of the cost of business combinations Goodwill is measured as the positive difference between: the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired entity, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquired entity, with respect to the net amount at the acquisition date of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the difference is negative, it is recognized in the income statement. If on initial recognition the acquisition cost of a business combination can only be determined provisionally, the allocated amounts are adjusted within twelve months of the acquisition date (measurement period). 1.6. Translation of foreign currency items Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are initially translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate at the transaction date. At the reporting date, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated to the functional currency at the closing rate. Exchange rate gains and losses are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities measured at cost are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the transaction date; those measured at fair value are translated with the exchange rate at the date fair value was determined. 249 www.italcementigroup.com 1.7. Property, plant and equipment Measurement Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes the purchase or production cost and the directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and the conditions required for its operation. Production cost includes the cost of materials and direct labor costs. Finance costs relating to the purchase, construction and production of qualifying assets are capitalized. The carrying amount of some assets existing at the IFRS first-time adoption date of January 1, 2004, reflects revaluations applied in prior periods in connection with specific local laws, based on the real economic value of the assets in question. Assets acquired through business combinations are stated at fair value, determined on a provisional basis at the purchase date and subsequently adjusted within the following twelve months. Subsequent to initial recognition, property, plant and equipment are carried at cost and depreciated over the asset’s useful life, less any impairment losses. Assets under construction are recognized at cost; depreciation begins when the assets enter useful life. When an asset consists of components with a significant cost and different useful lives, initial recognition and subsequent measurement are carried out separately for each component. Subsequent expense Repair and maintenance expense is normally recognized as incurred. Component replacement costs are capitalized and the carrying amount of the replaced component is expensed. Depreciation Depreciation is generally calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each component of an asset. Land is not depreciated, with the exception of land used for quarrying operations. Asset useful life determines the depreciation rate until a subsequent review of residual useful life. The useful life range adopted for the various categories of assets is disclosed in the notes. Quarries Costs for the preparation and excavation of land to be quarried are amortized as the economic benefits of such costs are obtained. Quarry land is depreciated at rates reflecting the quantities extracted in the period in relation to the estimated total to be extracted over the period in which the quarry is to be worked. The company makes specific provision for quarry environmental restoration obligations. Since the financial resources required to settle such obligations are directly related to the degree of use, the charge cannot be defined at inception with a balancing entry to the asset cost, but is provided to reflect the degree of use of the quarry. 1.8. Leases Finance leases, which substantially transfer to the company all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset, are recognized from the lease inception date at the lower of the leased asset fair value or the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs and reductions against the residual liability so as to obtain a constant rate of interest on the outstanding liability. The policies used for depreciation and subsequent measurement of leased assets are consistent with those used for the company’s own property, plant and equipment. Leases where all risks and rewards incidental to ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 250 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 1.9. Investment property Investment property is land and/or buildings held to earn rental income and/or for capital appreciation, rather than for use in the production or supply of goods and services. Investment property is initially recognized at purchase cost, including costs directly attributable to the purchase. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured at amortized cost. 1.10. Intangible assets Intangible assets purchased separately are capitalized at cost, while those acquired through business combinations are recognized at provisionally estimated fair value at the acquisition date and adjusted where necessary within the following twelve months. Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost amortized over the asset’s useful life. The company has not identified intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. 1.11. Impairment Property, plant and equipment and investment property, and amortizable intangible assets, are tested for impairment if indications of impairment emerge. Assets represented by equity investments in companies recorded at cost are tested for impairment if indications of impairment emerge. Impairment is the difference between the asset carrying amount and its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the greater of fair value, less costs to sell, of an asset or cash-generating unit, and its value in use, determined as the present value of future cash flows. Fair value less costs to sell is determined through application of relevant valuation models adopting appropriate income multipliers, quoted share prices on an active market for similar enterprises or other available fair value indicators applicable to the assets being measured. In determining value in use, assets are measured at the level of cash-generating units on a continuing operations basis. Estimated future cash flows are discounted at a rate determined for each cash-generating unit using the weighted average cost of capital method (WACC). If an impairment loss on an asset other than goodwill subsequently reverses in full or in part, the asset carrying amount is increased to reflect the new estimated recoverable amount, which may not exceed the amount that would have been reflected in the absence of the impairment loss. Impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses are taken to the income statement. 1.12. Financial assets All financial assets are recognized initially at cost at the purchase date. Cost corresponds to fair value plus additional costs attributable to the purchase. Subsequent to initial recognition, assets held for trading are classified as current financial assets and carried at fair value; any gains or losses are taken to the income statement. Held-to-maturity investments are classified as current financial assets, if they mature within one year; otherwise they are classified as non-current assets and subsequently carried at amortized cost. Amortized cost is determined using the effective interest rate method, taking account of any acquisition discounts or premiums, which are apportioned over the entire period until maturity, less any impairment losses. Other financial assets are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value. Any gains or losses are shown in a separate equity caption until the assets are sold, recovered or discontinued, or until they are found to be impaired, in which case the cumulative gains or losses in equity are taken to the income statement. Equity instruments that are not listed on an active market and whose fair value cannot be measured reliably are carried at cost. 251 www.italcementigroup.com 1.13. Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of purchase/production cost (using the weighted average cost method) and net realizable value. Purchase cost includes costs incurred to bring assets to their present location, less allowances for obsolete and slow-moving items. Production cost of finished goods and semi-finished goods includes the cost of raw materials, direct labor and a portion of general production costs, determined on the basis of normal plant operations. Financial costs are not included. The net realizable value of raw materials, consumables and supplies is their replacement cost. The net realizable value of finished goods and semi-finished goods is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated cost of completion and estimated costs to sell. 1.14. Trade receivables and other receivables Trade receivables and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount, less allowances for uncollectible amounts, which are provided as doubtful debts are identified. 1.15. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash on hand, bank demand deposits and other treasury investments with original maturity of not more than three months. Current account overdrafts are treated as financing and not as a component of cash and cash equivalents. The definition of cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows is identical to that in the statement of financial position. 1.16. Income taxes Current income taxes are provided in accordance with local tax laws in the countries where the Group operates. Deferred tax is recognized using the liability criterion, based on temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the statement of financial position. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which such differences, losses or credits may be reversed. Taxable or deductible temporary differences do not generate recognition of deferred tax liabilities or assets only in the following cases: Ɣ taxable temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, unless goodwill is taxdeductible; Ɣ taxable or deductible temporary differences arising from initial recognition of an asset or a liability in transactions that are not business combinations and affect neither accounting profit nor taxable profit at the transaction date; Ɣ equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures when: a) the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the taxable temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; b) it is not probable that the deductible temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and that taxable income will be available against which the temporary difference can be used; Ɣ deferred tax assets are reviewed at the end of every reporting period and reduced to the extent that sufficient taxable income is no longer likely to be available in the future against which the assets can be used in full or in part. 252 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined at tax rates expected to apply when the deferred tax asset (liability) is realized (settled), based on rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. Taxes relating to items recognized directly in equity are recognized in equity, not in the income statement. 1.17. Employee benefits The company operates pension plans, post-employment medical benefit plans and post-employment benefits. It also has other commitments, in the form of bonuses payable to employees on the basis of length of service in the company (“Other long-term benefits”). Defined contribution plans Defined contribution plans are structured post-employment benefit programs where the company pays fixed contributions to an insurance company or pension fund and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not dispose of sufficient assets to pay all the employee benefits accruing in respect of services rendered during the current year and in previous years. These contributions are paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees and recognized as expense as incurred. Defined benefit plans Defined benefit plans are structured post-employment benefit programs that constitute a future obligation for the company. In substance, the company assumes the actuarial and investment risks of the plan. In accordance with IAS 19, the company uses the unit credit projection method to determine the present value of obligations and the related current service cost. These actuarial calculations require use of consistent and objective actuarial assumptions about demographic variables (mortality rate, personnel turnover rate) and financial variables (discount rate, future increases in salaries and medical benefits). The post-employment benefits in Italy (TFR, trattamento di fine rapporto) are treated in the same way as benefit obligations arising from defined benefit plans. Termination benefits Termination benefits include provisions for restructuring costs recognized when the company has approved a detailed formal plan that has already been implemented or notified to the third parties concerned. Actuarial gains and losses Actuarial gains and losses on post-employment defined benefit plans may arise as a result of changes in the actuarial assumptions used in two consecutive periods or as a result of changes in the obligation value or in the fair value of any plan asset in respect of the actuarial assumptions used at the beginning of the period. The company uses the corridor method whereby actuarial gains and losses are recognized as income or expense when their unrecognized cumulative net value, for each plan, at the end of the previous period exceeds 10% of the larger of present value of the defined benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets at that date. These gains or losses are taken to profit or loss over the estimated average residual working life of the employees participating in the plans. Actuarial gains and losses relating to “Other long-term benefits” (service medals, length of service benefits) and to early retirement benefits are recognized as income or expense immediately. 253 www.italcementigroup.com Past service cost Changes in liabilities resulting from a change to an existing defined benefit plan are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over an average period until the benefits have vested. Costs for benefits that vest immediately upon changes to a plan are recognized as expense as incurred. Curtailment and settlement Gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognized as income or expense when the curtailment or settlement occurs. The gain or loss includes changes in the present value of the obligation, changes in the fair value of plan assets, actuarial gains or losses and past service costs not previously accounted for. At the curtailment or settlement date, the obligation and the fair value of the plan assets are re-measured using current actuarial assumptions. 1.18. Share-based payments The company has applied IFRS 2 as from January 1, 2004. Options for the subscription and purchase of shares granted by the company to employees and directors give rise to recognition of a cost classified under employee expenses, with a corresponding increase in equity. In accordance with IFRS 2, only options granted after November 7, 2002, whose rights had not vested at December 31, 2003, have been measured and recognized at the transition date. Options for the subscription and purchase of shares are measured at fair value at the grant date and amortized over the vesting period. Fair value is determined using the binomial method, and taking account of dividends. Future volatility is determined on the basis of historic market prices, after adjustment for extraordinary events or factors. The cost of granted options is reviewed on the basis of the actual number of options that have vested at the beginning of the exercise period. 1.19. Provisions for risks and charges The company recognizes provisions for risks and charges when a present legal or constructive obligation arises as a result of a past event, the amount of which can be reliably estimated, and use of resources is probable to settle the obligation. Provisions reflect the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation or transfer it to third parties at the reporting date. If the present value of the financial resources that will be used is material, provisions are determined by discounting expected future cash flows at a rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is performed, movements in provisions due to the effect of time or changes in interest rates are recognized in financial items. Changes in estimates are recognized in the income statement for the period. The company recognizes a separate provision for environmental restoration obligations on land used for quarry work, determined in relation to the use of the quarry in question. Pending publication of a standard/interpretation on accounting treatment of greenhouse gas emission allowances, after the withdrawal of IFRIC 3 by the International Accounting Standards Board, the company recognizes a separate provision when emissions are greater than the allowance. 1.20. Loans and borrowings Loans and borrowings are initially recognized at the fair value of the consideration provided/received less charges directly attributable to the financial asset/liability. After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. 254 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 1.21. Trade payables and other payables Trade payables and other payables are stated at the fair value of the original consideration received. 1.22. Derivatives The company uses derivatives such as foreign currency forward contracts and interest-rate swaps and options to hedge currency and interest-rate risks. Derivatives are measured and recognized at fair value. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined on the basis of the current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest-rate contracts is determined on the basis of discounted flows using the zero coupon curve. Hedging transactions Derivatives are designated as hedging instruments or as non-hedging instruments. Transactions that qualify for application of hedge accounting are classified as hedging transactions; other transactions are designated as trading transactions, even if they are performed for the purposes of risk management. For accounting purposes, hedging transactions are classified as “fair value hedges” if they cover the risk of changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability; or as cash flow hedges” if they hedge cash flows arising from an existing asset or liability or from a future transaction, which are exposed to variability. With regard to fair value hedges, fair value gains and losses on the derivatives are taken to the income statement immediately. Similarly, the underlying assets or liabilities are measured at fair value and any gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk is recognized as an income or expense balancing entry. If the movement refers to an interest-bearing financial instrument, it is amortized in the income statement until maturity. With regard to cash flow hedges (foreign currency forward contracts, fixed-rate interest swaps), movements in inherent value are reflected in a separate equity caption, while time-based changes and the non-effective hedge component are recognized in the income statement. The effective component and non-effective component are calculated using the methods indicated in IAS 39. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives designated for trading are recorded as income or expense. When the financial instrument matures, is sold, settled, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, the derivative is no longer treated as a hedging contract. In this case, gains or losses on the derivative are retained in equity until the hedged transaction takes place. If the company no longer expects the hedged transaction to take place, the net gain or loss in equity is taken to the income statement. 1.23. Revenue, other revenue, interest income and dividends Sale of goods and services Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale of goods or rendering of services are collected by the company and the amount in question can be reliably determined. Revenue is recognized at the fair value of the consideration received or due, taking account of any trade discounts given and volume discounts. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the company transfers the material risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the goods to the purchaser. Rental income Rental income is recognized as other revenue, as received. 255 www.italcementigroup.com Interest income Interest income is classified as finance income on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. Dividends Dividends are recognized as finance income as shareholders’ right to receive payment arises. 1.24. Government grants Government grants are recognized when there is a reasonable certainty that they will be received and all the requirements on which receipt depends have been fulfilled. Grants related to the purchase or production of non-current assets (grants related to assets) are recognized as deferred income and taken to the income statement over the useful life of the underlying assets. 256 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

Software licenses of indeterminate life and the related development costs are amortized over a five-year period. Impairment losses refer to CO2 emission rights held at year-end for 864 thousand euro and were applied on the basis of market price. 258 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 4. Investments in subsidiaries and associates The changes compared to December 31, 2010, were as follows: (in thousands of euro) At December 31, 2010 1,740,651 Acquisitions 55,825 Repayments ( 450) Sales ( 14,551) Impairment losses on financial assets ( 52,284) Impairment losses on financial assets withdrawn from reserves ( 7,524) At December 31, 2011 1,721,667 During the year the subsidiary Sicilfin S.r.l. incorporated the companies Silicalcite S.r.l., Italcementi Ingegneria S.r.l., Intertrading S.r.l., Immobiliare Salesiane S.r.l. and Imes S.r.l. and changed its business name to Italcementi Ingegneria S.r.l.; the values of these equity investments were, therefore, combined. Acquisitions refer mainly to the payment to replenish losses at Nuova Sacelit S.p.A. and to the increase in the share capital of Calcestruzzi S.p.A., for, respectively, 5,000 thousand euro and 50,787 thousand euro. Repayments refer to the partial return of the share capital by Sirio S.p.A.. Sales include the sale of the equity investment in Axim Italia S.p.A. at a sale price of 15,203 thousand euro, for which a net gain of 1,633 thousand euro was posted under finance income. Investments in subsidiaries and associates are tested for impairment if evidence of impairment emerges, by comparing carrying amount with recoverable amount. The methods used to determine recoverable amount are described in the accounting policies in the section “Impairment losses on assets”. The value configuration used to determine the recoverable amount of equity investments is value in use, that is, fair value less costs to sell, with reference to comparable transactions. The value in use of each equity investment is determined on the basis of 2012 budget data and on the discounted projection of expected future cash flows, taking account of changes in operating assets, net of the effects of investments for additions or restructuring. The observation period varies between five to nine years according to the characteristics of the markets on which the Group companies operate. The terminal value is calculated on the basis of the discounted cash flows for the last year. The growth rate is based on the forecast long-term growth of the relevant industrial sector of the country and on the estimated long-term inflation rate. The estimate assumes a growth rate, for operations in Italy, equivalent to the long-term inflation rate (2%).

On July 27, 2011, a long-standing dispute relating to the years from 1996 to 1999 ended when the Court of Cassation rejected the appeals filed by the State and confirmed in full the rulings of the Milan Regional Tax Commission. The proceeding was concluded with an additional tax charge of 0.8 million euro, compared with the amount of 68 million euro initially claimed by the tax authorities. In addition, on December 13, 2010, the Supreme Court of Cassation discussed the appeal relating to 1987; on March 2, 2011, it deposited its ruling upholding the two cross appeals presented by the company and overturned, for approximately 4 million euro of taxable income, the sentence of the Regional Tax Commission in our favor, since the grounds of the judge’s ruling were per relationem. The case was reopened on January 13, 2012, by the Regional Tax Commission. On February 1, 2011, the Regional Tax Commission decided in favor of the company, by confirming the sentence of first instance, which annulled a notice of assessment relating to 2003, and also declaring that the notice was without merit, since no intent of evasion was perceived in the company’s conduct. In August 2009, the Regional Tax Office for Major Contributors served a notice of assessment relating to 2004, against which the company appealed in November 2009. A hearing was held and on October 12, 2011, the Tax Commission annulled the notice and upheld the company’s arguments in full. The Regional Office of Lombardy served notices of assessment relating to 2005 and 2006 regarding the same matter as the notices for 2003 and 2004, the judicial outcome of which was in the company’s favor. The company has appealed to the Milan Tax Commission for both years. Of the decrease in the provision for tax, 630 thousand euro referred to the payment of tax demands and 800 thousand euro to the use of a surplus provision following a sentence issued by the Supreme Court of Cassation. The increase in the provision for the restoration of quarries includes a cash adjustment of 231 thousand euro, charged to the income statement under “Finance costs”. The decreases in the provision for restoration of industrial areas refer entirely to use of the provision for expenses incurred for the dismantling of plant and the remediation of some sites. The decreases in the provision for other risks relate to the settlement of an outstanding dispute and to the first payment made in favor of the Azzanelli foundation for construction of a new geriatric facility. 267 www.italcementigroup.com 18.

No drawings had been made on the facility at December 31, 2011; Main intercompany borrowings and lines of credit at Italcementi S.p.A. b) In 2011, after finalization of a bilateral bank line of credit arranged by Italcementi Finance S.A., Italcementi S.p.A. obtained from Italcementi Finance S.A. a 50 million euro five-year renewable line of credit. No drawings had been made on the line at December 31, 2011; c) In 2010, concomitantly with the Italcementi Finance S.A. bond issue, Italcementi S.p.A. obtained two tenyear intercompany loans from Italcementi Finance S.A., one at a fixed rate and one at a floating rate, for a total amount of 210 million euro; d) In 2010, Italcementi S.p.A. took part in financing the repurchase offer on the Ciments Français S.A. US Private Placements, granting Ciments Français S.A. a long-term 5-year floating-rate intercompany loan for 100 million euro; e) In 2010, concomitantly with the finalization of the Italcementi Finance S.A. syndicated line of credit, Italcementi S.p.A. obtained from Italcementi Finance S.A. a five-year 220 million euro renewable line of credit. No drawings had been made on the line at December 31, 2011; f) As a result of the Moody’s rating downgrade on December 15, 2011, the intercompany loans granted by Italcementi Finance S.A. to Italcementi S.p.A. for a total amount of 210 million euro will be subject to the applicable interest-rate increase of 125 basis points, in compliance with the step-up clause of the 750 million euro bond issued by Italcementi Finance S.A.. 272 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 19.2 Management of liquidity, credit and counterparty risks 19.2.1 Liquidity risk Italcementi S.p.A. cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011 were immaterial. The company’s objective is to maintain a debt level able to ensure a balance between average debt maturity, flexibility and diversification of sources. Consequently, it arranges confirmed lines of credit and diversified sources of finance. Distribution of loan maturities is balanced, and will enable the company to refinance its borrowings as they fall due in a satisfactory manner, despite the difficult economic scenario. The company’s policy is designed to ensure that at any time debt maturing in under two years is less than or equal to undrawn confirmed lines of credit. As from 2010, under its financial policy review, Italcementi S.p.A. is a recipient of the fund-raising activities of Italcementi Finance, enabling it to improve its access to credit and benefit from the synergies of a centralized financial policy. The policy aims to obtain loans at competitive conditions and to ensure a balance between average debt maturity, flexibility and diversification of sources. Consequently, Italcementi S.p.A. obtains refinancing from Italcementi Finance through shortand long-term intercompany loans, arranged at arm’s length conditions.

At December 31, 2011, Italcementi S.p.A. had 1,345 million euro of confirmed lines of credit, of which 765 million euro undrawn and immediately available (1,295 and 795 million euro respectively at December 31, 2010). 19.2.2 Covenants In addition to the customary clauses, some of the company’s financing contracts include covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios, fixed for the most part at the year end. For bilateral lines of credit and borrowings, failure to comply with covenants leads to termination and consequent early repayment, although these clauses also include a stand-by period prior to actual execution. Lines of credit and financing contracts do not contain rating triggers that would lead to early repayment. Some financing contracts involve assumption of negative pledges to the counterparty, although these are limited to specific instances that do not substantially compromise the company’s ability to finance or refinance its operations. At December 31, 2011, lines of credit and loans subject to covenants accounted for 12% of total drawings represented by gross debt (1,317 million euro at December 31, 2011, excluding the fair value effects of derivatives). At December 31, 2011, the company complied with all contractual commitments; covenant-related financial ratios were well within the contractual limits agreed by the loans in question. The company expects to comply with its covenants for the next 12 months and will provide information as appropriate should its financial situation deteriorate. 19.2.3 Credit risk In compliance with Italcementi S.p.A. procedures, customers electing extended terms of payment are vetted for credit worthiness before and during the life of the contract. Credit checks take the form of customerbalance monitoring by the administrative department, whose procedures also regulate provisions for overdue receivables at regular intervals. The concentration of trade credit risks is limited by virtue of Italcementi S.p.A.’s broadly based and uncorrelated customer portfolio. For this reason, management believes that no further provisions for credit risks will be necessary beyond the amounts normally provided for uncollectible and doubtful receivables. 19.2.4 Counterparty risk Currency and interest-rate instruments are transacted only with counterparties with high ratings, selected on the basis of a number of criteria: ratings attributed by specialist agencies, assets and equity as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. The majority of counterparties are leading international banks. No financial instruments are negotiated with counterparties in geographical regions exposed to political or financial risks. All counterparts are in Western Europe or in the USA. At December 31, 2011, Italcementi S.p.A.’s credit exposure (intragroup current accounts) to the Calcestruzzi group, standing at 212.5 million euro, did not present risk in excess of that already contemplated in testing Italcementi’s interest in the Calcestruzzi group for impairment. 274 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

Derivatives are measured and recognized at fair value. The fair value of interest-rate contracts is determined on the present value of cash flows using the zero coupon curve. The fair value of forward currency purchase contracts is based on the current exchange rates of contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of foreign currency payables and receivables is determined using closing rates. The fair value of fixed-rate payables and receivables is based on a fixed rate with no credit margin, net of transaction costs directly related to the financial asset or liability. Other short-term financing includes financial liabilities and current account amounts due to Group companies for 75,908 thousand euro. 275 www.italcementigroup.com 19.3.1 Fair value of derivatives The table shows the fair value of financial instruments reflected in the statement of financial position, subdivided by type of hedge: December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 (in thous ands of euro) Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Interest-rate derivatives hedging cash flows 1,989 2,596 Trading interest-rate derivatives Exchange-rate derivatives hedging cash flows 1,520 678 571 Exchange-rate derivatives hedging fair value 17 Trading exchange-rate derivatives 172 Total short-term 1,537 1,989 678 3,339 Interest-rate derivatives hedging cash flows 10,604 83 7,837 Total medium/long-term 10,604 83 7,837 Italcementi S.p.A. does not set up hedges on sales and purchases of shares. Derivatives on trading exchange rates and interest rates refer to assets that do not qualify for recognition with hedge accounting criteria. The fair value of derivatives relating to EUA and CER transactions was 1,910 thousand euro at December 31, 2011, of which -28,364 thousand euro reflected under “Other current liabilities”, 31,412 thousand euro under “Other current assets”, -16,541 thousand euro under “Other non-current liabilities” and 15,403 thousand euro under “Other non-current assets”. 2011 derivative transactions on emission rights had an impact of –2,095 thousand euro on the income statement and 4,251 thousand euro on equity (OCI reserve). The fair value of derivatives relating to transactions on electricity at December 31, 2011, was -509 thousand euro, reflected under “Other current liabilities” for -814 thousand euro and “Other current assets” for 305 thousand euro. 2011 derivative transactions on electricity had an impact of–46 thousand euro on the income statement and 463 thousand euro on equity (OCI reserve). The fair value of derivatives relating to transactions on tin(II) sulfate at December 31, 2011, was -18 thousand euro, reflected entirely under “Other current liabilities”. 2011 derivative transactions on tin(II) sulfate had an impact of -18 thousand euro on equity (OCI reserve). 19.3.2 Fair value – hierarchy In determining and documenting the fair value of financial instruments, the company uses the following hierarchy based on different measurement methods: level 1: financial instruments with prices quoted on active markets; level 2: prices quoted on active markets for similar financial instruments, or fair value determined with other measurement methods where all significant inputs are based on observable market data; level 3: fair value determined with measurement methods where no significant input is based on observable market data. 276 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

It hedges two types of risk: 1. the risk of variations in the market value of fixed-rate borrowing and lending transactions. Group fixed-rate debt is exposed to an “opportunity cost” risk in the event of a fall in interest rates. A change in interest rates will affect the market value of fixed-rate assets and liabilities and impact the consolidated profit or loss in the event of liquidation or early repayment of these instruments; 2. the risk linked to future flows arising from floating-rate borrowing and lending transactions. A change in interest rates will have a negligible impact on the market value of floating-rate financial assets and liabilities but will affect finance costs and, consequently, future profits. The Group manages this dual risk as part of its general policy, performance targets and risk reduction targets by giving priority to hedges on future flows over the shortand medium-term, within the specified limits. It hedges interest-rate risks mainly by arranging interest-rate swaps and interest-rate options with top-ranking banks. Exposure in derivatives may never exceed the value of the underlying. 277 www.italcementigroup.com 19.4.1 Interest-rate risk hedging The table below sets out the notional value of interest-rate derivatives by maturity: Maturity Maturity Maturity Maturity Total less than 1 to 2 2 to 5 more than (in millions of euro) 1 year years years 5 years Cash flow hedges SWAPS pays Fixed / receives Floating 400 M€ Euribor 3M 2.073% 100.0 125.0 175.0 400.0 100 M€ Euribor 6M 2.696% 25.0 25.0 50.0 100.0 Cash flow hedges Options 120.0 120.0 Total 245.0 150.0 225.0 620.0 19.4.2 Exposure to interest-rate risk At December 31, 2011, 86% of Italcementi S.p.A. net debt (not including the fair value of derivatives) was at a fixed rate or hedged against the risk of rate increases. 84% of fixed-rate commitments arose from swapped contracts initially arranged at floating rates. Hedges are stated at nominal value for the period in question (consistently with instrument maturity) and do not include fixed-rate to fixed-rate contracts. 19.4.3 Net debt at inception and after interest-rate hedging The evolution of net debt at December 31, 2011, is illustrated in the table below: 12.31.2011 Maturity Maturity Maturity Maturity less than 1 to 2 2 to 5 more than (in millions of euro) 1 year years years 5 years Fixed-rate financial liabilities 100.5 0.2 0.2 0.6 99.5 Fixed-rate financial assets (8.5) 0.0 0.0 0.0 (8.5) Floatingto fixed-rate hedges 500.0 125.0 150.0 225.0 0.0 Fixed-rate ND after hedging 592.0 125.2 150.2 225.6 91.0 Floating-rate financial liabilities 1,216.5 484.8 333.5 229.5 168.7 Floating-rate financial assets (480.6) (380.6) (100.0) Floating-rate ND at inception 735.9 104.2 333.5 129.5 168.7 Floatingto fixed-rate hedges (500.0) (125.0) (150.0) (225.0) Optional hedges (120.0) (120.0) 0.0 Floating-rate ND after hedging 115.9 (140.8) 183.5 (95.5) 168.7 Optional hedges 120.0 120.0 0.0 0.0 Fair value of derivatives, net 11.1 0.5 2.4 8.2 Total ND 838.9 104.9 336.1 138.3 259.7 At December 31, 2011, a +0.5% change in the interest-rate curve would have had an impact of -0.6 million euro, that is, 1.8% of 2011 net finance costs. The impact on interest-rate derivatives in portfolio would be +5.7 million euro on equity and immaterial on profit before tax. At December 31, 2011, a -0.5% change in the interest-rate curve would have had an impact of +0.6 million euro, that is 1.8% of 2011 net finance costs.

Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 The company is structurally exposed to currency risks mainly on US dollar solid fuel purchases. The company hedges exposure to the currency risk with forward currency purchase contracts, as well as call and put options on exchange rates.These hedges are arranged with leading banks. 19.5.1. Exposure to currency risk Foreign currency exposure refers largely to US dollars for solid fuel purchases. At December 31, 2011, a 10% rise in the US dollar against the euro would have had an impact on exchangerate derivatives in portfolio of +3.2 million euro on equity and an immaterial impact on profit before tax. At December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in the US dollar against the euro would have had an impact on exchange-rate derivatives in portfolio of -3.2 million euro on equity and an immaterial impact on profit before tax. 19.5.2 Currency risk hedges Currency hedges stated at the closing rates are illustrated below: (in millions of euro) 12.31.2011 12.31.2010 Forward purchases Cash flow hedges US dollars 32.5 19.0 Fair value hedges US dollars 1.4 Total 33.9 19.0 Options Cash flow hedges US dollars 17.0 Trading US dollars 7.5 Total 24.5 Exchange-rate derivatives at Dec em ber 31, 2011, expire within 12 m onths 19.6 Management of commodity risk CO2 Italcementi S.p.A. is exposed to market fluctuations on CO2 emission rights prices, in connection with its surplus or deficit on the quotas allocated by its national government. From 2008 to 2011, Italcementi S.p.A. transacted forward EUA-CER swaps (forward EUA sales and forward CER purchases) distributed in the period 2009-2013, to diversify and optimize its CO 2 emission rights portfolio. Furthermore, in 2010 and 2011, Italcementi S.p.A arranged price risk hedges with respect to the sales of surplus emission rights planned in the fourth quarter of 2010 for 2011 and 2012. In 2011, in view of the surplus accumulated and the macroeconomic and industry scenario, Italcementi S.p.A. sold EUAs on the spot market for 28.0 million euro (18.4 million euro in 2010). In 2010 and 2011 Italcementi S.p.A. also operated on the spot and forward markets on behalf of the Group’s other European companies under an agency basis. 279 www.italcementigroup.com ELECTRICITY In 2011, Italcementi S.p.A. arranged price risk hedges on electric power purchases for 2011 and 2012. TIN (II) SULFATE In 2011, Italcementi S.p.A. arranged a modest volume of price risk hedges on tin(II) sulfate purchases for 2011 and 2012. 19.7 Management of equity risk Italcementi S.p.A. is exposed to market fluctuations on listed shares held in portfolio recognized under “Other equity investments”. Treasury shares held by Italcementi S.p.A. are measured at cost and deducted against equity under the “Treasury shares” reserve (see note 14). The risk of fluctuations in the value of these equity investments is not actively managed with financial hedging instruments. 19.8 Hedge Accounting The effects arising from application of hedge accounting rules are summarized below. The specific equity reserve reflects fair value gains and losses on the effective component of cash flow hedges only. New derivatives recognized in equity totaled +344 thousand euro at December 31, 2011 (-1,796 thousand euro at December 31, 2010). The eliminated portion of the reserve relating to instruments that expired in 2011 amounted to +9,858 thousand euro at December 31, 2011, compared with +19,452 thousand euro at December 31, 2010. The changes in equity relating to derivatives traded in 2010 and still in portfolio at December 31, 2011, amounted to -7,305 thousand euro (-14,694 thousand euro at December 31, 2010). The non-effective component of cash flow hedges in portfolio at December 31, 2011, recognized in profit or loss was immaterial in both 2011 and 2010. 280 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A.

Indeed, we monitored the compliance with the laws and the By-laws, as well as the observance of correct management principle, by obtaining information by the Directors concerning the activities carried out and transactions having a significant impact on the financial statements undertaken by the Company and its subsidiaries. In this regard, we can reasonably state that the mentioned transactions have been performed in compliance with the applicable laws and company By-laws and they did not appear clearly careless, risky, in potential conflict of interest or not consistent with shareholders meeting resolutions’ or such as to compromise the corporate assets’ integrity. As far as our supervisory activity is concerned, we supervised the adequacy of the organizational structure of the company, obtaining, to this extent, on one hand information from the executives in charge of the relevant functions, and on the other hand liaising on this matter with the Audit Firm during periodical meetings. In this connection, we have no remarks to report. We checked the adequacy of the instructions given by the Company to its subsidiaries under art. 114, par 2 of the Consolidated Law on Finance, as well as the compliance with the fulfillments under art. 36 of Regulation on Markets. We supervised the adequacy of the internal control system, the risk management and the accountingadministrative system, as well as its reliability in fairly representing management operations. To this end: We periodically met the Chief Executive Officer, who is also executive director responsible for overseeing the internal control system, and he illustrated the activities carried out by each Department involved in the operation of the control system, in relation to which we report hereinbelow; We reviewed the quarterly reports of the Manager in charge of preparing the company’s financial reports, whose contents have been in-depth examined during several meetings. We therefore obtained information, inter alia, on the activities undertaken in order to update the “Reference operating model for the assessment of the internal control system regarding the financial disclosure”, by introducing new procedures and adjusting those already existing; on the review of the Group accounting principles manual; on the periodic update of the analysis aimed at identifying processes having significant impact on financial reporting to be subject to operational planning; on the definition of actions to be undertaken as a consequence of the results of administrative and accounting audits carried out by the Internal control Department; We examined the periodic reports prepared by the Risk Management Department, which had been illustrated by the manager in charge of said department during specific meetings. We therefore were in the position to acknowledge the scheduled actions, aimed at improving the company’s performance by measuring, managing and controlling previously identified main risks, and that risks mitigation procedures were extended to the whole Group; We assessed the Audit Plan proposed by the Controller for the 2011 fiscal year, and we had been monitoring its progress during the year. We hereby report that the Plan had been properly executed and that it concerned operating procedures, IT systems, compliance issues, as well as certain audits 302 2011 Annual Report Presentation 4 General information 15 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Report Directors’ report 150 Extraordinary session Italcementi S.p.A. Annual Report Separate financial statements 239 which had not been originally scheduled; We continuously liaised with the Audit Firm, and we examined the documents prepared by the latter concerning their action plan and its execution; We attended the Internal Control Committee meetings and, anytime the items on the agenda deemed it appropriate, we examined them jointly the Committee; We met the Compliance Committee members and, by examining their reports, we acknowledged from time to time the updating process of the “Organizational, Management and Control Model”, adopted by the company according to Legislative Decree 231/2001; We liaised with supervisory bodies of the main subsidiaries and no data nor information emerged that we deem appropriate to highlight in this report; We also met the Statutory Auditors of the parent company Italmobiliare S.p.A. in order to have a proficient exchange of information. Having recalled that the audit international standards provide for a Quality Assessment Review on the internal control system to be performed by independent auditors at least every five years, we hereby report that the company appointed the Institut de l’audit e du control internes (IFACI) to undertake such assessment. IFACI has recently completed its diagnostic analysis on the Department in charge of the control system and on the operating methods followed by the latter, and it confirmed a substantial compliance with the IIA/IFACI framework standards in terms of duties, organization and efficiency of such Department. Based on the outcome of the undertaken activities and taking into account the ascertained regularity and the order of the financial information flow generated within the different corporate areas, we hereby assess the adequacy of the internal control system in force within the Company. Such system, updated on an ongoing basis and, consequently, subject to a positive evolution process, significantly contributes to the Company efficiency and effectiveness’ improvement process and, in particular, to the risk management. In our capacity as Internal control and audit Committee, according to the provisions of art. 19 of the Leg. Decree 39/2010, we hereby confirm that there are no remarks thereupon to be reported at the shareholders’ meeting. In the execution of our supervisory activity, we did not notice unusual or atypical transactions, undertaken with Company’s subsidiaries or related parties or with third parties. With reference to infra-group transactions or ordinary transactions with related parties executed during the year, we noted that directors properly highlighted and illustrated in the Directors’ Report, which we refer to, the relevant features and the financial impact. As far as we are concerned, we acknowledge that these transactions have been executed in the interest of the Company and in compliance with the provided procedure. To this extent, we point out that, as of January 1, 2011, the “Procedures for transactions with related parties” according to the CONSOB Regulation of January 24, 2010 and the subsequent explanatory report of September 24, 2010, whose guidelines were already adopted by the Board of Directors in its meeting of November 5, 2010, are currently in place. The pending legal proceedings have been duly illustrated in the Management Report and they appear to be carefully defended for the purposes of protecting the company. We report that no criticalities emerged during meetings with the Audit Firm; this is confirmed, on one hand, by the Report under art. 19, third paragraph, of Legislative Decree 39/2010 which was presented by the Audit Firm to this Board on March 26, 2012 and which states that, in the execution of the audit activities, no significant lacks in the Internal control system with reference to the financial disclosure process emerged. 303 www.italcementigroup.com On the other hand, the absence of any criticalities in the internal control and accounting systems of the company is confirmed also in the Audit Firm Reports on the separate and consolidated financial statements, dated March 26, 2012 which do not raise any remarks nor disclosure recalls. In these reports, the Audit Firm also confirmed consistency of directors’ reports with the respective financial statements, so assessing compliance, in the financial statements, with the provisions of art. 123-bis of the Consolidated Law on Finance and of the Consob/Isvap/Banca d’Italia joint Regulation no. 4, dated March 3rd 2010. The Directors drafted the separate and consolidated financial statements in accordance, as provided for, with IAS/IFRS Accounting Standards, as implemented by the EU, highlighting the occurred updates, and they provided the information requested by the aforementioned Regulation no. 4 of March 3rd 2010 in the Directors’ report. As to the impairment test, the Directors approved criteria and methods to be followed, also confirming the economic data used for income forecasts if not consistent with the those included in the 2010-2014 Business Plan. We point out that Calcestruzzi S.p.A., which had been excluded from the management and coordination activity of the company in the recent past, was reconsolidated during 2011. We ascertained that the Remuneration Committee had been properly proposing guidelines (both in the merit and procedurally) concerning the definition and execution of the company’s remuneration policy; said guidelines are included in the Remuneration Report, approved by the Board of Directors, and to be submitted to the Shareholders’ meeting under art. 123-ter of Consolidated Law on Finance. The Company’s compliance with the Corporate Governance Code, drafted by the Corporate Governance Committee of listed companies, is illustrated in the appropriate section of the Directors’ report and we deem such illustration to be adequate and exhaustive. As far as our intervention is concerned, we assessed the existence of professional and independence requisites for the members of this Board and we also monitored the application of the self-examination procedure followed by the Board of Directors, with specific regard to the requisites set out for the independent directors. With reference to our supervisory activity concerning the Audit Firm independence requisite under art. 17, par. 9, let a), of Legislative Decree 39/2010, we hereby acknowledge the contents of the “Transparency Report” updated as at December 2011 and drafted by the Audit Firm and published on its web site, and we also received the written statement provided by art. 17, par. 9, let a), of Legislative Decree 39/2010 on March 26, 2012. Moreover, the Audit Firm informed us about its remuneration for activities other than those related to its audit activity and received by itself or by domestic and foreign entities belonging to its network. With reference to the “Principles on the Audit Firm independence” released by the National Board of Accountants as referred to in Consob resolution no. 15185, we note that such remuneration, reported hereunder (figures Euro/000), does not appear to represent any criticality impacting on the Audit Firm’s independence.
