Badaj oz, Spain, June 16th 2012 Dear All I take great pride in submitting our first Communication on Progress. I am really pleased to reconfirm *GARCU Y MARQUEZ, SERVICruS INMOBILURIOS' commitment and continued support of the United Nations Global Compact and its ten principles. These principles, which correspond to our global corporate citizenship commitments, help guide our efforts to achieve greater accountability and drive continuous improvement in our business practices. Our involvement in the UN Global Compact also brings new opportunities to partner with other orgartizations that share our commitments. The real estate industry as a whole has faced some significant challenges due to the current global recession. The diminished availability of credit negatively impacted real estate pricing, and significantly reduced the volume and pace of commercial real estate transactions. Nevertheless our commitment to corporate social responsibility is stronger \o c{ than ever. I firmly believe that there is no other way to do business than through an \¡o \o ethical and humanist approach.
