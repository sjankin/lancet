Traffic Authorities in Denmark are handling an increasing number of cases. As a consequence of the manner in which the courts interpret the regulation, the company expects increased expenses in connection with compliance with the regulation. Aircraft insurance Air Greenland’s long-standing agreement with several airlines concerning aircraft insurance expired in 2011. The company was therefore forced to find other insurance on the market. Before the expiry, we had the advantage of being insured in a larger pool, where the risk was shared among several parts, resulting in lower premiums. Air Greenland joined a new, smaller pool in 2012, which has resulted in a doubling of the premium. The high costs are mainly attributable to the diversity of the fleet, where the risk exposure of helicopter operations incurs high premiums. 16 17 Market development Still the biggest Transatlantic traffic Air Greenland is still the biggest player in the In 2011, Air Greenland has had four to five market for passenger transport to, from and weekly flights between Copenhagen and in Greenland.

Air Greenland is therefore working actively to accommodate processes, audits and attitude modification to the new demands, particularly those from the offshore sector. These are described as OGP standards (Oil & Gas Producers), which contain very specific requirements for direct suppliers to the branch. Air Greenland has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the company’s present procedures with a view to preparing a list of the areas, where adjustments are needed. 21 Operations PUNC TUALIT Y 2011 2010 85% 75% 65% 55% 45% 35% 25% 15% 5% JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC The year’s punctuality, measured on all deparIn 2011, production was marked by the transitures within 15 minutes compared to the timetion from DHC-7 to DHC-8.

However, this area of business fluctuates with world market prices, so there is still a significant risk factor. 26 EU regulations for compensation The present regulations are suited to a tightly regulated EU market, where roads and technical conditions have less influence on regularity than is the case in Greenland, where a wide route network has to be weaved together to ensure basic distribution services for the country. Regulations require the payment of € 400 in compensation for certain delays and cancellations out of EU. With the present legislation, the company estimates the probability of an annual compensation figure in the doubledigit millions. The legislation is unclear, since enforcement of the regulations has undergone huge changes following lawsuits. Service contracts One of the major risk factors for Air Greenland is the composition of the coming service contracts, including emergency readiness, which expire at the end of 2012. The existing contracts have existed for seven years without major adjustments, so the specifications in the tender documents will determine which contracts Air Greenland will bid on for the coming period. A major risk factor is the timeframe for clarification regarding the service contracts, since there will be significant costs involved in phasing out equipment and personnel, should the service contracts be significantly inferior, compared to previous earnings. 27 Report on the Company’s Corporate Social Responsibility UN Global Compact Following the sale of our Boeing 757, the winter Air Greenland’s work with social responsibility of 2010/2011 was the first time when there (Corporate Social Responsibility, CSR) is based were no direct flights between Narsarsuaq on compliance with the 10 principles of UN’s and Copenhagen.
