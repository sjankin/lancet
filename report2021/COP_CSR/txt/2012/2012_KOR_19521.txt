We would like to express our deepest gratitude to all of you for your continuous encouragement and support. Since the foundation of Hansung Electric Company in 1898, KEPCO has stably supplied electric power, the driving force behind the national industries of Korea, and led the economic development for 114 years. Now KEPCO established the vision of 'Global Top Green & Smart Energy Pioneer,' and is writing a new history under the spirit of 'New Area, New Contents.' The rapid changes in the business environment, such as the energy paradigm shift due to climate change, acceleration of the convergence between industries and the emergence of soft power, are requiring creative thinking and innovation. In addition, with the global economic recession and the economic slump in Korea, expectations about corporate social responsibility are rising. We need new changes and challenges to make a society where everyone can grow and overcome the developmental gap due to the imbalance in information between large corporations and SMEs, the gap between the haves and the have-nots, and the generation gap due to the absence of communication,. In 2011, KEPCO overcame the confusion caused by the September 15 Rolling Blackout with one mind, and was committed to innovating the electric power supply and demand system to stably supply electric power. We added spurs to management rationalization, and conducted the largest organizational reshuffle since its foundation, and innovated the procurement and engineering processes to streamline our management system. We found overseas business opportunities and developed our workforce to reinforce our global competencies, while laying the foundation for socially responsible management by engaging in diverse social contribution activities and reinforcing support for SMEs. To lead in fulfilling social responsibilities as s the leading energy enterprise, KEPCO will actively support the vulnerable social groups and SMEs to make a sustainable corporate ecosystem where everyone can grow and prosper together. This year KEPCO established a New Vision of socially responsible management, i.e. 'A global leader in social contribution for the happiness of mankind and society ,' and proclaimed a leap forward in socially responsible management. We will create jobs for the socially vulnerable groups by establishing a social enterprise, practice management of sharing by expanding social contribution at home and abroad, and make the world a better place for all stakeholders by practicing win-win management to revive SMEs. By stably supplying electric power in Korea, we will contribute to economic development, and increase our revenues by actively making inroads into overseas markets. Also, we will generate growth engines of the future by developing eco-friendly green power technology, and take the lead in making a clean and green environment by realizing eco-friendly values in the electric power supply chain. A futurologist Jeremy Rifkin predicted that the future will be an age of energy with green energy and smart power grids playing the central role. As the first mover leading the future world of energy, KEPCO will create a virtuous circle of sustainable values, and become a global enterprise brining happiness to mankind and society. I hope that you will continue to encourage and support us. October 2012.

An appropriate level of reserve facilities must be secured for stable power supply. the electric power As Korea is heavily dependent on imports of energy (about 97%), we must be able to secure energy stably, and as the industry electric power system is geopolitically isolated, it is impossible to export and import energy to and from neighboring countries. As production of electric power is concentrated in southern provinces, and consumption is concentrated in the metropolitan area, long-distance transport of electric power is essential, and it is difficult to use the market mechanism to control demands, and large investments are required to construct electric power facilities in order to secure supply capabilities. Structure of the At present, in the domestic electric power industry, 6 power generation companies, independent power producers, and electric power community energy systems are producing electric power, and KEPCO transports the electric power it purchased from the industry Korea Power Exchange through the transmission and distribution network, and sells it to general customers.

Jobs to be rotated at the head office and sites are specified by task and rank, particularly in the sectors of finance, procurement, transmission & transformation, distribution, construction and quality inspection, and detailed functions are classified. Employees, who were submitted to disciplinary actions for job-related corruptions like taking bribes and embezzlement, are strictly prohibited to be assigned to those jobs to be rotated. No one is allowed to serve in the position subject to job rotation for more than two years starting in 2011 (it used to be three years). ] The IT-based intelligent monitoring system, introduced in 2009, is operated to monitor 30 indexes in various areas like cases repeatedly detected by audit, sales, financial accounting, purchased materials and so on.

KEPCO is planning to introduce the mandatory integrity training by lifecycle, and reinforce integrity training for newly appointed employees, employees scheduled to be promoted and high-ranking public officials Actions taken against corruptions KEPCO has four levels of disciplinary actions for employees involved in corruption: (1) reprimand, (2) salary reduction, (3) suspension from duty and (4) dismissal. We introduced the Three Strike Out rule which allows the company to dismiss employees who have been disciplined three times for the same corruptions like receiving bribes, gifts and embezzlement no matter how trivial they are. In November 2011, we distinguished between active and passive receipt of monies and entertainment. If it was active, i.e. employees asked for it, additional punishment was possible, and we reinforced punishment for anti-social behavior by including drunken driving in the Three Strike Out rule.

Society 66 / 67 Employee welfare Win-win cooperative relationship between labor Supporting the harmony between work and life and management Classification 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 To firmly establish the win-win labor-management relationship, KEPCO Maternity leave 179 200 212 196 180 is making joint efforts with the labor union. KEPCO operates the joint Parental leave 64 82 99 142 206 industrial safety program involving both labor and management, e.g. Infertility leave 5 5 labor-management industrial safety health activities and joint inspections. We are reinforcing mutual communication and cooperation for sustainable growth and creation of shared values by proclaiming the social responsibility charter of the labor union and engaging in social Diverse welfare programs contribution activities together with the labor union. KEPCO faithfully complies with ILO Convention. In 2011, 14,608(76.7%) employees out of To meet the diverse welfare needs of employees and create a great 19,303 belong to the union. The collective agreement is renewed every workplace, KEPCO is trying to develop a welfare program covering the two years and applied to all employees. entire life cycle including health and leisure. For a healthy and happy working life, we operate the health management office, and provide PETCT health checkup service for prospective retirees, and offers various affiliated welfare services like a discount shopping mall exclusively for employees, and accommodations and travel discounts. In August 2012, we opened the cyber welfare center called 'Happy Charging Station,' a comprehensive online welfare portal system, and provide services like the lowest-price shopping mall exclusively for employees, an online flee market, and a welfare community. To guarantee income for the elderly in the aging society, KEPCO is considering introducing the retirement pension program in the second half of 2013. To form a consensus among employees and help the financial burden before the introduction of the Harmony between labor and management retirement pension program, we introduced the retirement insurance system in 2005. As a result of these welfare programs, the employees' Supporting the harmony between work and life satisfaction with welfare went up 0.3 points over last year. KEPCO is supporting the harmony between life and work for female workers by operating diverse childbirth and child-rearing programs. To identify consumer-oriented practical programs, we introduced various programs, such as supporting the use of replacements for people on maternity leave and parental leave, reducing working hours during the child care period, the flex-time program to guarantee the time for child care, (paid) leave for medical examination of infants, infertility leave, and using the annual paid holidays by half days. By operating the Pool System for substitute personnel against those who apply for maternity leave for child birth and child rising (494 retirees and 1,233 ordinary persons/as of July 2012), we are reducing the load of those who give birth to children and who are on maternity leave, and ensuring the harmony between work and life. Starting in September 2012, we completed a system for people on parental leave to alleviate the vacuum left behind by people on maternity leave and parental leave, thereby contributing to efficiently securing substitute workforce and reducing the load of people on maternity leave and parental leave. Also, KEPCO operates the daycare center and the maternity and health management office at the head office, and provides KEPCO a nursery systematic support for the harmony between work and life. Spreading the culture of trust and communication Junior Board KEPCO holds a breakfast meeting with the CEO every week, and To use the ideas of young employees to invigorate the organization and employees in various areas are invited, and their voices are heard. As they energize our innovation activities, KEPCO organized and operates the can frankly talk about business issues, opportunities for the diffusion of Junior Board. The Junior Board, consisting of 6 groups and 200 members, the horizontal culture in the organization and the reinforcement of proposes business improvement ideas from various points of view, and communication are created.

The publication of the newspaper-type weekly newsletter KEPCO Today enables KEPCO to share the current status and issues of KEPCO with employees, their families and customers, and SNS like Facebook and Twitter is helping create a friendlier and closer image of KEPCO. As a result of these efforts, in August 2012, KEPCO received the ‘Korea SNS Award’ in the public sector. A postscript: Junior Board Myeong-Gyu Song, Transmission Operation Dept What I felt through Junior Board activities can be summarized as follows: First, I could feel the sense of the crisis in my bones with regard to the future of the company. Now that the future of the company is uncertain, I could realize what all employees of KEPCO must do right now. Second, I could commune with the group members of the Junior Board. Through repeated meetings with them and in the process of making reports, I realized I am not alone. If I can work with such forwardlooking and passionate colleagues, I can do anything. I hope that the Junior Board will be further invigorated, and make KEPCO the best company with their passion and ideas.

Follow-up suggestions KEPCO' s strenuous efforts to respond to climate change and prevent global warming stand out. Responding to the increasing energy demands due to the acceleration of global warming, and reduction of carbon emissions and pollutants became important tasks across the globe, and they are emerging as important policy issues in Korea as well. KEPCO, the largest power company and a public corporation in Korea, must take part in the global efforts to prevent global warming, and proactively contribute to the Korean Government’s pursuit of low-carbon green growth, and KEPCO' s active sustainability management drive will be very desirable. Low-carbon green growth policies compliant with economic principles are necessary for sustainable growth. Low-carbon green growth means that higher costs will be paid in the production, transmission, supply and postmanagement of energy to improve the environment. Accordingly, the size of costs and financial sources needs to be determined within the framework of market economy. Expenditure of high costs without the support of financial sources is not sustainable, and eventually destroys the market and brings a greater harm to the environment. The tariff system must be improved reasonably to shoulder the burden of green growth. KEPCO must concentrate its efforts on assessment of appropriate costs in each area pursuing low-carbon green growth and methods of recovering costs to minimize social costs. To this end, an appropriate level of carbon tax and CER (Certified Emission Reduction) prices must be determined. The current electricity tariff regulation fails to reflect or consider the increased cost for eco-friendly green growth, and as the current electric charges are much lower than the sustainable level, cumulative deficits are growing. As a result, for KEPCO to proactively pursue green growth policies, I believe, the tariff system must be rationalized and the recovery of the expenses necessary for low-carbon green growth must be allowed. Appendix 71 Third party assurance Won-Hyeok Lim Head of the Global Economic Research Center, Korea Development Institute Prior suggestions -To understand the impact of KEPCO' s business on the sustainable development of the national economy, it is not enough to look at the domestic and overseas business. Creation and distribution of economic values, risks and opportunities due to climate change or aging, and employment, purchasing and public-interest investments of major operations must be taken into consideration comprehensively. Follow-up suggestions It is necessary to include contents related to the sustainable development of the national economy as well as the performance of KEPCO’s domestic and overseas business. The foundation of sustainability management is management. No matter how hard a company tries to take the lead in environmental protection and social contributions, and enhance its image, its existence will be cast into doubt if these endeavors are not supported by solid management. I’d like to emphasize that sustainable power generation, which is a higher-level concept of sustainability management, must ensure substantive power generation encompassing economic, environmental and social aspects. It is necessary to introduce the economic contributions of KEPCO as well as its social and environmental performance. KEPCO has been highlighting its image as a company giving light and hope to society by pursuing green growth business and spreading the culture of sharing. Now it’s high time to pay more attention to factors greatly affecting its management. For instance, KEPCO must analyze opportunities and risk factors related to climate change, nuclear power generation, population structure and overseas expansion, come up with countermeasures, and reflect them in the sustainability report. Also, it will be desirable to emphasize its economic contributions due to job creation at domestic and overseas sites and cooperation with SMEs as well as contents related to government subsidies. It must be possible to extend the horizon of the key performance indicators (KPI) of sustainability management to include the economic performance of sustainable power generation, and present mid-term goals as well as showing latest trends. The current KPIs show the performance of the past three years and the goals of the following one year. It is desirable to extend them, and analyze the performance trends of the past five years, and show the goals of the next five years. Appendix 72 Third party assurance Geo-Seong Kim Chairman, Transparency International Korea Prior suggestions KEPCO needs to pay as much attention to risk prevention as risk management. Description of internal education and policy implementation related to the Business Principles Countering Bribery proposed by Transparency International Introduction of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a more comprehensive and proactive concept than ‘social contribution’ Follow-up suggestions Sustainability Report 2011 includes information of importance to stakeholders, and provides a sufficient description of matters they are interested in. I believe that KEPCO' s anti-corruption policies have been very effective, but management of its subsidiaries like KHNP must be further reinforced. As described in the report, KEPCO received the top score from the AntiCorruption & Civil Rights Commission in 2010 among the public corporations that were investigated, and received the highest grade in the evaluation of anti-corruption policies for 6 years in a row. I believe that this is a remarkable achievement. Also, given that many stakeholders, particularly suppliers, are taking part in human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption as principals of ethical management, KEPCO can become a role model for other companies. However, the fact that corruptions related to NPPs are taking place at KHNP, one of its subsidiaries, implies that the fight against corruption must be escalated to the Power Group. KEPCO needs to further reinforce its policy for preventing bribery by accommodating the 'Business Principles Countering Bribery' proposed by Transparency International in order to help the anti-corruption culture take a firm root. More efforts must be made to ensure the safety of nuclear power plants. The Fukushima nuclear power plant accident, which was caused by the earthquake in Japan in March 2011, is not resolved yet, and it is difficult to measure the scale of damage accurately. KEPCO needs to sufficiently introduce stakeholders' concern over the damage from nuclear power plant accidents, and describe recent accidents. In the long run, it seems desirable to re-examine domestic and overseas NPP projects in consideration of the risks of accidents and the cost of shutdown at the time of project closing. The culture of gender equality is taking root This report reveals that the portion of female workers at KEPCO is gradually rising, and female managers are continuously increasing, and it is compensating males and females fairly. It proves that KEPCO is moving in the right direction in Korea where the gender equality index is very poor. I propose that KEPCO will take after overseas utility businesses like GDF Suez, and prepare a realistic timetable so that it can gradually increase the portion of female workers in directors, executives, new recruits and core jobs by a certain point in time.
