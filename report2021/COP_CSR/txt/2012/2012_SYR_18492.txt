Smart Social Responsibility www.rayessgroup.com www.haraier.com 1 To our stakeholders: June, 2006 was a perfect date for Rayess Kingdom Group companies to mutually join the Global Compact and to share the world leading organizations’ and corporations’ vision towards the Ten Principles and towards the real need for high standards of Corporate Social Responsibility. Our participation at the Global Compact Leaders Summit on July (2007) was our biggest delight as we could see, feel, and touch the global interest reflected in the Global Compact that would eventually result in a better future for mankind. Being the first Syrian participant in the Global Compact we take it on our shoulder to spread the word locally and to support the UNDP in developing her local network in Syria. We understand our responsibility towards our community and we are working towards spreading the word through various publications to increase corporations’ and individuals’ awareness and to help them understand their key role too. Rayess Kingdom Group, a Group for Life, heavily believe in its main competitive advantage and core of success “Humans.” We do our best to sustainably develop our strategy and performance to meet the ongoing development and changes in the world markets to ensure the best possible atmosphere in relation to the ten principles: Human Rights, Labor Rights, Environment and Anti Corruption. A copy of this report will be available on our website as soon as possible to help spreading the word and to help our employees, partners and customers to better understand the role we are playing for a better future so they can set theirs too.
