Message from the Chairman and CEO For Accor, sustainable development is a way of doing business on a daily basis. Every year, our 180,000 employees* in Accor brand hotels worldwide welcome millions of clients in over 4,000 hotels around the world. As the world’s leading hotel operator, it is both our duty and our desire to act as a driving force in the field of sustainable and responsible development. Our new PLANET 21 program focuses on the sustainable development aspect of this initiative, that of reinventing the hotels of the future, for a hotel industry that is sustainable, responsible, innovative and open to the world. We gave a concrete form to our commitment nearly 20 years ago when we created an Environment Department back in 1994 and then a Hotel Environment Charter in 1998. Since then, Accor has constantly renovated its practices and models in order to create sustainable value. By its very essence, a hotel is a place of mingling, diversity, interacting differences and blend. Through our new tagline, “Open new Frontiers in Hospitality”, I wanted to place openness at the core of our mission: openness to others and openness to a new way of perceiving hotels, of managing our impact on both the environment and the communities our hotels are a part of. PLANET 21 sets a new course for our group, employees, partners, and also for our customers whom we associate with our sustainable approach every day by placing sustainable development at the heart of the Group’s innovation and by federating the numerous initiatives of our hoteliers across the globe. Our scheme is structured into 21 concrete measures, each with ambitious quantified objectives that all the hotels must meet by 2015, in areas such as responsible eating, cutting water and energy consumption, and preventing illness. This is a significant pledge for Accor. However, we will not be able to meet our objectives without involving our customers and partners in our actions. For this reason, PLANET 21 is also an approach that is transparent for our customers, with an information program that invites them to participate actively through simple gestures in the hotel’s actions and promotes the daily commitment of our employees. I am convinced that sustainable development is vital to create a new business model that is more respectful of natural resources and human beings. This is why PLANET 21 is more than an ethical commitment; it is also a powerful lever that will boost our brands’ competitiveness, our attractiveness and ensure the loyalty of our partners, employees and customers who want to take action with us in favor of responsible growth capable of creating shared value for everyone. PLANET 21 embodies our desire to incite a virtuous long-term approach. We make this undertaking with humility, aware of the complexity of the issues, but also with determination and confidence in our ability to reinvent the hotel industry sustainably. In keeping with this strong ambition of which PLANET 21 is the instrument, the Accor Group reaffirms its adherence to the United Nations Global Compact and a renewed commitment to its 10 principles. Denis Hennequin, Accor Chairman and Chief Executive Officer *including 145,000 in owned, leased, and managed hotels July 2012 PLANET 21 reinvent hotels sustainably With PLANET 21, Accor has made 21 commitments in favor of sustainable development. Health, nature, carbon, innovation, local development, employment and dialogue: 21 commitments for the well-being of our world. In all our hotels, we work with employees, guests and partners to reinvent hotels – sustainably. Care for the planet? Please, step in. 2011 ACCOR ANNUAL REPORT/63 A NEW ERA OF AMBITIOUS EXPANSION Accor’s new sustainable development strategy is called PLANET 21.

While the checklist still contains 65 items, the indicators have been updated and extended to social responsibility issues like the use of fair trade products and the organization of staff training on health and well-being. Unless otherwise specified, these results concern all Accor hotels worldwide, with the exception of Adagio City Aparthotels. Thalassa sea & spa facilities apply the same Charter actions as their host hotels and their data are consolidated along with those of the hotel. Results are expressed as a percentage comparing the number of hotels implementing a given action to the total number of hotels applying the Charter. Some action points apply only to hotels equipped with special facilities, such as a restaurant or laundry. In this case, the percentage of hotels having implemented these actions is calculated based solely on the total number of hotels concerned (designated “applicable hotels” in the tables). Some of the actions have been clarified, others have been removed and new ones have been added. New actions for which comparative data are not available are marked NEW in the tables below.

ACCOR’S ETHICAL COMMITMENT FRAMEWORK In July 2009, Accor launched the Accor Management Ethics guide, which replaces the booklet The Manager's Benchmarks. Together ever more responsible launched in September 2003. The Accor Management Ethics guide is organized around three points: 1. Smiling at employees Our management principles; 2. Business ethics, company property and respect for people Respect for laws and a policy of integrity 3. Society and the environment Our responsibility and commitments. The Accor Management Ethics Guide was distributed to all managers in 2009. Managers have also been supplied with a meeting guide to help all the managers present the Accor Management Ethics Guide to their direct team, introduce each theme in the Guide with the goal of promoting discussion among participants, deepening their understanding, eliciting questions and winning their full support. The Accor Management Ethics Guide is currently being redrafted. ACCOR’S SPECIFIC COMMITMENT AGAINST CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY The anti-corruption and bribery topic is thoroughly presented in the Accor Management Ethics Guide, which was introduced in 2009 and spread to all Group managers since then. In particular: Accor is committed to complying strictly with competition laws in all its host countries and is fully aware that the risks are greater if there are fewer competitors. Accor pledges that no commission will be paid directly or indirectly to any elected or appointed public official or elected representative with regard to the company’s contracts or its relations with French and foreign government agencies. Accor pledges to take all reasonable measures to ensure that its employees do not engage in any unlawful conduct including the use of bribes with regard to both its purchasing and sales procedures. Accor pledges to be extremely attentive to funds flows that could be of criminal origin. PREVENTION OF CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS In 2010, the Board of Directors’ Code of Conduct was amended to prohibit directors from participating, directly or indirectly, in the sale of any of the Group’s hotel assets for any amount whatsoever: “Directors shall refrain from participating, directly or indirectly, in any transaction of any amount with a Group Company involving the sale by said company of one or several hotel assets.” This principle was extended to approximately 400 managers of the Group. Moreover, any project for selling hotel assets to former employees needs to be reviewed and authorized by the Executive Committee prior to implementation. July 2012 Additional information on Accor’s action related to the UN Global Compact A COMMITMENT EXTENDED TO CONTRACTORS Accor created its Sustainable Procurement Charter in 2003, now named Procurement Charter 21 . In 2010, this Charter was reinforced and updated to make our expectations clearer towards our suppliers: 1. Comply with the Procurement Charter 21; 2. Ensure that their own suppliers and sub-contractors fulfill these same criteria; 3. Participate in Accor’s evaluation process; 4. Authorize Accor and/or external providers commissioned by Accor to conduct sustainable development audits and implement any necessary action plans. The new version of the Procurement Charter 21 details even further Accor’s expectations towards its suppliers regarding the compliance to international regulations and standards, in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ILO Convention, the compliance of principles related to the respect of individuals and the protection of the environment, and to the UN Global Compact which Accor signed in 2003. The Procurement Charter 21 specifies that « the failure to comply with one of these principles can justify the termination of the commercial relationship ». The Procurement Charter 21 is included in international and nationwide contracts. July 2012
