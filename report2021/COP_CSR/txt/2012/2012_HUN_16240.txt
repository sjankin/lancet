Overview of 2011 Elevated level of integration In 2011, we formed a Downstream division which consists of Refining & Marketing, Retail and Petrochemical segments. With this elevated level of integration we aim to exploit sequential and interacting business processes, keeping in focus the operational efficiency by moderating negative effects of the external economic environment. The newly formed Downstream division operates 5 refineries, 2 petrochemical units, more than 1600 filling stations under 7 brands in 11 CEE countries, supplied by a far-reaching logistics system, all driven by Supply Chain Management. Extraordinary external 2011 was a challenging year for the Downstream segment, characterized by extraordinarily environment… unfavorable developments in the external environment and some unplanned refinery stoppages in Croatia. After a rebound in 2010, refining margins have fallen back to 2009 levels which were among the worst in 10 years. An increase in gasoil spread (vs. 2010) could not offset the weaker cracks of naphtha and fuel oil. Crude oil price increased significantly and consequently, energy prices compared to 2010 had risen more than, energy prices compared to 2010 had risen more than 25 % in 2011. 56 MOL Group Annual Report 2011 57 …despite still solid With improved product yield of refineries we successfully decreased the sales of loss making fuel oil CCS-based R&M performance of complex operating profit/(loss) FY 2010 FY 2011 Ch. % sales and increased the share of valuable motor fuels within total sales. assets excl. special items(1) MOL Group 20.9 (19.9) n.a ...but sales of profitable The Group’s total motor fuels sales1 in the CEE increased by 4% y-o-y while the core market motor fuels grow above stagnated.

Impairment in 2010 related partly to exploration activities qualified unsuccessful in Hungary and partly to certain Russian fields in the exploration and development phase. Impairment for those cash generating units has been triggered by the combined effect of the unfavourable changes in the Russian oil and gas tax regime and the delayed scheduling of future development capital expenditures due to more stringent resource allocation policy. Transfers from exploration and evaluation assets represent expenditures which, upon determination of proved reserves of oil and natural gas are reclassified to property, plant and equipment (see Note 2.3 xv.). In addition to these exploration and evaluation assets, a further HUF 2,267 million and HUF 6,486 million exploration expenses were incurred in 2011 and 2010, respectively, which were not eligible for capitalization.

Management estimates discount change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount. rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Gross margins are based on past practices and expectations of future changes Rotary in the market. Subsequent to an impairment test performed at the end of 2011 an impairment of HUF 802 million (2010: nil) has been recognized on the goodwill relating to the activities of Rotary, drilling subsidiary of INA d.d., due to decreased profitability outlook of the related Roth Group activities. Discounted cash flow was calculated using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.76% (2010: 13%). At 31 December 2011 goodwill of HUF 7,918 million (2010: 6,644 million) was allocated to the wholesale activities of Roth Group operating mainly on the Austrian wholesale market, forming a separate cash generating unit within Downstream business segment.

This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth population in Croatia knows it and is perceived as a market leader with an extensive network of filling station. The Group does not rate for the relevant Austrian markets. The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows reflecting risks specific to the Downstream intend to terminate this brand in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of the INA brand was HUF 14,201 million as of 31 segment vary between 8% and 9% in the years considered. December 2011. Since the brand is an integral part of the Croatian filling station network, it has been included in the carrying value of the group of cash generating units to which the corresponding goodwill has been allocated and has been tested for impairment For the wholesale activities of Roth Group, there are reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which could cause the carrying accordingly (see above). value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount. The actual recoverable amount for the wholesale activity of Roth Group exceeds its carrying amount by HUF 1,789 million. The implications of the key assumptions on the recoverable amount are discussed below: Discount rate assumptions – Management assessed discount rates based on the current and expected risk-free interest rate and the risks specific to the current activities of the unit. An increase of approximately 1.2 percentage points in this rate would give a value in use equal to the carrying amount of Roth Group’s wholesale activities. Romanian retail network At 31 December 2011 goodwill of HUF 4,732 million (2010: 4,273 million) was allocated to the Romanian retail network of the Group.

MOL actively manages its commodity exposures for the following purposes only: Corporate Level Objectives – maintenance of financial ratios and targeted financial results, protection against large cash transaction exposures etc. , 136 The notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements MOL Group Annual Report 2011 137 Business Unit Objectives – To reduce the exposure of a Business Unit’s cash flow to market price fluctuations in case of changes from Foreign Currency Risk Management the normal course of business (e.g.: planned refinery shutdowns) At group level, the Group has a net long USD, EUR, RON, and net short HUF, HRK, RUB operating cash flow position from economic point of view. MOL follows two different strategies based on the level of Net Gearing. In the two scenarios, Risk Management focuses on the followings: When MOL is in high gearing status, the Group follows the basic economic currency risk management principle (‘natural hedge’) that the currency mix of the debt portfolio should reflect the net operating cash flow position of the Group. In a High Gearing situation, the primary objective of risk management is to reduce the probability of breaching debt covenants, where a breach would seriously impair the company’s ability to fund its operations. The Group may use cross currency swaps to adjust the currency mix of the debt portfolio. As of 31 December 2011 and 2010, there were no open cross currency transactions. In Low Gearing status, the focus of risk management shall be directed more toward to the protection of shareholder value by maintaining discipline in CAPEX spending, ensuring risk-aware project selection. The Group has two long-term international gas transit agreements (expiring in 2017 and 2019) under which consideration is calculated in SDR. The contractual provisions prescribing price calculation in SDR have been identified as a SDR/USD swap, being an embedded The Group is currently in Low Gearing status. derivative under IAS 39, as the Group considers USD price setting to be closely related to the host contract. This derivative has been separated from the host contract and designated as a cash flow hedge to the host gas transit contract. The fair value of the embedded In line with MOL’s risk management policy, no speculative transactions are allowed. Any derivative transaction the company may enter SDR derivative is a net receivable of HUF 2,955 million (HUF 2,394 million net of deferred tax) as of 31 December 2011 (see Note 12). is under ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) agreements. The corresponding figure as of 31 December 2010 was HUF 4,116 million net receivable (HUF 3,704 million net of deferred tax). The decrease in the fair value of this instrument has been recognized in other comprehensive income. MOL Commodity Trading Limited was established in 2009 with the purpose to centralize and manage MOL’s needs in oil and oil products derivatives, to optimize the Group-level CO2 quota position and to manage the procurement of electricity. In order to improve control INA has concluded certain long-term contracts on gas and crudeoil storage and transport which contain embedded derivatives as over the resulting market and credit risks, risk limits are applied and monitored on an on-going basis. Continuous stress-tests and defined by IAS 39. These derivatives has been separated from the host contracts and designated as fair value hedge to the host gas scenario analyses provide additional cushion for the safety in the trading book. and crudeoil contracts. The fair value of the embedded derivatives is a net receivable of HUF 288 million as of 31 December 2011 (see Note 12 and Note 15). The corresponding figure as of 31 December 2010 was HUF 184 million net receivable. Key Exposures Group Risk Management identifies and measures the key risk drivers and quantifies their impact on the Group’s operating results. MOL The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts and currency exchange options either as fair value hedges, in case of debts, uses a bottom-up model for monitoring the key exposures. According to the model, the diesel crack spread, the dated Brent price and either as cash flow hedges in case a designated hedging relationship exist or as stand-alone derivatives and carries them at fair Notes to the gasoline crack spread have the biggest contribution to the cash flow volatility. The cash flow volatility implied by the FX rates, the other values. refined and petrochemical products are also significant. As of 31 December 2011 there were no open foreign exchange forward transactions. As of 31 December 2010 the fair value of financial statements Commodity Price Risk Management open foreign exchange forward transactions was a net of receivable of HUF 8 million (see Note 15). MOL Group as an integrated oil and gas company is exposed to commodity price risk on both the purchasing side and the sales side. The main commodity risks stem from long crude oil position to the extent of its Group level production, long refinery margin position Hedge of net investments in foreign operations to the extent of the refined product volumes and long petrochemical margin position. Certain facilities of the Group’s long-term debt (USD 1,177 million and EUR 2,155 million) has been designated from 1 July 2011 as hedging instruments in a net investment hedge of foreign operations denominated in USD and EUR. These borrowings are used to MOL can enter into hedging transactions for the above mentioned Corporate Level Objectives and Business Unit Objectives purposes hedge the Group’s exposure to the spot USD and EUR foreign exchange retranslation risk of these investments. Losses of HUF 111,267 only. million incurred on retranslating these borrowings are recorded in other comprehensive income to offset corresponding gains on translating the hedged net investments in foreign operations. In 2011 MOL concluded short term commodity swap transactions. These transactions are mainly dealt for inventory hedging purposes in order to mitigate the effects of the potential price movements during the non-business-as-usual refinery activities (e.g. maintenance Interest rate risk management periods), and they are also related to crude oil procurement and other trading possibilities. As of 31 December 2011 the fair value of As an energy company, MOL has limited interest rate exposure. The ratio of fix/floating interest debt is determined by the Board of open commodity derivative transactions designated as fair value hedge was a net payable of HUF 185 million (see Note 22). The fair Directors on the basis of the suggestion of Group Risk Management from time to time, based on international best practice. value of accompanying firm commitments as hedged items under commodity derivative transaction designated as fair value hedges was a net receivable of HUF 185 million (see Note 15). As result of the 750M EUR Bond transaction in 2005, 750M EUR Bond transaction in 2010 and HUF 16 billion Hungarian retail bond transaction also in 2010-2011, the fixed portion of the total debt increased substantially. As of 31 December 2011 and 2010, 36.3% and At the end of 2011 MOL concluded swap deals on a significant volume of crude oil purchases and unleaded diesel sales forecasted 32.6% of the Group’s debt was at fixed rates respectively. for the next year (on a quarterly basis) with the economic purpose of capturing a favourable crack spread on this product during 2012. As of 31 December 2011 the fair value of open transactions designated as cash flow hedge was a receivable of HUF 7,927 The Group may use interest rate swaps to manage the relative level of its exposure to cash flow interest rate risk associated with million with respect to diesel swap (see Note 15) and a payable of HUF 5,457 million with respect to crude swap (see Note 22), with floating interest-bearing borrowings. a corresponding adjustment of the fair valuation reserve in other comprehensive income. Deals will be settled subsequent to each quarter in the next year. As of 31 December 2011 and 2010, there was no open interest rate swap transaction As of 31 December 2011 and 2010 the fair value of open commodity derivative transactions not designated as hedges were a net receivable of HUF 337 million and HUF 21 million (see Note 15), respectively. 138 The notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements MOL Group Annual Report 2011 139 Sensitivity analysis for key exposures Individual credit limits are calculated and defined after external and internal assessment of customers.

Credit risk The Group provides a variety of customers with products and services, none of whom, based on volume and creditworthiness, present significant credit risk. Group procedures ensure that sales are made to customers with appropriate credit history and do not exceed an acceptable credit exposure limit. Customers are allocated to 12 segments in order to provide better transparency and to achieve more conscious diversification. The different characteristics of the segments support the mitigation of credit risk. For segments with higher risk profile the ratio of secured credit limits is also higher. Credit insurance, collateral, bank guarantee, letter of credit and lien are the most preferred insurance types. As a result of being a major player in the Central-Eastern European region, approximately 70% of our customers are situated in that region; nevertheless our customer portfolio is very diversified from geographical point of view.

In addition to the cooperation presented above, in 2011 CEZ entered in the following business transactions with members of MOL Group: − CEZ sold electricity to MOL Commodity Trading Kft. in the value of HUF 91 million (in 2010 HUF 589 million); − I&C Energo a.s. provided various investments, service works and delivery of material to CEZ in the value of HUF 12,326 million (in 2010 HUF 7,375 million); − AFRAS Energo s.r.o. supplied spare parts for technology units and services related to these spare parts to CEZ in the value of HUF 114 million (in 2010 HUF 478 million); − Slovnaft Česká Republika, a.s. delivered oil and lubricants to CEZ in the value of HUF 101 million (in 2010 HUF 2 million). 156 The notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements MOL Group Annual Report 2011 157 39 Share-based payment plans As required by IFRS 2, this share-based compensation is accounted for as cash-settled payments, expensing the fair value of the benefit as determined at vesting date during the vesting period. In 2011 as a consequence of decreasing share prices, expenses recorded in The expense recognized for employee services received during the year is shown in the following table: preceding years has been reversed in a value of HUF 3,202 million. In 2010 HUF 2,765 million expenses was recorded as personnel-type expenses with a corresponding increase in Trade and other payables. Liabilities in respect of share-based payment plans amounted to 2011 2010 HUF 2,174 million as at 31 December 2011 (31 December 2010: HUF 5,435 million), recorded in Other non-current liabilities and Other HUF million HUF million current liabilities. Expense arising from equity-settled share-based payment transactions Expense / (reversal of expense) arising from cash-settled share-based payment transactions (3,202) 2,765 Fair value as of the balance sheet date was calculated using the binomial option pricing model. The inputs to the model were as follows: Total expense / (reversal of expense) arising from share-based payment transactions (3,202) 2,765 2011 2010 Weighted average exercise price (HUF / share) 18,428 17,465 The share-based payments are described below.

Profit sharing incentive The profit sharing incentive relates to long-term, sustainable increase of profitability, based on the value added methodology, thus The incentive stock option is a material incentive disbursed in cash, calculated based on call options concerning MOL shares, with ensuring that the interest of the participants of the incentive system corresponds with that of shareholders of the Group. annual recurrence, with the following characteristics. covers a 5-year period starting annually, where periods split into: It is a cash-settled annual net bonus calculated on the basis of increase in the value added. (Value added: recognises a profit performance a 3-year waiting period and a 2-year redemption period in case of managers staying in the previous system for 2009, generated on top of the cost of capital invested). a 2-year waiting period and a 3-year redemption period in case of managers choosing the new system already Notes to the for 2009, and it is valid for all of the entitled managers from 2010. Since the basis of determining one unit of the profit-sharing incentive for any given year is the audited financial statement for its rate is defined by the quantity of units specified by MOL job category that year approved by the Annual General Meeting of the parent company, the incentive should be disbursed subsequent to the value of the units is set annually (in each year since the initiation of the scheme, 1 unit equals to 100 MOL shares). such Meeting closing the given year. According to the new system it is not possible to redeem the share option until the end of the second year (waiting period); the No payment is expected with respect to 2011 based on this new incentive system. financial statements redemption period lasts from 1 January of the 3rd year until 31 December of the 5th year. The incentive is paid in the redemption period according to the declaration of redemption. The paid amount of the incentive is determined as the product of the defined number and price increase (difference between the redemption price and the initial price) of shares.

How is this reflected in MOL’s SD approach and the Board’s perspective? MOL Group entered a new phase in sustainability when in 2010 it became a listed company in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. In 2011, new strategic business directions were identified and, finally, due to personnel changes in the Board, the composition of the SDC also changed. So we updated the Committee Charter and agreed on a How do you evaluate performance new direction: making progress in the 6 strategic focus areas and in the in 2011 in the light of sustainability objectives? performance of our business divisions and subsidiaries.

We can exploit synergies at the Danube Refinery, years from 2011 to 2015. It consists of detailed objectives for since algae can be used to capture a vast amount of carbon dioxide from vented emissions. In addition, different kinds of waste water the six focus areas at a Group and also at a Business divisioncould be utilized. Another business driver for algae research is the goal of producing enough renewable feedstock for bio-diesel and biolevel. The following chapter is a summary of the main activities, gas production. Based on laboratory research we set up a small-scale experiment in Százhalombatta as a first step towards catching up projects and data related to these areas and goals. We try to refer with the world’s leading algae processing companies (which produce four times as much as we do currently). to long-term goals wherever it is applicable. To see the detailed Group-level strategic objectives, please visit Chemically stabilized rubber bitumen production our website. MOL, together with The University of Pannonia, developed a new, patented production method which is capable of producing Chemically Stabilized Rubber bitumen (CSRB). Through using suitable technological methods the unfavourably high viscosity of classic rubber bitumen can be reduced.

Process Safety Management Related objective: 'Roll out a Process Safety Management System (PSM) and standards to all companies by end 2014' In 2011 we revised our internal PSM regulation. The reason for the change was the need to define and issue a common and comprehensive audit checklist which will be used in future for assessing the compliance level of different businesses. PSM Networks established in all relevant businesses worked on implementing the following main procedures: Sustainability •Management of Technology change procedure •LOTO procedure – control of hazardous energy sources •Improvement of the investigation of process incidents and information sharing (e.g. via regular newsletters) Several PSM training events have been held by our partner, DuPont. Key topics included PSM Basics, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Mechanical Integrity and Auditing. Trainees should in future ensure the further training of local line management and operational employees. Pilot implementation of PSM in IES (Italy) has also commenced with the establishment of the local PSM network and initial gap analysis (PSM requirements vs. current practice).

When identifying these issues, we take into consideration GRI G3 guidelines, recommendations by our industry’s professional association (IPIECA) and industry-specific evaluation criteria from sustainability analysts such as the SAM Group and Oekom. Moreover, issues related to governmental initiatives connected to SD might also be judged to be relevant; for example, compliance with certain pieces of legislation. Priority is given to areas where our company has more substantial impacts and where MOL can make efforts to improve its performance. Issues relevant to local sites are managed and reported locally. MOL follows the GRI G3 reporting guidelines and has achieved an A+ rating. Since no oil and gas sector-specific supplement was available from GRI while this report was being prepared, we strived to follow the IPIECA-API “Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting” protocol to determine additional, industry-specific indicators.

For and on behalf of the Supervisory Board and Audit Committee of MOL Plc: Despite mixed business environment MOL closed another successful year in 2011. High crude oil prices supported Upstream results, A Felügyelő Bizottság és however external conditions were unexpectedly tough for Downstream operation. Despite the developments in Syria and the further tightening regulatory environment, we were able to grow further in 2011. More than 70% of Group EBITDA was generated by Upstream segment, while half of the operating result came outside Hungary as the share of international operations increased year by year. Audit Bizottság jelentése The Upstream division as the main profit contributor of the Group achieved record high EBITDA in 2011. An important achievement is the more than 200% reserve replacement ratio which boosted SPE 2P reserves to 682 MMboe as a result of earlier exploration successes in Kazakhstan and extensive field development in Russia. The elevated reserves level will provide good basis for mid-term production growth. In 2011, Downstream suffered from extraordinarily unfavourable developments in the external environment and some unplanned György Mosonyi dr.
