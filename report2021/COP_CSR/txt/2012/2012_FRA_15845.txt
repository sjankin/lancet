Each year we continue our efforts to increase the positive effects of our actions and behaviours, and consider all possible avenues for improvement. Today, in 2012, personally and on behalf of HENNER which I chair, I maintain my commitment to the cause of the Global Compact, and ask all employees to continue their efforts HENNER:  To keep the benefits of actions already undertaken,  To find new constructive ideas, pragmatic and implementable. For 2012, all employees of HENNER is mobilized to deploy and implement the strategy defined in 2011 for the next decade. This strategy reinforces our desire to keep people at the heart of our actions. We call reflection to better control our consumption and therefore our environmental impact.

It is for the Group which I chair a full commitment. Charles Robinet-Duffo Chairman and CEO Henner 3 II HUMAN RIGHTS, LABOR LAWS OPERATIONS MANAGED IN 2011  Facilitating access to care for every Member covered by GMC As a reminder, HENNER has been particularly focused on network expansion in developing countries since early 2004, owing to the growing number of Members residing in these countries. Since 2009, a number of local and regional agreements were signed, considerably increasing the size of the network. The HENNER medical network has grown 26.8% since 2010, and now has some 11,500 healthcare providers in 150 countries outside the United States. In the USA, HENNER has established partnerships with various local correspondents (Olympus Managed Health Care, United Healthcare International), giving us access to preferred provider organisations totalling 4,700 hospitals and 724,000 outpatient providers for OMHC, and 4,600 hospitals and 500,000 outpatient providers for UHI. Our members benefit from the following services:  Direct settlement for hospitalisation and out-patient care  Agreements reducing the amount of copayment at the member’s charge. Based on our newly established partnerships, the number of hospitals increased by 32.9% (9,300 up from 7,000 in 2010) while the number of outpatient providers rose by 60.9% (724,000 compared with 450,000 in 2010). In 2011 alone, more than 700 new deals were signed with hospitals and outpatient facilities, pharmacies, and biomedical and x-ray centres. In the United States, a direct settlement system has also been set up with the 60,000 pharmacies in the CVS Caremark group. Finally, 200 providers were met with in 18 countries. A medical team of 4 doctors, 2 dental surgeons, a pharmacist and 4 medical assistants are constantly monitoring various measures to ensure our members receive quality treatment in line with international medical standards, particularly with regards to hospitalisation. Also in 2011, in line with its quality-focused management policy, HENNER led a survey of:  The quality of relations with healthcare providers from the medical network (based on a broader sample than in 2010) Results of the survey for medical network providers:  Quality of the exchanges between HENNER and providers: 85% satisfied,  Satisfaction of providers regarding direct settlement made by HENNER: 77% The quality of exchanges between HENNER and its healthcare providers were down by 1.6% compared to 2010, while provider satisfaction of direct settlement payments made by HENNER decreased by 3.1% Corrective and preventive measures have been taken to improve the results of our next survey. 4  Fighting HIV/AIDS and supporting the persons living with AIDS The specific action plan managed in the HIV/AIDS field includes:  The search for healthcare providers offering specialised treatment. More than 350 specialised providers around the world  Deals involving medical cooperation and the direct settlement of healthcare expenses. More than 200 deals signed in 25 countries  A pilot program to promote HIV/AIDS testing in six countries (Burundi, Niger, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe)  Within the medical department, a team deals specifically with monitoring patients with AIDS, in association with their regular doctors. This action is supported by a highly trained French expert, to assist the advising doctors at HENNER.  The publication of a charter in which HENNER is committed to its clients and employees in favour of a prevention policy and fight against HIV/AIDS. In 2011, HENNER continued to step up its program targeting access to care and insurance, in partnership with our major clients based in North America. HENNER also carried out a medical assessment of our healthcare partners, by simplifying medical criteria to facilitate the process based on 40 technical and medical items including:  Testing & advice,  Biomedical procedures,  Anti-retroviral treatments available,  Treatment of immunodeficiency-related diseases,  The training of practitioners. Their capacity to provide paediatric care to HIV/AIDS patients was also assessed. Over 110 services providers have been assessed so far. In 2011, HENNER continued to assess more than 150 healthcare providers.  Promoting local management As part of the group's development, since the beginning of 2007, HENNER has continued recruiting local employees in Curitiba (Brazil), Singapore, Tunis, and Nairobi (Kenya). Local recruitment offers the following advantages:  For employees: Working for a company that respects human and workers' rights. All employees at our regional branches abroad are recruited locally, trained in Paris at the company's head offices, and supervised by the central teams. They all benefit from healthcare cover provided by the company which goes beyond the legal obligations of the country of residence. This is done to maintain equality among all the company's staff.  For the company: Enabling us to providing our members with local, quality service, adapted to the country in which they live. 5 In 2011  Staff numbers at our regional branches abroad increased by 14.7% (up 2.5% in 2010). In France, HENNER continues to recruit staff regardless of their country of origin or culture. In 2011  Staff numbers in France rose by 7.4% (up 2.7% in 2010).  Wage policy The Group’s wage policy shows that wages increase faster than the official indices. Hourly basic wage Social security ceiling inflation Inflation Henner wages 6  Develop and promote our approach to social responsibility HENNER is committed to social responsibility, which takes into account the impact its decisions and activities can have on society and the environment, through transparent and ethical behaviour which:  Contributes to sustainable development, the health and well being of society  Acknowledges the expectations of all those involved  Complies with current laws and international behavioural norms Further to the project initiated in 2009, the Board of Directors at HENNER decided in 2010 to pursue and step up our action in the fields of Sustainable Development and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), by incorporating a broader variety of points of view into our strategy. Work groups representing the various entities and positions held within the company contributed to our projects. To do so, the Board of Directors asked several employees to take an active role in the project as representatives, both nationally and internationally (owing to cultural differences). Work groups have been formed to deal with the following topics:  HR practices in France  HR practices abroad  Business practices 1  Everyday behaviour in France 1  Everyday behaviour abroad  Philanthropy. 1 The expression, “daily behaviour” refers the consequences of resource management (energy, water, paper, ink) and of the environment of our daily activity. In all, 46 suggestions for improvement were made by the groups. Action is now being taken and monitored by the steering committee. Various resources have been used to promote a healthy environment and to reduce energy consumption. In 2011, 62,5% of improvement actions suggested by our work groups were set up. 7 III ENVIRONMENT POWER CONSUMPTION The power consumption policy and adapted resources have proven effective over the past few years.

At HENNER, we have developed a specific action plan:  All client service officers have been trained to detect suspicious cases (counterfeit invoices, verification of treatment provided);  Analysis of cases by HENNER's medical department;  A Steering Committee for making decisions on suspicious cases;  Itemised procedures detailing the client service officer's role and responsibilities, the internal audit department and the involvement of the medical department;  Reporting to clients and risk carriers when further disciplinary or judiciary action is needed. Changes in the cases analysed:  In 2007, around 40 cases were detected every month, of which between two and five cases were proven to be fraudulent.  In 2008, 17 cases of suspected fraud were detected by client services in the international department. This figure has decreased dramatically since the procedure was brought in.  In 2009, 11 cases of suspected fraud were detected by client services in the international department.  In 2010, 27 cases of suspected fraud were detected by client services in the international department. In 2011, in the international department:  11 cases of suspected fraud were detected by client services. 6 cases were heard and closed (one case of fraud proven), 5 other cases being analysed. This process also applies in France, and is particularly focused on healthcare providers, as initial checks are carried out by the French Social Security, reducing the potential risk.  In 2008, 21 cases of suspected fraud were detected by client services in the domestic department. This figure is higher than in the international department, as the procedure was brought in more recently,  In 2009, 9 cases of suspected fraud were detected by client services in the domestic department,  In 2010, 9 cases of suspected fraud were detected by client services in the domestic department, In 2011, in France  12 cases of suspected fraud were detected by client services. 2 cases were heard and closed (one case of fraud proven), 10 other cases being analysed. 11 HENNER, SAS de courtage et de gestion d'assurances Capital de 8 212 500 € RCS Paris B 323 377 739 TVA intra-communautaire FR 48323377739 Immatriculation ORIAS n° 07.002.039 (consultable su r www.orias.fr).
