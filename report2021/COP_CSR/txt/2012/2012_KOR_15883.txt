We will remain silent but dedicated in our journey to create future values for customers and stakeholders in industrial settings and to fulfill our social responsibility for a happier society in the upcoming five decades. ” It is my great pleasure and honor to meet our dear stakeholders who never fail to show their deep interest in and strong support for us through the ‘KSA Sustainability Report 2010’. Our first sustainability report was issued in 2009 in order to ensure stronger communication with stakeholders and help meet our sustainability management goals as an organization. KSA joined the UN Global Compact (UNGC), the UN-level international initiative on social responsibility, in November 11, 2010 and has been supporting the ten UNGC principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. Our sustainability reports intend to disclose our progress relevant to the UNGC and to solicit invaluable feedback from our stakeholders to make more effective contributions in the economic, social and environmental aspects, using it as the bedrock of KSA’s sustainability management. While having face-to-face meetings with and listening to wide-ranging stakeholders in preparing this report, their warm-hearted support and rather sometimes criticisms enabled us to look for KSA’s future ways to go and also reaffirmed their high expectations on us. In order to ensure KSA’s sustainable development in the longer term, this KSA Sustainability Report 2011 illustrates the following commitments that reflect our 2nd-phase mid-term management strategic tasks and issues where stakeholders show a high level of interest. First, we are to stay committed to our role as a private sector leader in standards. To ensure this end, we will fully incorporate opinions of relevant businesses in setting standard policies and build readiness for emerging trends of international standards such as social responsibility and green industry. We will also take the lead in R&D of standards in such new growth areas as convergence technology and software. Second, we will update the Korean Industrial Standards (KS) Certification system, the nation’s representative voluntary certification,to promptly accommodate changing technology and environments, making further contributions to industrial development. We will also make sure that the KS system is internationally recognized through the establishment of the KS Certification web system and continual development of new service areas. Third, we will work hard to deliver customized education and knowledge services that meet diversified customer needs as a professional industrial training service provider and to develop training programs that take into account such social issues as climate change, eco-friendliness and social-friendliness. Fourth, we are committed to more sophisticated operation of the Service Quality Index, Well-Being Consumer Index, LOHAS Certification, and In-door Air Quality Certification that were developed by KSA to enhance the quality of life for the general public and to establishment of new indices and certifications whose needs are increasing in Korea. KSA Sustainability Report 2011 Fifth, we are dedicated to sharing and increasing mutual benefits based on the knowledge asset that we have at KSA, taking one step closer to addressing the knowledge gap in our society. Additionally, this report illustrates KSA’s actions and commitments in the upcoming years in each of those issues that our stakeholders view as material. While we are fully committed to organizing our structure to ensure prompt response to external changes to meet stakeholders’ requirements and expectations, we are also working hard to create a system to nurture professional talents and enable them to make the best of themselves. Our goal is to grow together with our dear stakeholders while reaching targets one by one that were outlined in our sustainability reports. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of establishment in 2012, KSA has been an active provider of knowledge services in wide-ranging fields of standards, product quality, training and certification for the nation’s industrial development over the last five decades. We will remain silent but dedicated in our journey to create future values for customers and stakeholders in industrial settings and to fulfill our social responsibility for a happier society in the upcoming five decades. As we are fully dedicated to building a sustainability human society, we will greatly appreciate your continued interest and support in the future. Thank you.

Additionally, the U.S. and European countries suffering from budget deficits today indicate that the government can no longer serve as a guardian of social safety. With more and more companies seeking long-term values in business management and government’s commitment to reduced budget deficits, sustainability management and social responsibility management are emerging as top priority. KSA is proactively working in various ways to support companies to boost their competitiveness to cope with these changing environments.
