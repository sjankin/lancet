In order to understand one another, a high degree of sensibility, tolerance and respect is essential. Intercultural competence gains importance with the globalisation of economy and society. We at HELOG are conscious that the future will belong to those companies having an active share in ethic and effective business management in their country as well as in international locations. Only companies prepared for the future can demonstrate Sustainability Leadership. I would like to thank all our employees, contractors, clients and friends for their ongoing support in achieving the Global Compact objectives.

Employees are requested to report any violations on the part of our suppliers. It is up to the management to react according to HELOG standards and to convince the suppliers to follow the policy of the principle. HELOG also operates in so-called weak governance zones . So far, we have been able to pursue our business activities without restrictions or limits in these areas. We are also aware that the numerous problems of the weak governance zones cannot be resolved quickly. This is where the input of neighbouring countries, the UN and other international organizations is needed. On the other hand, we can improve the local situation with our investments, even though they are simply measures for fair pay or the disapproval of child labour and discrimination that will not take effect nationwide. We believe that a company’s commitment in these areas doesn’t automatically mean that they are accomplices. We still think that our actions will provide chances and HELOG is operating in Freetown conducting air operation with helicopters and aircrafts possibilities for the workers and business associates, which they wouldn’t have had. and has its office in Aberdeen / Freetown.

Principle 6 The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation HELOG currently employs staff members from 12 different countries. It is the aim of the management to eliminate any discrimination. For us it is important when evaluating new applicants for positions in our company to make sure they have a fitting attitude towards this issue.
