Within this initiative we concluded the 2nd Campaign for the Integrated Fauna Monitoring Program, in São Paulo, which revealed the good state of conservation of the areas, where we can find 582 species including avifauna, herpetofauna, and terrestrial and flying mammal fauna. Several of them are endemic, endangered and sensitive to environmental changes. Also a part of the Integrated Program, the biodiversity conservation plan has already carried out studies in the areas contained in the cerrado and Atlantic Coastal Rainforest biomes in the states of Bahia and São Paulo. And yet another action was to monitor and prepare the Rupestrian Fields Management Plan, at Itararé (São Paulo) and at the Limeira Unit (São Paulo).
