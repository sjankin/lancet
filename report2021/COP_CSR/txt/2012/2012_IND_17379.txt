GLOBAL COMPACT INITIATIVE In the year 2001, SCI had pledged its commitment to the United Nations Global Compact. An update on the continued compliance and commitment to the Ten Universally Accepted Principles of UNGC is as follows: PREAMBLE The Shipping Corporation of India Ltd. was established on 2nd October 1961 by the amalgamation of Eastern Shipping Corporation and Western Shipping Corporation. SCI started as a marginal Liner shipping company with just 19 vessels and today it has metamorphosed into a giant conglomerate.
