Indeed, Brisa's cash generation, measured by consolidated EBITDA-Capex, grew by 7% over 2010, reaching 370 million Euros, whereas at the level of Brisa Concessão Rodoviária, it grew by 3% to 297 million Euros. Actually, although motorway traffic fell for the second consecutive year, results show the sustainability of the company's business model as Brisa succeeded in achieving its major goal for 2011: cash generation growth. Cash generation growth thanks to a sound management of costs and investment This result in such an adverse environment was only possible thanks to operational efficiency and the implementation of strict cost control and investment management. On a comparable basis, excluding the costs of toll equipment sales and increased Via Verde activity following the introduction of tolls on former SCUT motorways, operating costs fell by 4%, in line with pre-set targets for the year. However, excluding the lay-off costs, operating costs fell by 6.%. We must highlight in 2011 the reduction of Brisa’s total payroll of which effect will be deferred in the next years. This streamlining was carried out based on a planned management of respective social impacts. Despite the good operating results, it was not possible to avoid a fall in EBITDA by 3%, as traffic dropped by 5% in overall terms and tariffs only marginally increased. The rise in cash generation was, to a great extent, achieved on the back of a more selective management of investment (which stood at 89 million Euros in consolidated terms), associated to the introduction of innovating technical solutions. Financial costs and net results negative impacted by Douro Litoral Concession The good performance at cash generation level did not prevent financial results and consequently net profit from SR BRISA 13 2011 001 PRESENTATION being affected strongly negative by Douro Litoral concession We think that markets have penalized in a misadjusted in approximately 219 million Euros.

Through communication drives in national and regional media, the company also sought to reinforce the availability of its site as an alternative and preferential means for the presentation of requests for eligibility for toll discounts and exemptions, thereby making it easier for its customers and at the same time reducing demand in the shops. At the end of November, Via Verde registered more than 60 thousand new requests for membership and around 614 thousand requests for eligibility for positive discrimination. These numbers illustrate the company’s response capacity to the wave of demand and the alignment of the operation in relation to the experience obtained in the first stage of the process, carried out in 2010. Road Safety Safety First Program Two major Road Safety campaigns were promoted in the Brisa Group’s network of motorways in 2011 appealing to drivers to drive carefully and safely at two critical times of the year: the summer holidays and the period between Christmas and the New Year. “Don’t play with your safety” was the motto chosen for the campaign which was held in the summer months, calling drivers’ attention to their conduct on the road. Besides the usual decoration on the tops and sides of the toll booths, the campaign also included a spot on the main radio stations in the country – TSF, Rádio Renascença and RFM –, which was on the air between the 1st of July and the 28th of August.

This reduction is justified, in part, by the 1.2% reduction in the number of vehicles in the fleet, from 621 to 613 vehicles, and also by the effect of the reduction in average consumption by the fleet vehicles, resulting from the “Brisa Driving Academy” initiative.

Introduction 1 We were engaged by the Board of Directors of Brisa Auto-Estradas de Portugal, S.A.(“Brisa”) to provide assurance on the Sustainability Report of Brisa (“the Report”) as of and for the year ended 31 December 2011. Responsibilities 2 The Board of Directors of Brisa is responsible for: • The preparation and presentation of the sustainability information included in the Report in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (G3), of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as described in the chapter “Report Profile” of the Report, and the information and assertions contained within it; • Determining Brisa’s objectives in respect of sustainable development performance and reporting, including the identification of stakeholders and material issues, in accordance with the principles of inclusiveness, materiality and response of AA1000APS (2008); and, • Establishing and maintaining appropriate performance management and internal control systems from which the reported performance information is derived. 3 Our responsibility is to carry out an assurance engagement and to express a conclusion based on the work performed with the objective of obtaining: • Reasonable assurance on whether GRI Indicators: Economic Data (EC1; EC4 and EC5), Patronage (EC8), Innovation (EC9), Energy (EN3 and EN4), Energy Efficiency (EN5 and EN6), Water (EN8), Biodiversity (EN11, EN12, EN13, EN14 and EN15), Emissions (EN16), Waste (EN22), Environmental Impact Reduction (EN26), Fines (EN28), Environmental Investment (EN30), Employment (LA1 and LA2), Labour Practices (LA4); Training (LA10), Performance Evaluation (LA12), Diversity and Equality Opportunities (LA13 and LA14), Product and Service Labelling (PR3 and PR5), Social Impact (SO1), are free from material misstatement; and, • Limited assurance on whether the information in the Report, as a whole, as of and for the year ended 31 December 2011 is not free from material misstatement. We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board of the International Federation of Accountants. These Standards require that we comply with applicable ethical requirements, including independence requirements.

RS BRISA 101 2011 004 VALIDATION Scope 4 The scope of our work was as follows: • Reasonable assurance A reasonable assurance engagement with respect to the indicators EC1, EC4, EC5, EC8, EC9, EN3, EN4, EN5, EN6, EN8, EN11, EN12, EN13, EN14, EN15, EN16, EN22, EN26, EN28, EN30, LA1, LA2, LA4, LA10, LA12, LA13, LA14, PR3, PR5 and SO1 involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the indicators. The procedures performed depend on professional judgment, including the assessment of the risk of material misstatement in the indicators mentioned above, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we considered internal control relevant to Brisa in the preparation and presentation of the indicators in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our engagement also included assessing the suitability of the criteria used by the Board of Directors of Brisa in the preparation of the indicators, as explained in the chapter “Report Profile” of the Report, in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the quantification methods in the reporting of policies used and the reasonableness of the estimates made by Brisa. Among others, our procedures included: Interviews with relevant responsible persons and relevant staff at operating and corporate level concerning the identification of the indicators presented above; Interviews with relevant responsible persons and relevant staff at operating and corporate level concerning the preparation of the indicators; Evaluation of the systems used for collection, calculation and report of the indicators; and Recalculation of indicators at corporate level. We understand that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate for the expression of our conclusion. • Limited assurance A limited assurance engagement on sustainability information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the Report, and applying analytical and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate. These procedures included: Interviews with the responsible persons to understand the processes implemented in Brisa to identify material issues for the relevant stakeholders of Brisa; Interviews with responsible persons and relevant staff at operating and corporate level concerning sustainability strategy and relevant policies, and the implementation of these policies across the business areas; Interviews with relevant staff at operating and corporate level responsible for the preparation of the sustainability information to be included in the Report; Visits to sites and building works (Carcavelos, Ponte de Lima and logistics platform Loures/Carregado) selected on the basis of a risk analysis including the consideration of both quantitative and qualitative criteria; Comparing the information presented in the Report to corresponding information in the relevant underlying sources to determine whether all the relevant information contained in such underlying sources has been included in the Report; and Reading the information presented in the Report to determine whether it is in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the sustainability performance of Brisa. 2 RS 102 BRISA 2011 004 VALIDAÇÃO The extent of evidence gathering procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement is less than that for a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore a lower level of assurance is provided. Consequently, it does not allow us to obtain the assurance that we would become aware of all the important matters that can be identified in an audit or a in a work of reasonable assurance.
