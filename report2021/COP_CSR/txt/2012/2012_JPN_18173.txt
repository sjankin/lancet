01 Mitsubishi Corporation Annual Report 2012 To Our Stakeholders It is my pleasure to write to you in our annual report for the year ended March 2012. The past fiscal year, the second of Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012, was positioned as a year for action. In fact, it turned out to be a year filled with challenges. The outlook for the year was already uncertain in the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake and nuclear accident as well as the Arab Spring that occurred in the year ended March 2011. But it became even more challenging as the European debt crisis worsened and Thailand was engulfed by severe flooding. However, we surmounted these challenges. We drew on every ounce of strength we have as a company to surpass our full-year earnings forecast and post net income of ¥453.8 billion. Importantly for our future growth, we also made progress executing our investment plan. The external operating environment remains extremely uncertain as I write this letter. The European debt crisis seemingly has no end in sight. The situation in the Middle East is still unsettled. And we are seeing gyrations in crude oil and other commodity prices. As we navigate through these shifting obstacles, we have rededicated ourselves to achieving the targets of Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012. We will push ahead to strengthen our existing earnings and develop new businesses for future growth. Ken Kobayashi President and CEO 02 Mitsubishi Corporation Annual Report 2012 Interview with the President How did you rate MCʼs performance in the year ended March Q 1 2012, the second year of Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012? A. We drew on all of our strengths to deliver a better-than-expected performance. We viewed the past fiscal year as a year for action, as the second year of Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012. And so it was as we made moves to achieve the goals of our medium-term management plan. We drew on our strengths in each business field to overcome uncertainty in our operating environment in Japan and overseas. This produced results. Our net income result of ¥453.8 billion bettered our ¥450.0 billion initial forecast. Of course there were negative factors such as the impact of bad weather and strike action at our Australian coking coal operations in the Metals Group, and the impact of flooding in Thailand in the Metals and Machinery groups. We absorbed these negative factors, however, with record earnings in the Energy Business, Chemicals and Living Essentials groups. So it was a more balanced performance than in the past, one that drew on all our strengths. While continuing to balance earnings from resource and non-resource fields, we intend to build on our strengths in the resource field. In tandem, we will reinforce our stable earnings platforms in non-resource fields. A major feature of the past year was that we invested approximately ¥1,300.0 billion. That means we have made investments of approximately ¥1,700.0 billion during the first 2 years of Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012. In terms of investments related to resources, we made new and additional investments in copper, thermal coal and other resources, as well as coking coal in the metal resources field. In *1 Please refer to the feature section on pages energy resources, we acquired more natural gas assets with the aim of ensuring an 26 –27 for information on shale gas activities. even more stable supply of LNG. Our investments in shale gas *1 during the year *2 Please refer to the feature section on pages 30 –31 for information on food eyed diversification in supply sources.

In addition to investing in a meat and livestock business in China *2 , we executed planned investments in the Machinery, Chemicals and Industrial Finance, Logistics & Development groups. We are determined to reap the benefits of these investments in the year ending March 2013 and thereafter to boost our earnings.

A. Vigilance is needed because there are certainly downside risks for the global economy. Regardless of the conditions we face, we will strengthen our ability to respond. A number of events impacted the global economy in 2011. The Great East Japan Earthquake, the Thailand floods and the European debt crisis were just some of them. Going forward, trends in energy resources require greater vigilance in light of the political unrest in the Middle East and development of shale gas resources in the U.S., for example. However, I believe the global economy will remain on an expansionary path over the long term due to a modest recovery in industrialized nations and high growth in emerging markets. That said, the European debt crisis continues to smolder, while there are noticeable concerns about an economic slowdown in China. Another factor to take into account is that a host of countries around the world are holding elections in 2012. This could very well see a change in leadership in many countries, not to mention increased protectionism. We could see a topsyturvy political and economic environment develop. We must keep a watchful eye on the downside risks for the global economy, including an economic downturn induced by fiscal austerity, energy price spikes caused by geopolitical risks, and mounting inflationary pressures in emerging nations. While uncertainty continues, the most important thing is to build up one’s strength to cope with any circumstances. In doing so, we will also leverage our inherent strength as a general trading company with connections in various fields and industries. 04 Mitsubishi Corporation Annual Report 2012 The year ending March 2013 is the final year of Midterm Corporate Strategy Q 3 2012. How do you plan to manage the company over the next year? A. I intend to make it a year in which we create sustainable corporate value, in part by achieving the targets of Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012. The year ending March 2013 is the culmination of Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012. Even though the external operating environment remains fraught with considerable difficulties, our determination is stronger than ever to achieve the plan’s ¥500.0 billion net income target by drawing on our comprehensive capabilities and having corporate officers and employees work as one. I see it as my mission to mold a company that can create sustainable corporate value no matter what the economic environment throws at us. I will not let us be bound by the conventional notion of a general trading company in this effort. Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012 sets the goals of creating not only economic value but also societal and environmental value for ultimately creating sustainable corporate value. I believe this is the basis for all companies and must be adhered to over the long term. So we have renewed our commitment to making the current fiscal year a year for creating sustainable corporate value. In the years ahead, we will demonstrate the importance of our existence broadly across the economy. Of course, the current fiscal year, as the last year of Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012, is also a bridging year to the next medium-term management plan. We aim to make it a year for laying sound stepping stones to the future. Create Sustainable Corporate Value by helping to solve global problems through business activities in light of the needs and expectations of all stakeholders Sustainable Economic Value Create Sustainable Aim for sound earnings growth and increased corporate value through the Corporate Value proactive reshaping of our business models and portfolio Sustainable Societal Value Contribute to economic development as a responsible corporate citizen Sustainable Environmental Value Aim to conserve and contribute to the global environment, recognizing that our planet is our greatest stakeholder 05 Mitsubishi Corporation Annual Report 2012 MC carried out an internal corporate reorganization in April 2012 that was first Q 4 announced in January. What do you hope to achieve from this reorganization? A. We aim to strengthen our framework for engaging in the infrastructure and global environmental businesses, which we designate as Strategic Domains. Under Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012, we aim to create future earnings drivers of scale. To this end, we have designated the infrastructure and global environmental businesses in particular as Strategic Domains that require a mediumto long-term approach. Previously, the Global Environment Business Development Group and the Machinery Group acted independently in the infrastructure domain. Recently, however, we have seen a growing number of cases where greater cooperation and collaboration are required. As can be seen in the power generation and power transmission businesses, an increasing number of businesses are contiguous in terms of business sphere and regions. Furthermore, the infrastructure business is no longer a trading and EPC*1 domain. Indeed, I *1 Engineering, Procurement, Construction believe we will see more and more examples of projects that require the handling of risk *2 Operation & Maintenance with which we have no experience, as the business model in this area transforms into one that extends to asset ownership and O&M*2. To cope with this, greater sharing of business knowledge is required, as is the channeling of human and other business resources. This was the thinking behind the need to reorganize internally so that we can grow more in the infrastructure and environment fields. Earnings are not our only goal in the infrastructure and global environmental businesses. These are meaningful fields where we can directly create societal and environmental value as well. We have a strong desire to create businesses that will support future generations.

And what initiatives do you have planned? A. We are developing initiatives that will help affected regions recover economically. In February this year, I went back to Sendai, the same area I visited in April last year in the aftermath of the disaster. I saw for myself how the region is making steady strides toward recovery, including restarted coastal factories that were damaged by the tsunami. However, I left still feeling that there were major issues to address such as rebuilding the lives of the people affected by the disaster and reviving local industry, for example. After the twin disasters, we established the Mitsubishi Corporation East Japan *3 Please refer to page 84 for information on Earthquake Recovery Fund with a total contribution of ¥10.0 billion. These funds support activities in affected regions after the Great East Japan Earthquake. are to be used to help with relief and recovery efforts in disaster-stricken areas *3 over four years. They have been used to provide emergency relief supplies, to award scholarships to university students whose studies have been affected, and to provide grants to NPOs and other groups active in the affected regions. As of March 31, 2012, a total of ¥3.0 billion had been used for supporting the abovementioned and other activities. Our staff have pitched in too. Employees launched volunteer activities in affected Mitsubishi Corporation East Japan Earthquake Recovery Fund regions on April 23, 2011. By March 2012, more than 1,300 employees had given their time to recovery efforts. These employees have cleared rubble, cleaned houses Total contribution: ¥10 billion and carried out other work in Sendai, Ishinomaki and Minamisanriku in Miyagi Prefec(total for four-year period) ture. Anybody can assess the situation and come up with strategies. But my experience reaffirmed for me that the most important thing is to actually see those plans Emergency Scholarship through with conviction. The road to a full recovery is still long, but employees will continue volunteer activities in affected regions and broaden the geographical scope of their activities. Recovery Support Grants In March 2012, we established the Mitsubishi Corporation Disaster Relief Foundation with some of the funds from the Mitsubishi Corporation East Japan Earthquake Donation and Other Aid Recovery Fund. We established this foundation to provide more flexible and continuor Contribution ous support based on the various needs of affected regions. Besides carrying on the activities of the Mitsubishi Corporation East Japan Earthquake Recovery Volunteer Activities Fund, the foundation will develop new initiatives for reviving industry and creating employment to aid the recovery. Overview of Mitsubishi Corporation Disaster Relief Foundation Foundation Name Mitsubishi Corporation Disaster Relief Foundation Purpose of Establishment To contribute to the recovery of the regions afflicted by the Great East Japan Earthquake Main Activities 1. Provision of scholarships 2. Provision of grants for NPOs, social welfare corporations and the like 3. Support for industry recovery and job creation 07 Mitsubishi Corporation Annual Report 2012 Q 6 What is your stance on returning profits to shareholders? A. Our basic policy is to reward shareholders by maintaining a consolidated payout ratio in the range of 20-25%. Our dividend policy is to maintain a consolidated dividend payout ratio in the range of 20-25%, taking into consideration the business environment, the expectations of shareholders for a stable dividend, and other factors. We will continue to utilize retained earnings for investments to drive growth, while maintaining our financial soundness. We aim to increase the annual dividend per share through earnings growth. For the year ended March 2012, we paid a ¥65 annual dividend per share as initially forecast, because we achieved our earnings target of ¥450.0 billion by posting net income of ¥453.8 billion. This dividend represented a consolidated payout ratio of 24%. We will continue to harness and leverage our know-how, human resources and networks to create sustainable corporate value. As always, I really appreciate the understanding and support of our shareholders and other stakeholders.

I would like to review our performance for the past fiscal year and discuss our capital structure policy. In the year ended March 2012, our performance was impacted by bad weather, strike action at our Australian coking coal operations and flooding in Thailand. Nevertheless, net income was ¥453.8 billion, meaning we achieved our ¥450.0 1 billion forecast. This achievement was largely due to the Energy Business, Chemicals and Living Essentials groups posting record earnings. The Energy Business Group benefited from high crude oil prices. The Chemicals and Living Essentials groups saw past investments generate results. I believe that our performance demonstrates the strengths of our balanced portfolio of resource and non-resource businesses. Our basic capital structure policy is to sustain growth and maximize corporate value by balancing earnings growth, capital efficiency and financial soundness. In the year ended March 2012, we made substantial investments totaling approximately ¥1,300.0 billion. We continued to use diverse fund procurement channels to fund these investments. For instance, we borrowed from banks, issued bonds and established a Renminbi-denominated commercial paper program. At the same time, total shareholders’ equity at March 31, 2012 2 was a record ¥3,509.3 billion, despite the negative impacts of the yen’s appreciation and falling share prices. This ¥276.0 billion year-on-year increase was because of an increase in retained earnings thanks to the net income result. As a result, the net 2 debt-to-equity ratio, which is an indicator of financial soundness, was 1.0 at March 31, 2012. We thus maintained it at around the same level as March 31, 2011. Over the past 2 fiscal years, including the first year of Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012, we have made substantial investments amounting to approximately ¥1,700.0 billion, with the aim of generating future growth. While free cash flows in 3 the year ended March 2012 were negative ¥550.2 billion, we expect to see an improvement from the year ending March 2013 as we reap the benefits of our past investments. The year ending March 2013 is the final year of Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012. As CFO of Mitsubishi Corporation, my aim is to continue to further buttress our financial base, which will support our ability to create sustainable corporate value.

MC responds to demand for electricity, using diverse energy sources such as thermal power as well as wind and solar power.

Wind power and peaker plants are an examElectric Power Information Center, Inc./OECD/IEA (2009) ple of how we are working to meet new needs. Wind power generation is environmentally friendly. One of its drawbacks, It is vital to respond to the different needs of each country. The U.S. is seeing a rapid increase in gas-fired power generation; European counhowever, is that output can be unstable. To compensate for this, tries are actively embracing wind and solar photovoltaic power; and we operate gas turbine peaker plants in California, U.S., which many Asian countries are using low-cost coal-fired power generation. generate electricity to cover peak demand. Meanwhile, Japan places emphasis on a balance of energy sources. I am in charge of promoting the development of wind power generation projects in France and four other European countries. A long-term approach is required to install giant wind turbines the size of Ferris wheels on windy expansive sites. Our days are busy holding explanatory meetings for locals in community halls, explaining road repairs leading up to power plant sites to mayors, and visiting governors to lobby for approval. We often face unexpected issues, given that there are many stakeholders. However, that’s what makes development an interesting challenge. It’s like solving a difficult puzzle. The result, in this case a splendid power plant, is well worth the effort.

It encompasses oil and gas exploration, development and production (E&P) business; investment in LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) liquefaction projects; importation and offshore trading of crude oil, petroleum products, carbon materials and products, LNG, and LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas); and domestic trading and retail operations related to these commodities and products. Group CEO Message Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012 Targets and Progress Under MC’s Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012, we have several key strategies: maintain and expand existing projects, particularly natural gas projects, and bring online new projects or ones under development; develop and strengthen E&P business; create new business models for tapping into globalization and growth markets; and strengthen MC’s strategies and functions in support of these activities. We conduct our businesses mindful of creating social and environmental value. As the energy arm of a major general trading company, we aim to be a unique and sustainable energy business group over the medium and long terms. We intend to develop our businesses globally. Specifically, in an effort to meet rising demand for natural gas, we are developing the Donggi-Senoro LNG Project and a shale gas business in Canada. Furthermore, to create new business models, we are working to strengthen value chains, including investing in carbon manufacturers. For the year ended March 2012, this business group posted net income of ¥120.6 billion, up ¥26.6 billion year on year. Business Environment and Outlook for Year Ending March 2013 In the year ending March 2013, we expect demand for energy to increase on the back of ongoing high growth in emerging countries, despite possible economic instability in Europe and uncertainty surrounding the Middle East. Based on this outlook, we are projecting net income for this business group of ¥130.0 billion for the year ending March 2013. We must closely monitor changes in supply-demand dynamics.

Aiming to diversify its energy supply, Brunei is looking at promoting the introduction of renewable energy. In this context, much is expected of solar photovoltaic power generation as an energy source with a relatively lower environmental impact. In order to cooperate with Brunei’s energy policy, MC has installed a solar photovoltaic power generation system with a nominal capacity of 1.2 MW, which is one of the largest in Southeast Asia. The system was completed at the end of July 2010. At present, MC, the Energy Department, Prime Minister’s Office (EDPMO) of Brunei and the Department of Electrical Services are jointly carrying out verification tests and evaluations. The data and know-how obtained in this project will help the promotion and commercialization of solar photovoltaic power generation in the future.

Group CEO Message Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012 Targets and Progress Under Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012 in the resource investment business, we have steadily made investments in existing and new projects in fields such as coking coal, thermal coal, iron ore, copper and PGM*. Meanwhile, in our trading business, we have actively expanded business overseas, particularly in growth markets, while rebuilding businesses in Japan. As we go forward, we will step up measures to solidify our business base by pushing ahead with various strategies and continuing to grow the human resources to support these operations. In the year ended March 2012, this business group posted net income of ¥172.1 billion, which was ¥59.4 billion lower year on year. One in main reason for this decline was the absence of the gains on a share m exchange at a Chilean iron ore-related company that were recorded in e the year ended March 2011. The other main reason was lower sales th vvolumes at an Australian resource-related subsidiary (coking coal) due to sstrike action and bad weather, which affected site operations. Business B Environment and Outlook for Y Year Ending March 2013 In terms of the business environment in the year ending March 2013, there are some uncertainties clouding the outlook, most notably a hint of th an economic slowdown in China and other emerging markets. Neverthea lless, over the medium and long terms, demand for metals resources and products as well as prices are expected to increase firmly, with economic growth in emerging markets driving the global economy. As the culmination of Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012, the year ending March 2013 is a year in which we will continue working steadily to execute initiatives to achieve our targets. In tandem, we intend to quicken the pace of business and human resource development globally in this business group, with an eye toward the next medium-term management plan. For the year ending March 2013, we are projecting a ¥12.9 billion year-on-year increase in net income to ¥185.0 billion. This projection is premised mainly on higher earnings from copper-related businesses and higher earnings from a steel product-related subsidiary. * PGM: Platinum Group Metals (platinum, palladium, and other platinum group metals) Jun Kinukawa Executive Vice President, Group CEO, Metals Group Mitsubishi Corporation Annual Report 2012 Metals Group Metals Group CEO Office Metals Group Administration Dept.

Leveraging our knowledge and customer network across these fields, we aim to expand value chains spanning finance, distribution and our extensive business investments. Group CEO Message Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012 Targets and Progress The Machinery Group has designated four key domains under Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012: social infrastructure projects, including power generation, transport and ports; resourceand energy-related projects; shiprelated business; and automobile-related business. During the past year, we worked to reinforce our existing operations and to create new businesses. In the year ended March 2012, we posted net income of ¥54.5 billion, a year-on-year decline of ¥6.9 billion. This result reflected lower motor vehicle sales overseas due to the impact of the historically strong yen and major floods in Thailand, as well as the absence of gains on share sales recorded in the year ended March 2011. Business Environment and Outlook for Year Ending March 2013 On April 1, 2012, we carried out an internal reorganization, which resulted in the integration of five units responsible for power generation, transport, ports, smart community and other projects into the Global Environment & Infrastructure Business Development Group. In addition, industrial equipment, rental businesses, construction and mining machinery businesses, and the elevator business within the group were brought together to form the Industrial Machinery Business Division. These and other moves were made so that we use our business resources as productively as possible. In resourceand energy-related projects, we are focusing on FPSO* projects and the gas pipeline business. In ship-related business, Diamond Star Shipping, which was established in Singapore in May 2011, is leading our efforts to expand our ship owning and chartering business. In automobile-related businesses, we are making progress expanding business in emerging markets, including Russia, China, India and Brazil, as well as our mainstay markets of Indonesia and Thailand. In construction machinery, we plan to strengthen sales and sales finance operations in China and elsewhere. For the year ending March 2013, we are projecting net income of ¥60.0 billion. * A Floating Production, Storage & Offloading System (FPSO) is a facility for producing oil and gas offshore.

Creating Social and Environmental Value A Lineup in Tune With Changing Times Nikken Corporation (Nikken, Rental Company), which is 96.83% owned by MC, was the first in its industry to utilize electric vehicles. The company has also gradually introduced hybrid excavators, trucks and other vehicles, small cranes for decreasing CO2, generators for reducing exhaust gas and LED lighting. These actions demonstrate how Nikken is proactively reshaping its rental asset portfolio to stay in tune with changing times. Furthermore, Nikken is steadily expanding its lineup of New Technology Information System (NETIS)-registered products. NETIS is a technology utilization system for public works and other projects developed by Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. Moreover, Nikken is working to bolster its rental services in order to improve work environments and ensure safety and security.

We also develop businesses in the life science field, which includes food science, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. A shift in the global economy’s center of gravity, the uneven distribution of resources, declining birthrates and aging populations in industrialized nations, and rising interest in the environment and health are some of the social changes shaping our business environment. While maintaining a focus on the role expected of the chemical industry in terms of ensuring a sustainable society, we aim to achieve further growth by strengthening our core businesses and creating new businesses. Group CEO Message Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012 Targets and Progress The Chemicals Group aims to be a strong group with sustainable earnings power, as well as have an influential presence in the marketplace. In April 2011, we established the Life Sciences Division, which subsequently entered the new business domain of custom manufacturing biopharmaceuticals. In the commodity chemicals field, we invested in a rock phosphate producer in Peru, seeing this as a promising growth business that can cater to demand stemming from the need to produce more food worldwide. In the functional chemicals field, we made Chuo Kagaku Co., Ltd. a consolidated subsidiary. This company is engaged in the plastic food packaging and container business where demand is expected to increase in Japan and overseas. For the year ended March 2012, we recorded net income of ¥37.1 billion. This ¥8.0 billion year-on-year increase shows that our actions in various fields are steadily producing results. Business Environment and Outlook for Year Ending March 2013 We foresee more business opportunities in the year ending March 2013 spawned by structural change. These include the emergence of shale gas as a feedstock in the North American petrochemical industry, and the completion of large petrochemical manufacturing facilities in China. There are other dynamics that offer opportunities as well. One is expansion in the fertilizer industry in line with burgeoning demand for food worldwide. Others are expanding consumer markets in emerging countries as their economies grow solidly, and ever-increasing interest in health, safety, comfort and the environment. Under this environment, in the year ending March 2013, we aim to generate net income of ¥40.0 billion. We will continue to strengthen our businesses, particularly in key fields, while remaining cognizant of capital efficiency.

In each of these fields, we organically manage supply chains extending from the procurement of raw materials to production and processing, intermediary distribution, retail and services. Our goal is to stably and continuously supply various products and services demanded by customers. Group CEO Message Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012 Targets and Progress Under Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012, the Living Essentials Group is focusing on three key themes: (1) expanding and improving our raw materials procurement network, (2) strengthening our Japan business base, and (3) targeting overseas growth markets. With regards to the first theme in the year ended March 2012, we worked to enhance our grain procurement network in North and South America, which included investing in a Brazilian grain trading company. In addition, we acquired a company running a salmon farming business in Chile, and invested in Brazil’s largest coffee plantation. In terms of the second theme, four intermediary food distribution subsidiaries completed their merger, starting anew as Mitsubishi Shokuhin Co., Ltd. in April 2012. In targeting overseas growth markets, we made various moves with the aim of nurturing new growth businesses. One was to invest in a meat and livestock business of COFCO Limited, one of China’s largest state-owned food companies. In the year ended March 2012, this business group recorded net income of ¥56.6 billion, up ¥10.3 billion year on year. This earnings increase resulted mainly from higher earnings at foodand textile-related companies which strengthened their business platforms in Japan. Business Environment and Outlook for Year Ending March 2013 With competition to secure food and other resources as strong as ever, in the year ending March 2013, we will continue work to enhance our grain procurement network, while strengthening the functions of existing businesses in Japan. Furthermore, we aim to build an earnings platform for driving further growth. Here, we will step up efforts with leading partners and develop across business domains where we are strong in emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere. For the year ending March 2013, we are forecasting net income of ¥66.0 billion, up ¥9.4 billion year on year. This forecast assumes higher earnings from food-related businesses.

MC is aware that it needs to enter these markets proactively, and has therefore been focusing financial and human resources on those regions. Specifically, we have reinforced our organizational structures to facilitate expeditious business promotion in these countries at the local level. We have also introduced measures to identify and develop individual projects and strengthened our Companywide structures for key fields. As a result, we are steadily growing our earnings drivers for the future, including developing new businesses in the food resources industry and entering new business domains such as financial services in these strategic regions. MC also has adopted a global management structure with the aim of gaining a thorough understanding of local conditions and thereby enabling betterinformed management decisions. Specifically, in addition to Japan, we have mapped out five key overseas regions (North America; Latin America; EuropeCIS, Middle East & Africa; East Asia; and Asia & Oceania), and assigned a Regional CEO to each. Each Regional CEO is endeavoring to ensure that optimal activities are conducted on a consolidated basis within their respective regions. In April 2012, we established a new holding company called Mitsubishi Corporation (Americas) to strengthen regional coordination and consolidated management of group companies in North America. By adopting this framework, MC will improve the dissemination of information from each region, including Japan, with the goal of developing a more sophisticated global strategy and strengthening consolidated management.

At present, he is the Commissioner of Nippon Professional Baseball. We asked Mr. Kato about Mitsubishi Corporation’s corporate governance. Strengthening Corporate Governance Must Not Become an End Unto Itself The ultimate mission of any company is to raise corporate value and deliver that value to stakeholders. Corporate governance is a vital element for doing that. Mitsubishi Corporation is extremely proactive and conscientious in addressing corporate governance, and has won recognition for the high level of its governance framework. I have understood why through discussions at Board of Directors’ meetings and communication with employees since my appointment as an outside director in 2009. Corporate governance, though, is only a means to continuously raising corporate value. It is by no means an objective. However, I really feel that corporate governance is becoming an end unto itself in society. In that sense, strengthening governance must not become an end unto itself. I believe that one of my roles as an outside Ryozo Kato Member of the Board director is to bring a measure of balance to governance. Mr. Kato joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan in 1965. He successively held the posts of DirectorMitsubishi Corporation Must Display Its Own Identity General, Asian Affairs Bureau; Director, General Affairs; Director Foreign Policy; and Ambassador to Fundamentally, corporate governance is something that should the U.S. He retired from the ministry in 2008. not pander to trends or the current climate in society.

MC has long engaged in creating a framework to ensure that it continues to conduct proper and fair business activities, in addition to upholding legal and regulatory compliance. This long-standing commitment is based on the Three Corporate Principles, which encapsulate our corporate philosophy, and is stipulated in our Corporate Standards of Conduct. In September 2000, we formulated a Code of Conduct, and all officers and employees are required to carry a booklet containing this code. In addition, every year all officers and employees are required to sign a written commitment to this Code after taking an e-learning program in which they study examples related to the Code of Conduct. Through these measures, we are ensuring legal and regulatory compliance by each and every employee, as well as instilling an awareness of proper conduct that reflects social norms. In another initiative, we introduced the Compliance Officer post and compliance officers have been appointed in all business groups and all regions in Japan and overseas. These people work to foster compliance in daily activities. In the year ended March 2011, we prepared a booklet in Japanese, English and Chinese summarizing our compliance activities to date, which was distributed worldwide. This booklet is aiding in deepening understanding of our compliance activities among suppliers and other stakeholders, as well as officers and employees of MC’s subsidiaries and affiliated companies. The compliance activities of all officers and employees are the basis upon which we Hideyuki Nabeshima Member of the Board, conduct all our corporate activities, as well as an important strategy for raising corporate Senior Executive Vice President value on a consolidated basis. From the base of the compliance activities conducted Chief Compliance Officer thus far, we will continue to upgrade and reinforce compliance initiatives that are effective at instilling awareness of compliance issues in each and every officer and employee of MC and employees of MC’s subsidiaries and affiliated companies.

We believe that, while tackling this issue will depend a great deal on the development of global climate regulatory frameworks and action based on them, business leadership and technological innovation will also be vital in the move toward a lower carbon society. As a global business enterprise, we also recognize that we have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint, and we are committed to harnessing our potential to develop systems and technologies to help communities and other industries do the same. In June 2011, the Mitsubishi Shoji Building, our headquarters, was certified as an “Office Taking Excellent Specific Global Warming Countermeasures” (a top-level office) by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. This recognizes the use of automated modulation of office lighting and a high-performance airconditioning system, along with other aspects such as employee energy-saving initiatives. MC operates the Palma del Rio II photovoltaic solar plant in Spain with ACCIONA. CO2 Emissions Assessment MC is working to reduce CO2 emissions in all business situations, including office work and logistics. MC has been disclosing environmental performance information since 2003 under the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)*, including our CO2 emissions data as well as details on how we are addressing the issue of climate change. Furthermore, we have requested third-party reviews of our CO2 emissions data on a global, consolidated basis in order to ensure the integrity of CO2 emissions reporting. As part of ongoing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint, in April 2009 MC embarked upon its “CO2 Action Project,” designed to promote the reduction of CO2 throughout our Japanese offices and in our business activities. CO2 emissions (indirect CO2 emissions from electricity consumption) in the year ended March 2012 on a non-consolidated basis were 2,876 tons, approximately 23% lower year on year. Furthermore, direct CO2 emissions from fuel consumption and indirect CO2 emissions from electricity consumption on a consolidated, global basis in the year ended March 2011 totaled approximately 3.65 million tons. * Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP): A project conducted in conjunction with institutional investors that requires major companies around the world to disclose their The Rockland Wind Farm in the U.S. generates 80 MW of electricity; MC’s share on a greenhouse gas emissions as well as climate change strategies. net equity basis is 40 MW. 78 Mitsubishi Corporation Annual Report 2012 Contributing to a Low-Carbon Society Through Business MC is contributing to the creation of a low-carbon society Renewable Energy Share in Mitsubishi Corporation’s Equity Share of Power Generation through businesses such as transportation infrastructure and (units: MW) Renewable energy renewable energy projects.

Furthermore, at business investees that need large volumes of water such as mining businesses, MC believes it is important to secure water in a way that does not impact local communities or the environment. Moreover, MC has been disclosing water-related activities through CDP Water Disclosure, an information disclosure initiative under the CDP, since 2011. Preservation of Biodiversity Humanity benefits greatly from the services that ecosystems replete with diverse forms of life offer. These services are varied and multifaceted. For example, ecosystems supply us with food and water, regulate climate and purify the water we drink. What enables all of these natural benefits is biodiversity. Similarly, MC benefits from the services that ecosystems provide in many regions worldwide. Accordingly, MC views the preservation of biodiversity as a vitally important issue. To support our commitment, MC strives to mitigate the impact that its businesses have on biodiversity, and seeks ways to contribute to ecosystem conservation through its businesses and social contributions designed to protect the environment. MC has a 70% stake in Alpac Forest Products Inc., a company headquartered in Alberta, Canada, that manages forests. This company manages forests with consideration for protecting biodiversity and forest ecosystems. 79 Mitsubishi Corporation Annual Report 2012 Environmental Partnerships and Contributions MC conducts social contribution activities designed to protect the environment and conserve valuable global ecosystems through partnerships with NGOs and other groups. We also provide volunteering opportunities for our employees in order to enhance their awareness and understanding of environmental issues.

Volunteers, including MC Group employees, support survey and research activities. The project also includes holding academic conferences and seminars so the results of this work can be applied in coral reef conservation efforts globally. Tropical Forest Regeneration Experimental Project Tropical forests are home to some of the world’s greatest biodiversity and their destruction is a serious issue in the context of global warming. Since the 1990s, we have run the Tropical Forest Regeneration Experimental Project to build on knowledge for solving this problem. This project aims to regenerate tropical forest ecosystems, including the animals that live there, within 40-50 years, using intensive and mixed Charitable Foundations planting of trees and plants indigenous to the local regions, to Through Mitsubishi Corporation Foundation for the Americas speed up the process of natural regeneration.
