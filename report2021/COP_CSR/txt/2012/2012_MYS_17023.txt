Quality and Affordable Communications Building the digital infrastructure for the future We are the first Asian operator within the Telenor Group to build a fully Long-Term Evolution (LTE)-equipped network, targeted for completion by 2013. The advent of LTE technology (or fourth generation mobile services – 4G) will play a significant part in UN Millennium Development driving Malaysia’s future growth, especially given the massive move to data traffic that Goal 8: is influencing the socio-economic structure of Malaysia. 4G is a major milestone for the local telecommunications sector, and an exciting experience for users as it would Target 18: In cooperation enable the kind of rich applications currently enjoyed by fixed broadband. with the private sector, make available the benefits As the demand for data grows, we have to enhance our network which escalates of new technologies, capital requirements and operating costs. From an environmental perspective, a bigger especially information network footprint equals higher energy consumption, greater use of land and other and communications natural resources, and construction material. To achieve better capital and operational efficiencies, as well as address related environmental impacts, we embarked on an in-depth infrastructure sharing with Celcom-Axiata, another player in the Malaysian telecommunications industry. Most importantly, this initiative will benefit customers through better prices and quality of services. We are currently in the pilot phase and scheduled for a nationwide rollout within the next 2 to 3 years. Driving internet uptake amongst local communities The internet must be delivered in a relevant, convenient and affordable manner to allow Malaysians of all walks of life to reap its benefits. Our approach to drive internet uptake can be seen on several fronts. We offer a wide range of affordable and relevant price plans to suit various needs and have also launched several products that have strong positive social impact such as the DiGi Simple MasterCard and Family-friendly internet experience in partnership with McAfee.  DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) DiGi Simple MasterCard The 1st telco-branded prepaid and secure cashless payment card. The Simple Card provides access to cashless payment solutions for consumers who do not have credit facilities with financial institutions. It also enhances financial safety for migrant and low-income workers, by reducing risks associated with carrying cash. The card also helps in managing family finances, especially for families with college-going children where parents can now provide a prepaid card to limit the spending of their children. Family-friendly internet experience with McAfee – A parental filter solution that is offered as an optional product bundling at a much discounted price to all our broadband customers. With this offering, parents can protect their children from exposure to inappropriate web content and reduce risks of online threats such as cyber-bullying, identity theft, cyber-stalking, cyber-grooming and pornography. Apart from our customers, we have also reached out to all Malaysians through numerous initiatives. Our objective is to show how the internet can be used in a positive and enriching manner.
