The practical use of the energy produced from biomass is attracting attention for its great ability to contribute to a reduction in CO2, which is considered the cause of global warming. Southeast Asia is blessed with an abundance of biomass resources, and its practical use is also highly anticipated as an alternative energy to fossil fuel. Founded as a manufacturing and distributor of proprietarily developed boilers in 1938, from early on Takuma has been involved in the development, manufacture, and supply of boilers that utilize not only fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas, but can also use factory-oriented waste (bagasse) from sugarcane. We have also delivered biomass power-generation Deployment of plants that use various types of residue from agriculture and forestry processes as fuel. In addition to bagasse, biomass fuels include wood chips, coconut waste, rice husks and corn cores, etc. Transporting sugarcane Businesses The flourishing economic growth of Southeast Asia is giving traction to the world economy of today. This is supported in part by their high rate of practical use of renewable energy. In these regions, the demand from power-selling electrical generation plants using abundantly available biomass resources is increasingly expanding, and the market is calling for the supply of environmentally-friendly, highly efficient, high quality, and highly reliable plants on a competitive price level. Takuma looks at things from the users’ perspective in order to truly grasp customer needs and market demand. By then uniting that information with the technology we have amassed, we aim at the realization of a competitive product structure. Biomass (bagasse) power plant Bagasse yard In the sugar manufacturing market of Thailand, the jump in the price of sugar has resulted in the serious consideration of plans to install bagasse combustion boilers in line with factory expansion. Due to the rapid actualization of a market demand that has gradually changed over the past several years, bagasse combustion boilers are being transformed from the conventional need for industrial use, in-factory application specification of comparatively low-pressure large capacity use (steam generation: 200 to 300 ton/hr, pressure 2.0 to 3.0 MPaG, steam temperature: 300 to 400°C) to the adoption of more compact, efficient boilers (steam generation: 120 to 170 ton/hr, pressure: 4.0 to 11.0 MPaG, steam temperature: 450 to 520°C). This is because the trend in the products called for in the marketplace has moved towards plants in the energy supply business that sell off any surplus electric power, over and above that which the sugar factories use, to power utilities. In addition to manufacturers in Europe, Australia, and locally in Southeast Asia, competitive manufacturers from India and China are quickly gaining ground. In this market, which is becoming more and more competitive year-by-year, Takuma is working in close cooperation with Siam Takuma, our company in Bangkok. On the foundation of our extensive results in planning, design, manufacture, construction and operation that is supported by years of experience, together with our overall accumulated know-how, we are supplying updated state-of-the-art, compact, high efficiency, high reliability, renewable energy plants to a wide range of countries in Southeast Asia, centering on Thailand. By delivering simple, rational and reliable biomass power-generation plants that truly satisfy the demands of the market, we are enabling the coexistence of global environment preservation and effective energy utilization, and thus contributing to further economic development.
