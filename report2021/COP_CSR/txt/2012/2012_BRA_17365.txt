For larger economic groups, a preclassification model is used as a function of economic capital allocated. For the other groups of companies, a simplified pre-classification model is used, with maximum nominal credit amounts for each period. For standard client risk, the portfolio limits are planned 2009 2010 2011 through Credit Management Programs (PGC in Portuguese), a document previously agreed upon by the business and risk areas, and approved by the Executive Committee.

This group of clients has a more automatic treatment.

During this time she never ceased to dream of having her own grocery store near her home in the community of Heliópolis, the largest shantytown in the capital city São Paulo and the second largest in Brazil. In 2006, when she learned about Santander Microcredit from her neighbors, Cheila decided to take out a loan of R$ 300 to invest in her small business. First, she bought a tarpaulin. Subsequently, with further financing, she changed the counter and the shop window. Then, as a result of additional loans, came the first banana stall, a second fish stall, and finally a small grocery store, which had sales of only R$ 250 a month and had only produced losses for the former owner.

In ten years of experience, the program has evolved and improved. One of the most important things we have learned during this time has enabled us, in the first year of support, to begin investing in “municipal diagnoses” carried out by the Committees for the Rights of Children and Adolescents in order to map the strengths and weaknesses in the system that protects children and adolescents in each location. This work, which lasts one year, qualifies the committee members to identify problems in the region where they operate and to promote dialogue with other leaders in the municipality in order to help prepare and plan the Municipal Policy for the Protection of Children and Adolescents, which determines the projects to be undertaken in the following year. In 2011, we channeled R$ 9 million into all the social projects identified as a priority by the 48 cities selected in 2010. Throughout the year, we enjoyed the collaboration Foto: Lorem Ipsum of around 3,000 employees acting as “multipliers”, who succeeded in engaging almost 30,000 other employees and more than 3,500 customers. EC8 Prêmios Santander Universidades (Santander University Awards) In 2011, in its seventh edition, Prêmios Santander Universidades awarded R$ 1 million in prizes to 20 projects of students, teachers, researchers, and universities, including eight scholarships to Babson College in the USA, granted to the four winning students and four teacher coordinators. A total of 6,143 projects were submitted by nearly 400 universities. 30,000 employees of Santander were engaged in the Amigo de Valor program in 2011 121 Santander | Social and Cultural Investment Shared knowledge Universia is the largest Ibero-American university collaboration network, developed to create new opportunities and further cooperation between universities based on a platform that brings together professors, students and businesses. It presently includes 1,216 institutions of higher education in 23 countries in Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula, reaching 14 million students and professors. Its four strategic pillars were redefined for the period from 2011 to 2013. Activities are now divided into Employment, Knowledge, Collaboration and Future. As far as Employment is concerned, the aim is to reflect the relationship between talent and employment, facilitating the search for the first job and professional experience for university students. The purpose of the Knowledge pillar is to be the driver of innovation, connecting academic research to business practice. In turn, the Collaboration pillar seeks to create physical and virtual sites for the debate on the inter-university relationship so as to be able to discuss trends in higher education, and education in general. The last pillar, Future, seeks to create initiatives and tools to help university students with their professional education. In 2011, the main relationship channel of the network in Brazil, Portal Universia (www.universia.com.br), received more than 1.8 million visitors.

According to studies conducted by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, for each 100 m² of roof area painted white, approximately ten tons of CO2 are not emitted into the atmosphere. Green area We created a green area to compensate the lack of vegetation and we made changes in the land to the effect of increasing permeability levels to facilitate the draining of water. 126 2011 Annual Report Photos: Pisco del Gaiso Recyclable materials A large part of the materials used in branches is recycled such as cement with electric arc furnace slag, PET pipes and rubber applied to tactile floors.

The work with suppliers follows the same principle. Water, waste and energy We encourage our partners to have emission inventories and adopt practices which also reduce their impacts. Since 2008, we have had a policy of managing As a result, we have been able to improve our own inventory building waste, which aims to reduce the generation and make it more in line with reality.

Photos: Pisco del Gaiso Santander Forest en18 Since 2008, we have offset part of our carbon emissions through the Santander Forest Project (Floresta Santander). In addition to planting trees to offset our emissions, the initiative generates income and employment opportunities in communities close to the cultivated land. Another consequence is an improvement in local biodiversity and microclimate. This reforestation is taking place in degraded areas, in locations with a low Human Development Index (HDI) and carried out with the support of the local community. In this way we contribute to the reclaiming of native forest in the southern region of the state of São Paulo (Vale do Ribeira) and in the north of the state of Paraná. Since 2008, we have recovered 216 hectares in degraded areas. In addition to offsetting the bank’s emissions, the recovery of the vegetation also contributes to the preservation of water resources and biodiversity. In some locations, such as the town of Prado Ferreira (PR), significant achievements such as the protection of the water catchment system and a reduction in erosion around springs can be seen. 129 Santander | About this report About this report 3.1 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.10 3.13 4.13 4.14 4.15 4.16 4.17 Santander’s Annual Report shows the bank’s performance Convergence of Topics – from economic, social, and environmental aspects in 2011, Internal Axis vs. External Axis a year in which we finalized the process of integrating the systems of Santander with Banco Real, completed our 3,0 strategic review cycle, and strengthened our processes and practices.
