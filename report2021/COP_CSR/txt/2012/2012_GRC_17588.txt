SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011 The Sustainability Since 2006, the HELLENIC PETROLEUM Group has published an annual Sustainability Report in order to improve our communication and share information with our social partners (stakeholders). This year’s seventh annual report provides an overview of the Group’s business performance taking into account economic, environmental and social perspectives from 01.01.2011 to 31.12.2011. Reporting Guidelines This Report was prepared through taking into account the GRI guidelines (Global Reporting Initiative, G3.1), the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and the GRI’s Oil & Gas Sector Supplement. Both the UNGC and the GRI are voluntary initiatives with a complementary role in promoting internationally accepted principles through corporate accountability and performance. Our Group is committed to implementing and promoting these two complementary initiatives which ensures for a consistent platform in the realization of values, sustainable development policies, strategies and business practices. During the preparation of the report, we took into account the dialogue with our stakeholders, conclusions drawn from survey research conducted in local communities and with our customers, suppliers and employees, requirements for disclosure from financial analysts and the wider public as well as observations made by inspection and auditing bodies. With this approach, the Group will endeavor to continue to implement activities under its commitment to Sustainable Development. Report’s Content The information provided in this report covers the influences and impacts that an energy group, such as HELLENIC PETROLEUM, has on sustainable development. All indicators, measurement units, quantities and sizes, referred to in the Report, correspond to recorded measurements and data using scientifically proven procedures, the best available practices, internationally accepted standards and international oil industry codes.

Assurance To ensure for accuracy, completeness and credibility, this Report was audited and validated in its whole by an independent external certification association prior to its publication. We inform our stakeholders that the design and implementation of this report was planned in order to ensure that the Group achieved an A rating based on GRI criteria indicators. The third party which assessed the Report, certified its A rating, according to guidelines G3.1 and the specific Oil & Gas Sector Supplement. The results of this assessment are presented in section 7.4. Moreover, the accuracy of the report is assured through internal audits and statistical checks performed by accredited certification associations as well as peer group companies and others. These inspections and audits ensure that the report is credible, properly balanced and relevant to the expectations and interests of the Group’s stakeholders. Reporting Boundaries The information contained in the report relates to the following Group companies selected because they represent the basic and strategic activities of the Group in Greece and abroad. We decided not to include hydrocarbons’ exploration and production activities as this activity is conducted through joint ventures involving several companies. The following companies were also included in the previous reports (2006-2010), with improvements and additional information, without revising any information.

The scheduled public opinion surveys (section 6.4), the employees’ partners’ customers’ satisfaction surveys (sections 5 & 6.3), the risk assessment (section 3.2) and the quality, environmental, health and safety policies (section 6.3) confirm a proactive approach. HR applies the “precautionary principle” in all its areas of operation (HR planning, selection and recruitment, training & development, succession planning, evaluation, reward) to prevent any risks arising from non systematic or thorough evaluation of parameters affecting its areas of operation. Moreover, monitors the market trends on remuneration – benefits issues, through surveys issued by specialized consulting firms, changes in labor and insurance issues, through the Press Labor Legislation, whereas is updated as a member of the HFE & HMA.

In the area of procurement, the precautionary principle is one of the basic principles of operation and included in the formulation of specific procurement strategy, with particular attention to ensure seamless and endless supply in the best technoeconomical conditions (eg, restriction of monopolies supply). By recording targeted number of near misses and taking preventive measures, DIAXON, avoids potential accidents. 4.12 Externally developed economic, & p. 16, 39, 67, 81 environmental, and social charters, principles, or other initiatives to which the organization O p. 55 (HFE' s Code of Corporate Governance) subscribes or endorses. 4.13 Memberships in associations (such as industry associations) and / or national / & p. 23-24, 39, 81-82 international advocacy organizations. 4.14 List of stakeholder groups engaged by the organization. & p. 4-5, 62-63 4.15 Basis for identification and selection of stakeholders with whom to engage. & p. 4-5, 62-63 90 4.16 Approaches to stakeholder engagement, & p. 4-5, 62-63 including frequency of engagement by type Moreover, the scheduled annual public opinion surveys (section 6.4), the regular and by stakeholder group. employees’ partners’ customers’ satisfaction surveys (sections 5, 5.4, 6.3 and indicator 4.4), the regular communication with customers, partners & employees (their representatives are members of the BoD) confirm the engagement of the interested parties. Specifically: Investors: Apart from regular interaction mentioned above, feedback is sought wherever possible, either formally (eg through the broker who organizes a roadshow and then comes in contact with the investor), or informally by direct contact with participants analysts. There is no institutionalized communication channel, but an open line of communication of the stakeholders with the IR Department, through which they contact the company and get answers to their questions. The roadshows (3 times per year), the day for financial analysts (once a year), the days of Greek institutional investors (annually), the conference with financial analysts (3 times per year) operating at a frequency sufficient to ensure continuous communication with the investment community. Whenever further data is required regarding the operation of the company, it is provided to the interested persons.

Clearly there is evaluation of the main contractors, after completion of a project, in issues concerning safety, performance, compliance with contractual obligations, etc (for these reasons the evaluation sheet is filled in). Customers: Scheduled communication through the sales consultants at least once a month. During the visit, potential deficiencies are identified or corrective actions noticed at previous audits are monitored. We develop a mystery-shopper program, per month at the Group owned petrol stations and per three months to the rest. On an annual basis and after evaluation, especially in areas concerning image, safety, products promotion etc., station owners are rewarded. The Group companies, locally, conduct market research and customer satisfaction surveys. Employees: Through the internal network (intranet) the employees are daily updated with business news related to the activities of the Group, (information, announcements, articles, calls concerning the Group in general and / or its subsidiaries). Also, employees are informed about the promoting activities of the retail network of the Group. Along with the internal network, the most important news / announcements are posted on bulletin boards on specific landmarks in all buildings of the Group.

The breach of contractual obligations by the supplier (eg pallets of chemicals) and the failure to execute a project lead to the redefinition of needs, re-evaluation of the reliability of suppliers, cost renegotiation, search of new partners, tender reopening. As long as the technical offer of a potential supplier is rejected, the sealed financial bid is returned in accordance with the current regulation of procurement. 5.

Participation in committees & actions with other companies in the opportunities for the sector (see section 7.2) facilitates the monitoring of the forthcoming regulatory changes. The Group’s organization’s activities commitment to sustainability issues is confirmed by the participation to the Board Council for Sustainable due to climate change. Development, the commitment to the UNGC and the cooperation with the Network for Corporate Social Responsibility. & p. 24-27 (Actions for: Energy Saving, Biofuels, RES) Financial implications and other risks and potential opportunities for operational activities due to climate change are within the scope of any feasibility study concerning investment operations of the Group. The company’s strategic choice for tackling climate change is the energy saving, both in production activity and administrative functions. The obvious financial impacts have to do with the costs associated with the projected deficit of the rights concerning emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), as the three refineries in Greece participate in the European Emissions GHG Trading Scheme. The developments concerning the relevant Directive 2003/87/ EC are monitored, at European level for the sector (participation in a EUROPIA group) and the impacts are evaluated at country and company level. For the first two trading phases (2005-2007 and 2008-2012) almost all of the rights allocated for free to industries, based mainly on past emissions. Especially for Greek refineries, this was done without taking into account the investment for the environmental improvement of fuel, which have let to increased energy consumption, and ignoring their early action to save energy, resulting in a deficit. For the period 2013-2020 (third trading phase), which changes the rules of allocation and only 50% of total allowances will be distributed free while the remaining 50% will be auctioned because of the exposure of the refining industry at a significant risk of brain carbon (carbon leakage) the refineries will receive 100% free allocation of allowances to be derived on the basis of the price benchmark resulting from the average of 10% most efficient installations of the oil sector (in the years 2007-2008 ), which is 29,5 kg CO2/CWT. This leads the industry benchmark at European level reductions of 23%, a higher percentage than the EU target of 21% applicable to other industry sectors. Appendices 93 Sustainability Report 2011 EC2 Financial implications HELLENIC PETROLEUM, for the period 2013-2020 would have a deficit of around 25% of emissions, and other risks and taking into account the modernization of the Elefsina refinery. Given that the technical options available opportunities for the for effective reduction of CO2 emissions are limited at existing facilities; because refineries have a high organization’s activities degree of energy optimization by implementing for many years energy saving projects, there will be costs due to climate change. to purchase the required emission allowances from 2013. It is also noted that because power generation activities are not allocated free allowances (since 2013), refineries are expected to incur additional increased cost concerning electricity purchases; as the cost of buying allowances for electricity is expected to be shifted to consumers. Other potential risks include increased costs for fuel and raw materials, reduced demand for energyintensive products as well as additional measures to control and reduce GHG, which are related for the sector at European level. The evaluation of potential opportunities for natural gas & advanced biofuels market penetration is continuous. Moreover, investments are implemented for the improvement of the energy efficiency and in the field of RES. EC3 Coverage of the & p. 43-44 organization’s defined benefit plan obligations. The Group does not use defined benefit plan, but defined contribution plan. With this program are covered: HELLENIC PETROLEUM 96.93% of employees, ASPROFOS 66.66%, DIAXON 95%, HP Cyprus 100% of permanent staff and JPK 100%. The employees contribute to the cost, and more specifically to health and pension plan. Indicative examples are (DIAXON & HEL.PE.): Newly insured employee : 2.5% employer contribution and 0.5% to 5% employee contribution. Already insured employee : 6.5% employer contribution and 1.5% to 5% employee contribution. At ASPROFOS: the employee contribution is 2-4% and the company participation is 3%. At HP Cyprus: the company pays 5% & the employee 5-15% of the employee’s annual salary, to the welfare fund. For the Pension Fund the contribution comes entirely from the company. For 2011the percentage was 15.6% over the annual salary. At JPK & EKO Bulgaria: a standard, obligatory scheme, which is predefined by the national law. At EKO Serbia: All contributions for pension and health are covered by the company (22% 12.3% of gross salary).

Indicative examples of salaries are: operator earns 32% higher than the local minimum and engineer earns 62% higher than the that local minimum ΑSPROFOS: (based on 100 sector’s agreement) the deviation from the standard minimum wage is: 96% engineers, accountants, 98%, 114% office workers, technicians 105%. EKO: The minimum wage in force at local level is approximately 79% of basic salary for a typical newly recruited to the company. ΕΚΟ Bulgaria: 330 %. Minimum wage €135. Entry level wage € 450. The entry level (new hires with no experience) are higher than the local as follows: for engineers 330 %, for accountants 330 %, for technicians 330 %. ΕΚΟ Serbia: engineers 444%, accountants 166%, sales representatives 277%. JPK (Montenegro): the lower company salary is 2.28-2.67 times higher than the local minimum. ΟΚΤΑ (FYROM): no local minimum in 2011. ΗΡ Cyprus: There is a collective bargaining agreement, which regulates the wage scale in relation to the respective job. On the basis of these bands will set the salaries of new recruits. The collective agreement is common to all 3 major oil companies (HEL.PE., BP, Exxon Mobil) operating in Cyprus. The permanent staff is paid based on levels of collective agreement. The seasonal staff is paid based on the minimum wage (€ 900 per month) fixed by law for specific occupations. 94 EC6 Policy, practices, and & p. 71, the spending proportion on locally-based suppliers at significant locations of operation is proportion of spending on 10% of total expenditure for supplies and is presented in table 6.4.1. locally-based suppliers at significant locations of Local supplier is defined as the provider of materials, products, and services that are based in the same operation. geographic market as the significant locations of the Group.

The surveys, extent of impacts. regular communication and consultation are used to determine the investment in infrastructure and other actions for the benefit of local communities and to understand the significant indirect effects locally. Assessing the findings will lead in planning activities for 2012. It has been recorded that local communities anticipate actions with a focus on supporting the unemployed, health services, in support of elderly and vulnerable groups in general. Moreover, during the planning phase of new investment care is taken of the direct and indirect impacts. For example, during the implementation of the project Modernization and Upgrading of Refinery an increase for job positions locally was noted, as well as support of the local market (supply, jobs). The typical average employee’s wage in the Group is 30-60% higher than the equivalent salary in Greece; respectively abroad is up to 300% higher than the corresponding national average.
