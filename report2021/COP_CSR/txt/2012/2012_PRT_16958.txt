We foresaw a very demanding context The very complex macroeconomic background to our business and our analysis of its causes enable us to predict a clear and necessary paradigm shift in our society. The world we live in today is different from the one we knew in recent years. The change from the present focus on short-term reality to a long-term vision will entail engagement and communication between all stakeholders – the company, employees, shareholders and partners. This will be essential if we are to manage the challenge in the right way. Over the past decade, the disproportionate rise in worldwide indebtedness as opposed to value creation has exposed several weaknesses and placed us in a position where a change in behaviour is imperative. This excessive leverage, especially in the westernised bloc, combined with a misguided approach to risk, led in practice to unbalanced national economies and direct intervention in various European countries, including Portugal. For the first time we are witnessing a phenomenon where countries pose a greater risk than the companies operating in them. This is true of Portugal and EDP, where the three major ratings agencies consider that at one or more levels EDP is safer in terms of credit than the Portuguese state. Despite this, due to the ratings agencies’ internal mechanisms which disregard EDP’s global and diversified profile, the company has been dragged into the successive devaluations of Portugal’s rating. Furthermore the utilities sector, formerly seen as a defensive sector, is now under huge regulatory pressure on account of the evident difficulties faced by states and taxpayers. Not even the maintenance of low prices in the energy markets has been able to prevent a continuous decline in demand since 2008. In this complex context the capital-intensive and long time to market profile, combined with the immobility of assets, forces companies to have a clear strategy based on (i) controlled risk, (ii) efficient operations and (iii) focused growth. We have executed and the results achieved have confirmed our vision… The 2011 results clearly bear out the defined growth strategy, constant diversification of markets and allocation of assets, focus on efficiency, financing policy and firm commitment to the people that made all this possible. In terms of growth we have yet again achieved our best ever operating profits, with gross operating profits (EBITDA) growing 4% to EUR 3.756 billion and net operating profits also growing by 4% to EUR 1.125 billion. Due to the conditions described above, EBITDA in Portugal fell 5%, but this was offset by the strong growth abroad, which increased by 11%. EDP Renováveis and HC Energía were the major drivers of growth in 2011. At present, 58% of EDP’s EBITDA comes structurally from abroad, as against 44% in 2006. As for efficiency, 2011 saw the conclusion of the second phase of the Opex project, which has already saved over EUR 270 million since 2006. The Opex III was also launched, with ambitious goals for savings up to 2015. Due to this concentrated focus, EDP is once again the most efficient utilities company in the Iberian Peninsula. Operational investment in 2011, which totalled EUR 2.2 billion in line with what was announced to the market, fell by around EUR 500 million compared to 2010 and will fall a further EUR 200 million in 2012. These successive reductions since 2008 represent a pragmatic approach to the new reality in which we find ourselves. In financial terms the debt/profit ratio remained the same as in 2010, although EDP has been among the companies in the sector that has deleveraged the most in the last six years. The consolidation of financial ratios will remain a priority goal. Shares outperformed the PSI 20 by 24% and its European counterparts by 21%, which shows that the market recognises EDP’s special positioning. Generally speaking, EDP’s performance during 2011 reflects a clear vision, huge capacity for adaptation and a coherent path that the company has been consistently following. …and a unique positioning EDP is now the largest Portuguese industrial group, the energy sector leader and the company that invests most in Portugal (totalling close to EUR 3 billion in the last three years) and abroad, where we already obtain over half our profits. We lead the largest hydroelectric project in Europe, with over six hydroelectric projects under construction in Portugal, which will save over EUR 200 million per year in fossil fuels and CO2 emissions in 2020. In an innovative approach to projects of this type, these involve such renowned Portuguese architects as Eduardo Souto Moura and Álvaro Siza Vieira. We are also the world’s third largest producer of wind energy. We deliver energy to over 11 million customers, which represents our firm commitment to helping develop all the regions where we are present. But we go further than this. Even in a region where we have no business interests, in the Kakuma refugee camp we have built the largest Portuguese social responsibility project in the world. We are also Portugal’s greatest corporate investor in culture and social innovation (close to EUR 20 million per year) through the various EDP foundations. On a daily basis we strive to become a global energy company and a leader in creating value, innovation and sustainability. Ten years ago we began to produce our sustainability report, now incorporated into this report, promoting transparency in our different areas of activity and encompassing the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact, which we endorsed in 2004. For the second year running we were recognised as the world’s top-ranking company in the electricity sector in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which distinguishes the companies with the best performance in issues such as transparency, risk management, biodiversity and human development. Because the future is not built without innovation, our group invests EUR 65 million per year in research and development. We anticipated the deep-offshore wind energy market with the world’s first wind platform, successfully installed in Portuguese waters. We have invested in new smart-energy grids, putting in place the first smart cities, which are recognised by the EU as a benchmark in Europe. We have also invested in the electric car as the essential vehicle in the transition to a low-carbon economy. 4 It was this balanced profile, active in many geographic regions and endowed with a vision, that attracted China Three Gorges (CTG), the largest Chinese renewable energy operator, through the greatest ever privatisation operation in Portugal. This process was an unquestionable landmark in terms of transparency and competitiveness. The new partner will guarantee access to competitive financing, contributing to the company’s financial soundness and allowing the platforms developed in recent years to continue to grow, while also creating new opportunities in the Asian market. We are ready to continue to be a world leader in the energy sector 2012 will certainly be one of the most complex years for the company, but we are confident that we have already laid the grounds for managing the current economic situation and the energy market as well as possible. Our portfolio is essentially based on regulated or long-term contract assets (c. 85%). Our generation portfolio, 63% of which does not emit greenhouse gases, has an average residual working life of over 24 years. We have 2,600 MW under construction which will start to generate significant revenue in 2012. As a result of the entry of CTG we are structurally funded until 2015, with a liquidity position of EUR 8.1 billion at the end of December 2011 if we take into account the EUR 4 billion under the strategic partnership. We have an investment programme that matches the new market reality and an ambitious training programme for the people in our team of exceptional quality in the different markets. As to the regulatory challenges in the various geographic areas, we will maintain a proactive approach in identifying problems and offering credible solutions that are properly grounded and adjusted to the different realities. Our delivery capacity is also demonstrated by our successive execution of a sustained policy of dividend growth, established in 2006, which forecast an increase in dividend per share of 85% up to 2011. Hence the proposal to offer our shareholders at a General Meeting will be EUR 0.185 per share, an increase of 8.8% against 2010. We would like to extend a word of thanks to the shareholders, customers, suppliers, business partners, government bodies, regulatory bodies and corporate bodies (in particular the General and Supervisory Board), for the support and confidence they have placed in the whole team over the year. Without people, the performance and unique positioning that EDP has achieved in recent years would not have been possible. Their dedication and commitment, manifested in the best ever results of the 2011 internal satisfaction survey, were crucial for this success. For all this, a special word goes to the over 12,000 employees of 29 nationalities, working on four continents and 13 countries, who make up EDP. In 2012, even more effort and integration will be required. We count on the support of everyone to pursue this path to success and thus contribute to a more open, competitive and responsible Portugal. It is our wish to carry on charting the future course of events.

Since 2005, EDP recorded a compound anual growth rate of EBITDA of 11%/year, sustained by the two major growth platforms of the 31 strategic framework edp way potential, it should be emphasized the roll-out of the HR module across some of the main business units. On the ShareCom Assuming its role as the integrating instrument for the five crosscomponent, it should be pointed out the preparation of the Iberian company and transformational projects of the EDP Group, the ‘EDP Management Information System, the convergence of the contact Way’ pursued in 2011 the consolidation of a group culture and the centre model for the Iberian Peninsula and also the integration of the reinforcement of the capability to execute the strategic options commercial support services in Spain. previously created by EDP. Throughout 2011, the unity among these projects and their corporate vision was greatly reinforced, having Opex: this project, focused on the optimization of the EDP costs also been achieved communication and change management base achieved savings of €159M in the previous year, two years synergies, highlighting the EDPWay Day, which mobilized more than before the target (€160M in 2012). In these circumstances, during 1,000 participants. 2011, priority was given to the internal launch of the third vague of this project in the context of the preparation of the new business plan. edpway Transversal to EDP culture, the company integrates sustainability in all its activities, keeping five major guidelines until 2012: 1} Deepening of Sustainability and Environmental Management in the management and control systems of the Group; 2} Identification of best practices and promotion of internal culture execution and external partnerships; 3} Reinforcement of skills related to the management of environmental risk and responsibility; 4} Development of a company-wide culture of excellence in sustainability performance; 5} Widening to the several stakeholders of the Group the application of tools that allow the gathering of expectations and valuation of the Group’s performance. These guidelines are met through an annual Environment and Sustainability Operational Plan and are framed by the base model of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. Sustainability management occurs at diferent levels of the organisation, from strategy to operation. For further information about the Group’s sustainability Sou+EDP: this project, focused on the human capital, organisation, refer to Corporate Governance, EDP Functional encompasses a set of initiatives on 3 axes: corporate attractivity, Structure, or at www.edp.pt> sustainability. internal mobility and communication and mobilization. Corporate attractivity of the EDP Group increased due to a series of activities undertaken at universities and job fairs, and also to the recruiting programs that were launched in the meanwhile, such as OnTop and Talent City. Regarding Internal Mobility, it should be highlighted the creation of a mobility dynamic through the preparation and publication of the applicable procedures. Lean: the Lean approach was gradually consolidated and extended across the EDP Group throughout 2011, having reached a total of 11 business units. At the same time, the Lean project management was particularly focused on developing an action plan aiming at the sustainability of this approach within the Group, having conducting for this purpose a diagnosis based on a survey directed to the main stakeholders in the project. It should be also emphasized the development of a training offer at distinct levels within the Group, including both the EDP University and the general training catalogue. EDPro: this project, focused on an effective management of the Group’s key processes, concluded in 2011 the first annual process improvement planning cycle, a fundamental instrument for mobilizing and coordinating all main participants in process management within the Group. Still during 2011, it was conducted a revision of the operating model for the Business Process Management IT support tool. It should also be pointed out that American Project and Quality Center, an US-based organisation working with over 700 of the Fortune 1000 companies, selected EDP as ‘best practice partner’ for its ‘Building strong process management capabilities’ project. SharEDP: During 2011, it should be highlighted the completion of the projects which provided the harmonization of procedures and practices at Iberian level concerning treasury management and suppliers invoicing with automatic data capture, among others.

Under construction √ Under licensing process 36 main events of the electric generation activity in Portugal In Portugal, EDP Group is present in the electricity generation activity under Ordinary and Special Regime through EDP Produção, and under special regime through EDP Produção Bioeléctrica, Soporgen, Energin, Fisigen and Pebble Hydro By the end of the year, the total installed capacity was 10,056 MW, of which 5,015 MW (49.9%) in hydroelectric plants and 5,040 MW in thermoelectric power plants. 2011 was characterized by inflows to the system below average, with an hydrological index of 0.92, quite lower than the 1.31 registered in 2010. The Hydroelectric Ordinary regime generation was 10,485 GWh, 27% lower than the record generation in 2010 (14,376 GWh), as a consequence of lower hidraulicity. At the end of the year, the storage reservoirs level was about 46% of their maximum capacity (52% in 2010). On the other hand, although the thermoelectric Ordinary Regime generation grew 8.4%, reaching 10,944 GWh, it was not enough to offset the loss in hydro generation. The Special Regime generation dropped about 5% to 1,545 GWh, due to the lower hidraulicity. The power requested in the mainland network was 9,192 MW, about 211 MW below the maximum occurred in 2010. Regarding EDP Produção hydroelectric generation portfolio capacity, it is worth mentioning the conclusion of construction works and assembly of Picote (246 MW) and Bemposta (191 MW) repowerings. In the last quarter took place the start of operation tests and began the respective trial periods. As planned, the construction works continued in the repowering of Alqueva (256 MW), entry into service scheduled to 2012, hydroelectric plants of Baixo Sabor (171 MW) and Ribeiradio/Ermida (77 MW) with conclusion scheduled for 2014 and Venda Nova III (740 MW) until 2015. In the beginning of the year were launched the constructions of Salamonde II (207 MW) and Foz-Tua (259 MW), which equipment supplies were already awarded. In the same context, hydroelectric plant of Fridão (238 MW) is in the final phase of the licensing process. The works in the power plant are scheduled to be launched in mid 2012. On the thermal portfolio, during 2011 were achieved the main efforts to the decommissioning of Barreiro power plant and the corresponding Environmental Requalification which shall be completed in March 2012. In what concerns the power plants’ certification, in addition to the maintenance of the registration in the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), it is important to highlight the “multisite” registration of more hydroelectric facilities: Caniçada, Salamonde, Cascata do Ave (Guilhofrei, Ermal, Ponte da Esperança e Senhora do Porto), Carrapatelo, Torrão, Crestuma-Lever, Castelo do Bode, Bouçã, Cabril and Santa Luzia. Finally, we emphasize the assignment by the Direcção-Geral de Energia e Geologia (DGEG) of the investment incentive to Alqueva, Ribatejo ad Lares power plants, from 1st January 2011 to 1st June 2017 in the first two and until 1st December 2020 in Lares. 37 performance Generation in Iberia Portugal GENERATION PORTFOLIO (MW) UniT 2011 2010 2009 2008 9,974 9,943 10,380 Installed Capacity in Portugal * MW 14,819 14,198 13,304 12,262 9,091 2,020 1,989 1,989 EDP's Installed Capacity * MW 10,380 9,943 9,974 9,091 2,000 2,039 2,039 2,039 EDP's market share * % 70 70 75 74 1,176 1,180 1,180 1,180 1,180 Source: REN Technical data 4,735 4,735 4,735 5,172 Number of Generating Groups* # 192 190 190 186 Ordinary Regime Generation # 116 114 116 114 2008 2009 2010 2011 Hydroelectric power plants # 95 93 93 93 Command Centre # 1 1 1 1 Generating power plants # 3 3 3 3 Hydro CCGT Power plants # 37 35 35 35 Coal Others Thermoelectric power plants # 21 21 23 21 Coal # 4 4 4 4 CCGT # 5 5 5 3 Fuel oil # 10 10 12 12 Gasoil # 2 2 2 2 Special Regime Generation # 76 76 74 72 ORDINARY REGIME GENERATION Mini-Hydroelectric power plants # 67 67 67 67 AVAILABILITY (%) Biomass # 4 4 4 2 Cogeneration # 5 5 3 3 93.4 96.6 93.3 97.5 Installed Capacity at 31 December* Ordinary Regime Installed Capacity MW 10,056 9,619 9,675 8,812 93.2 92.8 92.4 96.8 Hydroelectric power plants MW 5,015 4,578 4,578 4,578 Thermoelectric power plants MW 5,040 5,040 5,096 4,234 Coal MW 1,180 1,180 1,180 1,180 CCGT MW 2,039 2,039 2,039 1,176 Fuel oil MW 1,657 1,657 1,713 1,713 2008 2009 2010 201 Gasoil MW 165 165 165 165 Hydroelectric Thermoelectric Special Regime Installed Capacity MW 324 324 299 279 Hydroelectric power plants MW 157 157 157 157 Biomass MW 32 32 32 11 Cogeneration MW 136 136 111 111 Total Capacity MW 10,380 9,943 9,974 9,091 SPECIAL REGIME GENERATION AVAILABILITY (%) Net Generation* Ordinary Regime Generation GWh 21,429 24,468 23,514 21,642 Hydroelectric power plants GWh 10,485 14,376 7,642 6,435 94.8 95.7 95.5 95.6 93.4 90.2 95.1 Thermoelectric power plants GWh 10,944 10,092 15,872 15,207 93.3 Coal GWh 6,879 4,889 8,869 6,926 94.9 90.9 82.7 83.2 CCGT GWh 4,072 5,156 6,696 7,481 Fuel oil GWh -6 46 307 801 Gasoil GWh 0 1 0 0 Special Regime Generation GWh 1,545 1,625 1,222 869 Mini-Hydroelectric power plants GWh 439 622 368 170 2008 2009 2010 201 Biomass GWh 198 203 129 49 Cogeneration GWh 907 800 725 650 Cogeneration Mini-Hydro Biomass Total Generation GWh 22,974 26,093 24,736 22,511 Energy Balance Hydrological index # 0.92 1.31 0.77 0.56 NET GENERATION (GWh) EDP Group power plants Hydroelectric output GWh 10,485 14,376 7,642 6,435 26,093 24,736 Thermoelectric output GWh 10,944 10,092 15,872 15,207 22,551 11,095 22,974 16,726 Mini-hydroelectric output GWh 439 622 368 170 15,906 12,050 Wind power output (ENERNOVA) GWh 1,391 1,472 1,273 1,026 Biomass output GWh 198 203 129 49 14,998 Cogeneration output GWh 907 800 725 650 10,924 EDP Group Net generation GWh 24,364 27,565 26,009 23,537 6,604 8,010 Direct sales to industrial costumers GWh 0 0 0 0 Output to grid (EDP Group) GWh 24,364 27,565 26,009 23,537 2008 2009 2010 2011 Other generators with PPA GWh 8,814 7,701 8,088 8,596 Other generators SRG GWh 15,256 14,821 11,927 9,670 Hydroelectric generation Thermoelectric generation Importer/(Exporter) balance GWh 2,813 2,623 4,777 9,431 Pumped hydroelectric storage GWh -737 -512 -929 -639 Consumption Related to output GWh 50,509 52,198 49,872 50,595 Synchronous compensation GWh -1 -0 -1 -0 Own consumption in generation GWh -6 -5 -5 -5 ENERGY BALANCE 2011 (TWh) Energy Delivered to Distribution GWh 50,502 52,193 49,866 50,590 * Excludes wind 50.6 49.9 52.2 2.6 50.5 2.8 9.4 4.8 22.0 23.3 79.1 17.6 26.0 27.6 23.5 24.4 2008 2009 2010 2011 EDP Group output Importation Other generators 38 1 2 3 4 1.

By the end of 2011, the total installed capacity was 3,855 MW of which 426 MW (11%) from hydroelectric plants and 3,314 (89%) from thermoelectric power plants. The total availability of coal plants was 97.3%, which confirms the excellent operation of the equipment, even more considering the extraordinary operating flexibility of these groups due to the complementary nature of coal over gas. The availability of CCGT’s was 98.7%. The combined cycle also had a very flexible operation, with frequent stops, attending to the requirements of the market. In 2011 total generation decreased by 9% vs. 2010, due to both a lower hidraulicity and to lower thermal output. Nevertheless, the second half of 2011 saw the recovery of coal output (+26% vs. 2010) related to the decrease of CO2 price which reached a minimum by December at 6.94€/ton. The new capacity payment model has been applied since 2008, replacing the previous capacity guarantee model. There are two types of incentives: to investment (regulated in Order ITC 2794/2007) and to availability (regulated in Order ITC 3124/2011). Royal Decree 134/2010 establishes a restriction procedure to guarantee the operation of power plants using domestic coal. This RD is transient (2011 2014). The Group 3 of HC power plant in Soto de Ribera, takes part in this procedure. 41 performance Generation in Iberia Spain GENERATION PORTFOLIO (MW) UniT 2011 2010 2009 2008 3,875 3,886 288 299 Installed Capacity in Spain * MW 79,843 77,634 75,010 75,004 3,401 3,427 282 308 1,698 1,698 EDP's Installed Capacity * MW 3,886 3,875 3,427 3,401 1,229 1,229 EDP's market share * % 4.9 5.0 4.6 4.5 1,460 1,460 1,460 1,460 Number of Generating Groups* # 37 38 40 38 429 429 429 0 429 Ordinary Regime Generation # 21 21 20 20 2008 2009 2010 2011 Hydroelectric power plants** # 12 12 12 12 Thermoelectric power plants # 9 9 8 8 Coal # 4 4 4 4 Hydro Coal CCGT # 4 4 3 3 CCGT Others Nuclear # 1 1 1 1 Special Regime Generation # 16 17 20 18 Hydroelectric power plants** # 0 1 1 1 Thermoelectric power plants # 16 16 19 17 ORDINARY REGIME GENERATION Biomass # 1 1 2 2 AVAILABILITY (%) Cogeneration # 9 9 11 9 Waste # 6 6 6 6 98.7 Installed Capacity at 31 December* 96.7 94.8 Ordinary Regime Installed Capacity MW 3,740 3,740 3,272 3,271 92.3 97.3 Hydroelectric power plants** MW 426 426 426 426 Thermoelectric power plants MW 3,314 3,314 2,846 2,845 92.3 91.4 Coal MW 1,460 1,460 1,460 1,460 88.9 CCGT MW 1,698 1,698 1,229 1,229 Nuclear MW 156 156 156 156 2008 2009 2010 2011 Special Regime Installed Capacity MW 146 135 155 130 Hydroelectric power plants** MW 3 3 3 3 Coal CCGT Thermoelectric power plants MW 143 132 152 127 Biomass MW 3 3 7 7 Cogeneration MW 57 46 63 38 SPECIAL REGIME GENERATION Waste MW 83 83 82 82 AVAILABILITY (%) Total Capacity MW 3,886 3,875 3,427 3,401 Net Generation* 93.4 91.0 89.8 Ordinary Regime Generation GWh 9,904 10,942 11,346 12,416 88.3 Hydroelectric power plants** GWh 584 1,038 877 812 91.0 Thermoelectric power plants GWh 9,320 9,904 10,469 11,604 87.6 87.0 Coal GWh 5,354 4,244 5,865 6,575 83.6 CCGT GWh 2,754 4,470 3,491 3,831 Nuclear GWh 1,212 1,190 1,113 1,198 Special Regime Generation GWh 841 916 896 700 2008 2009 2010 2011 Hydroelectric power plants** GWh 2 7 2 2 Thermoelectric power plants GWh 843 909 894 698 Cogeneration Waste Biomass GWh 0 0 6 6 Cogeneration GWh 300 356 369 192 Waste GWh 541 553 519 500 Total Generation GWh 10,747 11,858 12,242 13,117 energy balance NET GENERATION (GWh) Hydrological index # 0.83 1.34 0.81 0.66 EDP Group power plants 13,117 12,242 11,858 Hydroelectric output GWh 584 1,038 877 812 2,711 2,886 10,747 Thermoelectric output GWh 5,354 4,244 5,865 6,575 3,144 6,575 2,639 Nuclear output GWh 1,212 1,190 1,113 1,198 5,865 CCGT output GWh 2,754 4,470 3,491 3,831 4,244 5,354 Mini-hydroelectric output GWh 2 7 2 2 Wind power output (ENERNOVA) GWh 4,584 4,355 3,275 2,632 4,470 3,831 3,491 Biomass output GWh 0 0 6 6 2,754 Cogeneration output GWh 300 356 369 192 0 Waste output GWh 541 553 519 500 2008 2009 2010 2011 EDP Group Net Generation GWh 15,331 16,214 15,517 15,749 Other generators ORG GWh 169,621 178,227 181,116 207,924 Other generators SRG GWh 86,925 85,631 74,020 62,772 CCGT Others Coal Importer/(Exporter) balance GWh -6,091 -8,333 -8,106 -11,040 Pumped hydroelectric storage GWh -3,215 -4,458 -3,763 -3,731 Consumption Related to output GWh 262,571 267,281 258,784 271,673 ENERGY BALANCE 2011 (TWh) Own consumption in generation GWh -7,247 -6,673 -7,081 -8,338 Own consumption in transmission grid GWh 0 0 0 0 Losses GWh -2,771 -2,890 -3,090 -3,440 260 249 258 253 Energy Delivered to Distribution GWh 252,552 257,718 248,613 259,896 255 250 241 243 * Excludes wind power ** Includes mini-hydro from EDP Renováveis -11 -8 -8 -6 2008 2009 2010 2011 EDP Group output Exportation Other generators 42 1 2 3 1.

The average load factor, in 2011, was 25% in Europe, 33% in the U.S. and 35% in Brazil. Operational excellence and prime location of EDPR’s wind farms allowed the reach of superior net capacity factors comparing to the industry (as the case for Spain with +146 b.p.s). EDPR EUROPE (EDPR EU) EDPR EU has been a top company in wind energy additions over the last few years, with a total wind energy capacity installed of 3,977 MW and a pipeline in various stages of development of 9.1 GW, including 160 MW under construction. After the entry into operation of 87 MW in ENEOP2’s wind farms, 2011 installed capacity in Portugal increased to 939. In Spain, capacity installed was 2,201 MW after an increase of 151 MW versus prior year. At the end of 2011, there were 58 MW under construction. In 2011, installed capacity reached 306 MW in France, after an increase in the year of 22 MW, while in Belgium it remained at 57 MW. Poland saw a significant increase in capacity, as the 70 MW Korsze wind farm entered into operation in 2011. Year end installed capacity in Poland amounted to 190 MW. In Romania, installed capacity increased to 285 MW as a result of the completion of the Cernavoda project (138 MW), and two new projects for a total increase of 195 MW. 2011 was an important year for EDPR UK. In June 2011 EDPR’s interest in offshore projects increased from 1,500 MW to 2,500 MW through the establishment of a joint venture with Repsol Nuevas Energias. As of December 2011, EDPR EU has the first MW under construction in Italy via the Villa Castelli (20 MW) wind farm. EDPR NORTH AMERICA (EDPR NA) The activity in the U.S. is operated by the North American platform EDPR NA. At the end of 2011, EDPR NA owned 29 wind farms in operation located in 11 different states, summing a total capacity of 3,422 MW, after the installation of new 198 MW during the year. EDPR NA continued its development efforts in Canada, where it installed its first met towers in Ontario, opened a new office in Toronto, and established new prospects in Ontario and British Columbia. By the end of 2011, EDPR NA held a pipeline of 10.3 GW, including 215 MW already under construction.

This operation, based essentially on efficiency improvements and quality of services in the distribution grids, distributed about 56TWh of energy in 2011. Portugal In Portugal, EDP Distribuição has the concession of the National Distribution Grid in Medium and High Voltage Electricity and the concession of all the 278 municipal Distribution Grids in Low voltage, on the mainland. It has 223 thousand km of network and 46.5TWh of electricity distributed in 2011 to a total of 6.1 million costumers. The investment and maintenance policies followed by EDP Distribuição in the last years continue to have excellent results, ensuring the satisfaction of demand in adequate technical conditions and ever-improving technical service quality indicators. The ICEIT (Interruption Time Equivalent to the Installed Capacity) indicator registered in 2011 75 minutes, significantly lower than the previous years. The program of regional imbalances reduction (in terms of technical service quality) and the higher investment in the network automation had a strong contribution to the ICEIT reduction. During 2011 there were significant developments in InovGrid project. This project was created based on the need to modernize the electricity distribution network and to enhance the achievement of the European targets to energy efficiency and renewable energy integration. The InovGrid project aims to provide higher intelligence to the distribution network, allowing to control and automate the energy management which is extremely important considering the significant increase in generation distributed. It improves the service quality and the distribution security. It is also relevant to the customer relationship, providing more information and new products and services with lower operating costs. InovGrid project was launched in 2007 by EDP Distribuição and it reached a significant landmark in 2011 with more than 32 thousand EDP Box assembled, of which 30 thousand in InovCity, Évora. In May 2011, InovGrid was selected by the European Comission and the Eurelectric as an European case study to development of methodology and tool to assess smart grids’ costs and benefits. Micro-generation in low voltage remains high, with 8,136 new micro-generators with an installed capacity of 29 MW. By the end of the year were connected 17,327 installations like those, which correspond to a capacity of 61.6 MW. Xxx new Special Regime Generators were also connected to the distribution grid, with xxx MVA of capacity, amounting xx SRG with xxx MVA. In both cases, there is a predominance of photovoltaic and wind technologies. Spain In Spain, HC Energía conducts the electricity distribution business in 5 Autonomous Communities with a total of 22,652 km of network and 9.5 TWh of distributed energy, with a 2% growth vs. 2010. The investments carried out in recent years, as well as the implemented procedures, allowed a decrease of the interruption of supply to less than an hour in Asturias, the main distribution area, which concentrates more than 93% of HC costumers.

In Spain is present in the Last Resort Market by HC CUR and in the liberalized market through HC Energía, Naturgás energía and HC CIDE Energía, acting in competition with other Iberian players. Portugal During 2011, the overall number of customers in the Regulated Market fell by 0.3%, as a result of the outflow of nearly 35 thousand customers to the free market, partly offset by the inflow of 15 thousand new customers. Electricity sales in the regulated market decreased by about 20% vs. 2010, particularly in higher voltage levels (VHV, HV and MV), with a global reduction above 51%. This huge reduction reflects the effect of the referred migration of customers to the liberalised market as a consequence of the regulated tariff extinction for those voltage levels. In line with previous year, 2011 continued to be a year of consolidation for the liberalised market, after a new build-up in 2009, especially in the B2B segment. In opposition, the tariff context in B2C segment did not allow its development. Despite the lower growth of the liberalised market and higher competition, EDP Comercial kept a leadership position, through a strong partnership with the costumers. At the end of the year, EDP Comercial achieved a market share of 42% in energy supplied and, providing 77% of the facilities in the liberalised market. Such a performance was an outcome of the sustained action of the company business units. The B2B segment, following the path to the market relaunching since 2009, was once more the segment with more competitive dynamics in 2011, as it received new players and new costumers in the market. The proposal of value adjusted to the costumers’ needs resulted in a sales volume of around 7.9 TWh during the year and a costumer portfolio of 14,871 facilities at the end of the year. In the B2C segment, EDP Comercial was the choice of approximately 267 thousand domestic costumers and small business (80% of the Liberalised Market), corresponding to 1,2 TWh of sales volume. Spain EDP Group reached approximately 699 thousand costumers in the liberalised market which means an increase of 7.4% comparing with 2010. The B2B segment recorded 18,186 GWh of energy sold, 0,3% higher than the previous year. The strategy in B2C segment has been focused on the portfolios analysis, to gain profitable costumers through cost channels and get their fidelity with a dual offer. Due to the decrease of the demand in Spain and the competition in electricity market, the margins this year in B2B and B2C were smaller than in 2010. 53 performance Supply in iberia ENERGY SUPPLY IN PORTUGAL (TWH) PORTUGAL UniT 2011 2010 2009 2008 46.5 46.1 47.8 46.5 LAST RESORT MARKET 1.2 8.5 17.2 21.9 Number of costumers # 5,771,900 5,791,683 5,842,797 5,890,427 Very high voltage # 12 21 26 53 High voltage # 86 177 193 234 Medium voltage # 8,339 12,803 17,681 22,913 45.3 37.6 30.6 24.6 Special low voltage # 17,473 23,985 28,246 32,170 Low voltage # 5,692,425 5,702,584 5,746,352 5,785,797 Street lighting # 53,565 52,113 50,299 49,260 2008 2009 2010 2011 Electricity sales GWh 24,579 30,581 37,626 45,289 Regulated Free Very high voltage GWh 266 1,012 1,330 1,667 High voltage GWh 1,008 2,095 3,723 6,358 Medium voltage GWh 2,594 4,795 9,128 14,052 Special low voltage GWh 1,615 2,498 3,163 3,340 Low voltage GWh 17,551 18,653 18,740 18,364 MARKET SHARE LIBERALISED Street lighting GWh 1,544 1,528 1,542 1,509 MARKET IN PORTUGAL(%) LIBERALISED MARKET IN portugal Number of costumers # 365,776 357,363 277,008 197,752 80.3 EDP Comercial # 281,609 313,608 259,698 197,151 64.9 B2B # 14,871 9,082 7,535 9 51.0 41.6 B2C # 266,738 304,526 252,163 197,142 Other suppliers # 84,167 43,755 17,310 601 Electricity sales GWh 21,929 17,248 8,520 1,180 2008 2009 2010 2011 EDP Comercial GWh 9,132 8,794 5,529 947 B2B GWh 7,940 7,510 4,565 271 B2C GWh 1,191 1,284 963 676 Other suppliers GWh 12,797 8,453 2,992 233 MARKET SHARE LIBERALIZED Spain MARKET IN SPAIN (%)* REGULATED / LAST RESORT MARKET Number of costumers # 316,728 359,145 422,252 549,398 11.2 11.4 11.4 High voltage # 0 0 0 4 Medium voltage # 0 0 0 77 Low voltage # 316,728 359,145 422,252 549,317 11.0 Electricity sales GWh 833 1,099 3,133 7,240 High voltage GWh 0 0 1,559 5,064 2008 2009 2010 2011 Medium voltage GWh 0 0 11 133 Low voltage GWh 833 1,099 1,563 2,043 * margin calculation based on generation before distribution and transport losses LIBERALISED MARKET IN SPAIN Number of costumers # 7,586,894 5,248,118 3,028,182 2,153,754 HC Energía + NG Energía # 698,815 650,860 530,778 117,175 B2B # 8,192 7,871 4,848 3,400 B2C # 690,623 642,989 525,930 113,775 EDP COSTUMERS IN IBERIA (MILLIONS) Other suppliers # 6,888,079 4,597,258 2,497,404 2,036,579 Electricity sales 6.09 6.10 6.11 6.05 HC Energía + NG Energía GWh 20,529 20,342 16,234 12,507 B2B GWh 18,186 18,124 12,833 9,941 B2C GWh 2,343 2,218 3,402 2,566 0.67 0.95 1.01 1.02 2008 2009 2010 2011 Portugal Spain 54 1 2 3 1.

It is present in Portugal through Portgás (acting under the brand name of EDP Gás Distribuição and EDP Gás Serviço Universal), EDP Gás.Com and EDP Comercial (licensed trader to operate in the liberalized market) and a minority stake in Setgás. In Spain it is present in this market through Naturgas Energía. During 2011, EDP Gas Group kept increasing in points of supply (+2.,9%) and gas distributed (+5.9%), nevertheless, it had a decrease in the number of costumers (-0.9%) and supplied gas (-5.9%). The supply activity, like 2010, had an unfavourable economic year, namely regarding the competitiveness of gas from long term contracts, that represents the majority of gas portfolios in Europe and, particularly, in Iberia. Portugal In 2011, the Distribution activity had an increase of more than 25,500 points of supply (+10.4% vs. 2010), meeting the targeted network densification. The gas distributed also increased in 2011 (4.3%), reaching 7.1 TWh. In the Liberalised market, EDP rose in costumers (+1.355) and in supplied gas (-0.2%). Despite the total liberalisation of the Supply activity since January 2010, EDP Gás Serviço Universal (regulated company) had an increase in the number of costumers (+25.332 clients), which was not accompanied by the supplied gas, falling 29.3% due to the exit of most of the costumers with consumptions above 10.000 m3. Spain In the Transport activity stands the conclusion of the transport pipeline Siero-Villaviciosa and the inauguration of Serinyà-Figueres, and the request of administrative authotizations for the transport pipeline Moratalla Mula. Regarding Murcia region, were presented to the system’s technical management and the Government new proposals of secondary transport pipelines: Yecla-Jumilla, Lorca-Puerto Lumbreras-Águilas, Ramal a Cieza and Ramal a Mazarrón.Finally, Naturgas Energía Transporte bought 50% of the Navarra gas structures, from Iberdrola, to own 100% of those structures. In the Distribution activity, the gas distributed increased 6.1% compared with 2010 and the points of supply increased about 10.000, due to the network densification effort and the expansion investments, like La Puebla Vieja in Laredo, Solórzano, in Cantabria, Castropol, in Asturias, Berrobi in Guipúzcoa, Arrankudiaga in Vizcaya and Santillana del Mar in Cantabria. Highlight to the incorporation of Gas Energía Distribución Cantabria, S.A.U. in Naturgas Energía Distribución, S.A.U. As in 2010, 2011 was another year of pressure on Iberian suppliers to sell their gas due to the take or pay long term contracts. As a result, the competition became harder and the prices degraded. That led to a 4.4% reduction of the number of costumers the supplied gas of 5.2%. To face that Naturgas energía made gas trading and exchange operations to avoid penalties and offered a Dual Contract (Gas and Electricity) to costumers out of the ordinary action zone. 57 performance Gas business in Iberia NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS (THOUSANDS) IBERIA UniT 2011 2010 2009 2008 1,055 1,069 1,059 829 833 824 788 Number of costumers (thousands) # 1,059,436 1,069,127 1,054,806 829,282 628 Regulated # 270,053 244,721 221,266 200,988 Last Resort # 110,773 140,766 214,059 122,000 201 221 245 272 Liberalised # 678,610 683,640 619,481 506,294 2008 2009 2010 2011 Points of Supply Distribution # 1,264,717 1,229,220 1,185,225 891,020 Portugal Spain Grid Length Kms 14,240 13,764 12,573 9,048 Transportation Grid Kms 425 417 362 309 Distribution Grid Kms 13,815 13,347 12,211 8,739 Gas Volume (millions) GRID LENGTH (Kms) Distributed m3 4.8 4.5 2.1 2.3 Supplied m3 3.1 3.3 2.1 2.1 Gas Volume 13,764 14,240 Distributed TWh 55.6 52.5 25.1 26.6 12,573 9,938 10,115 Supplied TWh 36.4 38.7 24.6 28.9 9,048 9,065 Regulated TWh 1.4 2.0 2.3 4.2 5,828 Last Resort TWh 0.5 0.9 1.2 n/a 3,827 0 4,125 3,220 3,508 Liberalised TWh 34.5 35.9 21.1 24.7 0 Number of Employees # 537 519 537 422 2008 2009 2010 2011 PORTUGAL Portugal Spain Number of costumers (thousands) # 271,576 245,335 221,356 200,988 Regulated # 270,053 244,721 221,266 200,988 Last Resort # 0 0 0 0,0 GAS IN PORTUGAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTED Liberalised # 1,523 614 90 0 AND POINTS OF SUPPLY Points of Supply Distribution # 270,866 245,347 221,388 200,988 271 245 Grid Length Kms 4,125 3,827 3,508 3,220 201 221 Transportation Grid Kms 0 0 0 0 Distribution Grid Kms 4,125 3,827 3,508 3,220 7.1 6.1 6.8 Gas Volume (millions) 6.0 Distributed m3 0.6 0.6 0.5 0.5 Supplied m3 0.7 0.8 0.3 0.2 2008 2009 2010 2011 Gas Volume Energy Distributed (TWh) Distributed TWh 7.1 6.8 6.1 6.0 Points of Supply (thousands) Supplied TWh 8.2 8.9 3.3 2.7 Regulated TWh 1.4 2.0 2.3 2.7 Last Resort TWh 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Liberalised TWh 6.8 7.0 1.0 0.0 Number of Employees # 103 102 101 111 GAS SPAIN ENERGY DISTRIBUTED AND POINTS OF SUPPLY spain 964 984 994 Number of costumers (thousands) # 787,860 823,792 833,450 628,294 690 Regulated # 0 0 0 0 45.6 48.4 Last Resort # 110,773 140,766 214,059 122,000 Liberalised # 677,087 683,026 619,391 506,294 20.7 19.0 Points of Supply 2008 2009 2010 2011 Distribution # 993,851 983,873 963,837 690,032 Grid Length Kms 10,115 9,938 9,065 5,828 Energy Distributed (TWh) Transportation Grid Kms 425 417 362 309 Points of supply (thousands) Distribution Grid Kms 9,690 9,521 8,703 5,519 Gas Volume (millions) Distributed m3 4.2 3.9 1.6 1.8 Supplied m3 2.4 2.6 1.8 2.1 GAS SPAIN ENERGY SUPPLIED (TWh) Gas Volume Distributed TWh 48.4 45.6 19.0 20.7 Supplied TWh 28.3 29.8 21.3 26.3 38.7 36.4 Regulated TWh 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.5 28.9 29.8 28.3 24.6 Last Resort TWh 0.5 0.9 1.2 n/a 26.3 21.3 Liberalised TWh 27.7 28.9 20.1 24.7 Number of Employees # 434 417 436 311 2.7 3.3 8.9 0 8.2 2008 2009 2010 2011 * In 2008 includes last resource Portugal Spain 58 1 2 1.

The main aim is the study and development in the oceans area of Portugal. of an Open Secondary Substation Node, i.e. equipment intended for transformer stations which constitutes an open platform that is interoperable, extensible and modular, for integration in a smart and secure distribution grid. INOVCITY Brasil The municipality of Aparecida do Norte, Brazil, will be the first city equipped with a smart energy grid in the state of São Paulo, thanks to this project. Inspired on the city of Évora, where the 1st pilot of EDP in Portugal is ongoing, the project will entail an investment of BRL 10 million and it will test the feasibility of metering technology and energy efficiency initiatives. Approximately 15,000 electronic meters are undergoing installation, which will give the user continuous control of consumption and the distributor a rapid response to interruptions in electricity supply. This grid also permits the start-up of microgeneration studies, with renewable energy being produced by the consumers, and also to promote energy efficiency measures, particularly public and private lighting. ClimaGrid project Brazil This project, to be undertaken in partnership with the National Institute for Space Research of Brazil, aims to predict and ensure the rapid repair of occurrences in the grids due to extreme weather phenomena. Variables such as wind, rain, vegetation, lightning and temperature are now part of the georeferencing system of the Brazilian EDP Group distribution companies. project to detect and locate grid failures The aim is to develop specific measurement teams that enable the detection of HC Energía’s faults in underground networks, through the analysis of partial discharges. 66 3.5. advanced venture capital fund EDP VENTURES generation technology In 2011, the relationship with the two investments in funds of the Energy Related Cleantech (USA and UK) field were consolidated and a shareholding was acquired in Feedzai “Consultoria e Inovação “Mejora de disponibilidad de alternadores Tecnológica” (7.06%) which integrated the EDP Ventures portfolio. de plantas de cogeneración” Project co-creation This project is intended to diagnose problems not detected by An online collaborative platform launched in 2011 (www.cocreation.pt). vibration analysis, through the analysis of alternator currents in three It is a pioneering initiative of the EDP Group encouraging customers, HC Energía’s cogeneration power stations.

These awards aim to encourage competitiveness and the adoption of good corporate social responsibility practices among its suppliers, distinguishing the projects most closely aligned with the strategic objectives of the Group, in the following categories: ººCustomer Relations award ººSharing Good Practices award ººInnovation award ººCorporate Social Responsibility award ººExcellence award for supplier of the year 88 Promotion of good environmental practices in the supply chain EDP Produção, with the support of EDP Valor, defined the objective for Portugal in 2010 of encouraging the reduction of environmental impacts caused by the supply of the limestone required to operate the desulphurisation facility of the Sines thermal power station as well as the sale of gypsum as a by-product of the process. The compliance with this goal required the effective engagement of its service providers. The process began with the inclusion of environmental criteria in tenders to be submitted, as well as to encourage the search for optimised transport solutions. The challenge was accepted by the company Gyptec, which went on to win an Excellence award from the Portuguese Business Association for its “Practices of Environmental, Energy Efficiency and Energy Saving Excellence”. This recognition arose from the model adopted for the service delivery, in response to the criteria defined by EDP. “We believe that the implementation of this Good Practice, now publicly recognised, was made possible by the policy of internally adopting the good environmental practices conducted by EDP, and which, in this particular case, resulted in drawing up a contract specification for limestone supply and transport with a weighting of 20% for environmental gains that are obtained.” “Hence, we thank and congratulate EDP for encouraging environmental, economic and social sustainability in its supply chain, as these are values we share and which strengthen our partnership towards sustainable development.” The Management of Gyptec skills development to make commitments, such as not using illegal labour, having in the supply chain quality assurance systems and the commitment to implementing environmental protection policies.

Measuring impact on the community LBG method One of EDP’s sustainability commitments is to implement the LBG method in the management of the EDP projects’ social return. In Portugal, a system for collecting structured information according to the LBG methodology was implemented at the start of 2012. The Fundação EDP applied the SROI (Social Return on Investment) technique to the activities of the organisations that had been previous winners of the EDP Solidária Barragens programme: “Learning by doing”: A project implemented by APPACDM of Mirandela to support people with mental disabilities through learning and the development of motor skills through the introduction of new handicrafts-related activities. The calculated SROI was 22 cents for each one euro invested; “Mobility and Health”: A project developed by the Cerejais Parish and Social Centre (CSPC) to support the elderly through the provision of equipment that provides easier access to healthcare and physiotherapy services. The calculated SROI was EUR 1.47 for every one euro invested; “CSS Certification Arlampar”: A project conducted by Associação EcoGerminar in the area of regional development, training farmers so as to give them CSS certification (Fair and Sustainable Trade). The SROI calculation estimated for a period of five years was EUR 2.69 for every one euro invested. The investment value in 2011 was about EUR 21 million, representing 0.91% of EBIT, and the total amount leveraged by the projects undertaken was EUR 1.2 million.

Pursuant to number 1 of article 1 of CMVM Regulation 1/2010, regarding the governance of listed companies, EDP follows the recommendations included in the “Corporate Governance Code” (Código de Governo das Sociedades), approved by CMVM on January 2010, having decided not to follow a different set of recommendations on such matter. EDP follows the recommendations included in said “Corporate Governance Code” where applicable to it, except for Recommendations l.3.3 and l.6.1 of the referred Code, for the reasons expressed bellow. The following table lists the CMVM recommendations in the Corporate Governance Code and indicates whether they were fully adopted or not by EDP, as well as the section of this report that contains more detailed information on the adoption of each specific recommendation. For a wider reflexion on the recommendations included in EDP’s “Corporate Governance Code”, we suggest the consultation of “EDP’s Corporate Governance Manual” (Manual de Governo Societário da EDP), which is available to EDP shareholders and to the public at www.edp.pt.

I.3.3 Companies shall ensure proportionality between voting rights and Not adopted EDP considers that, pursuant to the “one share one 4.8 shareholder participation, preferably through a statutory provision ensuring vote” principle, adequate shareholders’ participation is one vote per share. The companies which do not meet the proportionality ensured, even though there might be limitations on the requirements are those which, in particular: i) have shares without voting rights; number of shares each shareholder may use to vote. ii) establish that, above a certain threshold, voting rights cast by one single The principle of proportionality between the number of shares held and the corresponding voting rights must be shareholder or shareholders related to him/her should not be accounted for. assessed in relative terms rather than in absolute terms. Especially relevant in this context is the fact that the limit above which votes are not considered, as established in number 3 of article 14 of EDP’s articles of association, was always defined and amended according to the express intention of EDP’s shareholders through general shareholders meetings resolutions, approved by qualified majorities, and in line with EDP’s specific interests: (i) the increase from 5% to 20% was approved by shareholders in the General Shareholders Meeting held on August 25, 2011, with the participation of 72.25% of the share capital, and the resolution was approved by a majority of 94.16% of the votes cast; (ii) the increase to the current limit of 25% was approved in the General Shareholders Meeting dated February 20, 2012, with the participation of 71.51% of the share capital and the resolution was approved by a majority of 89.65% of the votes cast. Thus, taking into consideration the degree of representation reached in said General Shareholders Meetings, the characteristics of EDP’s shareholding structure and the fact that such matter must be exclusively resolved on by the shareholders, EDP considers that the shareholders interests are adequately respected in general terms. 96 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE Recommendation Adoption Comments Description Status in the Report I.4 QUORUM AND DECISIONS I.4.1 Companies shall not establish a quorum for deliberation greater than that Adopted 4.10 laid down by law.

Financial risk: The Group’s financial risks are mainly managed by the Financial Department, which is responsible for the Group’s cash management at Iberian level, the debt portfolio and the risk of interest rate and foreign exchange through financial markets instruments. In Brazil, Energias do Brasil follows, under coordination, similar principles and methodologies. Liquidity risk: The liquidity risk warranted particular attention. EDP’s strong credit profile in this difficult context for Portugal is higher than the country’s one. There were bond issues, which were necessary for the habitual debt rollover and to finance the Group’s growth. The Net Debt/EBITDA ratio did not significantly change between December 2010 and December 2011, and EDP Group is aiming at improving this ratio in coming years. In what concerns liquidity, as of December 2011, total cash and credit lines amounted up to 4 billion Euros, divided between 1,7 billion Euros in cash and equivalent and 2,4 billion Euros in available credit lines. The liquidity risk has therefore been mitigated thanks to our debt management policy, the contracting of new financing and the availability of lines of credit obtained (underwritten) but not used. Thanks to the Group’s financial management policies, there is still a low market risk and a diversified counterparty risk involving highly credible financial entities. Furthermore, the recent shareholding change within the Group shall create opportunities for a decrease in debt ratios and an increase in liquidity levels. Liabilities resulting from the EDP Group Defined Benefit Pensions Fund and health care benefits in Portugal are fully covered by the Pension Fund assets and specific provisions included in the EDP balance sheet.

Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 1. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OF EDP GROUP The Group’s parent company, EDP – Energias de Portugal, S.A. (EDP, S.A.), was incorporated in 1976 as a result of the nationalisation and merger of the major Portuguese companies in the electricity sector operating in mainland Portugal. EDP S.A.'s head office is located in Lisbon at Praça Marquês de Pombal, 12. During 1994, as established by Decree-laws 7/91 and 131/94, the EDP Group (EDP Group or Group) was set up following the split of EDP, S.A., which led to a number of directly or indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries of EDP, S.A. The Group’s businesses are currently focused on the generation, distribution and supply of electricity and distribution and supply of gas. Although complementary, the Group also operates in related areas such as engineering, laboratory tests, vocational training, energy services and property management. The EDP Group operates essentially in the European (Portugal, Spain and France) and American (Brazil and the United States of America) energy sectors. Activity in the energy sector in Portugal Electricity The National Electricity System (SEN) basis of organization and operation, as well as the general basis applicable to the production, transportation, distribution and supply activities of electricity, and to the market organization, are established by the Decree-Law 29/2006 of 15 February. This DL was developed by the DL 172/2006 of 23 August. The DL 29/2006 was updated by DL 104/2010 of 29 September and by DL 78/2011 of 20 July, which transposes the principals of the European Parliament and Council’s Directive 2009/72/CE of 13 July which came to repeal the Directive 2003/54/CE. The National Electricity System (SEN) includes the activities of generation and supply of electricity under free competition conditions, subject to licensing, and the activities of transmission and distribution provided through the award of public service concessions. Transmission, distribution and supply of last resort activities are subject to regulation from Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços Energéticos – ERSE (Energy Sector Regulator), which is responsible for the preparation, issuance and enforcement of regulations and for establishing the tariffs and prices related to network usage – access tariffs – and electricity supply for clients in the regulated market electricity tariffs charged by the Supplier of Last Resort. For transmission, distribution and supply of last resort activities, the law establishes a remuneration right fixed by ERSE, under the tariff regulations, in order to economic and finance balance in terms of efficient management. Electricity transmission is ensured by the National Transportation Network (RNT) and is carried out under public service concessions, exclusively by REN Redes Energéticas Nacionais, SGPS, S.A., for a period of 50 years. Generation The generation of electricity covers generation under ordinary and special regimes. Under the ordinary regime, where EDP Group is represented by EDP Gestão da Produção, S.A., electricity is generated and sold under free market conditions, in organised markets or through bilateral agreements, being subject only to licensing. The special regime (PRE) allows producers to deliver electricity to the network, through bilateral agreements with the Supplier of Last Resort (CUR), being remunerated based on the principle of the costs avoided to the system, plus an environmental reward representing the benefits of using renewable energy resources. The PRE is subject to specific legislation, namely to promote the use of endogenous renewable resources, cogeneration or micro generation. The EDP Group is present in this segment through its subsidiaries EDP Gestão da Produção, Produção S.A. S A and EDP Renováveis Portugal, Portugal S.A., S A among others. others In January 2005, following the publication of Decree-Law 240/2004 of 27 December, the EDP Group signed the early termination of contracts for the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) related to the binding electricity production plants of the EDP Group. This Decree-Law established the creation of a compensation mechanism to maintain the contractual balance (CMEC) attributed to the bounded producers, which includes a significant portion of the EDP Group's generation activity in Portugal. According to this legislation, the effects of the termination agreements were suspended until the launch of the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL), effective as of 1 July 2007. On 16 February 2007 the Portuguese Government confirmed its decision to early terminate the PPAs and implement the CMEC mechanism and defined the rules to calculate the compensations due to the power generators for such early termination, which essentially consisted in an adjustment of the reference market price of electricity used to calculate the CMEC initial compensation amount. On 15 June 2007, EDP and REN agreed on the early termination of the PPAs, effective as of 1 July 2007. The new CMEC regulation sets the compensation due at 833,467 thousand Euros, which in accordance with the legislation can be subject to securitisation. In June 2007, Decree-Law 226-A/2007 of 31 May, which approves the new legal regime for using hydric resources under the terms of the new Water Law (Lei da Água), came into force. This Decree-Law extends the period on which the companies, owning the hydroelectric plants relating to the various dams, can operate the public hydric resources. The extension of the operating period, and the consequent extension of the useful life of the related hydraulic fixed assets, implied a payment by the holders of the hydroelectric plants of an amount of economic and financial compensation. On that basis, the Government (INAG), REN and EDP Gestão da Produção de Energia signed on 8 March 2008, several service concession arrangements for which EDP Gestão da Produção de Energia paid approximately 759 million Euros for the extension of the period to operate the public hydric domain for an additional average period of 26 years. Distribution Electricity distribution is carried out through the National Distribution Network (RND) and consists of a medium and high-tension network and a low-tension distribution network, exclusively under public service concessions. The distribution of electricity in medium and high-tension has been licensed to EDP Distribuição by the Portuguese Government for a period of 35 years, from 25 February 2009. In accordance with specific legislation (Decree-law 344-B/82), the right to distribute low-tension electricity in Portugal is attributed to the municipalities (local authorities). However, Service Concession Arrangements were celebrated generally with a 20 year term between each of mainland Portugal municipalities and EDP Distribuição with the possibility of the agreement being revoked with at least 1 year's prior notice and the payment of an indemnity to the concessionaire. These concessions are in return for payment of a rent to the respective municipalities. 164 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 Supply The Electricity supply market is open to competition, subject only to a licensing regime. Suppliers have the right of access to the national transmission and distribution networks upon payment of the access charges set by ERSE. The activity of free supply is developed by EDP Comercial, S.A. The activity of supply of last resort (CUR), including universal public service obligations, is guaranteed by EDP Serviço Universal, S.A., a company wholly owned by EDP Distribuição. Electric Energy Price Regime In the non-regulated market, electricity tariffs are defined by an agreement between each supplier and its customers. In the regulated market the tariffs charged by the Supplier of Last Resort are defined by ERSE. The Decree-Law 104/2010 of 29 September, establishes the end of regulated tariffs for very high, high, medium and low-tension customers from 1 January 2011. Under the terms of the Ministers Council Resolution 34/2011 of 1 August which sets out the timetable for the extinction of tariffs to customers, transitory rates to be approved by ERSE will be applied for the period not exceding three years only those customers who have not yet chosen a supplier. Public Domain Assets In Portugal some fixed assets relating to electricity generation and distribution in the regulated market are subject to the public domain regime. These assets are directly related with the Group's activity, which can freely manage them, but cannot dispose of them for private commercial purposes while they are related with the public domain regime. Gas In the distribution activity for natural gas, EDP Group develops its activity in Portugal through its subsidiary Portgás, S.A. EDP Group is present in the commercialization of natural gas, either in the regulated market (EDP Gás Serviço Universal) or the free market (EDP Gás.com and EDP Comercial). EDP Gás.com and EDP Comercial, with a trading license in the free market since 2008 and 2010, respectively , have operated in the market since the start of 2009. Additionally, the Group develops the supply business of propane gas, through EDP Gás GPL S.A. On 15 June 2011, the tariffs set by ERSE were published for the years 2011-2012. The income allowed for Portgás S.A. include the initial revaluation of its assets (with reference to 31.12.2007), approved by the Finance Ministry. Activity in the energy sector in Spain Electricity In Spain, Hidroeléctrica del Cantábrico (HC Energia) is the parent company of an industrial group that operates in the electricity and gas sectors. In the electricity sector, HC Energia generates, transports, distributes and supplies electricity. Production is based essentially on traditional coal thermal power plants and, on a smaller scale, on hydroelectric and nuclear power plants. Electric Sector Regulation O 27 November On N b 1997 th El t i Sector's the Electric L S t ' Law 54/1997 was approved, d which i l t the th principles hi h (i) implements i i l included i l d d in l signed th Protocol P t i the i D b t b 1996 between d on 11 December th the Ministry of Industry and Energy and the major electric power companies regarding greater liberalization and competition in the electricity sector and (ii) incorporatesinto Spanish law the provisions contained in Directive 96/92/EC on common rules for the internal electricity market. Additionally, on 6 July 2007 the Law 17/2007 of 4 July came into force, amending the Law 54/1997, to adapt it to the Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Council and Parliament of 26 June 2003 on common rules for the internal market of electricity. The referred Law 54/1997, as amended, provides, among others, the following basic principles: Generation Since 1 January 1998 electricity generation operates on a free market competition basis, which covers the purchase and sale of energy and other services related to the distribution of electricity. The market structure for electricity generation has been widened by Law 17/2007 of 4 July, in order to include the forward market and the intraday market, as well as technical issues, complementary services, deviations management and unorganised markets. The organisation and regulation of the market for electric power generation is defined by Royal Decree 2019/1997 of 26 December. Electric energy is paid at the system's marginal price plus a component for the adjustment services necessary to ensure an adequate supply. Additionally, the Order ITC/2794/2007 of September 27, which revised the electricity tariffs of from 1 October 2007, replaced the concept of power availability remuneration of electricity generation by the concept of capacity payments stated in article 16 of the Law 54/1997 (amended by Law 17/2007), which sets a remuneration of the availability service for the procurement of capacity in the medium term and the incentive to invest in long-term capacity. The installation of new generation units is liberalised, subject to obtaining the necessary permits. Producers have the right to use primary energy sources in their generation units as deemed most appropriate, with the restrictions applicable to the environment. As a consequence of a pre-notification of European Commission, the Royal Decree Law 1221/2010 of 1 October was approved modifies the Royal Decree Law 134/2010 of 12 February and establishes the procedure for supply restrictions, as a protective measure to promote the consumption of local coal. Additionally, from the endorsement of Royal Decree Law 14/2010 of 23 December, producers under the ordinary regime have the obligation to pay for the utilization of the transport and distribution networks. 165 notes to the consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 december 2011 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. and 2010 Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 Transportation Red Eléctrica de España, S.A. performs the activities of Transmission Manager and System Operator, being responsible for its technical management, to ensure the continuity of supply and efficient management of the generation and transmission system. The responsibility for the economic management of the system is guaranteed by the Compañía Operadora del Mercado Español de Electricidad, S.A. The entities and qualified consumers have free access to the transmission and supply networks, setting out a system of tarifs for traffic. The remuneration for the transmission and distribution activities is set by the regulatory entity. The Royal Decree 325/2008 of 29 February, establishes a new fee system applicable to electricity transportation facilities, that entered into service from 1 January 2009. Just as for distribution, this new model of compensation is based on investments realised. The current text of Law 54/1997 also provides that the transmission activity will be performed by a single entity. There is also a distinction made between the primary transmission system (facilities> 380 kV and with international networks and extra-peninsular island systems) and the secondary transmission system (facilities <220 kV other than primary transmission systems and less but fulfilling the functions of transmission). Distribution Law 54/1997 provides that the remuneration for each company must respect criteria based on the costs needed to develop the activity, taking into account a model of characterization of distribution areas and other parameters. On 19 March 2008, the Royal Decree 222/2008 of 15 February entered into force, establishing a new system of remuneration for the distribution electricity activity and modifying the system of Acometidas (system that regulates the installation, that allows the connection of the distribution network with the point of delivery of energy to the client). The new remuneration system is based on investments and increased demand of each distributor. As such, the standard provides new incentives for reducing losses and improving quality, which are pending for new regulatory developments. Supply Law 54/1997 established a progressive liberalisation of electricity supply and the introduction of supply activities to enable customers to progressively choose their suppliers and liberalised the supply market from 1 January 2003. Additionally, since 1 July 2009, distributors can no longer act as suppliers (sell electricity) acting strictly as network operators. Electricity Tariffs Regime The activities for the energy supply are paid by consumers, through fees and charges. These rates exclusive to Spain, are established by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade based on the costs of regulated activities, including fixed costs and diversification and security of supply costs. On the other hand, on 1 July 2009 the system of electricity tariffs became extinct and all consumers were transferred to the free market. However, the Royal Decree 485/2009 of 3 April, pursuant to Articles 9.f and 18th and 24th Additional disposition of Law 54/1997, provide that the consumers of low-tension, with contract capacity not exceeding 10 kW, are eligible for the tariff of last resort, which determines the maximum and minimum price of supply. This rate will be applicable by the suppliers of last resort, where Hidrocantábrico Energia Último Recurso, S.A.U. is included. Social Benefit The Royal Decree 6/2009 of 30 April, created the Social Benefit for some consumers who benefit from the tariff of last resort (TUR) and that meet certain social characteristics of consumption and purchasing power given by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade. The benefit will cover the difference between the value of TUR and the benchmark value and will be financed by the production companies. Gas Naturgás, a subsidiary of HC Energia Group which operates in the natural gas distribution and supply, owns all the EDP Group's gas assets in Spain. The distribution of natural gas in Spain is a regulated activity. Law 34/1998, approved on 7 October 1998, amended by Law 12/2007 of 2 July 2007, transposed to Spanish legislation the provisions of Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 26 June 2003 related with common rules for the natural gas internal market . The aforementioned legislation identifies the following operators in the context of the supply of natural gas by pipeline: § Transmission companies, owners of facilities for regasification of liquefied natural gas, transport or storage of natural gas; § Distribution companies, owners of distribution facilities, whose function is to distribute natural gas by pipeline, as well as build, maintain and operate such facilities in order to bring natural gas to the consumption points; § Suppliers, companies that hold access to the facilities owned by third parties, purchase natural gas for sale to consumers or other suppliers for the purpose of international exchanges; § Final consumers, who purchase natural gas for own consumption and direct consumers in the market, who have direct access to third party facilities. The Royal Decree 6/2000 of 23 June, also creates the figure of Technical Manager of the System, which is responsible for the technical management of the basic gas network and secondary transmission network, attributed to ENAGÁS, S.A. The system of provisioning and supplying based on tariffs for natural gas distribution companies expired on 1 July 2008. Since then, new last resort rates have been set, that can benefit consumers who are covered by the regulation (from July 2009 defined as those consuming less than 50,000 kWh / year), and which will be implemented by the suppliers, who in accordance with Article 82 of Law 34/1998 have an obligation as suppliers of last resort. Naturgás Comercializadora Energía, S.A. is one of the trading companies designated by the Ministry. 166 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 For suppliers of last resort, the Royal Decree 485/2009 makes it possible for groups of companies that have the obligation to provide last-resort electricity and gas, to aggregate in a single company both obligations (HC Energia Comercializadora de Último Recurso currently covers suppliers obligations of last resort for gas and electricity). The Royal Decree 104/2010 of 5 February, regulates the supplier of last resort in the natural gas sector and establishes that the last resort tariff ( TUR ) became the only tariff from 1 January 2010, denying to suppliers of last resort the application of discounts over customers with TUR. Activity in the energy sector in Brazil Electricity In Brazil, the EDP Group generates, distributes, transmits and supplies electric energy through its subsidiary EDP Energias do Brasil, S.A. (EDP Energias do Brasil). In August 2008, Energias do Brasil made an exchange with Grupo REDE of the entire interest held in Enersul (a distributor of electricity in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul) by the corporate shares held by Rede Energia in Rede Lajeado Energia S.A. ( Rede Lajeado ) and Investco S.A. ( Investco ), as well as corporate shareholdings held by Rede Power in Rede Lajeado and Tocantins Energia S.A. This transaction enabled EDP Energias do Brasil to consolidate its position in the electricity generation sector in the State of Tocantins in northern Brazil. The Brazilian electricity sector has undergone major structural and institutional changes in recent years, having migrated from a monopoly run by the State to a market model, involving private capital. This market model includes the existence of two distinct systems, the regulated system and the liberalised system. Regulated System The Regulated Contracting Environment is for the sale of electricity between generators, energy importers or retailers, selling energy to distributors who in turn, acquire energy to ensure supply to consumers. The main form of contracting by a distributor concessionaire is through the realization of public auctions regulated by ANEEL. The rules of these auctions are designed so tha the winner is the one with the lowest price. The distribution companies must estimate the amount of electricity to contract in auctions and they are obliged to purchase 100% of their needs respecting the condition that, market increases must be met by energy from new ventures, contracted 3 years (Auction A-3) or 5 years (Auction A-5) in advance. Failure to comply with the supply of energy to its markets may result in severe fines. Public auctions began in late 2004. Liberalised system In the liberalised market, electricity is traded among production concessionaires, independent power producers, auto-producers, agents and free consumers. In this market, the contractual conditions, such as price, duration and amount of the contract are traded freely and negotiated between the parties (Decree No. 5.163/04). Free consumers can return to the regulated system under certain conditions. Generation The generation market is based predominantly on the existence of Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) between generators and distributors, with tenders to supply longtterm d demand, d th dj t the adjustment t off medium di h t tterm and d short and dd il market daily d i ti f deviations, k t for k t or spott market. Electricity generation in Brazil relies mostly on hydroelectric technology. Power generation plants are the object of concession, permit or registration, according to the type of plant, the power capacity to be installed and the destination of the energy. Depending on the destination of energy, power generation plants can be classified as: § Generation companies, producing electricity for public service distribution; § Independent producers, who assume the risk of the sale of electricity with distributors or directly with free consumers; § Auto-producers (energy generation for own consumption, the excess of which can be sold through an authorization). Transmission The Brazilian transmission system, with a capacity above 230 kV, is divided into transmission and sub-transmission networks, depending on the disaggregation level of the consumers market. The primary network is responsible for the transmission of electricity to large consumers and the supply of energy to any consumer of high dimension. The secondary network is basically an extension of the primary network with the objective of delivering electricity to small consumers and providing energy to large industrial customers. Distribution The public service concession arrangements for electricity distribution are allocated by tender and establish rules regarding price, regularity, continuity, safety, timeliness and quality of services and supplies provided to consumers and users. These arrangements also define penalties for possible irregularities. In most states, mainly in the North and Northeast, the concession area corresponds to the state boundaries. However, mainly in São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, the concessions for distribution may cover smaller areas than the state itself. In same cases, the concession area is extended beyond the geographical limits of the state where the distribution company is located. 167 notes to the consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 december 2011 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. and 2010 Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 The distribution activity operates in a regulated environment, with tariffs determined in the context of incentive regulation ( price cap ) with a remuneration basis in the assets used in the distribution energy service (BRR). The tariff also includes a part to cover the operating costs established from a standard company, the Reference Company (with costs that would be charged by an efficient operator and which acted in the concession region). The regulatory EBITDA has two parts, which (i) regulatory depreciation of BRR assets and (ii) return on capital prudently invested multiplied by the regulatory WACC, ie by the rate of weighted average cost of capital of sector companies. Finally, the tariffs also consider the costs of acquiring energy, hiring the use of transmission and sector-based as costs to be included in the tariff. The tariff portion that includes the regulatory remuneration, the depreciation charge and the value of the reference Company is called portion B. The costs of buying energy, hiring of basic network and charges, set up the portion A of the tariffs as set out in the concession contracts for distribution companies. Tariffs are adjusted annually based on changes in portion A costs and in the correction of portion B costs, by the index of variation of IGPM, discounting productivity gains (factor X). The index adjustment is calculated to pass on the variations in costs not manageable in the Parcel A and the adjusted Parcel B. Periodically (on average every 4 years) there is a tariff revision, which results in a global review of costs, in the definition of a new BRR and a new Reference Company, which capture the productivity gains in the period between reviews. At the start of 2010 an addendum to the concession contracts of distribution companies was signed to ensure the neutrality of sector costs. Supply The electricity suppliers that do not own electric assets, are authorised to act exclusively in the free market, selling or buying energy in quantity, conditions and prices freely negotiated. The commercialization of energy with a distributor is only possible through participation in the Auction set by the distributors , with the negotiation of contracts, for a maximum of two years, and commencement of energy delivery within a period not exceeding two years. Public Domain Assets In Brazil, fixed assets used in the distribution and the supply activities are binded to these services and cannot be removed, sold, transferred or mortgaged without the prior and express consent of the regulator (ANEEL). Activity in the Renewable Energies Sector In December 2007 the EDP Group incorporated EDP Renováveis, S.L. in Spain so as to concentrate the Group's subsidiaries in the renewable energies sector. On 4 July 2008, a share capital increase of EDP Renováveis was made through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of 196,024,306 shares. This share capital increase was not subscribed by the EDP Group, resulting in a dilution of the interest held in EDP Renováveis from 100% to 77.53%. The share capital increase amounted to 1,566,726 thousand Euros, of which 980,121 thousand Euros relates to the capital increase and 586,605 thousand Euros relates to the share premium. Electricity Generation In December 2011, EDP Renováveis, the subsidiary of EDP Group for the renewable energies sector, holds the share capital of EDP Renewables Europe, S.L. (EDPR EU, previous designated as Nuevas Energias del Ocidente, S.L), EDP Renewables North America (EDPR NA, previous designated as Horizon Wind Energy, L.L.C. ) and EDP Renováveis Brasil, S.A., operating respectively in Europe, in the United States of America and in Brazil.

As at 31 December 2010, Spain and Portugal are the most relevant geographical markets where EDPR EU operates. In July 2007 the EDP Group acquired from Goldman Sachs, 100% of the share capital of EDPR NA, which develops, manages and operates wind farms in the United States of America. EDPR NA holds a series of wind farms in operation and a pipeline of projects under development for the construction of wind farms. Regulatory framework for the activities in Spain The Electrical Sector in Spain is regulated by Law 54 of 27 November 1997 and subsequent amendments to legislation. Royal Decree 436 of 12 March 2004 was published on 24 March 2004 and sets out the methodology to be used for updating and systematizing the legal and economic regime relating to the electrical power production under the special regime, which includes the generation of electricity using renewable sources of energy, cogeneration, biomass and waste. This Royal Decree replaces the former Royal Decree 2818/1998 and unifies regulations applicable to special regime energies. The Royal Decree also defines a system whereby the owners of the electrical installation are entitled to sell the production or surplus of electrical power to distributors. A regulated price can be received for this sale, or production and surplus can be sold directly on the daily market, futures market or through a bilateral agreement, in which case a marketnegotiated price would be received, plus an incentive for participation in the agreement and a premium if the installation was entitled to receive it. The Royal Decree 661 of 25 May 2007 was published on 26 May 2007 and regulates electrical power produced under the special regime. This Royal Decree replaces Royal Decree 436 of 12 March 2004 and updates regulations on electrical power production under the special regime, whilst maintaining the basic structure of the regulation. The economic framework set out in this Royal Decree maintains the same system of payment for power produced under the special regime, whereby the owner of the installations can opt to sell its power at a regulated price, for the programmed periods only, or sell the power directly on the daily market, futures market or through a bilateral agreement, in this case receiving the negotiated price plus a premium. The main changes to the Royal Decree include a modification to the regulated price and premiums and the introduction of a system of variable premium for certain technologies, such as wind power. The owners of wind power installations officially entering into service prior to 1 January 2008 can opt to adhere to the transitory regime established in the first transitory provisions, which stipulate that the owners of these installations may maintain the prices and premiums established in the aforementioned Royal Decree until 31 December 2012. The Royal Decree 6/2009 of 7 May was approved and is aimed at eliminating the tariff deficit from 2013. Among other measures, it introduces a pre-allocation register for new renewable energy capacity for renewable-energy installations to obtain the entitlements set out in Royal Decree 661/2007. 168 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 In July 2010, the Ministry of Industry established an agrement with two major associations of renewable energy (Spanish Wind Energy Association and Protermosolar) to change the existing regulation. This agreement resulted in the approval of Royal Decree 1614/2010 , of December 7, which defines (i) for the years 2011 and 2012 a redution of 35% in the income applicable to wind generation defined by Royal Decree 661/2007, (ii) an addition to article 44.3 of Royal Decree 661/2007 clarifying that future revisions of the income for energy production through renewable sources will only be applied to the installed capacity from 2012 and (iii) setting a limit of 2,589 hours of operation for the installed capacity from which the wind farm is nor entitled to receive any income. The Decree-Law 14/2010 of 23 December, establishes several measures to reduce the tariff deficit, including a production rate of 0,5€ /MWh applicable to producers under the ordinary and special regimes. On 28 January 2012 the Spanish Government enacted Royal-Decree Law 1/2012 that approves a temporary suspension of the remuneration for renewable energy capacity not included in the pre-assignation registry. Despite this regulation, the Government has emphasised its commitment towards achieving the 2020 Renewable Energy Target for Spain. Within EDPR’s pipeline, wind farms already included in the registry will not be affected by this new regulation. Projects not included in the registry, and therefore, ruled by Royal-Decree-law 1/2012, do not have beforehand a defined incentive scheme. Regulatory framework for the activities in Portugal The Portuguese legal provisions applicable to the generation of electrical power based on renewable resources are currently established by Decree-Law No. 189/88 dated 27 May, as amended by Decree-Law No. 168/99 dated 18 May, Decree-Law No. 312/2001 dated 10 December and Decree-Law No. 339-C/2001 dated 29 December. Also relevant is Decree-Law No. 33-A/2005, dated 16 February, which establishes the current values used in the remuneration formula applicable to energy produced by means of renewable resources and the deadlines for the application of such remuneration formula. The main feature of the legal framework for renewable energy power generation in Portugal is that the national network operator or the regional distribution operator must purchase all electricity produced by renewable producers who hold an operating license. The construction and operation of a wind farm depends on the allocation of a network connection point issued by the State Energy Department Direcção Geral de Geologia e Energia-DGGE”. The issue of the point of connection occurs upon the request of the promoters during limited periods of time set by the DGGE or by means of a public tender procedure. Award of connection points by direct negotiation is exceptional. Decree-Law No. 225/2007 dated 31 May, establishes a set of regulations related to renewable energies, foreseen in the National Strategy for Energy, and has reviewed the formula used in estimating the remuneration of electricity supply generated by renewable power stations and delivered to the network of the National Electric System, as well as the procedures for the attribution of the available power in the same network and the deadlines to obtain licenses for the establishment of renewable power stations. In 2012, following the measures set out in the international financial assistence plan to Portugal and of the Government Programme, which predict the analysis of the effectiveness of the financial support for cogeneration and renewable energy, DecreeLaw 25/2012 of 6 February, suspended the allocation of power injection on the Public Service under the special regime, which applies to all applications whose network connection is not authorized or whose reception is not yet assigned and covers the production facilities under Decree-Law 312/2001 and 583/99, relating to indigenous renewable resources and cogeneratyion up to 10MVA. Regulatory framework for the activities in the United States of America Federal, state and local energy laws and regulations regulate the development, ownership, business organization and operation of electric generating facilities and the sale of electricity in the United States of America. All project companies within the Group in the United States of America operate as exempt wholesale generators (“EWGs”) or qualifying facilities (“QFs”) under federal law or are dually certified. In addition, most of the project companies in the United States are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) and have market-based market based rates on file with FERC. FERC The federal government regulates the wholesale electric energy sale and transmission business in interstate commerce through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), which draws its jurisdiction from the Federal Power Act (the “FPA”), and from other federal legislation such as the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (“PURPA 1978”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (“EPACT 1992”) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPACT 2005”). EWGs are owners or operators of electric generation (including producers of renewable energy, such as wind projects) that are engaged exclusively in the business of owning and/or operating generating facilities and selling electric energy at wholesale rates. An EWG cannot make retail sales of electric energy and may only own or operate the limited interconnection facilities necessary to connect its generating facility to the network. In certain states, approval of the construction of new electricity generating facilities, including renewable energy facilities such as wind farms, is obtained from a state agency, with only limited ministerial approvals required from state and local governments. However, in many states the permit process for power plants (including wind farms) also remains subject to land-use and similar regulations of county and city governments. State-level authorizations may involve a more extensive approval process, possibly including an environmental impact evaluation and opposition by interested parties or utilities. Both the United States federal government and various state governments have implemented policies designed to promote the growth of renewable energy, including wind power. The primary federal renewable energy incentive program is the Production Tax Credit (PTC), which was established by the U.S. Congress as part of EPACT 1992. As part of the American Recovery and Investment Act of 2009, the federal government is encouraging renewable energy development through investment tax credits and cash grants from 2009 through 2013. Many states have passed legislation, principally in the form of renewable portfolio standards (“RPS”), which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy supply from renewable sources, similar to the Renewable Energy Directive in the EU. The American Recovery and Investment Act of 2009 was approved and includes a number of energy related tax and policy provisions to benefit the development of wind energy generation, namely (i) a three year extension of the PTC until 2012 and (ii) an option to elect a 30% Investment Tax Credit ( ITC ) that could replace the PTC through the duration of the extension. This ITC allows the companies to receive 30% of the cash invested in projects placed in service or with the beginning of construction in 2009 and 2010. In December 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment, Insurance and Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 was approved and includes an one year extension of the ITC, which allow the companies to receive 30% of the cash invested in projects with beggining of construction until December 2011 as long as placed in service until December 2012. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was extended in December of 2010, the federal government also encourages renewable energy development through investment tax credits and cash grants from 2009 through 2013. Many states have passed legislation, principally in the form of renewable portfolio standards (“RPS”), which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy supply from renewable sources, similar to the Renewable Energy Directive in the EU. 169 notes to the consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 december 2011S.A.and 2010 EDP Energias de Portugal, Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES a) Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated and company financial statements of EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. reflect the results of the company's operations and the financial position of all of its subsidiaries (EDP Group or Group) and the Group's interest in its associated companies, for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010. EDP S.A.'s Executive Board of Directors approved the consolidated and company financial statements (referred to as financial statements) on 8 March 2012. The financial statements are presented in thousands of Euros, rounded to the nearest thousand. In accordance with Regulation (EC) 1606/2002 of the European Council and Parliament, of 19 July 2002, as transposed into Portuguese legislation through Decree-law 35/2005 of 17 February, the company's financial statements and the Group's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union (EU). IFRS comprise accounting standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as well as interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and their predecessor bodies. The EDP Group's consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the E.U. until 31 December 2011. The accounting policies used by the Group in preparing its accompanying consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2011 are consistent with those used in preparing the annual consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2010. However, as described in note 51, the Group adopted in the preparation of consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2011, the accounting standards issued by IASB and IFRIC interpretations effective since 1 January 2011. The accounting policies used by the Group in preparing the consolidated financial statements described in this note were adopted in accordance. The adoption of these new standards and interpretations in 2011 did not have a significant impact on the Group's accounts. The new standards and interpretations recently issued but not yet effective and that the Group has not yet applied on its consolidated financial statements, can also be analysed in note 51. The financial statements were prepared under the historical cost convention, modified by the application of the fair value accounting to derivative financial instruments, financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and available-for-sale investments, except those for which fair value is not available. Assets and liabilities that are hedged under hedge accounting are stated at fair value in respect of the hedged risk. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Liabilities for defined benefit plans are recognised at the present value of the obligation net of plan assets fair value. In accordance with IFRS 3 – Business Combinations, adjustments to the provisional fair values that result from purchase price allocations to assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, acquired ( Purchase Price Allocations ) with impact on the amount of goodwill determined and registered in previous periods, originate a restatement of the comparative information, reflecting these adjustments on the income statement and balance sheet, with effect from the date of the acquisition. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the Executive Board of Directors to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and related assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The issues involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or where assumptions and estimates are considered to be significant, are presented in note 3 (Critical accounting estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements). In the 2011 annual accounts (with 2010 comparatives), in order to improve the presentation of assets and liabilities, the Group has further disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position what are in fact the core business “Debtors and other assets” and “Trade payables and other liabilities”. In order to improve the presentation of Cash and cash equivalents, as at 31 December 2011 and 2010, the specific demand deposits in relation to institutional partnerships are funds required to be held in escrow sufficient to pay the remaining construction related costs of projects in institutional equity partnerships in U.S.A., in the next twelve months, were re-classified in the caption of Cash and cash equivalents instead of being included in the caption of Other debtors and other assets Current. Accounting policies have been applied consistently by all Group companies and in all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Nevertheless, there was a change in accounting policy on employee benefits pensions. Change in accounting policy According to IAS 19, the costs of the year related to benefit plans may be booked in the income statement, as one of the following: (i) Interest cost and expected return on plan assets presented in financial results and the current service cost in employee benefits costs; or (ii) The total net cost presented in employee and benefits costs caption. Since the IFRS adoption, EDP Group has consistently presented these costs in accordance with the second option, presenting the net effect of its defined benefits in the employee benefits costs caption. However, during the third quarter of 2011, EDP Group decided to change the previously adopted accounting policy. Therefore, EDP Group began to present only the amount corresponding to the current service cost and the effect of early retirements in employee benefits costs and the interest cost and the return on plan assets fund in financial results. As at 31 December 2011, the effect of this change results in an impact of 88 million of Euros in financial results against a decrease on employee benefits costs. As at 31 December 2010, EDP Group restated its employee benefits costs for comparative purposes, resulting in a decrease of approximately 85 millions of Euros against a negative increase of financial results in the same amount (see notes 10, 15 and 37). 170 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 b) Basis of consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities and results of EDP, S.A. and its subsidiaries (Group or EDP Group) and the equity and results attributable to the Group, through the investments in associates. As from 1 January 2010 onwards, the EDP Group applied IFRS 3 (revised) for the accounting of business combinations. The changes in accounting policies resulting from the application of IFRS 3 (revised) are applied prospectively. Subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries where the EDP Group has control are fully consolidated from the date the Group assumes control over their financial and operating activities until the moment that control ceases to exist. Control is presumed to exist when the Group owns more than half of the voting rights. Control also exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to manage the financial and operating policies of the entity to obtain benefits from its activities, even if the percentage of shareholding is less than 50%. Until 31 December 2009, when the accumulated losses of a subsidiary attributable to non-controlling interests exceed the non-controlling interests in its equity, the excess was attributed to the Group and charged to the income statement as incurred. Profits subsequently reported by the subsidiary were recognised as profits of the Group until the losses attributable to the non-controlling interests previously recognised by the Group have been recovered. As from 1 January, 2010, the due proportion of accumulated losses are attributed to non-controlling interests, implying that the Group can recognise negative non-controlling interests. As from 1 January 2010, on a step acquisition process resulting in the acquisition of control the revaluation of any participation previously acquired is booked against the profit and loss account when goodwill is calculated. On a partial disposal resulting in loss of control over a subsidiary, any participation retained is revalued at market value on the sale date and the gain or loss resulting from this revaluation is booked against the income statement. Associates Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method from the date the Group acquires significant influence to the date it ceases. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over its financial and operating policies. Generally, when the Group holds more than 20% of the voting rights of the investee it is presumed to have significant influence. If the Group holds, directly or indirectly, less than 20% of the voting rights of the investee, it is presumed not to have significant influence, unless such influence can be clearly demonstrated. The existence of significant influence by the Group is usually evidenced by one or more of the following: Representation on the Executive Board of Directors or equivalent governing body of the investee; Participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends and other distributions; Existence of material transactions between the Group and the investee; Interchange of managerial personnel; Provision of essential technical information. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's attributable share of total reserves and profits or losses of associates, accounted for under the equity method. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group's carrying amount is reduced to zero and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to cover such losses on behalf of the associate. Jointly controlled entities Jointly controlled entities, which are consolidated under the proportionate consolidation method, are entities over which the Group has joint control defined by a contractual agreement. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's proportional share of the joint ventures' assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, from the date the joint control begins and until it ceases. Accounting for investments in subsidiaries and associates in the company's financial statements Investments in subsidiaries and associates not classified as held for sale or not included in a disposal group which is classified as held for sale are accounted for at cost in the company's financial statements, and are subject to periodic impairment tests, whenever indication exists that certain financial investment may be impaired. Goodwill Following the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on 1 January 2004 and as permitted under IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the EDP Group decided to maintain the goodwill resulting from business combinations that occurred prior to the transition date, calculated in accordance with the Group's previous accounting policies. Business combinations that occurred after 1 January 2004 are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition cost corresponds to the fair value, determined at the acquisition date, of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed including the costs directly attributable to the acquisition, for acquisitions up to 31 December 2009. As from 1 January 2010 onwards, costs directly attributable to the acquisition of a subsidiary are booked directly in the income statement. As from the transition date to IFRS (1 January 2004), positive goodwill arising from acquisitions is recognised as an asset carried at acquisition cost and is not subject to amortisation. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates is defined as the difference between the cost of acquisition and the corresponding share of the fair value of the net assets acquired. As from 1 January 2010 onwards, the EDP Group has the possibility to book non-controlling interests at fair value or at cost, implying that the full amount of goodwill can be booked in the financial statements, including the portion attributable to the non-controlling interests, against non-controlling interests, if the first option is chosen. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates is defined as the difference between the cost of acquisition and the total or corresponding share of the fair value of the net assets acquired, depending on the option taken. 171 notes to the consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 december 2011S.A.and 2010 EDP Energias de Portugal, Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement in the period the business combination occurs. The recoverable amount of the goodwill in subsidiaries is assessed annually, regardless of the existence of any impairment triggers. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount is determined based on the value in use of the assets, calculated using valuation methodologies supported by discounted cash flow techniques, considering market conditions, the time value of money and the business risks. Until 31 December 2009, contingent acquisition prices were determined based on the best estimate of probable future payments, being the future changes in the estimate booked against goodwill. As from 1 January 2010, goodwill is no longer adjusted due to changes in the initial estimate of the contingent purchase price and the difference is booked in the income statement. Purchases of non-controlling interests and dilution Until 31 December 2009, in the acquisition of non-controlling interests, the difference between the fair value of the non-controlling interests acquired and the consideration paid, was accounted against goodwill. The acquisitions of non-controlling interests through written put options related with investments in subsidiaries held by noncontrolling interests, were recorded as a financial liability for the present value of the best estimate of the amount payable, against non-controlling interests. The difference between the non-controlling interests acquired and the fair value of the liability, was recorded as goodwill. The fair value of the liability was determined based on the contractual price which may be fixed or variable. In case of a variable price, the changes in the liability are recognised as an adjustment to the cost of the business combination against goodwill and the effect of the financial discount of the liability (unwinding) was recognised as a financial expense in the consolidated income statement. This accounting treatment is maintained for all options contracted until 31 December 2009. Until 31 December 2009, when an interest in a subsidiary was disposed of, without a loss in control, the difference between the sale price and the book value of the net assets held by the Group, plus the carrying value of goodwill in that subsidiary, was recognised in the income statement of the period as a gain or loss resulting from the disposal. The dilution effect occurs when the percentage of interest in a subsidiary decreases without any sale of interest in that subsidiary, for example, if the Group does not participate proportionally in the share capital increase of that subsidiary. Until 31 December 2009, the Group recognised the gains or losses resulting from a dilution of a subsidiary following a sale or capital increase in the income statement. As from 1 January 2010 onwards, in an acquisition (dilution) of non-controlling interests not resulting in a loss of control, the difference between the fair value of the noncontrolling interests acquired and the consideration paid, is accounted against reserves. The acquisitions of non-controlling interests through written put options related with investments in subsidiaries held by non-controlling interests, are recorded as a financial liability for the present value of the best estimate of the amount payable, against non-controlling interests. The fair value of the liability is determined based on the contractual price which may be fixed or variable. In case of a variable price, the changes in the liability are recognised against the income statement as well as the effect of the financial discount of the liability (unwinding). Investments in foreign operations The financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries and associates of the Group are prepared using their functional currency, defined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate. In the consolidation process, the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Euros at the official exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Regarding the investments in foreign operations that are consolidated using the full consolidation method, proportionate or equity method, the exchange differences between the amount of equity expressed in Euros at the beginning of the period and the amount translated at the official exchange rates at the end of the period, on a consolidated basis, are booked against reserves. Foreign currency goodwill arising on the acquisition of these investments is remeasured at the official exchange rate at the balance sheet date directly against reserves. The income and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Euros at the approximate exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences from the translation into Euros of the net profit for the period, arising from the differences between the rates used in the income statement and those prevailing at the balance sheet date are recognised in reserves. On disposal of a foreign subsidiary, the related exchange differences previously recognised in reserves, are accounted for in the income statement. Balances and transactions eliminated on consolidation Inter-company balances and transactions, including any unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains and losses arising on transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in those entities. c) Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into Euros at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. These exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Foreign currency non-monetary assets and liabilities accounted for at historical cost are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency non-monetary assets and liabilities stated at fair value are translated into Euros at the exchange rates at the dates the fair value was determined. d) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trade date at fair value. Subsequently, the fair value of derivative financial instruments is remeasured on a regular basis, being the gains or losses on remeasurement recognised directly in the income statement, except for derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Recognition, in the income statement, of the resulting gains and losses on remeasurement of hedging derivatives depends on the hedge model used. The fair value of derivative financial instruments corresponds to their market value, when available, or is determined by external entities using valuation techniques. 172 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 Hedge accounting The Group uses financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and price risk resulting from its operational and financing activities. Derivatives not qualified for hedging under IAS 39 are accounted for as trading instruments. Hedging derivatives are recorded at fair value, being the gains and losses recognised in accordance with the hedge accounting model applied by the Group. An hedge relationship exists when: (i) At the inception of the hedge there is formal documentation of the hedge; (ii) The hedge is expected to be highly effective; (iii) The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured; (iv) The hedge is revalued on an on-going basis and is considered to be highly effective throughout the reporting period; (v) The forecast transaction being hedged must be highly probable and must be exposed to changes in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit or loss. Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged assets and liabilities or group of hedged assets and liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk. When the hedging relationship ceases to comply with the requirements for hedge accounting, the accumulated gains or losses concerning the fair value of the risk being hedged are amortised over the residual period to maturity. Cash flow hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives qualified as cash flow hedges are recognised in reserves. The cumulative gains or losses recognised in reserves are reclassified to the income statement when the hedged item affects the income statement. When a hedging relation of a future transaction is discontinued, the changes in the fair value of derivative recognised in reserves remain recognised in reserves until the future hedged transaction also affects the income statement. When the future transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses recognised in reserves are recorded immediately in the income statement. Net investment hedge The net investment hedge model is applied on a consolidated basis to investments in subsidiaries in foreign currencies. This model permits exchange differences recognised in the exchange differences consolidated reserves to be offset by the foreign exchange differences in foreign currency loans or currency forwards contracted. The ineffective portion of the hedging relationship is recognised in the income statement. The accumulated foreign exchange gains and losses regarding the net investment and the related hedging recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement when the foreign entity is sold, as part of the gain or loss resulting from the disposal. Effectiveness For an hedge relationship to be classified as such, in accordance with IAS 39, its effectiveness must be demonstrated. Therefore, the Group performs prospective tests at the inception date of the hedge and prospective and retrospective in each balance sheet date, to demonstrate its effectiveness, showing that any adjustments to the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged are offset by adjustments to the fair value of the hedging instrument. Any ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement in the moment that occurs. e) Other financial assets The Group classifies its other financial assets at acquisition date, considering the underlying intention, in the following categories: Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss This category includes: (i) financial assets held for trading, acquired for the purpose of being traded in the short term, and (ii) financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception (fair value option). Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale investments are non-derivative financial assets which: (i) the Group intends to hold for an undetermined period of time, or (ii) are designated as available for sale on initial recognition. Initial recognition, measurement and derecognition Purchases and sales of: (i) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, and (ii) available-for-sale investments, are recognised on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell these financial assets. Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, in which the transaction costs are recognised directly in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when (i) the contractual rights to receive their future cash flows have expired, (ii) the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership or (iii) although retaining some, but not substantially, the risks and rewards of ownership, the Group has transferred control over the assets. 173 notes to the consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 december 2011 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. and 2010 Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value, being the gains or losses arising from changes in their fair value recorded in the income statement. Available-for-sale investments are also subsequently carried at fair value, however, gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are recognised in fair value reserves until the financial assets are derecognised or impaired, being the cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in fair value reserves recognised in the income statement. Foreign exchange differences relating to these assets are also recognised in fair value reserves if arising from shares, and in the income statement if arising from debt instruments. Interest, calculated using the effective interest rate method, as well as dividends received are recognised in the income statement. The fair value of listed investments in active markets is based on current bid price. The Group determines the fair value of unlisted securities through (i) valuation methodologies, such as the price of similar recent arm’s length transactions and discounted cash flow techniques, and (ii) valuation assumptions based on market information. Financial assets whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are stated at cost, being any impairment loss booked against the income statement. Reclassifications between categories The Group does not transfer financial instruments into or out of the fair value through profit or loss category at the moment of its initial recognition being the variations recognised in the income statement (Fair Value Option). Impairment At each balance sheet date an assessment is performed as to whether there is objective evidence of impairment, namely those resulting in an adverse effect on estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, and every time it can be reliably measured. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the recoverable amount of the financial asset is determined, and the impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after their initial recognition, such as: (i) in the case of listed securities, a significant or prolonged decline in the listed price of the security, and (ii) in the case of unlisted securities, when that event (or events) has an impact on the estimated amount of the future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, that can be reliably estimated. If there is objective evidence of impairment on available-for-sale investments, the cumulative potential loss recognised in fair values reserves, corresponding to the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value at the balance sheet date, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred to the income statement. For debt instruments, if in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreases, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed to the income statement up to the amount of the acquisition cost, if the increase is objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. In the case of equity instruments, the reversal of the impairment is recognised in equity under fair value reserves. f) Financial liabilities An instrument is classified as a financial liability when it contains a contractual obligation to liquidate capital and/or interests, through delivering cash or other financial asset, independently of its legal form. Financial liabilities are recognised (i) initially at fair value less transaction costs and (ii) subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. g) Equity instruments A financial instrument is classified as an equity instrument when there is no contractual obligation at settlement to deliver cash or other financial asset to another entity, independently of its legal form, and there is a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities. Costs directly attributable to the issuance of equity instruments are recognised in equity, as a deduction to the amount issued. Amounts paid or received relating to sales or acquisitions of equity instruments are recognised in equity, net of transaction costs. Distributions related to equity instruments are deducted from equity, as dividends, when declared. Preference shares issued by the Group are considered as an equity instrument when the Group has no contractual obligation to redeem the shares and dividends are paid at the discretion of the Group. Preference shares issued by subsidiaries, classified as equity instruments and held by third parties, are included under non-controlling interest. h) Property, plant and equipment Items of Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. On transition to IFRS, on 1 January 2004, the Group decided to consider as deemed cost the revalued amount of Property, plant and equipment in accordance with the Group's previous accounting policy, which was comparable in general terms to the depreciated cost determined in accordance with IFRS. Subsequent costs are recognised as property, plant and equipment only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred, according to the accrual principle. The Group carries out impairment tests whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, being any impairment recognised in the income statement. 174 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 The recoverable amount is the higher of net selling price and value in use, the latter being calculated by the present value of the estimated future cash flows obtained from continued use of the asset and its sale at the end of its useful life. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation of tangible assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Number of years Buildings and other constructions 8 to 50 Plant and machinery: Hydroelectric generation 32 to 75 Thermoelectric generation 25 to 40 Renewable generation 25 Electricity distribution 10 to 40 Other plant and machinery 5 to 10 Transport equipment 4 to 25 Office equipment and tools 4 to 10 Other property, plant and equipment 10 to 25 According to IFRS, the estimate of the useful life of assets should be reviewed whenever a change occurs in the expected economic benefits flowing from the assets as well as when the technical use planned for the assets differs from previous estimates. Changes ocurring in the depreciation charge of the year are accounted for prospectively. Borrowing costs and other directly attributable costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of assets are capitalised as part of the cost of the assets. A qualifying asset is an asset that needs a substantial period of time to be ready for its intended use or sale. The amount of interest costs eligible for capitalisation is determined by applying a capitalisation rate to the expenditures on those assets. The capitalisation rate corresponds to the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the outstanding borrowings during the period. The capitalisation of borrowing costs begins when expenditure for the assets is being incurred, borrowing costs have been incurred and activities necessary to prepare all or part of the assets for their intended use or sale are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying assets for their intended use or sale are completed. Other expenses directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of the assets, such as cost of consumed materials and personnel costs, are also capitalised as part of the cost of the assets. Government grants Government grants are initially booked as deferred revenue, under non current liabilities only when there is reasonable certainty that the grant will be received and that the Group will fulfil the grant term conditions. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are booked in the income statement on a linear basis, on the same period in which the expenses are incurred. Grants that compensate the Group for the acquisition of assets are recognised in the income statement over the related assets useful life. Transfers of assets from customers The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) issued in November 2008, 2008 the interpretation IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers Customers. This interpretation was approved by the European Commission on 27 November 2009, being applicable for periods beginning after 31 October 2009. For EDP Group, the first period after the approval of this interpretation is the year 2010. IFRIC 18 is applicable for agreements in which an entity receives from a customer an item of Property, plant, and equipment that the entity must then use either to connect the customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of energy. This interpretation clarifies: ● the conditions in which an asset is under this interpretation; ● recognition of the asset and its initial measurement; ● identification of the services identified (one or more services in exchange for assets transferred); ● income recognition; and ● accounting for the transfer of money from customers. The Group adopted this interpretation for the allowances received from clients, recognising the assets received by its estimated construction cost against operating income. The assets are depreciated based on its useful life. i) Intangible assets The Group's intangible assets are booked at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The Group performs impairment reviews whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, any impairment being recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount is the higher of net selling price and value in use, the latter being calculated by the present value of the estimated future cash flows obtained from continued use of the asset and its sale at the end of its useful life. Acquisition and development of software The costs of purchasing software and the costs incurred by the Group to implement it are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the software. Costs incurred by the Group directly related to the development of software, that are expected to generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Such costs include employee costs directly associated to the project and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. 175 notes to the consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 december 2011 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. and 2010 Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 Software maintenance costs are charged to the income statement when incurred. Concession rights on distribution of electricity and gas The concession rights on distribution of electricity in Brazil and the concession rights related to the distribution of gas in Portugal, are recorded as intangible assets and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the concessions period, not exceeding 30 and 40 years, respectively. Concession rights to use the public hydric domain Portuguese concession rights to use the public hydric domain are booked as intangible assets and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the concession period, which currently does not exceed 45 years. EDP Group records as concession rights the financial compensations for the use of public domain assets, whenever these compensations are paid and for all the Group subsidiaries. The accounting policy related to intangible assets attributed to concessions is described in note 2aa), Group concession activities. Industrial property and other rights Industrial property and other rights are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets, which does not exceed 6 years. j) Leases The Group classifies its lease transactions as finance leases or operating leases based on the substance of the transaction rather than its legal form. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers to the lessee substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Operating leases Lease payments under operating lease contracts are recognised as an expense in the period to which they relate. Finance leases Finance leases are recognised by the lessee, at the inception of the lease, as assets and liabilities at the fair value of the leased assets which is equivalent to the present value of the future lease payments. Lease payments include the interest charges and the amortisation of the outstanding principal. The interest charges are recognised as costs over the lease period in order to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Lessors record assets held under finance leases as leased capital, by the net amount invested in the lease. Lease payments include the financial income and the amortisation of the outstanding principal. Financial results recognised reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding net balance of the lessor. Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease Following the issuance by International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, applicable from 1 January 2006, arrangements including transactions that, although do not take the form of a lease, convey the right to use an asset in return for a payment, are recognised as leases, provided that, in substance, they comply with the requirements defined in the interpretation. k) Investment property The Group classifies as investment property, property held for capital appreciation and/or for rental purposes. Investment property is recognised initially at acquisition or production cost, including directly attributable transaction costs, and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Subsequent expenditures on investment property are only added to the cost of the asset when it is probable that additional future economic benefits will arise when compared to initial recognition. l) Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of acquisition cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories includes purchases, conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated selling costs. The cost of inventories is determined by using the weighted average method. CO2 licenses held by the Group for trade purposes are booked as inventories and measured at fair value, at each balance sheet date, against the income statement. m) Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less impairment losses, are being presented in the statement of financial position net of impairment losses which are associated. 176 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 Impairment losses are recorded based on the regular assessment of the existence of objective evidence of impairment resulting from doubtful accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement, being subsequently reversed through the income statement if the estimated losses decrease, in a later period. n) Employee benefits Pensions Some EDP Group companies grant post-retirement benefits to employees under defined benefit and defined contribution plans, namely pension plans that grant retirement complementary benefits for age, disability and surviving pensions, as well as early retirement pensions. Defined benefit plans In Portugal, the defined benefit plan is funded through a closed Pension Fund complemented by a specific provision. The Pension Fund covers the liabilities for retirement pension complements as well as for early retirement. In Brazil, Bandeirante has two defined benefit plans managed by the CESP Foundation, a closed complementary welfare entity with its own assets, segregated from those of its sponsors. Escelsa has a defined benefit plan that grants complementary benefits for retirement due to age, disability and survival pensions. Escelsa also has a special complementary benefit plan for retired employees who served in the Brazilian army. The Group’s pension plans are defined benefit plans, since the criteria used to determine the amount of the pension to be received by employees on retirement is usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary level. In compliance with IFRS 1, the Group decided, on the transition date on 1 January 2004, to recognise the full amount of the deferred actuarial losses on that date against reserves. The Group’s pension liability for each plan is calculated annually at the balance sheet date, by independent experts individually for each plan, using the projected unit credit method. The discount rate used in the calculation is determined based on market interest rates of high quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have similar maturity to the related pension liability. Actuarial gains and losses resulting from (i) differences between financial and actuarial assumptions used and actual amounts and (ii) changes in the actuarial assumptions, are recognised against equity, in accordance with the alternative method defined by IAS 19. The increase in past service costs arising from early retirements (retirements before the normal retirement age) is recognised in the income statement when incurred. As described in note 2 a), the Group recognises as operational expenses, in the income statement, the current service cost and the effect of early retirements. Interest cost and estimated return of the fund assets are recognized as financial results. The assets of the plan comply with the recognition criteria established by IFRIC 14 IAS 19 and the minimum funding requirements established by law or by contract. Defined contribution plans In Portugal, Spain and Brazil, some companies have defined contribution social benefit plans that complement those granted by the Social Security System, under which they pay an annual contribution to the plans, calculated in accordance with the rules established in each plan. Other benefits Medical benefits and other plans In Portugal, Spain and in Brazil some EDP Group companies provide medical benefits during retirement and early retirement, through complementary benefits to those provided by the Social Security System. The medical benefits plans are classified as defined benefit plans, the liability being covered by provisions booked in the Group’s statement of financial position. Measurement and recognition of the medical benefits liabilities are similar to those of the defined benefit plans pension liabilities, explained above. Variable remuneration paid to employees In accordance with the by-laws of some Group companies, the shareholders approve in the Annual General Meeting a variable remuneration to be paid to the management and employees (bonus), following a proposal made by the Executive Board of Directors. The variable remuneration is charged to the income statement in the year to which it relates. o) Provisions Provisions are recognised when: (i) the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, (ii) it is probable that settlement will be required in the future and (iii) a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. Provisions for dismantling and decommissioning in electric power plants The Group accounts for provisions for dismantling and decommissioning of assets when there is a legal, contractual or constructive obligation at the end of the assets’ usefu life. Therefore, such provisions have been booked for the electric power plants to cover the cost of restoring the location and land to their original condition. The provisions are calculated at the present amount of the expected future liability and are accounted for as part of the cost of the related property, plant and equipment being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of those assets. 177 notes to the consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 december 2011S.A.and 2010 EDP Energias de Portugal, Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 Decommissioning and dismantling provisions are remeasured on an annual basis based on the best estimate of the settlement amount. The unwinding of the discount at each balance sheet date is charged to the income statement. p) Recognition of costs and revenues Costs and revenues are recognised in the year to which they relate regardless of when paid or received, in accordance with the accrual basis. Differences between amounts received and paid and the corresponding revenue and costs are recognised under other assets or other liabilities. Revenue includes amounts invoiced on the sale of products or services rendered, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after elimination of intra-group sales. The invoicing of electricity sales is performed on a monthly basis. Monthly electricity invoices are based on real meter readings or on estimated consumptions based on the historical data of each consumer. Revenues regarding the energy to be invoiced based on actual consumption not yet metered as at the balance sheet date is accrued on the basis of recent average consumptions. Differences between estimated and actual amounts are recorded in subsequent periods. q) Financial results Financial results include interest costs on borrowings, interest income on funds invested, dividend income, foreign exchange gains and losses, realised gains and losses, as well as gains and losses on financial instruments and changes in the fair value of hedged risks, when applicable. Interest is recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis. Dividend income is recognised on the date the right to receive is established. Financial results also include impairment losses on available-for-sale investments. r) Income tax Income tax recognised in the income statement includes current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Deferred taxes arising from the revaluation of available for sale investments and cash flow hedge derivatives recognised in equity are recognised in the income statement in the period the results that originated the deferred taxes are recognised. Current tax is the tax expected to be paid on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred taxes are calculated in accordance with the balance sheet liability method, considering temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax basis, using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date for each jurisdiction and that is expected to be applied when the temporary difference is reversed. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, differences arising on initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to absorb deductible temporary differences for taxation purposes. The Group offsets, as established in IAS 12, the deferred tax assets and liabilities if, and only if: (i) the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and (ii) the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in future periods in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered. s) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing consolidated and the company net profit attributable to the equity holders of EDP, S.A. by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, excluding the average number of shares held by the Group and by EDP, S.A., respectively. For the diluted earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding is adjusted to consider conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as convertible debt and stock options granted to employees. The dilution effect corresponds to a decrease in earnings per share resulting from the assumption that the convertible instruments are converted or the options granted are exercised. t) Share based payments The stock options remuneration program enables the Group's employees to acquire EDP, S.A. shares. The exercise price of the options is calculated based on the listed price of the shares at the grant date. The fair value of the options granted, determined at the grant date, is recognised in the income statement against equity during the vesting period, based on their market value calculated at the grant date. If the option is exercised, the Group acquires shares in the market to grant them to employees. 178 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 u) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets or groups of non-current assets held for sale (groups of assets and related liabilities that include at least one non-current asset) are classified as held for sale when their carrying amounts will be recovered mainly through sale, the assets or groups of assets are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable. The Group also classifies as non-current assets held for sale, non-current assets or groups of assets acquired exclusively for its subsequent resale, that are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the measurement of all non-current assets and all assets and liabilities included in a disposal group, is adjusted in accordance with the applicable IFRS standards. Subsequently, these assets or disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. v) Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include balances with maturity of less than three months from the balance sheet date, including cash and deposits in banks. w) Segment reporting The Group presents the operational segments based on internal management information. A business segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing an individual product or service or a group of related products or services and that is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing an individual product or service or a group of related products or services within a particular economic environment and that is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of components operating in other economic environments. x) Tariff adjustments In regulated activities, the regulator establishes through the tariff adjustment mechanism, the criteria to recognise gains or losses of one period in future periods. The tariff adjustments accounted for in the EDP Group financial statements represent the difference between the amounts invoiced by portuguese regulated companies (based on the applicable tariffs published by ERSE in December of the previous year) and the regulated revenue calculated based on actual costs. The assets or liabilities resulting from the tariff adjustments are recovered or returned through the electricity and gas tariffs charged to customers in subsequent periods. Decree-Law 165/2008 of 21 August recognised the unconditional right of the regulated operators of the electric sector to recover the tariff adjustments under a regime identical to the one used for the tariff deficits. Consequently, EDP Group booked under the income statement caption Turnover of Electricity and network accesses the effects resulting from the recognition of tariff adjustments, against Debtors and other assets. According to the referred Decree-Law, the tariff adjustments determined annually, will be recovered by the regulated operators even in case of insolvency or cease of operations. ERSE is the entity responsible to establish the method to ensure that the entity entitled to these rights continues to recover the tariff adjustments until its complete payment. The Decree-Law also allows the transfer of the right to receive the tariff adjustment to third parties, in whole or in part, through future electricity tariffs. Decree-Law 87/2011 approved on 14 April and published in Diário da República on 17 July, confirmed the unconditional right of the regulated operators of the natural gas sector to recover the tariff adjustments. Consequently, EDP Group booked under the income statement caption Turnover of Gas and network accesses the effects resulting from the recognition of tariff adjustments against Debtors and other assets and Trade and other payables , in the same terms defined for the electric sector as mentioned above. y) CO2 licenses and greenhouse effect gas emission The Group holds CO2 licenses in order to deal with gas emissions resulting from its operational activity and licenses acquired for trading. The CO2 licenses held for own use and attributed free of charge are booked as intangible assets against Deferred Income Subsidies and are valued at the quoted price in the Bluenext market on the grant date, usually at the beginning of each year. The use of the licenses is based on actual gas emissions in the period, valued at the quoted price on the date of attribution. Amortisation of Deferred Income Subsidies is made in the year in which the subsidy is granted. When the emissions of the year exceed the CO2 licenses attributed for free, a provision is booked to cover for the costs of acquiring the necessary additional licenses at the balance sheet date. The licenses held by the Group for trading purposes are booked under inventories at acquisition cost, subsequently adjusted to the respective fair value, calculated on the basis of the Bluenext market quote in the last working day of each month. Gains and losses resulting from these adjustments are recognised in the income statement of the period. z) Cash Flow Statement The Cash Flow Statement is presented under the direct method, by which gross cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities are disclosed. The Group classifies cash flows related to interest and dividends received and paid as investing and financing activities, respectively. aa) Group concession activities The International Financial Reporting Commitee (IFRIC) issued in July 2007, IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements. This interpretation was approved by the European Commission on 25 March 2009 and is applicable for the annual periods beginning after that date. In the case of the EDP Group, the first annual period after the approval date is 2010 and, therefore, the EDP Group adopted IFRIC 12 for comparative purposes as of 1 January 2009. Under the terms of IFRIC 12, this interpretation was applied prospectively considering that the retrospective application was impraticable. The effect of the retrospective application would have a similar effect as a prospective application. 179 notes to the consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 december 2011 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. and 2010 Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 IFRIC 12 is applicable to public-private concession contracts in which the public entity controls or regulates the services rendered through the utilisation of certain infrastructure as well as the price for such services and also controls any significant residual interest in the infrastructure. According to IFRIC 12, the infrastructure allocated to concessions are not recognised by the operator as a tangible fixed assets or as a financial lease, as the operator does not control the assets. The infrastructure are recognised according to one of the following accounting models, depending on the type of remuneration commitment of the operator assumed by the grantor within the terms of the contract: Financial Asset Model This model is applicable when the operator has an unconditional right to receive certain monetary amounts regardless of the level of use of the infrastructure within the concession and results in the recognition of a financial asset, booked at amortised cost. Intangible Asset Model This model is applicable when the operator, within the concession, is remunerated on the basis of the level of use of the infrastructure (demand risk) and results in the recognition of an intangible asset. Mixed Model This model is applicable when the concession includes simultaneously guaranteed remuneration and remuneration based on the level of use of the infrastructure within the concession. Under the terms of concession contracts of EDP Group to which IFRIC 12 is applicable, the construction activities are outsourced to specialised entities. Therefore, EDP Group has no margin in the construction of assets assigned to concessions. The revenue and the expenditure with the acquisition of these assets have equal amounts (see note 7). Intangible assets within concessions are depreciated over their respective useful lives during the concession period. The Group carries out impairment tests to the intangible assets within concessions whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, being any impairment recognised in the income statement. Grants received from customers related to assets within concessions are delivered to the Group on a definitive basis, and, therefore, are not reimbursable. These grants are deducted from the value of the assets allocated to each concession. 3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS IN PREPARING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IFRS require the use of judgement and the making of estimates in the decision process about certain accounting treatments, with impact in total assets, liabilities, equity, costs and income. The actual effects may differ from these estimates and judgements, namely in relation to the effect of actual costs and income. The main accounting estimates and judgements used in applying the accounting policies are discussed in this note in order to improve the understanding of how its application affects the Group’s reported results and disclosures. A broader description of the accounting policies employed by the Group is disclosed in note 2 to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Considering that in many cases there are alternatives to the accounting treatment adopted by EDP Group, the reported results could differ if a different treatment was chosen. The Executive Board of Directors believes that the choices made are appropriate and that the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the Group’s financial position and results. The alternative outcomes discussed below are presented solely to assist the reader in understanding the financial statements and are not intended to suggest that other alternatives or estimates would be more appropriate. Impairment of available-for-sale investments The Group determines that available-for-sale investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in their fair value. Determination of a significant or prolonged decline requires judgement. In making this judgement, the Group assesses, among other factors, the normal share price volatility, assuming as significant a decline of more than 20% in listed shares. In addition, valuations are generally obtained through market prices or determined by external entities, or through valuation models that require assumptions or judgment in making estimates of fair value. Alternative methodologies and the use of different assumptions and estimates could result in different impairment losses being recognised with a consequent impact in the Group’s income statement. Fair value of financial instruments Fair values are based on listed market prices, if available, otherwise fair value is determined either by the price of similar recent transactions under market conditions or determined by external entities, or by pricing models based on net present value of estimated future cash flows techniques considering market conditions, time value, yield curves and volatility factors. These methodologies may require the use of assumptions or judgements in estimating fair values. Consequently, the use of different methodologies or different assumptions or judgements in applying a particular model, could have produced different financial results from those reported. Contractual Stability Compensation CMEC Following a Portuguese Government decision to extinguish the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), EDP and REN agreed to the early termination of the PPAs, with effect from 1 July 2007. 180 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 As a result of the PPAs termination and in accordance with the applicable legislation, a contractual stability compensation (CMEC) was granted to EDP Group. The mechanism for granting the compensation includes three types of compensation: initial compensation, compensation resulting from the revisable mechanism and final compensation. Initial compensation was recognised when the PPAs terminated as an account receivable of 833,467 thousands of Euros, booked at its net present value, against deferred income. Part of the initial compensation is recognised as operating income each year against a reduction of the deferred initial compensation. According to the applicable legislation, securitization of this amount is possible. Compensation resulting from the revisable mechanism refers to the correction of the initial compensation for each year considering the actual conditions and is recognised as a loss or gain in the year to which it relates. Final compensation will be calculated in accordance with the terms defined by the legislation relating to the termination of the PPAs, after termination of the revisable mechanism period (10 years). Interest resulting from the discount rate used is booked in the period to which it relates, based on the respective implicit rate, against income for each period. Contractual Stability Compensation – Revisable mechanism The revisable mechanism consists in correcting on an annual basis, for a period of 10 years after termination of the PPAs, the positive and negative variations between the estimates made to calculate the initial stability compensation for a period and the actual amounts occurred in the market for that period. This mechanism gives rise to compensation resulting from the correction of the estimate referred to as CMEC revisable mechanism. In each period, the EDP Group calculates the CMEC considering market prices and the actual quantities sold, using the assumptions defined in the Valorágua model, according to the current legislation. Consequently, the use of different methodologies or assumptions from the model used, could give rise to different financial results from those considered. Review of the useful life of the generation assets In 2010 EDP Gestão de Produção, S.A. reviewed the useful lives of the hydroelectric and thermoelectric generating assets which, consequently, led to a prospective change in the depreciation charge of the period. The useful lives of the hydroelectric power plants were redefined based on an assessment performed by an external entity of the corresponding equipment, considering its current conservation state and the future maintenance plan. Based on this information, the remaining useful lives were identified for each asset, being the maximum term established at the corresponding final date of the public hydric domain associated to each hydroelectric power plant. This analysis considered the use of estimates and judgement in order to determine the useful lives of these assets. In the second quarter of 2011 EDPR Group changed the useful life of the wind farms from 20 to 25 years. The redefinition of the useful life of the wind generation assets was based on a technical study performed by an independent entity which considered the technical availability for an additional period of 5 years of useful life of these assets. The referred study covered 95% of wind installed capacity of EDPR Group, in the different geographies (Europe and North America), considering assumptions and estimates that required judgement. Tariff adjustments Tariff adjustments in Portugal represent the difference between costs and income of the National Electricity and Gas System, estimated at the beginning of each period for purposes of calculating the tariff, and the actual costs and income of the System established at the end of each period. The tariff adjustments assets or liabilities are recovered or returned through electricity tariffs to customers in subsequent periods. Considering the current legislation which establishes an unconditional right of the regulated operators to recover or return the tariff adjustments, the EDP Group booked in the caption Electricity and Gas sales of the period, period the effects of the recognition of the tariff adjustment, adjustment against Other debtors / Other Creditors. Creditors Under the current legislation, legislation regulated companies can also sell to a third party, in whole or in part, the right to receive the tariff adjustments through the electricity and gas tariffs. Tariff deficit In Portugal, the Decree-Law 237-B/2006, of 19 December 2006, recognised an unconditional right of the operators of the binding sector to recover the tariff deficit of 2006 and part of deficit of 2007, regardless of the form of its future payment or in situations of insolvency and cease of operations. The Decree-Law also allows the transfer of the tariff deficit collection right to a third party. In 2008, the EDP Group sold unconditionally the tariff deficit of 2006 and 2007. In 2009, the tariff deficits regarding 2008 and the remaining part of 2007 were transferred, as well as the non-regular tariff adjustment regarding the estimated overcost of the special regime production for 2009. In September 2011, the EDP Group sold unconditional tariff adjustment for the additional cost of cogeneration for the period 2009-2011. In Spain, Royal Decree 1634/2006, published in December 2006, established the electricity tariff for the period starting on 1 January 2007. This Royal Decree established the method of recovering the 2006 deficit, and that as from 1 July 2007 tariffs for the sale of electric energy by distribution companies will be modified quarterly by Royal Decree. Order ITC/2794/2007 of 27 September, which revises electricity tariffs as from 1 October 2007 was issued in compliance with Royal Decree 1634/2006. As at 29 December 2007, Order ITC/3860/2007 of 28 December, revised the electricity tariffs, from 1 January 2008. Spanish Royal Decree Law 6/2009, published on 7 May 2009 establishes, among other matters: (i) the possibility to securitise the Spanish tariff deficit supported by the electric sector companies through a State guarantee; (ii) the calendar for the elimination of the tariff deficit, such that on 1 January 2013, access tariffs will be enough to cover regulated activities’ costs, without the creation of an ex-ante tariff deficit and, in order to ease this gradual elimination, the Royal Decree Law also provides for the passage of some costs currently included in the electricity tariff to the Spanish State Budget; (iii) the revocation, as from 1 July 2009, of Royal Decree Law 11/2007, which established the obligation to return the additional revenues obtained from the incorporation of CO2 costs in markets prices, and which was to be in force until 2012; (iv) the creation of a social subsidy, which translates to a lower tariff for low income consumers and (v) the charge to electric companies of the costs with the management and treatment of radioactive waste from nuclear power plants and fuels consumed. EDP Group considers, based on the legislation issued, that the requirements for the recognition of tariff deficits as receivables against the income statement are accomplished. Impairment of long term assets and Goodwill Impairment tests are performed, whenever there is a trigger that the recoverable amount of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets is less than the corresponding net book value of the assets. 181 notes to the consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 december 2011 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. and 2010 Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 On an annual basis the Group reviews the assumptions used to assess the existence of impairment in goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shares in subsidiaries. The assumptions used are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic indicators and business assumptions used by management. The goodwill in associates is reviewed when circumstances indicate the existence of impairment. Considering the uncertainties regarding the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill as they are based on the best information available, changes in the assumptions can result in changes in the determination of the amount of impairment and, consequently, on the Group’s results. Doubtful debts Impairment losses related to doubtful debts are estimated by EDP based on the estimated recoverable amounts, the date of default, debt write offs and other factors. Certain circumstances and facts may change the estimated impairment losses of doubtful debts, namely changes in the economic environment, economic sector trends, client’s credit risk and increases in the rate of defaults. The evaluation process in determining whether an impairment loss should be recorded in the income statement is subject to numerous estimates and judgement. Changes in the estimates and judgement could change the impairment test results which could affect the Group’s reported results. Revenue recognition Electricity sales revenue is recognised when the monthly electricity invoices are issued, based on actual meter readings or estimated consumption based on the historical data of each consumer. Revenue relating to electricity to be invoiced, regarding consumption up to the balance sheet date but not measured, is booked based on estimates which take into consideration factors such as consumption in prior periods and analysis relating to the energy balance of the operations. The use of different estimates and assumptions can affect the Group’s revenue and, consequently, its reported results. Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in several jurisdictions. Certain interpretations and estimates are required in determining the global amount of income tax. There are several transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Different interpretations and estimates could result in a different level of income taxes, current and deferred, recognised in the period. In Portugal, the Tax Authorities are entitled to review the EDP, S.A. and its subsidiaries determination of its annual taxable earnings, for a period of four years for annual periods starting from 2010 and six years for previous annual periods in case of tax losses carried forward. As a result, it is possible that some additional taxes may be assessed, mainly as a result of differences in interpretation of the tax law. However, EDP Group and its subsidiaries believe that there will be no significant corrections to the income tax booked in the financial statements. Pensions and other employee benefits Determining pension and other employee benefits liabilities requires the use of assumptions and estimates, including actuarial projections, estimated rates of return on investments, discount rates and pension and salary growth and other factors that can impact the cost and liability of the pension, medical plans and other benefits. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the amounts determined. Provisions for dismantling and decommissioning of power generation units The EDP Group considers that there are legal, contractual or constructive obligations to dismantle and decommission of Property, plant and equipment assets allocated to electricity generation operations. The Group records provisions in accordance with existing obligations to cover the present value of the estimated cost to restore the locations and land where the electricity generations units are located. The calculation of the provisions is based on estimates of the present value of the future liabilities. The use of different assumptions in the estimates and judgement from those referred to could lead to different financial results than those considered. 4. FINANCIAL-RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES Financial risk management The EDP Group’s business is exposed to a variety of financial risks, including the effect of changes in market prices, foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group’s exposure to financial risks arises essentially from its debt portfolio, resulting in interest and exchange rate exposures. The unpredictability of the financial markets is analysed on an on-going basis in accordance with the Group’s risk management policy. Derivative financial instruments are used to minimise potential adverse effects, resulting from interest rate and/or foreign exchange rate risks on EDP Group's financial performance. The management of financial risks of EDP, S.A., EDP Finance, B.V. and other EDP Group entities is undertaken centrally by the Financial Department of EDP S.A., in accordance with policies approved by the Executive Board of Directors. The Financial Department identifies, evaluates and submits to the Board for approval, hedging mechanisms appropriate to each exposure. The Executive Board of Directors is responsible for the definition of general risk management principles and the establishment of exposure limits. All transactions undertaken using derivative financial instruments require prior approval by the Executive Board of Directors, which defines the parameters of each transaction and approves the formal documents describing their objectives. As for the subsidiaries in Brazil, the Local Risk Management Department is responsible for the management of market risks arising from fluctuation in interest and exchange rates. This management is performed according to the principles/policies set by the EDP Group for this geographical area. 182 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 Exchange-rate risk management EDP, S.A. Financial Department is responsible for managing exchange rate risk exposure resulting from foreign currency loans, seeking to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the financial costs of the EDP Group companies and, consequently, on the consolidated results, through exchange rate derivative financial instruments and/or other hedging structures. The policy implemented by the EDP Group consists of undertaking derivative financial instruments to hedge exchange rate risk with characteristics similar to those of the hedged asset or liability. The operations are revalued and monitored throughout their useful lives and, periodically, their effectiveness in controlling and hedging the risk that gave rise to them is evaluated. EDP Group is exposed to the exchange rate risk in US Dollars (USD), British Pounds (GBP), Japanese Yen (JPY), Brazilian Reais (BRL) and Zloty (PLN). Currently, the exposure to EUR/USD and EUR/PLN exchange rate risk results essentially from investments of EDP Group in wind parks in the USA and Poland. These investments were financed with debt contracted in USD and PLN, which allows to mitigate the exchange rate risk related to the investments. The Brazilian subsidiaries exposed to the USD/BRL exchange rate risk as a result of their USD debt, use derivative financial instruments to hedge this risk. Additionally, investments in the Brazilian subsidiaries, whose net assets expressed in BRL are exposed to exchange rate risks, are monitored through analysis of the evolution of the BRL/EUR exchange rate. Given the long term nature defined for the investments in the Brazilian subsidiaries, the Group has decided not to use financial instruments to hedge the exchange rate risk on the investment in these subsidiaries. The exchange rate and interest rate risk on the GBP, CHF and JPY bonds issued by EDP Finance B.V. under the Medium Term Notes Program for the Issuance of Debt Instruments have been hedged as from their issuing date. The EDP Group’s remaining debt, except for the debt contracted by the Brazilian subsidiaries, is denominated in Euros. Sensitivity analysis exchange rate Relating to financial instruments that result in an exchange rate risk exposure, a fluctuation of 10% in the Euro exchange rate in relation to the following currencies, as at 31 December 2011 and 2010, would lead to an increase/(decrease) in the EDP Group results and equity as follows: Dec 2011 Results Equity Thousands of Euros +10% -10% +10% -10% USD 12,432 -15,195 -755 923 PLN 3,309 -4,044 12,432 -15,195 2,554 -3,121 Dec 2010 Results Equity Thousands of Euros +10% -10% +10% -10% USD 7,485 -9,148 -15,995 19,550 PLN 3,584 -4,381 4,381 7,485 -9,148 -12,411 15,169 This analysis assumes that all other variables, namely interest rates, remain unchanged. Interest rate risk management The aim of the interest rate risk management policies is to reduce the financial charges and to reduce the exposure to interest rate risk from market fluctuations through the settlement of derivative financial instruments. In the floating rate financing context, the EDP Group contracts interest rate derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows associated with future interest payments, which have the effect of converting floating interest rate loans into fixed interest rate loans. Long-term loans contracted at fixed rates are, when appropriate, converted into floating rate loans through interest rate derivative financial instruments designed to reduce financial charges and to level them to market conditions. In addition to these operations, more structured collar operations are contracted, as necessary, to mitigate exposure of the debt cash flows to market rate fluctuations. All the operations are undertaken on liabilities in the EDP Group’s debt portfolio and mainly involve perfect hedges, resulting in a high level of correlation between the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the changes in fair value of the interest rate risk or future cash flows. The EDP Group has a portfolio of interest rate derivatives with maturities between approximately 1 and 17 years. The Group’s Financial Department undertakes sensitivity analyses of the fair value of financial instruments to interest rate fluctuations. After the covering effect of the derivatives 50% of the Group's liabilities are fixed rate. 183 notes to the consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 december 2011S.A.and 2010 EDP Energias de Portugal, Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 Sensitivity analysis Interest rates (excluding the Brazilian operations) Based on the debt portfolio contracted by the Group, except for Brazil and the related derivative financial instruments used to hedge the related interest rate risk, a 100 basis points change in the reference interest rates at 31 December 2011 and 2010 would lead to the following increases / (decreases) in equity and results of the EDP Group: Dec 2011 Results Equity 100 bp 100 bp 100 bp 100 bp Thousands of Euros increase decrease increase decrease Cash flow effect: Hedged debt -19,082 19,082 Unhedged debt -66,160 66,160 Fair value effect: Cash flow hedging derivatives 47,501 -51,429 Trading derivatives (accounting perspective) -7,884 4,658 -93,126 89,900 47,501 -51,429 Dec 2010 Results Equity 100 bp 100 bp 100 bp 100 bp Thousands of Euros increase decrease increase decrease Cash flow effect: Hedged debt -27,277 27,277 Unhedged debt -64,241 64,241 Fair value effect: Cash flow hedging derivatives 36,981 -40,988 Trading derivatives (accounting perspective) -25,659 28,386 -117,177 119,904 36,981 -40,988 This analysis assumes that all other variables, namely exchange rates, remain unchanged. Counterparty credit risk management The EDP Group’s policy in terms of counterparty risk on financial transactions is managed through an analysis of the technical capacity, competitiveness, credit rating and exposure to each counterparty, avoiding significant concentrations of credit risk. Counterparties in derivative financial instruments are credit institutions with high credit risk rating notation and therefore the risk of counterparty default is not considered to be significant. Guarantees and other collaterals are not required on these transactions. The EDP Group has documented its financial operations in accordance with international standards. Therefore, generally, derivative financial instruments are contracted under ISDA Master Agreements. Regarding the third-party debt generated by the Group’s day-to-day business, the credit risk arises essentially from the legal obligation of providing continuous low-tension electricity supplies even when there are payment delays. delays This risk is considered to be mitigated by the large number of customers and by their diversity in terms of sectors of activity, as well as by the large volume of residential customers. Liquidity risk management The EDP Group undertakes management of liquidity risk through the engagement and maintenance of credit lines and financing facilities with a firm underwriting commitment with national and international financial institutions allowing immediate access to funds. These lines are used to complement and backup national and international commercial paper programmes, allowing the EDP Group’s short-term financing sources to be diversified (see note 36). Energy market risk management In its operations in the non-regulated Iberian electricity market, EDP Group purchases fuel to generate electric energy and sells the electric energy generated by its plants in the organised market (OMEL and OMIP) as well as to third parties. The Group is exposed to energy market risks namely in its operations in the non-regulated market. Some electricity generating plants despite operating in the market, are subject to the CMEC legislation, and the changes in the operating margins are determined essentially by the difference between the prices in the market and the reference indexes defined in the contracts. As a result of its energy management operations, EDP Group has a portfolio of operations relating to electric energy, carbon emissions (CO2) and fuel (coal, fuel and gas). The portfolio is managed through the engagement of operations with financial and physical settlement on the forward energy markets. The objective of the operations is to reduce volatility of the financial impact resulting from the positions managed and also to benefit from arbitration or positioning within the trading limits approved by the Executive Board of Directors. The financial instruments traded include swaps (electricity, brent and coal) and forwards to fix prices. The activity of energy management is subject to a series of variables which are identified and classified based on their common uncertainty characteristics (or risk). Such risks include market price evolution risk (electricity and fuel) and hydroelectric production volume risk (price and volume risk), as well as credit risk of the counterparties. Monitoring the price, volume and credit risks includes their quantification in terms of positions at risk which can be adjusted through market operations. This quantification is made by using specific models that value positions so as to determine the maximum loss that can be incurred, with a given probability and a determined time frame. Risks are managed in accordance with the strategies defined by the Executive Board of Directors, which are subject to periodic review based on the evolution of the operations, in order to change the profile of the positions and adjust them to the management objectives established. 184 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 Risks are monitored by means of a series of actions involving daily monitoring of the different risk indicators, of the operations grouped in the systems and the prudence limits defined by management area and risk component, as well as regular backtesting and supplementary validation of the models and assumptions used. This monitoring not only ensures the effectiveness of the strategies implemented, but also provides elements to enable initiatives to be taken to correct them if necessary. The principal price and volume risk indicator used is the margin at risk (P@R), which estimates the impact of the variation of the different risk factors (price of electricity and hydrological) on the following year’s margin, P@R corresponding to the difference between an expected margin and a pessimistic scenario with a probability to occur of 5% (confidence interval of 95%) considering a time frame of 1 year. Both the volumes which are certain and those, which although uncertain, are expected, namely production of the plants and the corresponding consumption of fuel, are considered. P@R Distribution by risk factor Thousands of Euros Dec 2011 Dec 2010 Risk factor: Negociation 2,000 1,000 Fuel 45,000 41,000 CO2 1,000 3,000 Electricity 19,000 36,000 Hydrological 19,000 20,000 Diversification effect -66,000 -74,000 Total 20,000 27,000 Regarding credit risk, the quantification of exposure considers the amount and type of transaction (eg. swap or forward), the rating of the counterparty risk that depends on the probability of default and the expected value of credit to recover, which varies depending on the guarantees received or the existence of netting agreements. As at 31 December 2011 and 2010 the EDP Group's exposure to credit risk rating is as follows: Dec 2011 Dec 2010 Credit risk rating (S&P): AAA to AA12.44% 18.06% A+ to A81.15% 75.69% BBB+ to BBB3.43% 0.90% BB+ to B0.47% 1.11% No rating assigned 2.51% 4.24% Total 100.00% 100.00% Brazil – Interest rate and exchange rate risk management The main tool used to monitor and control market risk in the Brazilian subsidiaries is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is the maximum expected loss on the operations portfolio over a specific period of time, resulting from an adverse movement in the market that has a specific confidence interval. The VaR model used is based on a confidence interval of 95% and assumes a 10 day time frame for settlement of positions, based essentially on historical data. Considering market data for the last 2 years and observation of the relationship between the different prices and markets, the model generates a series of scenarios for changes in market prices. prices The VaR methodology used in Brazil considers a series of stress tests with the objective of monitoring the financial impact of the different market scenarios. The summary of VaR on the operations of the Brazilian subsidiaries at 31 December 2011 and 2010 is as follows: VaR Thousands of Euros Dec 2011 Dec 2010 Exchange rate risk 677 461 Interest rate risk 3,747 3,638 Covariation -604 -421 Total 3,820 3,678 5.

INCOME TAX In accordance with current legislation, tax returns are subject to review and correction by the tax authorities during subsequent periods. In Portugal and Spain the period is 4 years and in Brazil it is 5 years, being the last year considered as definitively settled by the tax administration the year of 2005. In the United States of America the general Statute of Limitations for the IRS to issue additional income tax assessments for an entity is 3 years as from the date that the income tax return is filed by the taxpayer. Tax losses generated in each year, which are also subject to inspection and adjustment, can be deducted from taxable income during subsequent periods (4 years in Portugal since 2010, 18 years in Spain, 20 years in the United States, without an expiry date in Belgium and France and without an expiry date in Brazil, although in Brazil it is limited to 30% of the taxable income of each period). The EDP Group companies are taxed, whenever possible, on a consolidated basis as allowed by the tax legislation of the respective countries. In August 2011, the Royal Decree-Law 9/2011 was approved, providing for the implementation of a set of measures on the Spanish regime on income taxation. From 1 January 2012 onwards, the tax losses carry forward period is extended from 15 to 18 years. In 2010 and 2011, a decision from the Supreme Administrative Court issued decisions in relation to the municipal surcharge calculation in the Special Taxation of Groups of Companies (RETGS), which confirmed that the Tax Authorities interpretation (Published letter number 20,132, of 14 April 2008) was not in accordance with the law. According to the referred decisions, the payment of municipal surcharge under RETGS should be calculated over the taxable profit of the group instead of over the taxable profit of each company included in the group, and not in accordance with the tax authorities interpretation. In previous years as a result of the Portuguese Tax Authorities interpretations regarding municipal surcharge and the underlying IT transaction systems used by the tax authorities, EDP paid in excess the referred municipal surcharge related to the RETGS of 31,6 million Euros. As a result, as of 31 December 2011, the municipal surcharge to be recovered regarding the years 2007 to 2010 totals to 31,6 million Euros, over which will accrue the amount of 11,5 million Euros in respect of the 2011 municipal surcharge. Taking into consideration the contingent nature of these receivables, none of them are recognised in the 2011 financial statements, except for the 2007 municipal surcharge of 10 million Euros, Euros for which EDP received a formal favourable decision from the Administrative Court In respect of the municipal surcharge paid in excess over the years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, EDP has used all available legal means in order to recover such amounts. On 30 December 2001, the Administrative Court of Lisbon formally released a decision in favour of EDP regarding the 2007 municipal surcharge. Following to the referred decision, EDP recognised in income of 10 million Euros.

Consequently, the total income tax rate applicable in Portugal to the entities with taxable income exceeding that amount, was increased to 29%. The Law 64-A/2011 of 30 December, (2012 State Budget Law), modified the above referred tax, where the State surcharge applies (i) at a rate of 3% over taxable income in the range of 1,5 to 10 million Euros, and (ii) at a rate of 5% over taxable income exceeding 10 million Euros. In accordance with n.º 4 of Article 116º of this Law, such modification applies for a two year period starting in 1 January 2012. Accordingly, during 2012 and 2013, the corporate income tax rate in Portugal applicable to entities with taxable income exceeding 10 million Euros will be 31,5%.

During 2010, the goodwill from Hidrocantabrico Group decreased by 16,663 thousands of Euros as a result of the revaluation of the liability relating to the anticipated acquisition of minority interests from Cajastur, through the written put option held by this entity over 3.13% of the share capital of HC Energia, as described under accounting policies note 2b). EDP Renováveis Group The goodwill held in EDP Renováveis Group, with reference to 31 December 2011 and 2010, is analysed as follows: EDP Renováveis Group Thousands of Euros Dec 2011 Dec 2010 Goodwill in EDPR Europe Group 697,691 748,680 Goodwill in EDPR North America Group 611,882 592,915 Goodwill in EDPR BR Group 1,560 1,699 1,311,133 1,343,294 The decrease in EDPR Europe goodwill in the amount of 12,846 thousands of Euros, results from the redefinition of the final price of the liability related with the put option of Caja Madrid over the non-controlling interest held by this entity over Genesa in the amount of 3,363 thousands of Euros (see note 41) and the sale of Subgrupo Veinco by 9,483 thousands of Euros. On the other hand in 2011, the impairment in EDPR Italia Group goodwill, relates essentially with an update of the assumptions in the estimatives of MW to install and future energy prices of 34,737 thousands of Euros (see notes 8 and 13). The variation of EDPR North America goodwill is related to exchange differences. During 2010, the increase in EDP Renováveis Group includes the amount of 57,781 thousands of thousands of Euros s from the acquisition of the EDPR Italia. During 2011 the decrease in EDP Renováveis Group subgroup is related with the revaluation of the put option of Caja Madrid over Genesa amounting to 68,968 thousands of Euros. 200 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 Goodwill impairment test analysis – EDP Group The recoverable amount of the goodwill in subsidiaries is assessed annually, independently of the existence of any indicators of impairment. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount is determined based on the value in use of the assets, calculated using valuation methodologies supported by discounted cash flow techniques, considering market conditions, the time value of money and the business risks. The recoverable amount testing is performed for each cash flow generating unit, identified in each country where EDP Group develops its activities/operations, namely: ● HC Energia (including Naturgás) Generation, Distribution & supply of electricity and Distribution & supply of gas; ● EDP Renováveis Europe – Wind generation; ● EDP Renováveis North America and Brazil Wind generation; ● EDP Brasil Generation, Distribution, and supply. Therefore, for the purposes of these tests, the EDP Group has defined a set of assumptions to determine the recoverable amount of the main investments of the Group. Goodwill impairment test analysis – HC Energia Group (including Naturgás) The discount rates used by the Group in the impairment test analysis range between 6.3% and 7.2% (2010: between 5.6% and 6.4% respectively). In the generation business, the cash-flow projections correspond to the remaining useful lives of the power plants. In the electricity and gas distribution business, the cashflows are projected in a four year period, where in the 5th year a perpetuity is used with a 1% growth rate. The main assumptions on which impairment tests are based are as follows: Energy produced by the power plants: the best estimates were prepared taking into consideration future market demand and total installed capacity; Prices of electricity, gas and coal: future price curves based on external recognised data bases were prepared with internal knowledge developed historically and considering regulation in force. Contracted prices for future purchases were also used as applicable in each case; Operating costs: Operating costs were projected consistent with the company’s experience and internal models; In the regulated business, namely in the distribution of electricity and gas, the contracted or officially approved remuneration was used, applying the regulated mechanisms for the annual remuneration updates. The Group has performed a series of sensitivity analyses of the results of impairment tests to changes in some of the key variables, such as (i) uncontracted generation margins and (ii) Discount rate. This sensitivity analysis of considering (i) a 5% decrease in estimated generation margins, or (ii) a +50bps increase on the discount rate did not result in any impairment indicators. Goodwill impairment test analysis – EDP Renováveis The future cash flows projection period used is the remaining useful life of the assets which is consistent with the estimated useful life of our wind farms and with the current depreciation d i ti method. th d This Thi isi also l supportedt d by b the l t th long-term off-take ff t k contracts t t in i place l andd possibility ibilit off utilizing tili i estimated ti t d price i curves The main assumptions on which impairment tests are based are as follows: Power produced: net capacity factors used for each CGU utilize wind studies carried out, taking into consideration (i) the installed capacity and the long-term forecasts of wind output and (ii) the regulatory mechanisms that allow for production whenever weather conditions permit; Electricity remuneration: approved or contracted remuneration has been applied where available, as for the CGUs that benefit from regulated remuneration or that have signed contracts to sell their output a pre-determined during their useful life; where this is not available, prices were derived using price curves projected by the company based on its experience, internal models and using external data sources; New capacity: tests were based on the best information available on the wind farms due to come operational in coming years and considered the contracted and expected prices to buy turbines from various suppliers, adjusted by the probability the projects planned are to be successfully completed and by the growth prospects of the company based on the Business Plan Targets, its historical growth and market size projections; Operating costs: established contracts for land leases and maintenance agreements were used; other operating costs were projected consistent with the company’s experience and internal models; Terminal value: it is used as a percentage of the initial investment in each CGU, considering inflation; Discount rate: the discount rates used reflects the Group’s best estimate of the risks specific to each CGU and range as follows: 2011 2010 EDPR EU 6.1% 8.6% 5.3% 7.7% EDPR NA and EDPR BR 5.0% 8.3% 6.1% 9.1% The Group has performed a series of sensitivity analyses of the results of impairment tests to changes in some of the key variables, such as (i) Net Capacity Factor, (ii) Electricity remuneration, (iii) Capital expenditure in new windfarms, and (iv) Discount rate. This sensitivity analysis does not lead into any imparity on EDPR EU nor EDPR NA and EDPR BR, apart from Italy where an increased in the discount rate of +25bp’s and +50bp’s would result in the recognition of an impairment loss between 4.6M€ and 9.0M€, respectively. 201 notes to the consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 december 2011S.A.and 2010 EDP Energias de Portugal, Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 On 28th of January 2012 the Spanish Government enacted Royal-Decree Law 1/2012 that approves a temporary suspension of the premium remuneration for renewable energy capacity not included in the pre-assignation registry. Despite this regulation, the Government has emphasized its commitment towards achieving the 2020 Renewable Energy Target for Spain. Within EDPR’s pipeline, wind farms already included in the registry will not be affected by this new regulation. EDPR planned and valued its pipeline using conservative criteria not considering the existence of a new regulatory scheme. Therefore, there is no economic impact either on the value of EDPR´s pipeline nor on the overall company. A sensitivity analysis considering one-year delay in the construction of wind farms affected by this new regulation does not result in relevant impairment losses in the assets value. Goodwill impairment test analysis – EDP Brasil For EDP Brasil, the cash flows were determined based on the production and consumption volume and estimated tariffs and installed capacity and tariff evolution prospects in the different markets / power purchase agreements. The period of considered cash flows corresponds to the useful life of the plant & machinery and other relevant equipments or until the end of the concession contracts, if lower than the useful life. The discount rate used of 8.3% in 2011 (9.1% in 2010), reflects the Group’s best estimate regarding the specific risks related to each CGU. The terminal value of the distribution business corresponds to the present value of the assets and the end of the concession period (Remuneratory Asset Base). In the generation / supply business, the terminal value corresponds to the present value of the assets net of amortisation at the end of the concession period. This sensitivity analysis of considering +50bps on the discount rate does not result in any impairment indicators for goodwill . 20.

Additionally, during 2011, the effect of changes in actuarial losses net of taxes has originated a decrease in the non-controlling interests of 14,705 thousands of Euros. 35. HYDROLOGICAL ACCOUNT The movements in the Hydrological account are analysed as follows: Group and Company Thousands of Euros Dec 2011 Dec 2010 Balance at the beginning of the year 75,098 112,631 Amounts received / (paid) during the year -8,036 -41,272 Financial charges 2,080 3,739 Balance at the end of the year 69,142 75,098 The hydrological account was established by Decree-law 338/91 and consists of a legal mechanism for compensating the variable costs of generating electricity. The hydrological account was set up in 1994 when the actual EDP Group was owned by the State, through a charge against the income statement. In 2000, through a spin-off of EDP, REN was set up, and new regulations were issued (through Decree-law 98/2000) which reinforced and maintained the requirement to keep the hydrological account in EDP’s balance sheet. As explained above, REN was part of the EDP Group until 2000. Thus, the entries in the hydrological correction account were made within the EDP Group. Since the split of REN in June 2000, EDP, S.A. (the Group parent company) has paid to or received cash from REN, which is booked against the hydrological correction account in the balance sheet and the related financial charges are booked in the income statement. REN uses the amounts received or paid to compensate the operators in the liberalised market, in accordance with the objectives of the hydrological correction account as explained above. In 2004, Decree-law 240/2004 was issued which establishes that, in respect to the free electricity market, the government must publish specific regulations applicable to the hydrological correction account. Based on these regulations and due to the government announcement mentioned above, the EDP Group’s Executive Board of Directors expects with a high probability that the recorded liability, including the balance relating to pre-1994 activity, will be payable to a third party to be nominated by the regulator. In October 2010 it was issued the Decree-Law 110/210, which determines the extinction of the hydrological account mechanism on 31 December 2016. The differential of hydrological adjustment should be reflected in the tariff calculation applicable to all energy consumers, to cover the variation risk of tariff costs and revenues associated to the hydrological variability in Portugal. This decree regulates that the account of hydrological correction should be maintained in the balance sheet of EDP – Energias de Portugal, S.A. and the correspondent annual movements explained in the notes to the financial statements. At extinction date, and for purpose of extinction movement, until 31 December 2016, the government will incorporate a team/workforce composed by representatives of ERSE, of National Electricity Distribution Network (RND), of National Electricity High Tension Transport (RNT) and National Conseil of Consumption, to determine such final movements. 36.

The impact on reserves at 31 December 2004 amounted to 1,162,000 thousands of Euros. In the following years, in compliance with the accounting policy adopted, the actuarial gains and losses of these plans were recorded directly in reserves, having recognised in 2011 gains of 11,805 thousands of Euros and in 2010 losses of of 107,915 thousands of Euros. Employee benefit plans Some EDP Group companies grant post-retirement benefits to employees, under defined benefit and defined contribution plans, namely pension plans that ensure retirement complements to age, disability and surviving pensions, as well as retirement pensions. In some cases healthcare is provided during retirement and early retirement, through mechanisms complementary to those provided by the National Health Service. The following is a summary of the nature of the plans and the companies covered, as well as financial and economic data of the plans: I. Defined benefit pension plans The EDP Group companies in Portugal resulting from the spin-off of EDP in 1994 have a social benefits plan funded by a closed Pension Fund, complemented by a specific provision. The EDP Pension Fund is managed by Pensõesgere with the management of the assets subcontracted to external asset management entities. This Pension Fund covers the liability for retirement pension complements (age, disability and survivor pension). The responsibilities for early retirement are not covered by the fund’s assets, being adequately provisioned through a specific provision. In Spain, following the collective labour agreement ( Convenio Colectivo ) signed in December 2007, HC Energia Group companies implemented an early retirement program that has been in place during the period from 2008 to 2012. Bandeirante in Brazil has two defined benefit plans managed by the CESP Foundation, until 31 May 2011. From this date, the plans management became the responsability off EnerPrev, E P l d complementary a closed l lf welfare i sponsored entity, b companies d by B il in i off EDP Brasil, d to manage a set off benefit b fi plans i order l f employees for l and d ex-employees l off Bandeirante: DB Plan in force up to 31 March 1998, a Benefit Plan that grants Balanced Proportional Supplementary Benefits (BSPS) in the form of an annuity payable to participants enrolled until 31 March 1998, of an amount defined in proportion to accumulated past service up to that date, based on compliance with the regulatory granting requirements. The company is fully liable to fund this plan. the DB plan in force after 31 March 1998, grants an annuity in proportion to the accumulated past services after 31 March 1998, on the basis of 70% of the average actual monthly wage for the last 36 months in service. In the event of death or disability caused by a labour accident, the benefits incorporate all the past service (including that accumulated up to 31 March 1998), and not only past service accumulated after 31 March 1998. The Company and the participants are equally responsible for funding the Plan. Escelsa, Bandeirante and Energest have Defined Benefit Plans that grant complementary pensions for retirement due to age, disability, and survivor pensions. Escelsa also has a special complementary retirement pension plan for war veterans. As at 31 December 2011 and 2010 the number of participants covered by the pension plans was as follows: Portugal Spain Brazil Portugal Spain Brazil 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 Number of participants: Retirees and pensioners 18,010 1,564 1,669 18,205 1,644 1,507 Active workers 6,168 1,348 1,690 6,384 1,294 1,975 24,178 2,912 3,359 24,589 2,938 3,482 218 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A.

These legal, arbitration or other actions, involve customers, suppliers, employees, administrative, central, municipal, tax, environmental or other authorities. In EDP Group opinion and its legal advisors the risk of a loss in these actions is not probable and the outcome will not affect on a material way its consolidated financial position. The losses of these processes were considered as possible, do not require the recognition of provisions and are periodically reassessed. At 30 September of 2011, the more relevant situations considered as possible contingencies are described as follows: i) Bandeirante is involved in a second lawsuit with the client White Martins, S.A. in the amount of 25,650 thousands of Euros, on the alleged existence of reflex effects of the Administrative Order 38/86 and 45/86 of the extinguished DNAEE, in the electricity tarrif charged by Bandeirante, between 1986 and 2000. EDP Group classifies the risk of loss of this lawsuit in the courts as possible, considering that customer complaint has no legal basis, in accordance with existing jurisprudence with regard to such complaints. ii) Escelsa is involved in litigation, related with the increase of the electricity tariffs, authorized by DNAEE Amninistratives Orders n. 38 and 45 of 27 February and 4 March of 1986. iii) Investco is involved in a legal actions of a civil nature mostly related with indemnity claims resulting from the filling of the hydroelectric reservoir. On 27 October 2009 and 5 January 2010, the EDP Group received two tax assessments regarding 2005 and 2006 taxable income for the EDP tax Group, which included an adjustment of 591 million Euros regarding its subsidiary, EDP Internacional S.G.P.S., related with the tax treatment considered by the EDP Group in relation to a capital loss generated with the liquidation of a subsidiary, whose main assets consists of investments in operating subsidiaries in Brazil, namely Escelsa and Enersul. As at 31 December 2011, the amount of this tax contingency totals 212 millions of Euros. Considering the analysis made and the technical advice received, and a favourable binding opinion obtained from the tax authorities in relation to the nature of the transaction occurred in the year of the assessment, the EDP Group considers as remote the risk associated with this matter. Under this analysis, the capital loss is tax deductible for income tax purposes, as established in article 75, no. 2 of the Corporate Income Tax Code ( Código do IRC ) based on the wording of the law in force at present date (actual article 81). Consequently, EDP Group is currently using all available legal means to defend its interest and those of its shareholders, based on the conviction that reason is on its side, both from a legal and tax perspective, being at this moment in the final phase. On the last 11 January 2012, EDP Group was notified by the portuguese tax authorities of the final decision regarding this litigation, and therefore decided to present an administrative appeal. 226 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Fair value of financial instruments is based, whenever available, on listed market prices. Otherwise, fair value is determined through internal models, which are based on cash flow discounting techniques and option valuation models or through quotations supplied by third parties. These models are developed considering the market variables which affect the financial instruments, namely yield curves, exchange rates and volatility factors. Market data is obtained from stock exchange and suppliers of financial data (Bloomberg and Reuters).Reuters) As at 31 December 2011 and 2010, the following table presents the interest rate curves of the major currencies to which the Group is exposed used for cash flow discount: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 Currency Currency EUR USD BRL EUR USD BRL 3 months 1.36% 0.58% 10.41% 1.01% 0.30% 10.90% 6 months 1.62% 0.81% 10.15% 1.23% 0.46% 11.61% 1 year 1.95% 1.13% 10.04% 1.51% 0.78% 12.04% 2 years 1.31% 0.73% 10.48% 1.56% 0.79% 12.27% 3 years 1.36% 0.82% 10.75% 1.89% 1.26% 12.15% 4 years 1.54% 1.01% 10.92% 2.20% 1.74% 12.04% 5 years 1.72% 1.23% 10.98% 2.49% 2.17% 11.95% 6 years 1.91% 1.45% 11.05% 2.74% 2.53% 11.89% 7 years 2.07% 1.64% 11.05% 2.93% 2.83% 11.85% 8 years 2.19% 1.80% 11.07% 3.09% 3.06% 11.87% 9 years 2.29% 1.93% 11.17% 3.21% 3.25% 11.88% 10 years 2.38% 2.03% 11.22% 3.32% 3.41% 11.90% 237 notes to the consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 december 2011S.A.and 2010 EDP Energias de Portugal, Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 Fair value of assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2011 and 2010 is analysed as follows: Group Dec 2011 Group Dec 2010 Carrying Carrying Fair value Difference Fair value Difference Thousands of Euros amount amount Financial assets Available for sale investments 171,313 171,313 443,965 443,965 Trade receivables 2,152,281 2,152,281 2,187,118 2,187,118 Debtors and other assets from commercial activities 3,604,009 3,604,009 3,483,216 3,483,216 Other Debtores and other assets 599,153 599,153 550,074 550,074 Derivative financial instruments 321,514 321,514 223,053 223,053 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 212 212 35,745 35,745 Cash and cash equivalents (assets) 1,731,524 1,731,524 1,588,163 1,588,163 8,580,006 8,580,006 8,511,334 8,511,334 Financial liabilities Loans 18,785,109 16,590,072 -2,195,037 17,891,646 17,398,777 -492,869 Property, plant and equipment suppliers and accruals Subcontracts (EDPR NA) 1,899,155 1,899,155 2,040,814 2,040,814 Institutional Partnerships in USA Wind Farms 1,796,809 1,796,809 1,644,048 1,644,048 Trade and other payables from commercial activities 2,686,961 2,686,961 2,864,527 2,864,527 Other liabilities and other payables 688,602 688,602 1,246,567 1,246,567 Derivative financial instruments 207,576 207,576 196,693 196,693 26,064,212 23,869,175 -2,195,037 25,884,295 25,391,426 -492,869 Considering that the EDP Group’s structure of financial assets and liabilities booked at amortised cost has essentially a short term nature, the effect of changes in the fair value has not been considered. Fair value of EDP Group’s loans was determined considering current market interest rates. The remaining financial assets and liabilities are already stated at fair value. The market value of loans is calculated based on the discounted cash flows at market interest rates at the date of the balance sheet, increased by the best estimate, at the same date, of market conditions applicable to the Group's debt, based on its average term. According to IFRS 7, EDP Group established the way it obtains the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities. The levels used are defined as follows: ● Level 1 – Fair value based on the available listed price (not adjusted) in the identified markets for assets and liabilities; ● Level 2 – Fair value based in market inputs not included in Level 1, but observable in the market for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; ● Level 3 – Fair value of the assets and liabilities calculated with inputs that are not based on observable market information. 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 Thousands of Euros Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial assets Available for sale investments 69,957 37,388 63,968 302,342 49,725 91,898 Derivative financial instruments 321 321,514 514 223,053 223 053 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 212 35,745 70,169 358,902 63,968 338,087 272,778 91,898 Financial liabilities Derivative financial instruments 207,576 196,693 207,576 196,693 As at 31 December 2011 and 2010, the movement in assets and liabilities included in Level 3 is analysed as follows: Financial assets available for sale Dec 2011 Dec 2010 Balance at beginning of year 91,898 71,902 Change in fair value reserve -17,934 7,964 Acquisitions 2,952 Disposals -16,894 Impairment -121 Transfers and other changes 4,067 12,032 Balance at year end 63,968 91,898 49.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Imputation to China Three Gorges On 30 December 2011, China Three Gorges Corporation ( CTG ) notified EDP that it has entered into a Strategic Direct Sale Agreement with Parpública Participações Públicas (SGPS), S.A. for the acquisition of 780,633,782 ordinary shares of EDP , which correspond to 21.35% od EDP's share capital and 21.35% of the respective voting rights. The imputation of a qualifying holding results from the signature of said agreement within the context of the implementation of EDP's 8th reprivatization phase. The referred acquisition of shares is subject to the prior satisfaction of conditions, namely the obtaining of approvals from relevant regulatory authorities from certain jurisdictions. Although the acquisiton of the above mentioned stake has not been concluded, Portuguese Law deems relevant, for certain prurposes, the attribuition of voting rights, as a result of the execution of a purchase agreement over listed companies' shares. Accordingly, as of the date hereof and until completion of the acquisition process, the attribution of voting rights inherent to the 780,633,782 shares, does not involve the actual exercise of those rights nor the ownership of any stake in the share capital of EDP by CTG.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS ISSUED The new standards and interpretation that have been issued and are already effective and that the Group has applied on its consolidated financial statements can be analysed as follows: IAS 24 (Revised) Related Party Disclosures The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued in November 2009, the IAS 24 (Revised) Related Party Disclosures, with effective date of mandatory application on 1 January 2011, being allowed its early adoption. This revised version simplifies the disclosure requirements for government related parties and clarifies the definition of a related party. Therefore, this standard establishes that the companies disclose in its financial statements the information regarding the transactions with related parties. In broad terms, two parties are related to each other if one party controls, or significantly influences, the other party. The principal changes are the following: partial exemption of the requirements on the paragraph 18 for transactions with government related entities ; simplification of “Related Party” definition. No significant impact in the Group resulted from the adoption of this amendment. IFRIC 14 (Amendment) Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in November 2009, amendments to IFRIC 14 – Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement, with effective date of mandatory application on 1 January 2011, being early adoption allowed. These ammendments were adopted by European Union in July 2010. The amendment to IFRIC 14, is it self an interpretation of IAS 19 Employee Benefits. The amendment applies in the limited circumstances when an entity is subject to minimum funding requirements and makes an early payment of contributions to cover those requirements. The amendment permits such an entity to treat the benefit of such an early payment as an asset. No significant impact in the Group resulted from the adoption of this interpretation. IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments The International Accounting Standard Board (IASB), issued in November 2009, the IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments, with effective date of mandatory application for the exercises beginning after 30 June 2010, being early adoption allowed. This interpretation clarifies how an entity renegotiates the terms of a financial liability with its creditor and the creditor agrees to accept the entity’s shares or other equity instruments to settle the financial liability fully or partially. No significant impact in the Group resulted from the adoption of this interpretation. Annual Improvement Project In May 2010, IASB published the Annual Improvement Project that implied changes to the standards in force. However, the effective date of the referred changes depends on each specific standard. ● Changes to IFRS 3 Business Combinations, effective from 1 January 2011. This changes clarifies that: (i) contigent consideration balances arising from business combinations whose acquisition dates preceded the date when an entity first applied this standard should not be adjusted; (ii) if a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost of the combination contigent on future events, the acquirer shall include the amount of that adjustment in the cost of the combination at the acquisition data if the adjustment is probable and can be measured reliably; and (iii) a business combination agreement may allow for adjustments to the cost of the combination that are contigent on one or more future events. No significant impact in the Group resulted from the adoption of this change. ● Changes to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, effective from 1 January 2011. This amendment simplifies the quantitave disclosures, since that is no longer necessary: (i) disclose the carrying amount of financial assets that would otherwise be past due or impaired and whose terms have been renegotiated , and (ii) describe the collateral held by the entity as security and other credit enhancements and, unless impracticable, an estimate of fair value related to financial assets renegotiated. No significant impact in the Group resulted from the adoption of this change. ● Changes to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Assets, effective from 1 January 2011. The amendment establishes that the statement of changes in equity for each component of equity, a reconciliation between the carrying at the beginning and the end of the period, separately disclosing changes resulting from: (i) profit or loss; (ii) other comprehensive income; and (iii) transactions with owners in their capacity as owners, showing separately contributions by and distributions to owners and changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control. No significant impact in the Group resulted from the adoption of this change. ● Changes to IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, effective from 1 January 2011. The amendment clarifies and emphasis the information that must be disclosed at the interim financial reporting. No significant impact in the Group resulted from the adoption of this change. 240 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 Standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective for the Group IFRS 1 (Amendment) First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in December 2010, amendments to IFRS 1 – First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting standards, with effective date of mandatory application of 1 July 2011, being early adoption allowed. These amendments have not been adopted by the European Union. The amendment to IFRS 1 , introduces a specific exemption for the first adoption of IFRS for entities operating in economies previously classified as hyper-inflationary, so that when the date of transition is after or is the date on which the functional currency stablises, the entity can choose to measure on the transition date, all assets and liabilities held at the time, at fair value. No significant impact is expected in the Group from the adoption of this change. IFRS 7 (Amendment) Financial Instruments: Disclosures Offsseting Financial Assets The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in December 2011, amendments to IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures, with effective date of mandatory application of 1 January 2013, being early adoption allowed. With this change, the disclosures of financial instruments include information that will evaluate the effect or potential effect of the compensation arrangements, including the countervailing recognised as assets and financial liabilities in the statement of financial position. The adoption of this amendement will only have impact on the financial statement disclosures. IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures for transfer transactions of financial assets The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in October 2010, amendments to IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures, with effective date of mandatory application of 1 July 2011, being early adoption allowed. The amendment to IFRS 7, clarifies the disclosures required to all financial assets that are not derecognised and for any continuing involvement in a transferred asset, existing at the reporting date, irrespective of when the related transfer transaction ocucurred. An entity transfers all or part of a financial asset, if, and only if, it either: transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of that financial asset ; or retains the contractual rights to receivethe cash flow of that financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in an arrangement. The entity shall disclose at each reporting date for each class of tranferred financial assets that are not derecognised in their entirety: (i) the nature of transferred assets; (ii) the nature of the risks and rewards between the transferred assets and associated liabilities. For transferred financial assets that are derecognised in their entirety the disclosures includes: (i) the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that are recognised in the y statement of financial p entity's p position and represent y continuing the entity's g g involvement in the derecognised y g financial assets , and the line items in which the carrying amount of those assets and liabilities are recognised; (ii) the fair value of the assets and liabilities that represent the entity's continuing involvement in the derecognised financial assets; (iii) the amount that best represents the entity's maximum exposure to loss from its continuing involvement in the derecognised financial assets, and information showing how the maximum exposure to loss is determined; and (iv) the undiscounted cash outflows that would or may be required to repurchase derecognised financial assets or other amounts payable to the transference in respect of the transferred assets. In addition, an entity shall disclose for each type of continuing involvement: the gain or loss recognised at the date of transfer of the assets; income and expenses recognised, both in the reporting period and cumulatively, from the entity's continuing involvement in the derecognised financial assets; if the total amount of proceeds from transfer activity in a reporting period is not evenly distributed throughout the reporting period; when the greatest transfer activity took place within that reporting period; the amount recognised from transfer activity in that part of the reporting period; and the total amount of proceeds from transfer activity in that part of the reporting period. An entity shall provide this informaton for each period for which a statement of comprehensive income is presented. The adoption of this amendement will only have impact on the financial statement disclosures. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued in November 2009, IFRS 9 Financial instruments part I: Classification and measurement, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015, being allowed its early adoption. This standard, changed in October 2010, has not yet been adopted by the European Union. This standard is included in phase I of the IASB's comprehensive project to replace IAS 39 and relates to issues of classification and measurement of financial assets. The main issues considered are as follows: the financial assets can be classified in two categories: at amortised cost or at fair value. This decision will be made upon the initial recognition of the financial assets. Its classification depends on how the entity presents these financial assets and the contractual cash flows associated to each financial asset in the business; debt instruments model can be measured at amortised cost when the contractual cash-flows represent only principal and interest payments, which means that it contains only basic loan features, and for which an entity holds the asset to collect the contractual cash flows. All the other debt instruments are recognised at fair value; and 241 notes to the consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 december 2011S.A.and 2010 EDP Energias de Portugal, Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 equity instruments issued by third parties are recognised at fair value with subsequent changes recognised in the profit and loss. However an entity could irrevocably elect equity instruments at initial recognition for which fair value changes and the realised gain or loss are recognised in fair value reserves. Gains and losses recognised in fair value reserves can not be recycled to profit and loss. This is a discretionary decision, and does not imply that all the equity instruments should be treated on this basis. The dividends received are recognised as income for the year. there is no exemption that allows unquoted equity investments and related derivatives to measure at cost. However, guidance is provided on the limited circumstances in which the cost of such an instrument may be an appropriate approximation of fair value; changes in fair value attributable to own credit risk of financial liabilities classified as fair value through profit or loss, shall be recognised in Other comprehensive income. The remaining fair value changes related to these financial liabilities shall be recognised through profit or loss. The amounts recognised in Other comprehensive income shall not be reclassified/transferred to profit and loss. The Group is evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued in May 2011, IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, being allowed its early adoption. This standard has not yet been adopted by the European Union. This standard introduces a new approach in determining which investments should be consolidated, replacing IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and SIC 12 Consolidation SPE. This standard establishes a single model to be applied in assessing the existence of control over subsidiaries, where an investor has control over a subsidiary when it is exposed, or has the right, to variable returns arising from its involvement in the subsidiary and has the ability to influence these returns because of the power over it. Additionally, the concept of de facto control was introduced. The Group is evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued in May 2011, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, being allowed its early adoption. This standard has not yet been adopted by the European Union. This standard superseded IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and introduces several changes for accounting jointly controlled investments, the main aspect is the elimination of the option to consolidate joint ventures by the proportional method, being the equity method mandatory. The structure of a joint agreement ceases to be the main factor in determining the accounting model to adopt. The classification of a joint agreement requires the identification and evaluation of the structure, legal form of the contractual agreement and other facts and circumstances. The Group is evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities Th International The I t ti A l Accounting St d d Board B d (IASB) issued ti Standards i i May d in 2011 IFRS 10 Consolidated C lid t d financial M 2011, fi t t t with i l statements, ff ti date d t off mandatory ith effective d t application li ti for f periods i d beginning on or after 1 January 2013, being allowed its early adoption. This standard has not yet been adopted by the European Union. The information disclosed has to help users of the financial statements evaluate the nature and risks associated with its interests in other entities and the effects of those interests on the financial statements. The main issues considered are as follows: for the interests in subsidiaries, should be disclosed: (i) the composition of the group;(ii) non-controlling interests; (iii) significant restrictions on the parent's ability to access or use the assets and settle the liabilities of its subsidiares; (iv) the nature of, and changes in, the risks associated with interests in consolidated structured entities; and (v) changes in its ownership interest that did or did not result in a loss of control during the reporting period. for the interests in joint arrangements and associates, it should be disclosed: (i) the nature, extent and financial effects of its interests in joint arrangements and associates, including information about contractual relationships with other parties; and (ii) the nature of, and the changes in, the associated risks with its interests in joint ventures and associates. for the interests in unconsolidated structured entities, should be disclose: (i) the nature and the extent of its interests in unconsolidated structured entities; and (ii) the evaluation of the nature and changes in the risks associated with the interests in unconsolidated structured entities. The Group is evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued in May 2011, IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, being allowed its early adoption. This standard has not yet been adopted by the European Union. This standard presents a revised concept of fair value and determines new disclosures requirements. The main aspects considered are as follows: (i) principles of fair value, (ii) appropriate valuations techniques and fair value hierarchy and (iii) additional disclosure requirements.

Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 IAS 1 (Amended) Presentation of Financial Statements The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued in June 2011, IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Presentation of items of other comprehensive income, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012, being allowed its early adoption. These amendments have not yet been adopted by the European Union. The principal changes are the following: the amendments retain the option to present profit or loss and other comprehensive income ineither a single continuos statement or in two separate but consecutive statements; items of other comprehensive are required to be grouped into those that will and will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss; and tax on items of other comprehensive income is required to be alocated on the same basis. The Group is evaluating the impact from the adoption of this change. IAS 19 (Amended) Employee Benefits The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued in June 2011, IAS 19 (Amended) Employee Benefits, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, being allowed its early adoption. These amendments have not yet been adopted by the European Union. The amendments to IAS 19, make important improvements by: eliminating an option to defer the recognition of gains and losses, know as the corridor method , improving comparability and faithfulnesss of presentation; streamlining the presentation of changes in assets and liabilities arising from defined benefit plans, including requiring remeasurements to be presented in other comprehensive income, thereby separating those changes from changes that many perceive to be the result of an entity's day-to-day operations; and enhancing the disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans, providing better information about the characteristics of defined benefit plans and the risks that entities are exposed to through participation in those plans. No significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of this change. IAS 27 (Amended) Separate Financial Statements The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued in May 2011, IAS 27 (Amended) Separate Financial Statements, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, being allowed its early adoption. This amendment has not yet been adopted by the European Union. The amendment to IAS 27 in 2011 resulted from the Board's project on consolidation. A new IFRS, IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses the principle of control and requirments relating to the preparation of consolidated financial statements. As a result, IAS 27 now contains requirements relating only to separate financial statements. This change is reflected in the standard's amended title, Separate financial statements. No significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of this change. IAS 28 (Amended) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued in May 2011, IAS 28 (Amended) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, being allowed its early adoption.

These amendments have not yet been adopted by the European Union. This amendment clarifies the required conditions to be met in order to present the net position of the financial assets and liabilities in the financial position of an entity, as follows: (i) the entity currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts, and (ii) the entity has the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. No significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of this change. 52.

The meeting took place outside of the Company’s head office since it did not allow the meeting to occur in satisfactory conditions, considering, as EDP is a listed company, the high level of shareholders participating. ----------------------------------------------------------The Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting, Mr. Rui Eduardo Ferreira Rodrigues Pena, started by informing that, before the beginning of the works, an institutional movie of EDP would be presented. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After the presentation of the institutional movie, the Chairman of Shareholders’ Meeting welcomed all presents, namely the Chairman of the General and Supervisory Board, the Chairman of the Executive Board of Directors, the representative of the Statutory Auditor and the guests, and explained the participation procedures in the present General Shareholders’ Meeting and the respective functioning, which are provided in the General Shareholders ´Meeting folder, namely: notice to convene meeting, accounts’ reporting documents, opinions and statements of the relevant Corporate Bodies, resolution proposals, and EDP By-Laws in force. Afterwards, assisted by the Company Secretary, Ms. Maria Teresa Isabel Pereira, and considering the absence of the Vice-Chairman of Shareholders’ Meeting Board, justified by professional motives, verified the regularity of the notice to convene the meeting through the mandatory publications made at the Ministry of Justice’s, CMVM’s and EDP’s websites, as well as in the Euronext‘s Official Listing Bulletin. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting and the Company Secretary also verified that the attendance list was duly organized and that there were representation letters for the shareholders that were legal persons or that were not physically present. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting and the Company Secretary then verified the percentage of the share capital present or represented at the General Shareholder’s Meeting – which, adding the correspondence votes, represented 70,9406% of the share capital and 70,4479% of the voting rights – based upon the shares’ registry statements issued by the financial intermediaries responsible for the individual registry of shares for each shareholder. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting proceeded underlining that the exercise of participating and voting rights at the General Shareholders’ Meeting was not prejudiced by the transfer of shares after the registration date (10th of April 2012), nor was dependent from the respective block between registration date and the present date. Nevertheless, the Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting referred that shareholders that declared their intention to participate at the General Shareholders’ Meeting and, meanwhile, transferred ownership of their shares between registration date and the General Shareholders’ Meeting were obliged to communicate it immediately to the Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting and to the Portuguese Securities Market Commission. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting mentioned, afterwards that shareholders who, by professional title, own shares on its own name, but on behalf of clients, may vote on a different way with its shares, as long as, beyond the participating statement and the sending, by the respective financial intermediary, of the shares’ registry statements, they had presented to the Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting, until 23:59 hours (GMT) of the 9th of April 2012, sufficient and proportional evidence of (i) identification of each client and number of shares to vote on its own account (it is considered as sufficient evidence the indication of the name and the tax number) and (ii) vote instructions, which shall be specific for each different item of the agenda and shall be given by each client. The Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting referred then that in case one shareholder has designated several representatives regarding shares held in different book-entry registries, and these representatives vote in a different way regarding the same proposal, all the expressed votes may be annulled. If any of the representatives do not attend the General Shareholders’ Meeting, the votes of the representatives present will be considered, as long as all of the representatives vote in the same way. The presence at the General Shareholders’ Meeting of a shareholder that has designated one or more representatives revokes the representation powers conferred. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting also stated that, according to article 14, number 3 of EDP’s By-Laws, votes from a shareholder owning any category of shares issued on its own account or on behalf of another shareholder would not be cast in the event that they exceeded 25% of the total votes, and so, on the votes casted in relation to each resolution on the items of the agenda, votes of shareholders Parpública – Participações Públicas (SGPS), S.A. and Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. would only be considered up to the limit of 25%, proportionally to their position on EDP share capital and voting rights, which is of, respectively, 25,49% and 0,23%; the application of this limitation results from the imputation of voting rights situation these entities face, as the respective shareholder is the same. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting and the Company Secretary also verified that the remaining General Shareholders’ Meeting’s prior formalities were complied with, namely, that the proposals and other information in relation to the items of the agenda were made available to shareholders, at the head office and at the CMVM’s and EDP’s websites, within the periods provided for by law. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(...) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting declared having sufficient conditions to initiate the works and proceeded by reading the agenda, according to the notice to convene the meeting, with the following content: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Item

As the abstentions are not considered, the referred proposal was approved by majority of the votes cast (with 99,7801% of votes in favour). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting continued the works, with Item Seven of the agenda, with the following content: “Resolve on the remuneration policy of the members of the Executive Board of Directors presented by the Remunerations Committee of the General and Supervisory Board.” As per the extension of the statement and since it was already acknowledged by the shareholders, the Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting asked the presents to waive the reading of the document, which is filed as an attachment to these minutes and is hereby reproduced: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------“1. According to the existing legal dispositions, the new General and Supervisory Board was elected by the EDP – Energias de Portugal, S.A. (EDP) General Shareholders’ Meeting on 20th February 2012. At its first meeting, held on 21 of the same month, the General and Supervisory Board decided to appoint a Remuneration Committee (RC) responsible, according to EDP’s Articles of Association, for the definition of the remuneration policy for the members of the Executive Board of Directors (EBD) of EDP. Since the three members of the previous RC had their mandates renewed, the decision was to maintain the composition of the previous RC. Considering the short time until the deadline for public disclosure of the guidelines of the new remuneration policy, this resolution had the 290 advantage of empowering members having previous experience and that would continue a path in line with previous decisions of the majority of the shareholders of EDP. -------------------------------2. This proposal maintains the same fundamental guidelines that have been used to determine the remuneration of EBD for the two previous mandates without ignoring the current changes of EDP’s shareholder structure, the ongoing revision of EDP’s business plan, as well as the lessons of the recent past. As for continuity, two aspects deserve to be highlighted: On the one hand, the maintenance of a variable component weighing twice the fixed one, and in which the multiannual performance indicators are weighted stronger than the annual ones; on the other hand, the intensification of the exercise of benchmarking, either with similar sized national companies of PSI20 or with foreign companies, namely Iberian and/or that are listed on Eurostoxx Utilities. The following sections will show in detail how these criteria have been applied. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3. In any case, it would be unwise to ignore the potential implications of the ongoing transformation of EDP’s shareholder structure and, in particular, the consequences that it may have on the business plan revision. Still, the information gathered from the discussion already held points towards the conclusion that the impact on the major guidelines of EBD’s remuneration policy will not be substantial. The model so far adopted is both solid (in its foundations and on the indicators chosen) and flexible (seemingly able to accommodate changes in the activities of the company, provided that they are not disruptive). The need to make some minor adjustments in some of the criteria adopted, both in terms of content and weight, may arise but they will not be substantial. At the same time, the preliminary discussions already held did not reveal any radical change in the positioning of the shareholders regarding the main principles of the remuneration policy. ----------------------4. The compensation policy of EDP’s EBD has become oriented towards the generic purpose of ensuring the achievement of the objectives set for the company, taking into account the constraints imposed by political, economic and social environment. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------5. The management of companies with the scale, diversity and geographic scope of activity as the ones already reached by EDP assumes a complexity that, naturally, points towards the separation of the role of capital owners (shareholders) and the effective exercise of management (ensured by professional managers, often without any participation or with a diminished participation in the company’s share capital). Therefore, the remuneration policy should ensure that EDP is able to attract and retain the most competent managers, but also encourage that their activity is aligned with the strategic interests of its shareholders and of its business partners as well as with its stakeholders. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------6. Despite the criticism that, up to the moment, has been made to it, the model of remuneration of the executive members of the board with a variable component linked to the performance of the company, continues to be regarded as the one with the greatest potential to safeguard the strategic alignment of interests mentioned above. The remuneration committees, the supervisory bodies and the General Shareholders’ Meeting have the responsibility to design and approve the model that best suits the specific circumstances of the company and of its economic activity. ---------------7. Strictly speaking, with greater or lesser sophistication, these strategic orientations are incorporated in EDP’s remuneration policy since the year 2001 when, within the scope of the one-tier governance model existing at the time, it was decided that the salaries of the members of the Executive Committee would have a fixed and a variable component. In 2003, with the separation of the functions of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman, this remuneration model was reinforced with the introduction of a multiannual variable component aiming to stimulate the consistency of the executive management with a medium and long term perspective of the company’s sustainability. Meanwhile, for the three year period 2006-2008, when the two-tier governance model was already in force, the referred remuneration model initiated in 2003 was maintained and it was approved by the shareholders at the 2007 General Shareholders’ Meeting and, following the legal changes that occurred, approved annually by the shareholders from 2010 on. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------8. In this context, continuing an experience that deserved the approval of the EDP shareholders and that has been recognized as a reference in the Portuguese market by independent assessments, the Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board proposes, for the period 2012-2014, a remuneration system for the members of the Executive Board of Directors of EDP, that is based on two objectives: 1) Ensure, after a national and international benchmark analysis, a competitive remuneration plan, and 2) accomplish an incentive system that guarantees the alignment of management with shareholders interests on an economical and financial sustainability perspective. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------9. Pursuant to the first objective, and taking into account EDP’s dimension and importance regarding the national economy as well as the international expression of its current activity, it was considered, for comparison purposes, the published fixed remunerations of chairmen of listed companies that integrate Eurostoxx Utilities and PSI-20, adapting the data to the governance model adopted (one tier or dual). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------10. As a result of this analysis, it is considered that the value of € 600 000 already practiced in the last two mandates, i.e. from 2006, remains appropriate for the fixed component of the remuneration of the Chairman of the Executive Board of Directors. As well as the maintenance of the relation between the fixed salary of the other members of the Executive Board and their Chairman in 80%. As per the data available, such value would put that remuneration component substantially below the average of the analyzed universe. Also as a result of this decision, if approved, at the end of this term, this component of the remuneration as well as the limit for the total compensation of the members of EBD will be the same, in nominal terms, for 9 consecutive years. -----------------------------11. On the other hand, the execution of the second objective (the alignment of the interests of management with the strategic interests of the company) demands not only a variable component that integrates the global remuneration, but also that the same be attributed subject to the verification of a set of requirements that act as incentives for good management practices as measured by international standards, which are increasingly multidimensional. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------12. Considering the best international practices – companies’ policies or guidelines issued by international institutions such as European Commission or supervisory entities – the remuneration variable component must: 1) be relevant, meaning, have an expressive relevance in the remuneration; 2) result from a set of indicators that reflect the shareholders perspective over the company performance and 3) depend, on a significant part, from the multiannual performance. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------13. As mentioned before, in general, these criteria have already been followed since 2006, materialized on a remuneration structure where the variable part may duplicate the fixed part and where the variable multiannual component, which reflects the appraisal for the entire term of office, acquired after 2009 an increased weight. Therefore: -----------------------------------------------------------14. Annual variable remuneration the respective value might vary between 0 and 100% of the annual gross fixed remuneration, as the effective performance would be 90% below of the established on the business plan (in case no payment was conferred) or overcame it, in 10% (in case it would be conferred a 100% payment). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------15. Multiannual variable compensation – between 2006 and 2008, its amount was fixed between 0 and 100% of the gross fixed remuneration of the term of office, as the result of the accumulated annual appraisal of the directors’ “performance” in the materialization of EDP’s Group economical sustainability. The attribution of this remuneration, though annually calculated, would only become effective if, at the end of the term of office, at least 90% of the strategic objectives established were reached; the referred objectives would be evaluated as the result of the performance of the company and of its comparison of the reference strategic universes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------16. Regularly RC carries out a compared analysis of EDP’s remuneration policy against the one practiced by the most significant referenced companies (main PSI-20 companies, Iberian piers and companies integrating Eurostoxx Utilities) and, above all, with the principal guidelines of the main supervision institutions. This analysis has been showing the general suitability of the policy followed. As a result, the RC of the General and Supervisory Board has decided not to alter, significantly, the existing model but only to introduce some adjustments resulting from modifications verified on the orientations of supervisory entities and from the evolution of the national and international economical context that will be detailed later. ----------------------------------------------------------------------17. Apart from the requirement stemming from the quantitative limits set out, above the average of the reference strategic universes, it should be kept in mind that the goals proposed by the EBD are subject to a prior opinion of the General and Supervisory Board and validated by the General Meeting, the supreme social body of the company, at the accounts approval. -------------------------------18. As is evident today, the economical international crisis has demonstrated the bankruptcy of remuneration policies based on short term performance. As mentioned before, that was not EDP’s case, as it was established since 2003 a multiannual variable remuneration component linked to the results achieved during the term of office, with equal weight to the annual component. Even though and in order to comply with the orientations that point out to the reinforcement of the relevance of the multiannual performance, the RC of the General and Supervisory Board has decided, in 2009, to redistribute the structure of the variable component of the remuneration, decreasing the relevance of the annual variable part and, as counterpart, increasing the multiannual.-------------------------19. Taking this into account, the maximum value of the annual performance bonus will be decreased for 80% of the fixed component, and the multiannual bonus may reach 120% of the fixed remuneration earned during the term of office. After the experience in last term o office the proposal of this RC to the General Meeting of Shareholders is to maintain this structure. In fact, despite the actual impact of media coverage that, nowadays, the attribution, by the end of the term of office, of a high remuneration to the members of EBD will have the truth is that if it is materialized, it will be the best proof that the company’s performance has reached the ambitious and multipurpose objectives set. Additionally, the understanding of this RC is that the limits to obtain the maximum values (greater than or equal to 110%), or to be deprived of the variable remuneration (below 90%) must be maintained, since the exigency related to the company’s management is highly demanding and well above average. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------20. At last, the indicators used to appraise the Executive Board of Directors performance, namely the ones related to the comparison between EDP’s and the Iberian and European peers stock behavior and to the valuation of the economical and financial performance of the company are detailed as follows: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------a. Annual performance indicators: value of Total Shareholder Return of EDP’s Group when compared with the verified in Eurostoxx Utilities and PSI20, actual capacity of shareholder value creation and growth of Gross Profit, Net Profit and EBITDA. To the weighted average of these indicators is assigned an overall weight of 90%, which is common to all the members of the EBD, in calculating the variable component of the remuneration. The remaining 10% are the result of an individualized assessment, made by the Chairman of the Executive Board of Directors, based on the individual contribution to the team. The Chairman of EBD is subject to an assessment by the Remuneration Committee. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------b. Multiannual Performance Indicators: comparison universes are the same but the indicators used take into account, for this purpose, all term of office as reference. Critical indicators are relative performance of EDP’s Group EBITDA, its capacity of value creation, total return for the shareholder as well as performance of the Sustainability Index applied to EDP’s Group (with the methodology of Dow Jones Sustainability Index). Additionally, Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board will take in consideration, although without resource to quantitative indicators, the evolution of EDP’s Group image regarding national and international markets, the change capacity and the ability to adapt to new market demands and, above all, the compliance with the strategic targets set for EDPs’ Group. Identically to the annual performance indicators, 10% are attributed upon an individualized assessment, made by the Chairman of the EBD, which, in turn is subject to an assessment of the Remuneration Committee. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------21. The development of EDP’s activity has increasingly added an international dimension, which may affect the remuneration and compensation policies. Beyond the regime of remuneration associated with work performed abroad, consigned to the purview of the EBD, the RC, within the framework of its statutory powers, proposes that the fixed and variable remuneration, irrespective of the geography where members of EBD are to operate, be treated, for domestic purposes, under the existing tax regime in Portugal, so as to prevent unjustified discrepancies in net remuneration between members of EBD. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In accordance to the applicable law and EDP’s Articles of Association, the Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board submits to the approval of the Shareholders the declaration on remuneration policy of the members of the Executive Board of Directors in accordance with the above stated terms.” -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As the shareholders waived the reading of the above said proposal, the Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting granted permission to speak to Prof. Alberto João Coraceiro de Castro, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board, who, after welcoming all presents, made a brief summary of the Remuneration Committee chaired by him. -----291 annexes (…) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Since no other person asked to speak, the Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting submitted to vote the proposal on Item Seven of the agenda, having been issued 1.390.327.106 votes, corresponding to 1.390.327.106 shares, which represent 38,0230% of the share capital. As abstentions are not considered, the referred proposal was approved by majority of the votes cast (with 99,8807% of votes in favour). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Afterwards, the Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting read the content of Item Eight of the – “Resolve on the remuneration policy of the other members of the corporate bodies presented by the Remunerations Committee elected by the General Shareholders’ Meeting” – and, following the same procedure adopted in the previous proposals, asked the shareholders that were present about the waiver of the reading of the statement, with the following content: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------” 1. Pursuant to article 11, number 2, paragraph d), of EDP – Energias de Portugal, S.A.’s By-Laws, the General Shareholders’ Meeting is responsible for the appointment of a Remuneration Committee with the obligation to determine the remuneration of the members of the corporate bodies, except for the remuneration of the directors (Executive Board of Directors), which, pursuant to article 27 of the referred By-Laws, shall be determined by a Committee appointed by the General and Supervisory Board (GSB). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2. The By-Laws of EDP – Energias de Portugal, S.A. provide, in article 8, number 1 that the Company’s Corporate Bodies are: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------a)The General Shareholders’ Meeting (GSM) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------b) The General and Supervisory Board (GSB) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------c) The Executive Board of Directors (EBD) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------d) The Statutory Auditor --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------on the other hand, the By-Laws also provide for the existence of other Corporate Bodies, with statutory dignity: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------e) The Environment and Sustainability Board (ESB) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------f) The Remuneration Committee, elected by the General Shareholders’ Meeting and, within the GSB, a Committee for the Monitoring of Financial Matters which according to the By-Laws, also assumes the designation of Audit Committee. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------g) The Board of the GSM. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------These are the corporate bodies of EDP-Energias de Portugal, S.A. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3. The Remuneration Committee, elected by the General Shareholders’ Meeting, is therefore, responsible for the determination of the remuneration of the members of the following corporate bodies: Board of the General Shareholders’ Meeting; Chairman and members of the GSB; Statutory Auditor and Environment and Sustainability Board. The Committee for the Monitoring of Financial Matters or Audit Committee shall be dealt with together with the other Committees of the GSB. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------4. The current Committee elected by the General Shareholders’ Meeting held on April 2009 and which term of office ends now, has the following composition: ------------------------------------------José Manuel Galvão Teles, Chairman --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------José Castel-Branco, Member -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Carlos Veiga Anjos, Member -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------5. In compliance with the powers which were conferred to it, the Remuneration Committee has determined the remunerations of the members of the corporate bodies of EDP, for the term of office 2009 -2010 (except for the EBD), although with the express reservation that the Committee would comply with its duty to follow, every year, the activity of the respective corporate bodies. ---------------On the GSM, held on the 16th of April, 2010, the shareholders decided to reject the Statement that was submitted. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Remuneration Committee did not receive, during the meeting of the GSM, nor in any other moment, the slightest criticism or the slightest remark regarding the remuneration policy that the shareholders believe should be carried on by EDP, save for, evidently, in what concerns the State position, which for different occasions publicly expressed, aims for applying in EDP similar measures of constraint as those defined for the public corporate sector. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------However the shareholders present on the referred GSM did not approve the adoption of any other Statement on the remuneration policy. -------------------------------------------------------------------Therefore, the Committee did not amend its ruling general principles, reinforced in the meantime by the intention of contention announced by the main shareholder, the State, maintaining valid and in full force the remunerations determined by it for the entire term of office. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------6. The Statement presented by the Remuneration Committee on the GSM of 2011, in compliance with the provisions of the referred Law 28/2009, was approved by the vast majority of the shareholders that were present, reinforcing therefore the position undertaken during its term of office. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is precisely what the Committee is to do again before this General Shareholders’ Meeting, aiming, once more, to meet the will of the shareholders (for which it strongly looked for, during its term of office) and leaving for support of later resolutions of its new members an important contribution and a facilitating element of its action, that shall respect the new corporate composition of the company. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------7. Thus, one shall comply with the provisions of the respective Item of the Agenda of the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting, to take place on the 17th of April. ---------------------------------------Given the above, the Remuneration Committee, elected by the General Shareholders Meeting hereby submits to the appraisal of the shareholders, pursuant to number 1 of article 2 of Law 28/2009, of 19th of June, the remuneration policy of the members of the corporate bodies of EDP – Energias de Portugal, SA., to which its competence respects.” ----------------------------------------------------As the shareholders waived the reading of the above said proposal, the Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting granted permission to speak to the Chairman of the mentioned Committee, Mr. José Manuel Archer Galvão Teles, who began by welcoming the shareholders and the members of the corporate bodies that were present, and subsequently presented the policy of remuneration of the corporate bodies (except for the Executive Board of Directors). --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(…) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Next, the Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting submitted to vote the proposal related Item Eight of the agenda, having been issued 1.311.626.085 votes, corresponding to 1.311.626.085 shares, which represent 35,8707% of the share capital social.
