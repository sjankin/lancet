GlobeScan’s 2011 Global Compact Communication on Progress 2 STATEMENT OF CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR THE GLOBAL COMPACT 2011 GlobeScan, like many globally-focused companies, has many ambitions. One of our core purposes has always been to apply our global polling and stakeholder engagement capabilities to ‘give voice’ to people’s aspirations on a whole range of issues. However, given our observation of trends and events over our 25-year history as a company, we have come to see the achievement of a sustainable and just world for all as such an over-riding imperative and huge challenge that we have decided to put our other ambitions aside to focus exclusively on this goal, both through our company’s work and through our new GlobeScan Foundation. The outward manifestation of this new focus has been the relaunching of our company over the past year with a broader service offering aimed at better supporting our clients’ efforts to also contribute to progress towards “a sustainable and just world for all.” As a result, we feel even more worthy and pleased to submit this, our seventh annual Communication on Progress since our company joined the Global Compact in 2004. In addition to our client work, our major contribution to the goals of the Compact this year has been manifested in the Regeneration Roadmap, our multi-faceted initiative with our colleagues at SustainAbility, the consultancy, to provide a way forward for achieving sustainable development within the next generation, focusing in particular on ways the private sector can Sincerely, improve sustainability strategy, increase credibility and deliver results at greater speed and Doug Miller, scale.

Nearly 25 years after the Brundtland Commission released Our Common Future, and 20 years after the first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, The Regeneration Roadmap assesses progress made on the sustainable development agenda and offers a new path forward. This project is inspired by interviews with sustainable development Pioneers, the Ray Anderson Memorial Interviews, conducted over the last year and will include perspectives from a new generation of innovators and entrepreneurs. The beauty and challenge of The Regeneration Roadmap lies in its design: a reflective process of progressive and participatory problem-solving whose outcomes will be substantial and valuable, but which will reveal themselves gradually. For more information about the Regeneration Roadmap, please visit www.theregenerationroadmap.com The GlobeScan Foundation is dedicated to helping achieve a sustainable and just world for all. We focus on developing and applying a range of social science tools to help unlock collaboration and accelerate progress. We have chosen the theme “Letting Everyone Speak” to manifest our mission for two reasons. First, we believe everyone has the right to speak on matters that affect their lives. And secondly, when we let everyone speak, we open up the possibility of collaboration, which we believe is essential for meeting humanity’s challenges. Over the last 25 years, GlobeScan Incorporated has done a great deal of pro bono work—for global NGOs, Complus, UN agencies, and foundations among others. Now, with our Foundation, we are able to focus and magnify our noncommercial work in order to advance progress for all. The GlobeScan Foundation Goals: • To conduct non-commercial global polls on matters of public interest • To give voice to influential experts and stakeholders on important topics • To develop and apply engagement processes that can unlock mass collaboration to solve problems For more information about the GlobeScan Foundation, please visit www.globescan.com/globescan-foundation.html 21 2 2011 Recipient of the Lord Home Memorial Lead Schoarship Isa Yunusa Chedi is Head of the Kaduna Zonal Office of Nigeria’s National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agenxy (NOSDRA) NOSDRA is a government environmental regulatory agency that is entrusted with the responsibility of regulating oil & gas activities in Nigeria. It is also the lead agency in oil spill management including Oil Spill Contingency Plan activation, monitoring of cleaning up and remediation of oil impacted site; oily waste management, etc. As the Head of the zonal field office Yunusa is responsible for managing and coordinating all activities of the Agency at the zonal level. The Kaduna Zonal Office covers the entire northern Nigeria with the exception of three states (i.e. Adamawa, Taraba and some part of Kogi States).

He manages the GIS laboratory for the purpose of geospatial database update and data retrieve. Yunusa visited GlobeScan’s head office after completing the Leadership for Environment and Development Fellowship at the LEAD International Session and spoke to the whole company about his experiences in environmental administration in Africa, commenting that the Fellowship had improved his leadership skills, ability to manage people and improved his approach to issues response, as well as providing him with pan-African contacts to coordinate with colleagues on the sustainability and environmental issues management agenda. My LEAD Experience LEAD Training is a program aimed at identifying potential world leaders with a view to ensuring that the concept of sustainable development is inculcated in them. Thus, having passed though the training at different levels, I came to realize how important the training is to me at personal and professional levels. Without doubt, the training has profoundly helped me in building self-confidence. It has also equipped me with the ability to visualise in a holistic manner complex problems; identify inter-linkages and eventually develop workable solutions. Another profound personal impact gained from the training is the need to ‘walk the talk’, i.e. to put my knowledge into action especially on sustainable development issues. I have also been utilizing the LEAD’s network in obtaining information from other countries on some issues that has to do with good governance and environment. LEAD Training has also added another dimension to my approach to work with other people. I came to realize how important it is to carry each member of my team along. And how imperative it is to identify the needs of communities before implementing a community project. LEAD training for me therefore, is a learning experience that has helped in changing my general attitude and behaviour toward people and the environment. Isa Yunusa Chedi – June 2012 22 2
