I summarize the improvements and progress we have made by each principle where applicable. Signature Name and Position Chris Lee, CEO PRINCIPLE 1 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT AND RESPECT THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY PROCLAIMED HUMAN RIGHTS Since attaining SA8000 Social Accountability System in 2009 the system has undergone two independent audits and there were no reported non-compliances. Our certification number is GB09/79253 PRINCIPLE 2 BUSINESS SHOULD ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES Our European Supply Chain Vendor Audit program continues. We audited 9 suppliers in 2010 when the program was first introduced and 29 suppliers were audited in 2011. We work with our supply chain to ensure compliance in all areas, this is ongoing. Updated Terms and Conditions contracts were issued to all suppliers in January 2012. PRINCIPLE 3 BUSINESS SHOULD UPHOLD THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND THEEFFECTIVE RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING We continue to run an Employee Forum over 3 sites; however this has been renamed the Information and Consultation Committee. All staff, during induction are notified of their rights with regard to freedom of association. PRINCIPLE 4 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF FORCED AND COMPULSORY LABOUR Brand Addition Manchester, at which over 50% of our total team work, has achieved the Investors in People Accreditation. This is the UK’s leading people management standard. This standard provides a simple and flexible framework that is versatile, flexible, non-prescriptive, outcomebased and recognises that every organisation is different and therefore needs to reach their end goals in their own way. We will be seeking to gain the Investors in People for our London operation during 2012. PRINCIPLE 5 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOUR Within our supply chain we continue to audit factories in the Far East using SA8000 as a guide to ensure compliance is met. This is actively encouraged and reiterated during the European vendor audit programme through our tier 2 supply chain. This is an ongoing process and Corrective Action Plans are monitored. PRINCIPLE 6 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT OF EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION Brand Addition is committed to promoting diversity and equal opportunities in employment. The company will not support any form of unlawful or unfair discrimination on the grounds of colour, race, religion and/or belief, nationality, ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, HIV status, marital or family status, disability or age. Diversity and equality of opportunity within the company are consistently reflected in our decisions relating to the recruitment, selection, training, promotion, transfers, benefits and terms and conditions of our employees. All decisions will be made on the basis of objective and job related criteria. PRINCIPLE 7 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES Brand Addition continues to keep abreast of environmental legislation be it relating to new or revised rules. This is achieved through subscription of the environmental periodical Ends Report. Forthcoming changes in legislation concerning waste and the phasing out of the refrigerant gas R22 are on our legal register under pending legislation for future action. PRINCIPLE 8 BUSINESS SHOULD UNDERTAKE INITIATIVE TO PROMOTE GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY Our waste disposal streams are now clearly identified to ensure there is no cross contamination of waste. Base lines have been established to monitor water usage and control valves have been installed in the gentlemen’s urinals. All pathways around the business have been repaired. We now have a more formal approach for dealing with waste computer equipment. PRINCIPLE 9 BUSINESS SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DIFFUSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES. We actively seek to reduce number of air freight shipments and prefer to ship by sea. Brand Addition continues to evaluate its environmental impacts within a robust EMS.

This includes cardboard, paper, plastics, aluminum cans and electrical/electronic products including batteries. PRINCIPLE 10 BUSINESS SHOULD WORK AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ALL ITS FORMS INCLUDING EXTORTION AND BRIBERY The Bibery Act 2010 came into force in July 2011 and as a result our Code of Practice and Suppliers Terms and Conditions contract now includes reference to the Bribery Act offences. Our Internal Policy was updated in August 2011. How do you intend to make this COP available to your stakeholders? Our COP will be stored on our shared drive for all employees to access.
