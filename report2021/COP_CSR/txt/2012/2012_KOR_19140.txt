How is the creation of new business going? Creating values through senior care business in the elderly society Developing senior care business To create common core values in terms of strategies that see mutually beneficial results for both internal and external company stakeholders, specifically smalland mid-sized enterprises (SMEs), in the field of senior care and the solution of the aging society, Yuhan-Kimberly plans to accredit the technologies of those partner SMEs which cannot run their own channel management or marketing and, furthermore, conduct the guaranteed sales of such technologies. Through this, it will provide the products of SMEs which Yuhan-Kimberly can verify and guarantee so that active seniors* can better manage the aging process. Indeed, this SME-support strategy is integrated within its plan to classify the values derived from the health and household products it sells, which are the key interest of its senior customers, into the following categories: ‘Comfortable Suggestion’, ‘Healthy Suggestion’, ‘Clean Suggestion’ and ‘Beautiful Suggestion.’ Given the scale of the challenge and the determination to achieve the set goals, there has been a Senior Supplier Task Force Team set up, which was launched in September 2011. It is designed to suppwort the achievement of the objectives in the senior care business & function set forth in Vision 2020 and consists of the following functions: planning, marketing, distribution, product sourcing and product development. For Seniors; Support for the companies and individuals with difficulties in their senior product development and market cultivation Yuhan-Kimberly openly selected its partners for active senior products through an open sourcing site in January 2012. There were a total of 12 categories (health, safety and hygiene-related product categories) and a total of 50 companies were selected as partners of Yuhan-Kimberly. The company plans to cooperate with these business partners through discussions in the future. This program aims to identify good companies (especially, socially-minded companies) and individuals which have a challenging time in their product development or market cultivation, and thus develop the senior product industry together. Senior Care Business Senior product CSV model Senior product CSV mission Provide the products and services for a better life of the entire generations Not only share values but also create values from infants to senior citizens This is the belief toward a better society Yuhan-Kimberly promises to you.

The company expects that the production of urinary incontinence underpants, which are to replace existing imported ones, will contribute to an increase in overall sales as well as the enhancement of consumer convenience and the environment. 2012 Yuhan-Kimberly Sustainability Report For Kids; Expansion of skin care product families and targets, including certified organic products Yuhan-Kimberly’s skin care business released certified organic skin care products in January 2012, and plans to expand its sales channels by developing online customers and baby shops. The company also widened its target market by releasing the Green Finger My Kids Boy (Lotion and bath) in July 2011, which is a skin care product targeted at boys. * Creating Shared Value (CSV) refers to a series of corporate policies and management activities to reinforce business core competitiveness while improving economic and social conditions. Active seniors? Active seniors are senior people who like to enjoy healthy activities and hobbies and have free time to spend, as they have retired from their work while their Tip children now live independent of them. They are those who pursue self-realization in their new period of life. 9 2 A ge nda Four Agenda Points of Social Responsibility Management How is the company responding to climate change? Active participation in a pilot project for carbon emissions trading Yuhan-Kimberly is undertaking various activities, such as the improvement of the production process, the project for early reduction of GHG, the pilot project for emissions trading, and the Management by Objectives (MBO) for logistics energy, which are designed to help it meet the low carbon vision of achieving a 30% reduction in GHG below BAU* in 2020 and a 30% increase in the sales of green products. In 2011, the company’s president & CEO took part in the climate change leadership training program, and the company is improving the participation and understanding of employees through the implementation of a Green Office and the improvement of its Remote Working System. GHG Emissions The total GHG emission of Yuhan-Kimberly for 2011 is 170,750 tCO2eq, 4.5% down from a year earlier, and the energy usage of 3,312 TJ, 3.8% down year-on-year. In addition, other indirect GHG emissions derived from transport by direct or consigned logistics center is 7,626 tCO2eq. GHG emissions by year (2009~2011) (Unit: tCO2eq) Energy usage (2009~2011) (Unit: TJ) 114,661 124,457 121,630 100,000 4,000 3,459 3,444 3,312 50,000 3,000 57,784 54,334 49,124 2009 2010 2011 2009 2010 2011 Scope 1 Scope 2 * The energy usage and GHG emission by year was prepared in accordance with the Guideline for GHG/Energy Management by Objectives of the Ministry of Environment and assured by an external assurance institute. For GHG emissions, there is a slight difference between the emissions in Scope 1 and 2 and the total emissions due to trimming to the nearest whole number, and the energy usage and GHG emissions for 2010 were recalculated due to system errors. GHG Reduction Initiative Yuhan-Kimberly received from the government a level of allowable GHG and energy emissions at 209,598 tCO2eq and set a goal of reducing its emissions for 2012 by predicting an expected growth rate of each mill and estimating potential reduction amounts. In 2011, Kimcheon mill, which produces mainly toilet paper, was able to reduce a total of 11,819 tCO2eq by converting the fuel of boilers and direct-fired burners. In addition, through the project for integrating the raw material manufacturing process and the improvement of the cooling/heating system and processes implemented in the Taejeon and Choongju mills, an annual GHG reduction of approximately 3,700 tCO2eq and 3,240 tCO2eq is expected, respectively. Participation as a leader in the pilot project for CERs exchange Since May 2011, Yuhan-Kimberly has participated in the Phase 1 pilot project for emissions trading in the industrial development section, supervised by the Ministry of Knowledge Economy. From July of that year, the exchange was conducted with cyber money and the company exchanged a total of 720,000 tCO2eq, approximately 12% of the entire exchange amount, Four Agenda Points of worth approximately 14 billion KRW. In 2012, the company will join the pilot project and utilize it as an opportunity to get a head-start in learning emissions trading. In the meantime, the Taejeon mill has been engaged in the pilot project for carbon emissions trading (2010-2012), run by the Ministry of Environment, since December 2011. *BAU : business As usual Social Responsibility Management 10 3 A genda Four Agenda Points of Social Responsibility Management How is the ‘Keep Korea Green’ campaign evolving?

They inspect products, containers and packaging with regard to consumer injuries and safety, and check the labeling of packages, product advertisements and events to ensure that they can give useful information to customers. In addition, through collaboration with related divisions before the release of a new product, they inspect any potential risks and complaints with regard to the product in question, and strive to prevent any consumer complaints. For instance, for the new product 'Magic Panty’ in child care, related organizations, including product development team, quality assurance team and customer satisfaction team, made a TFT for prevention of risks and complaints and checked any possible complaints resulting from the product standards that are different from the existing products and carried out additional improvement activities to complement any problems found. Improvement of consumer complaints: Task Force Team To improve consumer complaints, Yuhan-Kimberly is running a separate task force team to each handle separately the Marketing Team, Product Development Team, QA Team and Customer Satisfaction Team. In addition, should rapid improvement of rapidly increasing consumer complaints be required, or should matters that injure consumers or threaten their safety occur, or should a change of design be required due to repeated complaints, the company produces an improved sample and conducts a survey on satisfaction with the improved product, working with those consumers who experienced the relevant complaint. Expansion of communication channels Yuhan-Kimberly continues to expand its customer communications to enhance customer access and convenience. In addition to telephone, texting and web consulting, the company installed a chat consulting service in May 2011 so that customers can use a real-time consulting service for their inquiries, and, as a result, the call concentration decreased from 84% to 80%. In addition, the company has consigned general customer consulting services to a customer support center since September 2011. The company has sought to maintain the service quality of customer consulting and enhance productivity by selecting a proven company in the field of customer consulting, and, as a result, the call productivity per consultant rose 25% from 45 cases to 57 cases. Response to the risk issues: issue on product safety control In November 2011, KBS program Consumer Reports’ episode ‘Two faces of wet tissue products: Anti-bacteria in return for safety’ raised a safety issue facing wet tissue products by pointing out the insufficient safety standards in place for wet tissue preservatives in Korea and the detection of MI/MCI preservatives. The preservatives mentioned in the program are used in some of Yuhan-Kimberly's wet tissue products to complement natural preservatives, but the company has strictly managed all its wet tissue products in accordance with the cosmetics standards of EU and USA as well as domestic cosmetics standards. As a follow-up to the broadcast, the company sought to relieve the worries of customers about the safety of the products by quickly posting a notice that says Yuhan-Kimberly’s wet tissue products meet those strict safety standards on the company’s homepage. 2012 Yuhan-Kimberly Sustainability Report 21 Local Communities Social contribution projects for local communities Yuhan-Kimberly is cooperating with local communities through various activities for greater sustainability within Korea, including forest/environment protection, being family-friendly (care and women), securing cultural assets and the participation of its employees in voluntary service activities.

Further conclusions and observations on the adoption of reporting principles and specific performance information are made below; Regarding the level of adherence to reporting principles, we conclude the following: AA1000 Principles •Inclusivity: YUHAN-KIMBERLY has engaged with a wide range of stakeholders regarding sustainability issues via stakeholder committee and survey. Stakeholder engagement process, stakeholder committee meeting and survey result are disclosed in detail in the Report. Stakeholder groups which are Employees, Business partners(Suppliers), Customers, and Local communities, Shareholders are identified in the Report. Operating a stakeholder committee is recognized as good practice to take on board the voice of stakeholders. In addition YUHAN-KIMBERLY has analyzed stakeholder survey results since 2006. The accumulated information clearly indicates stakeholders’ concerns and expectation to YUHANKIMBERLY. Its operation of the stakeholder committee is noted as one of its best practices as well. •Responsiveness: Stakeholders’ views, interests and expectations derived from the survey are considered in the preparation of the Report and in the formulation of YUHAN-KIMBERLY’s sustainability management approach. DNV recommends that YUHAN-KIMBERLY establish more effective process responding to respective material issues with midand long-term quantitative objectives which are monitored, measured and reported for the achievement of the sustainability vision. •Materiality: The Report generally provides an account of performance on the issues that are most significant to YUHAN-KIMBERLY’s activities and which are most relevant to its stakeholders. The material issues were identified and prioritized based upon the stakeholders’ opinion sought by survey. DNV recommends major risks identified with the enterprise risk manual need to be integrated into the materiality determination process as a holistic approach to sustainability management. In addition, YUHAN-KIMBERLY is recommended to formally document the materiality determination process covering methods, assumptions, materiality threshold criteria, reporting and review procedures. YUHAN-KIMBERLY needs to make efforts to improve the sustainability performance of the supply chain by providing necessary training, advice and audit, etc. Additional principles •Reliability: No material errors have been detected in the data and information verified in accordance with AA1000 AS (2008) and VeriSustainTM. Data and information presented in the report are generally reliable. However, implementation of the internal data assessment on a regular basis needs to be considered to improve data quality. The Report is referred to GRI G3.1 and some data such as the environmental performance and afforestration are presented for more than 10 years periods so that the readers can compare the performance over time. Some data in the report found inconsistent with the source data during the verification and subsequently the errors were corrected. DNV recommends to carry out QA/QC to ensure data quality. Criteria and accounting methodology of data measured, collected and calculated every year for reporting should be developed in a documented procedure to maintain data quality. 2012 Yuhan-Kimberly Sustainability Report •Completeness: The scope and boundary of the Report cover the issues and activities that are of most significance to YUHAN-KIMBERLY and relevance to its stakeholders. No material omissions were identified in data or information verified. •Neutrality: In general the Report provides a fair and balanced representation of YUHAN-KIMBERLY’s approach and performance in 2011.
