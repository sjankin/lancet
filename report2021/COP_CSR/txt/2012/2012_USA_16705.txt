Often times this is easy. Other times it community residents and the event industry are impacted and influenced, but sharpens the focus on issues that require delicate tradeoffs. Priority issues for to a lesser degree.

This typically includes catering, printed materials and hotels. In some situations it may also include transportation, AV and exhibit materials. For sustainability clients we measure detailed information about supply chains to the greatest extent possible. For example, sign use will be analysed and itemised according to actual and potential reuse, recycled content, use of natural materials and method of disposal. 14 2011 2010 2009 3 Life Cycle Impacts Energy saved (Mj) 3,628,627 9,233,218 1,376,741 Water saved (L) 4,011,488 12,254,175 1,841,344 Emissions avoided (MT CO2) 8,918,093 14,210,158 77,717 Trees saved 915 1,153 1,375 Press articles & awards earned for clients 53 97 10 Net cost savings $563,672 $173,483 $1,724,358 MeetGreen® calculator score (conference / sustainability project) 47/65 45/61 36/55 Reporting period: January December of each year. 1. Event Sustainabilty Data disclosed does not represent all projects, only those able to report KPIs. Percentages are therefore based on total event projects reporting, not total events. In 2008-2009 this included only client projects specifically contracting for sustainable event services. In 2010 some conference management projects were able to add data. 18 events captured sustainability data in 2011. Indicators for waste include venues only, including catering waste onsite. Emissions scope calculated includes hotel stays, venue energy, air and ground transportation emissions. Emissions do not include freight with the exception of one event which does include freight. 2. Hotel data is based on total number of properties used across events reporting. The percentage for local/organic indicated is the average portion of menu ingredients that meet local or organic criteria over all events reporting. Each event analysed a selection of functions that comprised the highest volume of food served for that event. Fair trade data is based on total events providing this option for attendees. Paper metrics represent the percentage of all MeetGreen® projects using a minimum 30% post-consumer content for communications. 3. Life Cycle Impacts include the total estimated benefits associated with sustainable event decisions for reporting events within a single event cycle. Benefits calculated using vendor-reported metrics and data provided by the Environmental Paper Calculator, Carpet America Recovery Effort, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Plastics Europe Association of Plastics Manufacturers, Conserveatree and the Carbon Consultancy. Data Verification & Analysis Securing reliable sustainable event metrics is an on-going challenge, but is becoming easier as more people ask for footprint metrics. MeetGreen® strives to be a leader in this space in three specific ways: 1. Setting a consistent scope for what is measured and how it is measured. 2. Error-checking and being transparent about potential discrepancies in data. 3. Verifying data through onsite observation, including tracing waste through disposal, even where it means inspecting recycling plants that service venues. 15 EVOLUTION OF ACTION OUR APPROACH 1. Plans that provide a solid foundation and strategic direction for projects. 2. Support through procurement systems and training to enable effective execution. 3. Action to engage stakeholders to implement plans to improve satisfaction. 4. Check to measure progress and ensure accountability. 5. Advocacy to change internal and external practice based on lessons learned.

Following is a guide of where to find GRI EOSS disclosures in our 2011 Report. Those disclosures fully reported are identified on the following page with a check mark (P), while the remainder are partially disclosed. As a small business enterprise we’ve found this to be a challenging but possible exercise. In particular, we’ve learned important distinctions need to be drawn between our business operations on a daily basis at headquarters, and those activities associated with specific events. While we have a higher degree of control over and ability to measure our direct operating impacts, this is not always so with our varied event projects where we may only influence management and measurement of impacts. These projects also experience great diversity in scope, affecting materiality and reporting boundaries. Our consideration of how to apply GRI EOSS to our own business provides us with an informed perspective that helps us advise our own clients in how to approach the GRI EOSS.
