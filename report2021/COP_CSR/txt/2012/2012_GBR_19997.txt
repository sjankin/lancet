RICS Sustainability 02 RICS Corporate Responsibility Report A word from the CEO Responsible Action Responsible action is at the heart of everything we do at RICS, and transparency is an essential ingredient. This annual report on progress is an important way not only to communicate achievements but to identify areas requiring further work. Being a signatory of the UN Global Compact and its Ten Principles has provided us with an ideal framework for understanding challenges and opportunities on our journey towards demonstrable leadership as a responsible business. Our programme to achieve this includes widening our engagement in the ﬁelds of anti-corruption, ‘green’ supply chain management in the built environment, and integrating sustainable development principles into higher education. One challenge lies in contextualising corporate responsibility for our employees and our membership. Achieving our goals will greatly depend on our ability to successfully engage with our employees on this agenda. During 2011/2012, we have witnessed an encouraging increase in the level of enthusiasm with which our employees embraced volunteering at local levels and organising fundraising activities, particularly to support our corporate charity WaterAid, thus giving something back to global communities. Another objective has to be to optimise our organisational day-to-day practices to demonstrate to our members that we set the same standards internally as we would expect them to meet in their own organisations. To this end, over the course of the past year we established a reporting base-line through monitoring and quantitative evaluation of our work, along with engaging internal and external stakeholders to better understand existing work and to shape future plans. One of last year’s objectives was to further cut our carbon emissions for our three main sites, which are in the UK. I am very pleased to be able to report that resource efﬁciency in running the buildings at these sites has been further increased, in many areas even surpassing typical industry practice. Unfortunately, we have not achieved our overall carbon footprint reduction target due to strategic business expansion in several markets around the world: one signiﬁcant contributor to our 2011/2012 carbon footprint was business travel. During 2012/2013 we will be concentrating on measures to minimise the impact of this, and generally improving our performance, for example through expanding our use of video and rolling out improved policies on issues such as procurement. Finally, by investing in building professional capacity through global sustainable development standards and training, and bringing together academia and practice with dedicated research and scholarships, we are shaping the responsible professionalism of the future.

Over the past year, through the Corporate Responsibility Steering Group we carried out an analysis on how to strengthen our ‘responsible business, responsible employer’ approach. We speciﬁcally addressed two areas that had been identiﬁed for potential improvement in our previous report: 1. How to encourage more of our employees to get personally involved in fully embedding our Responsible Business vision within the organisation? 2. How to ensure our employees’ wellbeing and health against a background of increasing economic and business pressures?
