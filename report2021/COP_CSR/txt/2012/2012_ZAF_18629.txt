ENVIROMENTAL PRINCIPLES: Principle 7 Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challengers; Principle 8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies C AND G AIR aircraft meet international standards regarding noise pollution. All aircraft meet Stage III noise compliance requirements, which is in line with our goal to reduce noise pollution. The aircraft also have modern Jet and Turbo propeller engines, which are more fuel efficient and reduce carbon emissions. The recycling of paper within the work place continues to be a success. During 2012 C AND G AIR also removed all desk top printers and have established centralized printing stations within the various offices, this has not only reduced costs but allows us to monitor users and potential wasting of paper.
