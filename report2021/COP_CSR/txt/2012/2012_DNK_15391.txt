It is sustainability that has chosen us. Sustainability is a mindset. It is a vision of a world where we use and develop the planet instead of consuming it, where we use and develop people instead of consuming them, where we respect fundamental human rights in our conduct. And make’s it a profitable business and part of our risk evaluation. We are determined to be the partner to our customers that support their sustainability goals. We are determined to be a company where people can grow. We are determined to make our own footprint as limited as possible. We are determined to be an active partner in the society we are a part of. We are determined to be a profitable business. In short we are determined to support the development of a sustainable future. Best wishes Jens Moberg CEO, ALECTIA ALECTIA_COP.docx 3 Sustainability We strive to make sustainability a source of opportunity, innovation and competitive advantage by using our enthusiasm, experience and professional skills to make a significant positive difference for our clients, company and society. Progress During 2010 we have focused our effort on making sustainability a clear driver for our own development. We established at cross disciplinary task force to make sure that sustainable aspects where addressed in our competence development and we introduced sustainability as a mandatory consideration in our review processes. Our second COP-report represents our next step towards our vision of masterminding sustainable progress. It is not a destination, but an ongoing and never ending journey to contribute to a more sustainable world. It is defined by our performance in relation to the indicators in our model and our performance is evaluated by our clients, our employees and our external partners. The ambition with this report is to establish a reporting concept containing indicators that we on a long term scale can measure and develop. We have decided on indicators that represent vital elements in our business and areas where our ambition is to go beyond compliance. The clients we serve The nature of our services makes our role as advisors a very important opportunity for making a difference. We look at clients as partners and part of our vision and not an isolated opportunity for profit. Our ambition is to craft and lead challenging projects addressing social, environmental and economic perspectives of a long term improvement and hereby support our client’s sustainability effort. Client satisfaction Satisfied clients are the backbone of our business. We are committed to support value creation within our client’s business. Each year we measure our performance in our Customer Satisfaction Survey. The survey conducted for 2010 documented a slight drop in overall satisfaction, though still giving ALECTIA a satisfactory level of overall customer satisfaction. This resulted in imitate internal customer workshop in order to analyze the reALECTIA_COP.docx 4 sult and define relevant initiatives. We are confident that our results based on internal discussions for 2011 will improve. Furthermore, the survey evaluates our contribution to customer sustainability. On this target the survey also discovered a decline, and here at a level that we do not find satisfactory. Our increased focus on sustainability, as witnessed by sustainability’s integration as the corner piece of our strategy, is also intended to improve sustainability evaluations by our customers. Scale 1-5 2008 2009 2010 General 3,8 4,1 4,0 satisfaction Question 31 N/A 3,5 3,4 Improve your sustainability The company we are and want to be We are a people business and our employees are the most important resource in this business. It is our responsibility to make sure that employees work in a healthy environment and are given the best conditions for personal and professional development. Our employee satisfaction is documented in our annual employee survey. In 2010, the survey had a response percent of 86,9%. We see this response as an expression of interest but we evaluate the general result of the survey as not satisfying. Work-life balance Work–life balance is a broad concept describing the balanced prioritization between work , that is our time spent earning a living on the one hand, and life , that is the time devoted to our health, pleasure, leisure, family and spiritual development, on the other. It is our ambition that our employees enjoy a good work-life balance. Scale 1-5 2009 2010 The compatibility of my work with family and private life 3,8 3,6 Conditions regarding freedom, flexible hours and time off 4,0 3,5 In 2010, we introduced a new contractual agreement for all hourly employees, thus moving the organization to fixed salary across the company. This resulted ALECTIA_COP.docx 5 in an internal discussion regarding whether or not this change would allow us to maintain a good work-life-balance. This issue became clear in our employee survey and resulted in low satisfaction in this area. We will be working with and following this issue carefully as we move forward. Influence on our daily work We believe it is important that employees in ALECTIA experience a high degree of influence on projects and daily work and that ALECTIA delivers the right conditions for personal and professional development. Scale 1-5 2009 2010 Influence on the organizing of my job 3,9 3,9 The freedom I have to make decisions and take actions 3,9 3,8 within my area of responsibility My task are meaningful 4,0 3,9 The level of influence I have regarding my professional 3,5 3,4 development Satisfaction with own career development is not satisfactory for 2010. To improve this aspect of our company we are looking to introduce more transparent and clear career tracks and personal objectives. This will give ALECTIA a better tool for utilizing resources and it gives the employee a clear picture of expectations and personal possibilities. Our annual employee satisfaction survey documented a fall in general satisfaction from 2009 to 2010. Our goal is to achieve 4.0 or above in general satisfaction, so during 2011 we will undertake actions to reach this goal. Scale 1-5 2009 2010 Overall satisfaction 3,8 3,6 Diversity The concept of diversity encompasses acceptance and respect. It means understanding that each individual is unique, and recognizing our individual differences. These can be along the dimensions of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, Political beliefs, or other ideologies. Our objective is to build and maintain a comALECTIA_COP.docx 6 pany culture that allows the exploration of these differences in a safe, positive, and nurturing environment and that moves beyond simple tolerance to embracing and celebrating the rich dimensions of diversity contained within each individual human being. In our annual employee satisfaction survey we also looked at the issues of discrimination and bullying. While few incidents occurred in 2010, we are not satisfied that they did occur. The survey concludes that there is a need for open dialogue on the issue and a discussion on what discrimination and bullying is at ALECTIA. Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, daily somemonthly weekly times I have been bullied at work 13 2 1 3 I have seen other people 52 4 3 0 being bullied at work I have been the victim of 12 0 2 1 discrimination I have witnessed that other 19 1 1 0 have been the victim of discrimination One incident is one to many and we have reinforced our policy on this issue and made a call to action to both management team and employees. We are not and will never be a company that accepts discrimination or bullying. Footprint For a number of clients we make energy saving projects often on a “no cure no pay” agreement. We almost always come up with savings in the range of 10-20 percent. In our offices we estimate that we have the same savings potential given that we undertake investments with an ROI horizon of 5 years. We spent 4.5 million DKK on electricity and heating in our offices in Denmark. Our office in London is not included in this figure because they are currently moving to a new location. For the period 2007-2010 we entered into a “Curve Breaker Agreement” with the Danish Energy Savings Trust with the objective of saving 6 percent on our electricity consumption. Unfortunately, though, our consumption increased by ALECTIA_COP.docx 7 19% in this period as our company grew. This poor result is the result of insufficient focus and investments in increased efficiency. As we enter into a new “Curve Breaker Agreement”, we will do so this time with sufficient focus and investments such that our targets can be achieved. The society we are a part of As knowledge-based company, our engagement with educational institutions is of great importance. We strengthen this relation through educational support and cooperation programs and through the ALECTIA Foundation. Phd-program As a consulting company, our most important resource is employees with significant competences. In ALECTIA, a connection to the research and educational environment is given a high priority, and we have chosen to invest in an extensive PhD program. The objective is to have a yearly average of four industrial PhD students collaborating with ALECTIA. The objective of the PhD program is to heighten the knowledge level in ALECTIA A/S in the competence areas that form the basis of the company's existence. In the program to date, 8 PhD have finished the program and have achieved their degrees, while 3 employees are at the moment working on their PhD projects. The ALECTIA-Foundation considers the PhD-program to be vital for the continued development of ALECTIA as a knowledge-based company. PhD projects concluded in 2010 in ALECTIA 2007-2010: “Strengthening of reinforced concrete structures with externally bonded composite materials”, MSc Engineering Fedja Arifovic. 2006-2010: “Building integrated passive ventilation systems”, MSc Engineering Christian Anker Hviid. 2006-2010: “Quantitative hydrological effects of urbanization and storm water infiltration in Copenhagen, Denmark” Hydro geologist Jan Jeppesen. Present PhD projects 2006-2011: “Simulation-based support for integrated design of new, low-energy office constructions”, MSc Engineering Steffen Petersen. 2008-2011: “Models for Dynamic Wind loads around Buildings”, MSc Engineering Jens Johansson. 2009-2012: “Integration of working environment knowledge in design processes”, MSc Engineering Lene Bjerg Sørensen. ALECTIA_COP.docx 8 External cooperation Our cooperation with the educational institutions is very important to ALECTIA. At the same time, we are also an active partner to a number of industry organizations and we value this opportunity to make our influence count. It is our ambition to expand our network and influence in the business, educational, and political environments, in addition to NGOs. We believe that our expertise can play a role in a number of cooperations and we want to be a proactive partner to the society we operate in. Sponsorship Our own corporate sponsorship is limited, but our owners, the ALECTIA Foundation, make significant financial contributions to support projects relevant to the engineering profession. Through the years, the ALECTIA-Foundation has supported a number of different projects at schools, high schools and other institutes of higher education in order to strengthen the younger generation’s interest in natural science and technology. The Foundation has also supported the Experimentarium, a science museum near Copenhagen, the organization of Danish Science Communication, and to various engineering associations. Additionally, grants have been given to support the publishing of well-deserved technical books thus contributing to the world’s foundation of available knowledge. Finally, the Foundation has supported the establishment of an alumni network at the Technical University of Denmark. In recent years, the foundation has primarily supported initiatives that contribute to an increase in the interest for science and engineering. The ALECTIA-Prize The ALECTIA-Prize is DKK 250,000 prize awarded by the ALECTIA-Foundation to a project or a person ”benefiting the further education and development of Danish engineers” and ”strengthening the reputation of Danish engineering activities in Denmark and abroad”. The 2010 ALECTIA-Prize went to the Strategic Research Centre on Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB) at Aalborg University in Denmark. Conclusion With ALECTIA’s continued support to Global Compact and our ongoing commitment to transparency and action, we are committed to and believe that we will continuously improve our ability to make a positive contribution to our customers, employees, and the society we operate in as we continue to work for a more sustainable world.
