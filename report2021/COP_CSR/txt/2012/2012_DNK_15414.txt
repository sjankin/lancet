Depending on the terminal concept, the total planning and construction time for this new terminal will be between five and seven years, so we have already launched a feasibility study to determine how a future Terminal 4 could be designed. No matter which terminal concept we choose, Copenhagen Airport wishes to preserve its compact design with a flexible utilisation of the infrastructure, which ensures that travellers have short walking distances and low operating costs for the airlines. This will enhance Copenhagen Airports attractiveness as a key European hub. 28 CPH’s responsibility as traffic hub / Preface / Corporate profile / Financial summary / Financial highlights / Financial indicators / Taxation / / Route development / Regulation and charges / Expansion of capacity / CPH’s stakeholders / The travel experience / / Environment and energy / Employees / Safety and security / Procurement / Indicator tables / / CSR accounting policies / Management’s statement / Independent auditor’s report / Glossary / Illustration of Copenhagen Airport’s terminal complex after reconstruction and expansion. / Preface / Corporate profile / Financial summary / Financial highlights / Financial indicators / Taxation / / Route development / Regulation and charges / Expansion of capacity / CPH’s stakeholders / The travel experience / / Environment and energy / Employees / Safety and security / Procurement / Indicator tables / / CSR accounting policies / Management’s statement / Independent auditor’s report / Glossary / A characteristic feature of a major international airport is the large number of players collaborating to operate the airport and give passengers a good travel experience.

This applies not least to persons with reduced mobility or persons who for religious or cultural reasons have special needs that must be taken into account. In 2011, we introduced a rule that 85% of all security screening at the Copenhagen central security checkpoint (Danish acronym: CSC) must be carried out by security officers of the same gender as the passenger. In addition, signs at all security checkpoints inform passengers of their right to request screening by a person of the same gender if they are among the 15% of passengers who are not automatically screened by someone of the same gender. In 2010, we introduced special screening lanes for families travelling with children on peak travel days. Families with children are very pleased with this additional service. It also benefits passengers not travelling with children who are less likely to have a long wait due to the potentially more time-consuming screening process of families travelling with children. The service was so well received in 2010 that we continued to provide this extra service in 2011 as well. Handling of personally sensitive data A department under Security, the ID Card Office, handles issuing ID cards to all persons working permanently in the airport area. To obtain an ID card, applicants must first be approved by the police. This service is performed by the Copenhagen Police, ensuring that no member of CPH staff learns anything relating to a person’s criminal record or anything else that might disqualify them from receiving an ID card. However, the ID Card Office does learn the applicant’s full name, personal registration number, address and employer. This information is processed and stored in a separate system according to procedures laid down by the Danish Transport Authority, thereby ensuring full confidentiality. The handling of data collected in connection with the surveillance of the Copenhagen Airport area is regulated by the Danish Act on CCTV Monitoring and the Danish Personal Data Act. Clear and specific procedures have been defined for how CPH is to handle its CCTV recordings: only a limited number of employees have access to these recordings, and any access to using the recordings is highly regulated. There are also rules as to how long such recordings may be stored.

We are aware of our responsibility in this connection with respect to the Global Compact principles of working against corruption in all its forms, protecting the environment and climate, and supporting internationally declared human rights and labour standards.

In 2012, we will complete the drafting of a code of conduct for our procurement activities. The code of conduct will designate all the aspects of the Global Compact principles with respect to sustainable and responsible procurement and will include possible sanctions for suppliers who do not comply. All new and renegotiated supplier contracts will include our code of conduct, which will also be published on our website. Finally, we will in 2012 formulate and implement procurement-specific CSR policies for CPH in order to ensure that our efforts for sustainable development of our procurement processes are supporting our overall CSR policy. This will guide our future initiatives vis-à-vis our suppliers and our inhouse processes and will be combined to help expand and strengthen compliance with the Global Compact principles. After 2012 Our ongoing work to integrate the Global Compact principles in our supplier contracts includes a target that a minimum of 90% of our contracts with suppliers will comprise these principles in 2016. Continuing initiatives that build on our current initiatives will be applied to help us meet this target. 60 CPH’s responsibility as company / Preface / Corporate profile / Financial summary / Financial highlights / Financial indicators / Taxation / / Route development / Regulation and charges / Expansion of capacity / CPH’s stakeholders / The travel experience / / Environment and energy / Employees / Safety and security / Procurement / Indicator tables / / CSR accounting policies / Management’s statement / Independent auditor’s report / Glossary / In January 2012, we opened CPH Express, which gives airlines the opportunity to offer their passengers faster security screening.
