Global Compact Principle Three Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. MAGNETEC supports all workers in cases they would like to form and/or join a trade union by their own choice within the existing, valid national laws and regulations.

The global approach in strategy, mission, and vision has been realized fitting to the changing market situation but taking the employment status in first priority as the most important “value” in the Company’s daily life. This value was regularly appreciated getting to a higher motivation level by the implemented performance evaluation system. This led to a step up in know-how and practice level in general achieving 10% greater yield output.
