We recycle close to 69 percent of the wood packaging thus eliminating use of fresh wood. We have developed collapsible custom-built polypropylene (PP) boxes for components that are unwieldy to handle (e.g. dashboards) and bought from external vendors. With a cycle time of more than 150 trips, these polypropylene boxes have resulted in significant savings on component packaging. At our Pantnagar plant we have eliminated the use of bubble wrap for packing of spares, body shells and load bodies. Tackling climate change We have adopted a climate change policy which draws from the Tata Group‚Äôs Policy on Climate Change. This policy addresses key issues relating to products, processes and services. We are continually working to develop low carbon, fuel saving technologies which will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Development of CNG vehicles, electric vehicles and hybrids are at the forefront of our efforts towards this end. We have manufactured CNG versions of buses and light commercial vehicles, LPG versions of Indica and CNG versions of ACE goods carrier. Our PCBU business has developed its own climate change strategy which details both short term and long term goals for managing climate change.
