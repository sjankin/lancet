Over the past two decades IPC has collaborated with its members to upgrade the quality of mail service by developing technology systems that bring transparency to the mail processing system and delivery chain. It also manages the system for incentive-based payments between postal operators and creates business intelligence for its members, by providing a range of platforms for CEOs and senior management to exchange best practices, discuss strategy and engage in industry research. IPC also provides operational and IT based services to the postal industry and undertakes wider industry initiatives to help its members meet challenging issues that cut across the postal sector, such as environmental sustainability. IPC represents the majority of the world’s mail, with its members delivering about 80 percent of global postal volumes. They account for nearly 2.3 million jobs. IPC is based in Brussels, Belgium and has an international staff of 63 representing more than 20 different nationalities. IPC is governed by a board comprised of CEOs from eleven member posts and the IPC Chief Executive Officer. IPC members: THE NATURAL PARTNER FOR THE POSTAL INDUSTRY______________________________________________________________________________________________________3 Statement of support The International Post Corporation (IPC) has become a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, as part of its on-going sustainability program. As a signatory, we at IPC will ensure that the ten principles are incorporated in our business model. We will build on the work we are already doing to bring our members together to share best practice and support the mobilization of collective action on different issues. IPC will also attend UN Global Compact events and provide support to members interested in becoming signatories. Furthermore, as a growing employer and expanding business, we take our own commitment to these Principles seriously. As such, we are committed to practicing these Principles with respect to our employees, environment, operations and local communities. The UN Global Compact Launched in 2000, by then UN-Secretary General Kofi Annan, the United Nations Global Compact is now the largest voluntary corporate initiative in the world, with over 4700 corporate participants and stakeholders in over 130 countries. The main objective of the initiative is to mainstream ten sustainability principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. The initiative encourages global support for the principles and supports actions that contribute to broader UN goals, such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). CEO Statement Now that we have the Environmental Measurement and Monitoring System in place, it is important that we not only build on this, but that we take an active part in the wider debate, so that we can share our experiences with others, learn from them and be part of the overall solution.

First through the InfraVest Changbin Wind Farm Project Gold Standard project in Taiwan. This year our carbon offsetting activities are supporting a project to provide energy efficient stoves to rural households and communities in Kenya: http://climateneutralgroup.com/en/services/projects/?project=the-paradigm-project-clean-andsustainable-wood-stoves-in-kenya-2  Printing paper is Cyclus Offset 100 percent recycled. Reductions in our paper use are driven through continued implementation of a minimal printing policy and – unless there are good and pressing reasons – IPC encourage the printing of documents in black and white and on doublesided paper only  Continued provision of recycling facilities in our communal areas so that employees can recycle glass, cardboard and plastic  Continued use of environmentally friendly printing, IT and lighting technology on a replacement basis  Continued emphasis on the use of teleconferencing and remote presentation technologies (e.g. WebEx and webinar techniques) to help reduce business travel  Continued selection (in collaboration with our IT supplier) of additional desktop PC’s (and other relevant equipment) on the basis of their performance/energy efficiency in order to accommodate growing employee numbers Principle 8 Initiatives to promote environmental responsibility Our commitment or policy In 2008, IPC developed the Environmental Measurement and Monitoring System (EMMS) in direct response to requests from CEOs working throughout the postal industry for implementation of a common carbon measurement and reporting framework, in line with customer requirements and stakeholder expectations. With the help of our members, a pilot of the system was carried out in 2008. The full programme was rolled out in 2009, capturing data and progress for the 2008 calendar and financial reporting year. The objective is to provide a common reporting structure for posts to disclose their environmental management strategies, performance and achievements. THE NATURAL PARTNER FOR THE POSTAL INDUSTRY______________________________________________________________________________________________________10 A brief description of our processes and systems Each year, participating postal companies complete a comprehensive self-assessment questionnaire. This involves reporting on performance trends, sector averages and company scores, for both the qualitative Carbon Management Proficiency (CMP) section of the EMMS and a suite of 20 Carbon Performance Indicators (CPI) across five categories. In order to ensure consistency of the data, participants are provided with an exhaustive guidance document for reference. The final results are subject to review by IPC and Maplecroft, an independent advisory consultancy specialising in global risks management. This review process also stimulates constructive feedback, monitoring and continuous improvement of the programme for the future. Recent actions  The EMMS system has now been extended beyond IPC members; South African Post Office joined in 2011 and Brazil Post will join in 2012.  In 2010 postal operators, under IPC’s global postal sustainability programme collectively reduced CO2 emissions by 329,000 tonnes, equivalent to a cut of 4.2%.  Together with the CO2 emissions reduction over 7% in 2009, in two years the EMMS has already surpassed the half-way milestone on the road to achieving its target of cutting 20% of emissions by 2020.  IPC continues to develop the EMMS system, with increased engagement with our members, improved guidance documentation, emissions calculation tools and plausibility check processes. THE NATURAL PARTNER FOR THE POSTAL INDUSTRY______________________________________________________________________________________________________11 Principle 9 Encourage environmentally-friendly technology Our commitment or policy As part of our EMMS program, we actively encourage our members to make increasing use of alternative fuel vehicles in their delivery fleets. Alternative vehicles are vehicles that run on fuels other than standard petrol and diesel. This includes electric vehicles, hydrogen vehicles, vehicles that run exclusively on biofuels or that that run on LPG and CNG. It excludes vehicles that run on bio/ mineral fuel mixes that are at or below the nationally agreed minimum content of bio/mineral fuel. IPC participants are also required to provide their energy usage data for both renewable electricity purchased (‘green’ electricity) and for alternative energy sources including geothermal, biomass, solar and wind power. A brief description of our processes and systems The International Post Corporation has developed the EMMS system drive improvements in our clients’ environmental performance. A summary of this system can be found under Principles 7 & 8 above. Recent actions  The EMMS system measures the percentage of alternative vehicles within each of our members’ delivery fleets. We publish performance figures and case studies in our sustainability report to encourage increased uptake.  In 2011 we reported a 50% increase in the number of companies transporting post by vehicles using alternative fuels, since the start of the EMMS program in 2008.  We have increased the scope of our data collection process. We now require detailed categorisation of the different types of alternative vehicle that each of our members are using, covering a broad range of different vehicle types including electric, hybrid, LNG and hybrid.
