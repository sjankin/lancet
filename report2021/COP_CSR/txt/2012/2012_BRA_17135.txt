Technological Upgrade In 2011 and early 2012, the Company carried out the technological upgrade of its work stations, which went from 82% desktops and 18% laptops to 60% desktops and 40% laptops, increasing productivity due to the mobility required by certain processes and functions. There was also a significant improvement in the specification of equipment, with a focus on the more efficient use of power. Copel Agenda for Climate Change In June 2011, the Copel Agenda for Climate Change was approved and published on our website, presenting the commitments taken by the Company for the coming years in terms of climate change, and providing means to encourage practices and projects to mitigate and offset carbon credits. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 8 Floods on the coast The difficult access to re-establish the services in the rural communities of Rasgadinho and Limeira (in Morretes) and Floresta (in Paranaguá), hit by a storm in March 2011, was the main challenge faced by the Company's team. For the families living in these areas, Copel suspended the payment of monthly power bills of homes that were damaged by the rain, for up to six months. Through the EletriCidadania Volunteering Program, the Company introduced the 2011 Easter Campaign, seeking to provide services to the municipality of Antonina, the most damaged city on the coast. More than 300 kilograms of chocolate were collected, in addition to lollipops, candy and popcorn, which were included in the kit delivered to all children. Therefore, in addition to the school, other entities in Antonina, Morretes and Paranaguá, have received donations. In addition to candy, the Olympia Breyer school also received a snack kit, and the volunteers prepared recreational activities, including painting the children's faces, lectures about the safe use of energy and a musical performance. Award to the Migrageo project The program to modernize and migrate the geo-processing information systems in the Distribution Office – Migrageo is comprised of 53 projects, and has been in progress since 2005. Two rounds of the Pilot Project were carried out in the first half of the year for the applications of Cartography, Registration and Management of Networks and Network Projects. In 2011, approximately 450 employees were trained to use the application for consulting geo-referenced information about Copel's distribution – WEBGEO -, and these employees will help disclosing the new functions. There are more than 3,500 users currently using this system throughout Copel. In July, Copel received an international award for a special achievement in Geo-processing SAG Award Special Achievement in GIS (USA). For 2012, the Company expects to maintain the program by developing and implementing other modules of the program, such as, for instance: Management of Transformers, Elimination of the GEDIS and VISION Systems, Inventory of Networks, Data Extraction, and others. New participations: wind power generation and electric energy transmission In November 2011, Copel acquired a 49.9% interest in the company São Bento Energia S.A., in four wind power stations, which are Special Purpose Entities – SPEs (GE Olho d'Água, GE Boa Vista, GE Farol and GE São Bento do Norte) located in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. When completed, these stations, which will generate power from wind, will have a consolidated installed capacity of 94 MW, enough to meet the consumption demand of a city with approximately 200,000 inhabitants. Also in November 2011, Copel acquired a 49.9% interest in the company Cutia Empreendimentos Eólicos S.A., with the purpose of participating in the development of projects for five wind power stations located in the State of Rio Grande do Norte (Maria Helena, Jangada, Pedra Grande, Cutia and Guajiru), with an indicated capacity of 137.4 MW. The project is its initial development phase, and there is currently no estimated date for the start-up of the wind power stations. Still in 2011, by means of a bid through auctions promoted by the National Electric Energy Agency Aneel, Copel acquired interests in the companies Costa Oeste Transmissora de Energia S.A., Caiuá Transmissora de Energia S.A., Transmissora Sul Brasileira de Energia S.A., Marumbi Transmissora de Energia S.A. and Integração Maranhense Transmissora de Energia S.A., owners of concessions of public service for the implementation, operation and exploration of installations for the transmission of power within the scope of the Basic Network of the National Interconnected System SIN. The companies Caiuá Transmissora de Energia S.A. and Integração Maranhense Transmissora de Energia S.A. were established in 2012, and company São Bento Energia S.A. was classified as an advance for a future investment. In March 2012, Copel (49%), together with the State Grid Brazil Holding (51%), acquired Batches A and B of the Transmission Auction no. 02/2012, held by Aneel. The batches total 1,605 km of transmission lines and 4 substations in the states of Mato Grosso, Goiás and Minas Gerais. The construction term is 32 months after the signature of the concession agreement. The total RAP is R$ 199.5 million, of which R$ 126.4 million refers to batch A and R$ 73.1 million refers to batch B (historical values). All development undertakings are expected to start up in 2014. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 9 Plant nursery of the Mauá HPP In June 2011, the Caviúnas Plant Nursery was launched in the municipality of Ortigueira, close to the construction site of the Mauá HPP. The purpose of the plant nursery is to preserve and reproduce various species collected during the vegetable suppression process to form the plant's reservoir, which will be used in Copel's reforestation programs, both in areas of environmental conservation in the surrounding areas of the reservoir and to meet compensatory measures in the region. In 2011, approximately 50,000 were produced in this nursery. In addition to seedlings and tree seeds, plants recovered from the areas of suppression for the reservoir being relocated to this nursery, including epiphytes, such as orchids and bromeliads, as well as herbaceous, shrubby and climbing plants. Abradee Survey According to the 13th Residential Customer Satisfaction Survey conducted by the Abradee Associação Brasileira de Distribuidoras de Energia Elétrica [Brazilian Association of Power Distributors], through Instituto Innovare [Innovare Institute], power consumers served by Copel are the most satisfied in Brazil with the quality of supply and with the services provided by their concessionaire.

In compliance with the corporate strategies, the Company develops marketing and communication plans. Corporate communication seeks to highlight the importance of the Company's mission to develop the State, its business and services in power generation, transmission and distribution, in addition to telecommunication. Together with the communication plan for sustainability, it discloses actions developed by Copel for environmental preservation, the studies of alternative energies, social investments made in education, culture, sports and health, benefiting thousands of people in the whole state of Paraná, and the Company's performance and economic outlook. As a final result, it strengthens Copel's image before the public. The constant concern about communicating with all stakeholders reinforces the importance of the relationship channels provided to them and service channels made available to all consumers, and, through periodical surveys, these channels are evaluated and improved, favoring communication, interaction of institutional and market issues, and consolidation of communication as a strategic component within the organization. Marketing communication is responsible for allowing all customers of the company to know information about its products, services and service channels, with the purpose of increasing customer satisfaction and perceiving the value delivered by Copel. The main goal of this communication is to provide agility and quality to customer care, products and services, in addition to useful information about the safe and efficient use of electric energy. It also reinforces the alignment of technical, operational and commercial guarantees to the corporate positioning on sustainability and corporate governance. (GRI PR6) The internal communication channels are also used to prepare the staff with the same quality as in relationships with stakeholders. All internal and external communication channels disclose the same content in their messages, reinforcing an integrated marketing communication. Given that some of Copel's customers have special needs, specific channels are also provided. In order to care for customers with visual impairment, invoices are made available in Braille, and the Company's website is accessible since 2008. Agency staff has been trained to care for customers with hearing impairment in the Brazilian Sign Language (Libras). Agencies and service stations are being adjusted to welcome customers with physical disabilities or difficulty walking. (GRI EU24) Every two years, Copel conducts a survey about its image before stakeholders, in order to evaluate the Company's brand and image, employing qualitative (in-depth interviews and discussion groups) and quantitative (one-on-one interviews) techniques. The qualitative technique allows interviewees — suppliers, shareholders, the government, members of the Company's Board of Directors, regulatory agencies, the community (district associations in urban areas), the society (NGOs representing the environmental, cultural and social segments), the media (radio broadcasters, TV channels, newspapers, advertising agencies) and customers (free, residential, industrial, commercial, services, Copel employees and outsourced workers) — to express their opinion in a non-structured manner, enabling a better understanding of the reasons and motivations that are adjacent to the Company's brand and image. Rational and safe use of energy: communication initiatives Campaigns to educate the society on the safe use of electric energy to avoid accidents, a constant concern of the Company, has evolved to a more sustainable action, incorporating concepts of citizenship and care with the environment. The program entitled Kit Escola [School Kit], is one of the main means of communication used for this purpose, consisting in lectures provided by safety technicians and 650 volunteers throughout Paraná, with distribution of materials related to the subject . Another efficient way of informing the population about the safe use of electric energy consists in messages announced by radio broadcasters, through a partnership with the AERP Associação de Radiodifusão do Paraná [Paraná's Radio Broadcasting Association], with 309 broadcasters. Each broadcaster announces eleven messages per day, from Monday to Saturday, representing 3,399 messages per day and 88,374 per month. (GRI EU7) 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 16 The National Week of Electric Energy Safety – held every year – also helps disseminating information among schools, civil construction companies and consumers, at public places like parks, supermarkets, bus stations and shopping malls. In accordance with a pre-established annual calendar, the divisions of all different regional branches in the State hold lectures at companies, rural cooperatives, construction sites, class associations and the community in general, and participate in regional fairs and events. Customers also receive messages in their energy bills and envelopes. Customers residing in rural regions receive the rural calendar for power consumption self-reading, which provides information about the safe use of energy and other concepts regarding sustainability. Collecting agents Since 1985, Copel maintains a partnership with the network of collecting agents. The Company is a pioneer in establishing this alternative channel for the payment of energy bills. Currently comprising 1,657 establishments in Paraná, both in the urban and rural regions, the network of collecting agents is responsible for receiving the payment of 31% of the energy bills, corresponding to one million and 200 thousand energy bills/month. The partnership also includes the distribution of informative materials on the safe and efficient use of power to customers. Mobile Service Stations MSS The Company has thirteen mobile units used to meet the needs of its customers, providing access to commercial services, instructions about the safe and efficient use of energy, rights, duties and social programs. This year, Copel is acquiring another five VAN units, with the purpose of modernizing its fleet and providing customers with more comfort, speed in service and a better presentation of its brand. These units will be endowed with the most modern equipment available in the technology segment, with the implementation of data transmission through optical fiber and use of equipment with a high level of energy efficiency. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 17 1.6.

Colíder Hydropower Plant The Concession of the Colíder HPP development undertaking, with an installed capacity of 300 MW, was acquired in an auction on 07.30.2010 by Copel. It is located in the Teles Pires river, in the municipalities of Nova Canaã do Norte, Itaúba, Colíder and Cláudia, in the State of Mato Grosso. The Concession Agreement no. 001/2011 – MME – Colíder HPP was executed on 01.17.2011, and the project has a total expected investment of around R$ 1.57 billion. Construction began in March 2011, and commercial generation is expected to begin in December 2014. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 24 1.6.3. Transmission (GRI EU6) The segment's main attribution is to provide electric energy transport and transformation services, being responsible for the construction, operation and maintenance of substations, as well as the lines used for energy transmission. Copel holds and operates 2,029 km of transmission lines and 31 substations of the Basic Network, with a transformation power of around 10,000 MVA. Works in Substations SS and Transmission Lines TL are targeted at expanding and strengthening the National Interconnected System SIN (basic network). They comprise the development undertakings acquired in auctions promoted by Aneel, constructions authorized by Authorizing Resolutions, and constructions included in the Modernization Plan for Installations of Systemic Interest. In 2011, amounts higher than R$ 112.0 million were invested in this set of projects. The milestone that stood out was the completion, on 12.04.2011, of the construction project of the transmission line connecting the substations of Foz do Iguaçu and Cascavel Oeste, 115.7 km, at 525 kV, with an investment of around R$ 100 million. A work integrating the Growth Acceleration Plan, it is critical for Paraná and strategic for Copel, which will start transporting the energy production quota of the Itaipu Plant to the three Southern States, representing an increase of R$ 8.45 million in the Company's annual revenues. As for the operation and maintenance activities of Copel's installations in the Basic Network (more than 230 kV), the strict and continuous improvement work was carried on, seeking to guarantee the availability levels of the transmission system under the Company's responsibility. In this context, the following stood out in 2011: • Availability level of substations and transmission lines above 99.9%; • conduction of improvement works in many SS, with no accidental downtime, which represents an appropriate planning of the interventions; and • contracting of a pilot project for a detailed inspection of transmission lines through footage and HD pictures, without requiring technicians to go on long helicopter flights. 1) Development undertakings with Concession or Authorization for 2011. Many expansion works authorized by Aneel have been executed in 2011, including the installation of new transformers. Highlights for the completion of the installation of new transformers in the substations of Guaira (150 MVA/230 kV), Posto Fiscal (150 MVA/230 kV), Foz do Chopin (150 MVA/230 kV) and the Industrial District of São José dos Pinhais (2x150 MVA/230 kV).

The table below shows the increase in Annual Revenue Allowed RAP from transmission in the period. Cycle/Resolution Basic network Connections Total 2010-11 Res. 1021/2010 225,775,116.98 34,007,423.64 259,782,540.62 2011-12 Res. 1171/2011 250,055,524.24 39,867,804.03 293,544,721.08 Difference in reais 24,280,407.26 5,860,380.39 33,762,180.46 Percentage difference 10.8% 17.2% 13.0% Copel Geração e Transmissão S.A. holds six transmission concession agreements, of which four are under commercial operation, already entitled to receiving revenues, and the other two are under construction (Araraquara 2 TL – Taubaté and Cerquilho III SS, expected to start operating in October 2012). Revenue adjustments were made as presented in the previous table, which was established in each agreement. Concession Agreement no. 060/2001, which covers the transmission installations of the existing system and expansions authorized by Aneel, and Concession Agreement no. 075/2011, referring to the Bateias/Jaguariaíva TL, were adjusted according to the IGP-M accumulated in the period, at 9.77%. On the other hand, Concession Agreements no. 006/2008, referring to the Bateias TL— Pilarzinho, and no. 027/ 2009, for the Cascavel Oeste TL — Foz do Iguaçu, were adjusted at the IPCA accumulated in the period, at 6.55%. For these agreements, Aneel authorized an additional adjustment of 2.60% to offset the effect of the extension of the RGR up to the end of 2035, according to the Preliminary Measure no. 571/2010. Transmission Revenues – Fee Revision In 2009, a second fee revision was expected to be applied to transmission concessionaires. However, since Aneel did not timely approve the methodology, the process was postponed to 2010. 9. In 2010, through Approving Resolution no. 1,008/2010, Aneel approved the temporary result of the second periodical revision of Copel Geração e Transmissão S.A., establishing the fee repositioning to be applied to RBNI installments (an RAP installment corresponding to the new installations comprising the Basic Network) and RCDM (an RAP installment corresponding to the new DITs), in force in June 2009, of -22.88%. In response to an appeal filed by Copel, Aneel reconsidered the revision calculations with regard to the means of considering asset depreciation. Therefore, in 2011, through Approving Revolution no. 1152/2011, it approved the final result of the revision, establishing the fee repositioning to be applied at -19.94%. As a result, there was an additional R$ 9.9 million in the RAP in the 20112012 cycle. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 27 1.6.4. Distribution (GRI EU3,EU4,EU6,EU26) Under the scope of power distribution, Copel's main activities consist in providing, operating and maintaining the infrastructure, as well as providing co-related services. These activities seek to provide services to more than 3.9 million energy consumers, in 1,117 locations in 396 municipalities in Paraná, and in the municipality of Porto União, in the state of Santa Catarina. The municipalities of Guarapuava, Coronel Vivida and Rio Negro are partially served. In addition to operating and maintaining the installations at voltage levels of up to 34.5 kV, Copel Distribuição also operates in installations with voltage levels of 69 and 138 kV. Copel maintains its challenge of executing a bold construction program of transmission lines and substations in the electric energy distribution area, establishing continuous records of new development undertakings in this segment. In 2011, 11 new substations were connected, and 5 new high-voltage lines were completed, strengthening the electric distribution system, improving energy quality and increasing the availability of power to consumers. These investments reflect Copel's commitment to the population of Paraná, contemplating all regions of the state with various projects, including substations and high-voltage lines of 69 kV and 138 kV. Substation construction projects completed in 2011 include: • Novo Mundo Substation, at 41 MVA/69 kV, in Curitiba; • Tangará Substation, at 41 MVA/138 kV, in Arapongas; • Portal Substation, at 20 MVA/138 kV, in Foz do Iguaçu; • Tunas Substation, at 25 MVA/69 kV, in Tunas do Paraná; • Prudentópolis Substation, at 20 MVA/138 kV, in Prudentópolis; • Barbosa Ferraz Substation, at 20 MVA/138 kV, in Barbosa Ferraz; • Marialva Substation, at 20 MVA/138 kV, in Marialva; • Arapoti Substation, at 20 MVA/138 kV, in Arapoti; • Santa Helena Substation, at 20 MVA/138 kV, in Santa Helena; • Coroados Substation, at 7 MVA/34.5 kV, in Guaratuba; • Areia Branca dos Assis Substation, at 4 MVA/34.5 kV, in Mandirituba. In addition to these constructions, the Olímpico (Cascavel) and Mercês (Curitiba) substations were expanded, with the installation of new transformers at 41 MVA. New High-voltage lines at 69 kV and 138 kV, which were completed: • 138 kV Barbosa Ferraz — Ivaiporã, 42.14 km-long; • 138 kV Campo Mourão — Barbosa Ferraz, 37.97 km-long; • 69 kV Santa Mônica — Pinhais, 14.20 km-long; and • 69 kV Santa Mônica — Quatro Barras, 7.83 km-long. As a whole, these development undertakings added, in 2011, 369 MVA to the distribution system, and 115.1 km in new transmission lines of 69 or 138kV. Distribution Lines The table below shows the number of kilometers of Copel's distribution lines: Distribution Lines Extension (in km) 13.8 kV 97,981.0 34.5 kV 80,662.2 69 kV 1,003.5 138 kV 4,705.3 230 kV 66.1 Total 184,418.1 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 28 Compact Networks Copel has been implementing compact lines in urban areas with a high level of trees in the surrounding areas of the distribution networks. This technology avoids cutting and lopping trees, and improves the quality of supply, as it reduces the level of downtime. At the end of 2011, the compact distribution networks installed were 2,730 km-long. Isolated Secondary Networks Copel is also investing in isolated secondary networks with low voltage (127/220 V), which have significant advantages in relation to the conventional aerial network, such as: improving the DEC (duration equivalent to interruptions per consumer) and FEC (equivalent frequency of interruptions per consumer) indicators, making it difficult to steal energy, improving environmental conditions, and reducing the lopping area, increasing safety, reducing voltage drops throughout the network, and increasing the useful life of transformers by reducing the number of short-circuits in the network, among others. At the end of 2011, the isolated secondary distribution networks installed were 7,743 km-long. Substations The table below shows Copel's distribution substation park, according to the voltage: Distribution Lines Extension (in km) 13.8 kV 97,981.0 34.5 kV 80,662.2 69kV 1,003.5 138 kV 4,705.3 230 kV 66.1 Total 184,418.1 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 29 Market share and market growth From January to December 2011, the total billed market, which includes the captive market, free consumers served by Copel Geração, supply to the concessionaires and licensees increased by 4.6%, reaching 23,974 GWh versus 22,926 GWh in 2010. The captive market, which accounted for 93.7% of the billed market, recorded a 5.4% growth in 2011. The number of consumers billed by Copel in December 2011 showed a variation of 4.2% when reaching 3,916,946 consumers. From January to December this year, 157,535 consumers were added to the captive market. The residential class, which accounted for 26.0% of the total market, showed an increase of 5.0% in 2011, reaching 6,224 GWh versus 5,925 GWh in 2010. The average residential consumption in 2011 recorded a 0.8% variation when reaching 167.9 kWh/month. The accelerated job market, the development of the payroll, and the improvement in credit are factors that have contributed to the performance of the class in 2011. The billed industrial consumption, which accounts for 34.9% of total consumption, showed an increase of 2.8% in 2011. This variation results from the combination of the performance of the free market served by Copel Geração, which decreased by 13.6%, and the industrial captive market, which grew by 5.3%. The indicators of the industry's physical production in Paraná reflected the very positive results of 2011, according to data from IBGE. The Paraná industry grew by 7.0% in the period between January and December 2011, versus a national average of 0.3%. In this period, the “automotive vehicles (29.9%)” and “oil refining and alcohol production (12.1%)” segments stood out. In the quarterly comparison, the industry of the state of Paraná once again grew in production, going from 9.5% in the third quarter of 2011 to 15.1% in the fourth quarter. The commercial class, which accounted for 19.9% of Copel's market, showed a 7.0% variation, reaching 4.778 GWh YTD. This performance is due to the good moment of the trade and service segments, together with the accelerated job market and an increase in consumer credit. According to IBGE, sales in Paraná's extended retail trade grew by 8.8% in 2011 – in relation to the previous year –, a stronger performance when compared to the national average (6.6%) and to other states in the Southern region (7.8% in Santa Catarina and 6.2% in Rio Grande do Sul). The rural class consumed 1,872 GWh and grew by 5.5%. This class accounts for 7.8% of Copel's billed market. Average rural consumption reached 416.1 kWh/month, a 3.2% increase over 2010. Other consumption classes, Public Authorities, Public Lighting, Public and Own Services, complement Copel's electric energy market. With an 8.9% share, these classes accounted for a 3.7% in the YTD result, consuming 2,122GWh.

Electric energy fees were, in average, adjusted at 5.55%, with 5.77% related to the annual economic fee adjustment, and a negative 0.22% referring to the pertinent financial components, corresponding to an average effect of 2.99% to be perceived by captive consumers. Copel maintained the Night Rural Fee Program, which has the purpose of granting fee benefits, according to Aneel Resolution no. 207/2006, for all rural consumers of Group B between 09:30 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., thus encouraging the utilization of electrical equipment late at night, moving the load away from the peak hours. Specific Organizational Profile of the Eletrical Sector Under the scope of power distribution, Copel's main activities consist in providing, operating and maintaining the infrastructure, as well as providing co-related services. These activities have the purpose of serving the more than 3.9 million energy consumers, in 1,117 locations in 392 of the 399 municipalities of Paraná, in addition to the municipality of Porto União, in the state of Santa Catarina. In addition to operating and maintaining the installations at voltage levels of up to 34.5 kV, given the spin-off of Copel Transmissão (Aneel Resolution no. 1.120/2007), Copel Distribuição took over these activities also in installations of voltage levels between 69 and 138 kV, which used to be under the responsibility of an extinct Company. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 31 Fee revision of Copel Distribuição S.A. The periodical fee revision process has the main purpose of analyzing, after a pre-determined period established in the concession agreement (usually 4 years), the concession's economic and financial balance. It is worth pointing out that, whereas the Portion B of revenue in the annual fee adjustments is monetarily restated at the IGP-M, in the periodical fee revision there is a calculation of the revenue required to cover efficient operating costs and the appropriate compensation about the investments made. The periodical fee revision is conducted by calculating the fee repositioning and by establishing the X Factor. In the first stage of this process, fees compatible with the coverage of efficient operating costs and with a fair and appropriate compensation on investments made are established, with due discretion. In the second stage, the X Factor is established, with the purpose of sharing the scale gain with consumers, and as of the third stage of revisions, incentive to improving the quality of the service provided by distributed. Copel's last fee revision took place in 2008, through Approving Resolution no. 663, of 06.23.2008, which temporarily established the new electric energy supply fees as of 06.24.2008, considering the total average negative adjustment of 3.35%. This rate incorporated the percentages of the negative Fee Repositioning Rate of 7.17% and the financial components not pertaining to the periodical fee revision, of 3.82%. It is important to point out that due to the elimination of a negative financial component of 3.27% from the fee basis, which had been added to the 2007 annual adjustment, the consumer perceived an average increase of 0.04% in the period between 06.24.2008 to 06.23.2009. In the second stage, the X Factor was calculated, which is the establishment of efficiency goals for the second fee period, expressed in the fee. Based on the methodology established by Resolution no. 234/2006, the preliminary calculation of this factor resulted in 2.09% for Copel. Approving Resolution no. 826/2009 approved the final result of the second periodical fee revision, establishing the fee repositioning to be applied to electric energy supply fees and Distribution System Utilization Fees TUSD. The former were repositioned at -7.49%. Revenue variation, resulting from the difference between the temporary repositioning established in Approving Resolution no. 663/2008, and the final repositioning was considered in the annual fee adjustment of 06.24.2009. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 32 Fee adjustment of Copel Distribuição S.A. Approving Resolution no. 839/2009 approved the result of the annual fee adjustment on electric energy supply fees, established the Distribution System Utilization Fees TUSD, and the electric energy supply fees for companies Companhia Campolarguense de Energia Cocel, Companhia Força e Luz do Oeste CFLO e Força and Luz Coronel Vivida Forcel. Copel Distribuição's electric energy fees were, in average, adjusted at 18.04%, with 11.42% related to the annual fee adjustment, and 6.62% related to the pertinent financial components, corresponding to an average effect of 12.98% to be perceived by captive consumers. At the time, Copel requested the deferral of financial components, given the impact of the adjustment to consumers, who were already suffering from the impact of the financial crisis, seeking maintenance of the market and of the non-default rate, but Aneel denied the request. Due to Aneel's decision in the 176th Special Shareholders' Meeting, Copel decided to apply a discount equivalent to the average increase in the respective consumption class for all final captive consumers that were not in default. On 06.22.2010, through Resolution no. 1015/2010, Aneel approved the result of the 2010 annual fee adjustment regarding the power supply and provision fees, determined the Distribution System Utilization Fees TUSD, established the annual revenue of connection installations, and determined the annual value of the Electric Energy Service Inspection Fee TFSEE referring to Copel Distribuição S.A. Copel Distribuição's electric energy fees were, in average, adjusted at 9.74%, with 6.88% related to the annual economic fee adjustment, and 2.86% referring to the pertinent financial components, corresponding to an average effect of 2.46% to be perceived by captive consumers. In this case, Copel chose not to maintain the fee discount policy that was being practiced since 2004 with non-delinquent consumers. On 06.21.2011, through Resolution no. 1158/2011, Aneel approved the result of the 2010 annual fee adjustment regarding the power supply and provision fees, determined the Distribution System Utilization Fees TUSD, established the annual revenue of connection installations, and determined the annual value of the Electric Energy Service Inspection Fee TFSEE referring to Copel Distribuição S.A. Copel's fees were, in average, adjusted at 5.55%, with 5.77% related to the annual economic fee adjustment, and -0.22% referring to the pertinent financial components, corresponding to an average effect of 2.99% to be perceived by captive consumers. Distribution Concession The Company operates its distribution business according to the Concession Agreement no. 46/1999, established in 06.24.1999. The concession term was extended by Official Letter MME no. 196, dated 06.22.1999, up to 07.07.2015. The agreement provides for the possibility of extension for another 20 years, at the discretion of the Granting Authority. The term to submit the request and documentation for extension is 07.07.2012. In March 2010, Copel signed an addendum to the distribution concession agreement, in order to neutralize the revenue gains and losses arising from market variations applied to the Sector Charges item of Portion A. As a result, the following fee adjustments made by Copel should be lower, resulting in an average annual reduction of 0.5% in Distribution revenues. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 33 Energy Flow (GRI EU12) The Energy Flow shows a summary of all the energy traded by the Company in 2011.

Responsibility and engagement with interested parties (GRI 4.14, 4.15, 4.16) An important part of the production chain, suppliers consider Copel as a business partner that is attentive to their needs in order to better provide services and strengthen communication to improve the services provided to customers. As soon as it contracts the suppliers of a certain product, Copel holds integration meetings before starting the services, discussing issues regarding workplace safety and health practices required by the Company, issues related to the environment and social responsibility, as well as the clauses included in Copel's Code of Conduct. Special and decentralized meetings are other occasional discussions, open to the participation of suppliers qualified to provide Engineering services in the Distribution business, coordinated and carried out by the Regional managements, located in the State's hub cities. The purpose is to bring the reality of the local market closer to Copel's minimum requirements, maintaining a standard of quality and principles of health, safety and ethics taken by the Company. In the Distribution business, periodical meetings are held with the unions of electricity companies in Paraná (which represent 80% of the service providers) to discuss matters of common interest in the construction and engineering services segment. Thus, Copel seeks to strengthen its relationship with suppliers and increase the level of knowledge and engagement throughout the production chain. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 37 Communication Channels The response to questions submitted to the Company through the Contact Us channel is also available on our website, through email address copel@copel.com. In this channel, the assumption is to promptly respond to all questions received, which has been resulting in an increase of its use by stakeholders. The complete matrix of Copel’s communication channels is also available on our website, www.copel.com. Communication with the Internal Public (GRI HR5) (DGC) As a direct communication channel with all of its employees, Copel promotes the Employee Opinion Survey POE, conducted on an annual basis. In 2011, the survey round included a mixed study (both qualitative and quantitative) to deepen the understanding of the employee's perception of the company, within the scopes of the individual, the work environment and the company. The qualitative stage, of an exploratory nature, uses techniques known as Focus Groups, and the quantitative stage, which is conclusive, was applied through sampling. The survey identified that 85.9% of the employees believe that Copel is a good or great company to work for. Opportunities for improvement observed with regard to corporate work were, respectively: professional acknowledgment and valuing, possibility of professional growth, training and qualification and compensation courses related to the job. Under the scope of the Program for Promoting Diversity, in the period between 2007 and 2009, many discussions were carried out with groups that present specific needs and characteristics in the Company. The most critical issues were raised by the group of People with Disabilities PcDs, mostly regarding the inadequacy of the physical and architectonic structure, the lack of translation at events, the lack of audiovisual materials for the hearing impaired and printed materials for the visually impaired, the lack of preparation of the workforce to effectively integrate these professionals and use their full potential. These issues will be addressed in specific action plans. One of them will target the promotion of diversity, and the other will specifically target accessibility issues. Communication with Customers and Consumers (DDI/DGT/DGC) Customers served by Copel have many access channels at their disposal to make requests, suggestions and complaints. One of the channels that stand out the most in service volume is the Call Center (0800 51 00116), which is toll-free for customers. In addition to its own employees, the call center service contracts outsourced professionals with special needs, directly from various associations for people with physical disabilities in Paraná. In 2011, Copel's Call Center responded to an average of 576,000 monthly calls, accounting for 46% of the Company's care services. Copel's website (www.copel.com) currently has approximately 2 million visitors per month. There were 409,000 monthly consultations and services requested through the Online Services option. In 2001, 256 new custom service stations were launched by Copel, totaling 409 units distributed throughout the concession area. They provide an average of 214,000 care services per month. The address of each station can be checked on Copel's website, making it easier for customers to find that information. Still in 2011, a chat room was implemented on Copel's website, another online care center, which received a total of 123,000 online accesses throughout the year, requesting clarifications and services. There was also an integration between emails submitted by customers to the telephone system, enabling the care center to know the number of emails received, in real time, making it easier to manage the people that analyze documents and respond to customers, with 66,000 documents received throughout the year. In February 2012, the procedure of the Emergency Audible Response Unit URA was changed, and it now informs the protocol number for the request in the beginning of the call. The Reconnection URA is undergoing tests, with the purpose of allowing customers to make reconnection requests online, with no human interaction, optimizing calls in the call center, and it is expected to start up in 2012. Registration of power outage via SMS were made at an average of 5.4 thousand times per month in 2011. In order to use this service, it is enough for the customer to send a message to number 28593 with the acronym “SL” and the number of the consumer unit informed in the energy bill. The Company also has 15 mobile service stations, which travel around districts in large cities and take part in fairs, events and lectures at schools or companies, in addition to disclosing information about the efficient and safe use of power. In addition, at Post Offices throughout the State, Copel offers pre-paid envelopes for customers to submit documents and requests to the Company. In addition, Copel has an Ombudsman service and a Consumer Council as means to improve its relationship with customers. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 38 For customers of Copel Telecomunicações, free telephone service has been made available since September 2010, at 0800 414 181.

Since the company's contracting, only services related to independent auditing were provided. The Company has a major principle of not contracting other consultancy services that may interfere in the independence of external auditing works. Since 2005, in order to meet the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the main controls of cycles that may cause faults or errors in the financial statements above the materiality level are tested by the internal and external audits. As a governance measure, the internal audit procedures are made available for evaluation by external auditors. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SCOPE 49 2.15.Risk management (GRI EC2) The Integrated Corporate Risk Management process was first implemented at Copel with the purpose of following the risk management in corporate divisions and wholly-owned subsidiaries, seeking to maximize, in a consistent and permanent manner, economic, social and environmental values to all stakeholders. The Risk Management Policy and Model were implemented in 2009, defining the principles and guidelines for the Company's operations. The guiding principles include the classification and method of risk evaluation, the determination of parameters of risk appetite, as well as the Principle of Precaution, since the Company does not only provide for the probability of damage, but also promotes risk mitigation mechanisms. Due to the intrinsic uncertainty of the risks, Copel also considers qualitative impacts, in addition to the financial impacts. Moreover, the Company analyses risk mitigation measures, adopting controls, indicators and action plans that lead to the prioritization of risks and supports the decision making process. The strategy adopted by Copel allows it to consider risks in its decision making process, according to the following levels of approach: • Key business risks: these are the risks associated to the Company's strategic purposes, therefore the management is under the responsibility of High Management (BOD, Executive Office and Risk Committee). • Key process risks: risks related to processes, under the responsibility of process managers. • Key project risks: risks linked to strategic projects, whose management is under the responsibility of project managers. In 2011, the Company resumed the monitoring of key business risks and intensified all actions targeted at the evaluation of risks related to the composition of new businesses and to the participation in auctions promoted by Aneel, given the strategic interest in such development undertakings. Contingency planning (GRI EU21) Development undertakings under construction carried out by the Company have a document entitled Implementation Plan, which establishes all procedures required by different scenarios, such as natural disasters, workplace accidents, strikes, information technology or telecommunication collapse, endemic diseases, among others. For plants that have already been completed and are operational, the document is entitled Emergency Action Plan PAE, and was established with the same purpose. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SCOPE 50 3 ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 3.1. Net Operating Revenue In 2011, the Net Operating Revenue increased by R$ 875.1 million, representing a 12.7% increase in relation to 2010.

Performance in the cultural and social areas (GRI 4.12, 4.13) Incorporation of the Global Compact Principles The Company declares to be committed to the United Nations Global Compact since its introduction in 2000. Reinforcing its commitment, in 2011 Copel took over the coordination of the Governance Task Force of the Brazilian Committee of the Global Compact, also participating in task-forces for the Environment and Human Rights. Copel is constantly seeking to align its corporate initiatives and policies with the Principles of this Compact, as a global ethical reference for its everyday activities, making the Company divide its efforts into three significant lines of action. The first one is related to the organization's internal scope, consisting in the constant improvement of management systems and corporate policies. The second, considered to be structuring, is focused on external actions and is related to support the development, implementation and improvement of inclusive public policies that will promote more sustainability in society as a whole. The third one is about the direct operation, in partnership with other companies, institutions or organizations, in social and environmental projects and initiatives. Divided for clarity purposes, the three lines are treated as strategically synergetic and complementary, as shown in the chart below Chart showing the co-relation between corporate initiatives and policies implemented in the three lines of action and the Principles of the Global Compact Incorporation of the Global Compact Principles: key Respecting and protecting Encouraging technologies that do 1 5 Eliminating child labor 9 human rights not harm the environment Preventing violations of the Eliminating discrimination in the Fighting corruption in all of its ways, 2 human rights 6 10 workplace including extortion and bribery Supporting the preventive approach 3 Supporting free association at work 7 * Undetermined o environmental challenges 4 Eliminating forced labor 8 Promoting social responsibility 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 61 Principles of the Global Projects/programs/management systems/internal participation and policies Compact to which they Beginning End respond Management policies and system Program for communication and development of suppliers, focused on the implementation of practices to evaluate suppliers of materials and audits on the All 2008 2010 first level of the chain of this group of suppliers Supply chain management program All 2010 * Installation of an internal commission and action plan to promote human rights 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 2008 2011 Institution of the Gender and Ethnicity Pro-equality Committee 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 2011 * Corporate Accessibility Program (for accessibility in architecture, communication, 1,2,6 2007 2010 attitude and urban scenario) “Copel de Portas Abertas para Você” [Copel's Doors are Open to You]: communication with stakeholders, in the form of a public hearing, with participation All 2006 2011 of the high management.

Social Project and Corporate Programs (GRI 4.12) Under Lines Program [Sob Linhas] This Program has significant social importance, as it disciplines the multiple use and occupation, by communities, of the surrounding areas of transmission lines, for the production of food and seedlings, in compliance with the applicable law. It also has the purpose of reducing lawsuits to fight undue occupations, address safety issues in the right of way of transmission lines, as well as avoid interruptions in the electric system's operation and facilitate the maintenance of electric energy networks with regard to the cleanliness of the right of way. In 2011, Aneel approved the pilot project for the municipality of Maringá, to be implemented throughout 2012. São Bernardo Project In 2010, a data verification was conducted, along with the monitoring of the situation of families irregularly occupying a Permanent Preservation Area APP under Copel's responsibility, in São Bernardo, which is located in the municipality of União da Vitória PR. In 2011, in addition to continuing with the monitoring, a diagnosis was provided about the current situation, substantiating the project that, in partnership with public authorities, provides for the removal of trash-picking families occupying this area and living in constant risk of flood. The next stage provides for the recovery of the Riparian forest. The benefits of this Project will consist in the recovery of the Riparian forest surrounding the reservoir, covering the urban perimeter of the municipality of União da Vitória; the implementation of leisure areas/ the engagement of local social agents in making the action effective; and the improvement in interaction between the Company and the community. By removing the families, it will be possible to retrieve, recover and preserve the APP and ensure more safety and health for them, since the area is under constant risk of flood, favoring the dissemination of illness vectors. EletriCidadania Program Corporate Volunteering Established in 2004, EletriCidadania encourages volunteer work and the development of citizenship and social responsibility initiatives. The Program allows employees to use up to 4 monthly working hours to participate in volunteer and spontaneous communitarian actions. During 2011, many training programs were carried out in all of Copel's regional branches, seeking to promote adherence to the Program, disseminate basic knowledge of volunteer work and promote the sharing of experiences. In 2011, 170 employees adhered to the program, totaling 2,152 hours of volunteer work and enabling the development of the following initiatives: • Promotion of the collection and donation of different items for assistance entities: Campanha do Agasalho [Winter Campaign]; Campanha do Livro [Book Campaign]; Campanhas de Páscoa [Easter Campaigns]; and Campanha de Natal [Christmas Campaign]. • Tricopel: manufacture of crochet and knitted items to be donated to social entities. • Tecla Social (Social Key): promotes the collection, recovery and reuse of electronic equipment, sending them to public schools and families in a situation of social vulnerability. When it is not possible to recover the equipment, they are correctly disposed of. • Reforço Escolar (School Reinforcement): offers tutoring classes to students in the municipal education network. • Oficina do Brinquedo (Toy Workshop): collects and recovers toys that are distributed to children and social entities. • Programa Luz na Escola (Light in the School Program): promotes educational initiatives at schools, as well as student visitation to the Company's plants. Also in 2011, the planning of a computerized system to manage Volunteers began, with the purpose of creating a communication channel among the certified non-profit institutions and volunteer activity, by making available a bank to offer and register job opportunities for employees and monitoring and management resources on a corporate level. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 65 Corporate Accessibility Program The Corporate Accessibility Program has the purpose of making the Company adapt to the needs of people with disabilities or reduced mobility. This happens through renovations, architecture and urban projects, implementation of technological resources, application of training and educational campaigns, so that its employees, customers and other stakeholders have the required access to its main facilities, information and services, enabling the participation of everyone in the activities provided by the Company, in addition to broadly promoting social inclusion. The Program has four large work groups: Architecture, Attitude, Communication and Urban Solutions. The Program is a process of disseminating the inclusive culture, which covers information about accessibility, inclusion and the rights of people with disabilities, conducted through many training and communication actions. The most innovative initiative in this front is the promotion of Accessibility Seminars Follow This Idea, in partnership with the CREA-PR, covering many of the Company's installations with lectures about issues related to the care required when dealing with people with disabilities, the rules in force, technological novelties and, mostly, raising awareness through experience, where members are invited to experience the problems faced by people with disabilities, using canes, blindfolds, wheelchairs and weight on their legs, etc. In 2011, the Seminar qualified 294 new knowledge replicators. This demand tends to increase with the inclusion of accessibility as a criterion for certification in the 5S Program of Quality Management. Also in 2011, a pioneering quantitative opinion survey was contracted in the electric sector, evaluating the Company's level of accessibility among 600 customers with three types of disability: physical, hearing and visual. The results of the survey will guide the Company's actions. ( Communicational accessibility, one of the great challenges to be overcome to turn Copel into a truly inclusive and accessible company, has been pursued in the Information Technology and Marketing divisions. Solutions and adjustments for Copel's communication channels are researched, both for employees and the external public, such as the issuance of energy bill statements in Braille and the accessible website for the hearing impaired. News about the subject is frequently broadcast in the Company's internal newsletter, and all internal communications need to be fully accessible. With regard to architectural and urban accessibility, Copel contracted the development of technical specifications for projects to eliminate architectural barriers in many of its installations. For agencies and service units, a standardization guide was developed, and the adjustments are under implementation, systematically, with more than 50% already adjusted, according to the chart.

Among these, approximately 10,000 connections are deemed as priority, since they provide services to settlements, remaining quilombo communities, indigenous communities and rural schools. The table below shows the connections made up to December 2011. 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Total No. of 4,006 7,204 9,860 8,877 11,797 15,124 14,166 4,977 76,011 Connections The Federal Government, through Decree no. 7,520/2011, has established a new LPT Program for the period between 2011 and 2014, targeted at providing exclusive services to priority families, i.e.: living in the Citizenship Territories, rural settlements, indigenous and quilombo communities, as well as schools, health stations and community water wells. For 2012, Copel forecasts connections in isolated communities of the State, mainly located on the islands and the coast, through special networks and a photovoltaic solar system. For these communities, in addition to the benefits of the LPT Program, each family will receive a fridge, a solar heating system for water and LED light bulbs, paid by Copel's Energy Efficiency Program PEE. Aneel, in a resolution that is currently undergoing a public hearing, is likely to extend to 2014 the limit year to universalize the access to the electric energy service in the rural region. Given the new facts, Copel will give continuity to the program with the purpose of providing restricted service to priority families. Programa Nacional de Iluminação Pública Eficiente – Reluz [National Program for Efficient Public Lighting] Reluz has the purpose of promoting the development of efficient public lighting systems, contributing to improve the public safety conditions and life quality in Brazilian cities, in addition to contributing to the optimization of the electric system and extension of investments in generation, transmission, distribution and electric energy. The Program is executed through financing agreements executed between Copel and Eletrobrás and between Copel and the Municipality. Eletrobrás finances the concessionaire up to the limit of 75% of the Project's value, which, on its turn, finances the work conducted by the Municipality, accounting for at least 25% of the project's value (consideration). In 2011, the Municipality of Carambeí presented an expansion project of the public lighting system, which is under analysis at Eletrobrás, to enable a financing agreement using the resources from Reluz. The project provides for the following initiatives: • Expansion of 366 points of public lighting; • Extension of the network by approximately 7km; and • Expected investment of R$ 549.0 thousand. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 67 Legal Light Program [Luz Legal] The Luz Legal Program [Luz Legal] is a social development undertaking, implemented through a partnership executed between the State Government, Companhia de Habitação do Paraná Cohapar and Copel, enabling an easier installation of service entries in single-phase residential consuming units in urban regions expanded due to invasion, offering opportunities for better life conditions, citizenship and safety to hundreds of families that use energy in an irregular and unsafe manner. The selection of communities and families to receive the services is made by Cohapar, which promotes the adjustment and urbanization of land areas and the construction of homes in the areas involved. Contractors hired by Copel build the entrance roads, which are paid by consumers in 24 times with no interest or restatement, and installments included in the energy bill for payment. In 8 years, the Program has provided services to 6,460 families, whereas in 2011 this figure was 1,076. Night Irrigation Program [Irrigação Noturna] Conducted in a partnership with the State Department of Agriculture and Supply, with Instituto Paranaense de Assistência Técnica e Extensão Rural – Emater [Paraná Institute of Technical Assistance and Rural Extension], the State Department of Environment, among other entities, the program has the purpose of encouraging the increase in agricultural production through a discount in electric energy used at night — which varies between 60% and 70% in the period between 09:30 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. — for the activation of irrigation systems, resulting in an increase in the income and quality of life of rural producers. Up to 2011, 2,947 farmers benefited from this special irrigation fee. Night Rural Fee Program [Tarifa Rural Noturna] The program has the purpose of encouraging rural producers in Paraná, classified as rural consumers from Group B, to use electric energy in the period between 9:30 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., with a 60% discount on their energy bill, reducing costs and increasing rural production in the State of Paraná. Up to 2011, 5,407 properties benefited from this special night fee. Luz Fraterna Program [Luz Fraterna] A Program established in a partnership with the Paraná State Government, through which consumer units classified as low-income residential or rural residential, consuming up to 100 kWh, receive full bill exemption, and the debt is incurred by the State Government. Copel's total consumers (monthly average) benefited by the Program in 2011 was 225,243, versus 210,929 in 2010. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 68 Energy Efficiency Program – PEE On an annual basis, Copel develops the Energy Efficiency Program – PEE, in compliance with the concession agreement for electric energy distribution, and with Law no. 9,991/2000, through which financial resources are invested in projects aiming at promoting energy efficiency in the end use of electric energy. The investment criteria and types of projects allowed are established by Aneel and cover customers in the residential, industrial and commercial segments, as well as public authorities, with initiatives focused on energy efficiency in the main end uses of electric energy, such as lighting, driving force, refrigeration and air conditioning. In 2011, nearly R$ 25.4 million were invested in initiatives targeting the improvement of energy efficiency in installations of low-income residential consumers, indigenous communities, non-profit hospitals, public buildings, commercial establishments, traffic light signaling.

Quilombo communities in Paraná still face significant problems in relation to public safety, housing, basic sanitation, education, health, and other public policies that are critical for their material and symbolic existence. Copel has already conducted a survey in the region of Vale da Ribeira to finalize the process of electrical installation in Quilombo communities that still do not have access to electric energy. In order to comply with this program, it developed the following stages: 1 Copel will end the PLPT in December this year, and new requests will be net for universalization, in compliance with the legal terms established by Resolution 414/2010. It is important to point out that, considering the characteristics of services provided to these communities, the extension of the network will continue to not be incurred by the stakeholder, and it is the stakeholder is responsible for the installation inside the residence and for the Service Entry. 2 Service to the communities located in Parque das Lauráceas, totaling approximately 114 consumer units (this figure will always be updated), will be provided through PLPT, since the request took place during the validity of the PLPT. The works will be completed in 2012, and part of the connections depends on negotiations with Elektro to connect into its distribution system, and another part (Areia Branca community) will be served by photovoltaic systems, together with island contracting. 3 – Copel makes its structure available to respond to any connection requests in communities through universalization, providing that the requests are submitted to Copel, with no need for any special planning. Copel has been renovating the electric installations, changing the whole internal wiring of residences in various Quilombo Communities, a work started in Palmas and already under implementation in Vale da Ribeira. The institutionalization of this work group for the PBQ (Brasil Quilombola Program) was made through Joint Resolution 01/2012 CC/SERC, signed by state departments comprising the foundation of the work of program implementation, an agreement already signed between the State and Federal Governments. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 69 Education for Sustainability Program The Program seeks to develop competences through continuous learning, focusing on raising awareness and qualifying its leaders, workforce and suppliers for issues related to sustainability.

The Copel Network of Agents for Sustainability works on mobilizing and raising awareness of the internal public with regard to issues related to sustainability, according to the Company's strategic benchmarking. Throughout 2011, approximately 300 employees became aware of social-environmental issues with the publication of the digital newsletter entitled Sharing News, published every two weeks and exclusively created for the purposes of information, articulation and mobilization towards volunteer work in the Network, promoting the implementation of social and environmental projects and incentive to employees for proactive actions of good social-environmental practices. In addition, nine promotions of the course Acting in a sustainable manner were conducted for the internal public, with the purpose of disseminating the Sustainability and Corporate Citizenship Policy. With the purpose of giving visibility and disseminating the social-environmental projects and practices developed by Copel and replicate them, the 2nd Copel Seminar on Good Social-environmental Practices was held, which achieved an evaluation of approximately 90% of satisfaction among its participants. 4.3. Corporate citizenship Gender and Ethnicity Pro-equality Program We live in a time that represents one of the greatest revolutions of humanity, which even transcends technological revolutions. It is a change in values and practices with no precedents in history. The world finally knows that those who live on this planet, where, naturally, the sun rises for all, can and should expect that society will offer a place in the sun for all. Practicing equality means to not restrict access to assets, services or any other rights due to differences of gender, ethnicity, color, religion, generations, social class, and others. Understood as such, equality in diversity enables the expression of differences, knowing that they will be respected, and learning to live without discrimination. The gender equality policy started at Copel in 2007, with the Diversity Promotion Program. At the time, a Commission was created to manage the Program. In 2010, the Pro-equality of Gender Committee was established, and in the same year Copel received, for the first time, the Gender Pro-equality Seal, a certification from the Department of Policies for Women, of the Federal Government. In June 2011, Copel adhered to the Program developed by the Department of Policies for Women with the purpose of “Women and men: children, creating a corporate culture of incentive to the equality of youngsters, adults, and elders gender and ethnicity, which is the foundation of diversity in “Women and cultivating generational an organization. men cultivating diversity through human physical features rights equality for all” In order to cover ethnicity, which was included in the 4th diversity Edition of the Program, in 2012 Copel revised the “Women and through human composition and attributions of the Committee in charge of rights equality men cultivating raising awareness, mobilizing and coordinating the program for all” gender at COPEL, working, building and managing the process in a differences collective manner, and also enabling, through its permanent diversity operation, that equality among men and women gender and through human ethnicity be included in the everyday activities of rights equality for all” management and workforce, creating mechanisms, “Women and men instruments and providing financial and human resources to living in society, enable its operation with the commitment taken by the cultivating cultural, Company with the Gender and Ethnicity Pro-equality religious, country, “White, black, yellow women nation diversity and men cultivating racial and Program of the Department of Policies for Women. through human rights ethnical diversity through equality for all” human rights equality for all” 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 72 Corporate Program of Food Safety and Sustainable Development of the Community As a permanent member of the State Council for Food Safety Consea, Copel is developing a pilot project for Food Safety with an Organic Basis. The project does not only seek to change the current meal system of employees and their families, but also strengthen the Company's commitments to sustainability, encouraging organic family agriculture in favor of better quality of life, and promoting social inclusion through job generation. Implemented in the first half of 2008 at the Araucária Thermal Power Plant, the project relied on the participation of organic producers, Copel employees, outsourced employees, food handlers, families in the surrounding areas, and managers, who will disseminate the concepts to the remainder of the Company. The initiatives are based on the Organic Law on Food and Nutritional Safety Losan, a milestone in civil society, which discussed and created the Law, approved by the House of Representatives and the Federal Senate, with no reservations. 4.4. Support to Public Policies (GRI EU23, SO5) Historically, Copel, as a fomenter of the social and economic development of the State of Paraná, participates in and supports many collective movements with government bodies, Non-governmental Organizations NGOs, and other entities, for the broad promotion of citizenship, especially with underprivileged communities. Copel has transformed the practice of donation through tax incentive into a policy, and encourages both partner companies and suppliers to do the same. The Company leverages, as much as possible, the use of resources deductible from Cultural Incentives (Rouanet Act), Sports Incentive and the Fund for the Rights of Children and Adolescents FIA, based on annual estimates of taxes payable. Contributions under the Rouanet Act in 2011 were made for projects duly approved by the Ministry of Culture, totaling R$ 9.8 million. The Light Party Project [Festa da Luz] received most of the investment, amounting to R$ 1.5 million. The Company allocated the amount of R$ 2.5 million to projects enrolled in the FIA, and the largest investment was for the Reforma do Lar Marilia Barbosa Project, totaling R$ 0.7 million. Through the Sports Incentive Act, Copel allocated R$ 2.5 million. The principal amount was allocated to the project of Optimization of the Qualification Center for Non-professional Athletes of Instituto Pratique Esporte, totaling R$ 0.7 million.(GRI EC4, EC8) Agent for Indigenous Contact (SO1) In 2011, the basis to develop a volunteer corporate program to support indigenous communities was built, seeking to provide instruments to enhance electric energy supply. The program provides for the contracting of a bilingual native Indian in each Indigenous Land in the State of Paraná, to help families maintain their records up-to-date, request services to the concessionaire, learning about economics and safety concepts in the use of electrical equipment in the domestic environment. The program is expected to lead to a significant reduction in the number of domestic accidents involving electric energy in the homes of indigenous consumers, as well as establish a permanent communication channel. Management of the TAC of Indigenous Community Kaingang Apucaraninha (HR9) In 2011, a Social-economic, Environmental and Cultural Diagnosis was conducted for the Population of Indigenous Community Apucaraninha, located in the Municipality of Tamarana, Paraná, and the Program to Generate Projects of Social-economic and Environmental Sustainability was proposed for the community. These actions result from the Conduct Adjustment Term executed by Copel Geração e Transmissão S.A. with the Indigenous Community of Apucaraninha, the Federal Public Attorney's Office, and Fundação Nacional do Índio, on 12/01/2006. The diagnosis had the participation of specialized teams from the State Universities of Londrina and Maringá, and resulted in the creation of the Program that will be responsible for implementing several projects targeting sustainability of the indigenous community, expected to begin in 2012. These actions will be subsidized with resources from the indemnity fund paid by Copel upon execution of the agreement. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 73 4.5. Community (GRI EU19) Sustainability Reference Centers CERES (S01) These are centers for communication and promotion of social-environmental education, with the purpose of supporting actions in sustainability, corporate citizenship and the environment with the communities surrounding the Company's development undertakings and installations. Seeking to support and promote the implementation of actions targeting the sustainable development of municipalities surrounding Copel's development undertakings, it establishes technical cooperation terms in the pursuit of joint actions, with the purpose of building social assets and strong local capacities, supporting the structuring of an articulated local governance, focused on constantly improving public policies, with income generation, for the full exercise of citizenship and better quality of life in the communities involved. The purposes of these centers are: • Developing actions that will address critical issues of interest for the mitigation and/or reduction of risks and negative impacts, and leveraging of positive impacts on the business; • Changing COPEL's positioning before the community, from a provider to a partner • Increasing COPEL's representativeness in the municipalities surrounding its development undertakings; • Strengthening the engagement with communities in the Company's areas of influence and reach; • Opening a communication channel with local population of the municipalities surrounding the Company's generation development undertakings, in order to meet the needs related to its operation; • Fostering the sustainable development of municipalities, using actions focused on qualification, promotion of productive arrangements, structuring local projects and strengthening institutional partnerships; • Developing social-environmental education actions and supporting communication actions in order to meet the conditions of operation licenses (OLs). • Encouraging the implementation and development of COPEL's programs that may be applied in the region. Preservation and Education of the Historical and Cultural Heritage (S01 – EN26) With the purpose of empowering the community to comprehend the world around it, leading them to perceive and understand the socio-cultural universe, as well as the historical and temporal trajectory which it is a part of, Copel provides the society of Paraná with museums that have exhibits on energy, and that were created through the programs for scientific use of the flora and fauna, rescue of cultural memory, and archaeological recovery of the development undertakings. Copel's memory is materialized in the Museum of Energy, located in Curitiba. Created in October 1984, the museum presents Copel's trajectory, which blends into the expansion of electric energy supply in Paraná. More than 100,000 people have already experience this history through documents of the time, historical photos and objects that were part of technological evolution of the production, transmission and distribution of electric energy. Accompanied by a guide, visitors also learn about the safe and efficient use of energy, conscious consumption, and inter-relations between energy and the environment. The Regional Museum of Iguaçu, located in the Hydropower Plant of Governador Ney Braga, which has a significant collection related to the fauna, flora and people of the middle section of Iguaçu. The exhibitions are monitored by environmental educators, and it is possible to learn aspects of the history of the Iguaçu River. The Museum also provides social-environmental education works with the schools of the region and visitors. In 2011, it received 3,654 students and 11,450 spontaneous visitors. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 74 4.6. Government and society The Copel Program for Social Investments seeks to promote human rights, citizenship, and social-environmental responsibility by transferring resources, in a planned and conscious manner, to initiatives that promote social transformation, in favor of sustainable development, with a return to the society of Paraná. Therefore, Copel is focused on guaranteeing that investments will contribute to the Millennium Development Goals MDGs and principles of the Global Compact, in addition to being consistent with the Company's strategic objectives.

With regard to energy distribution, the following surveys were conducted: • Abradee Residential Customer Satisfaction Survey; • Aneel Customer Satisfaction Survey; • City Government Satisfaction Survey; • Survey on Consumption Habits and Ownership of Equipment; • Satisfaction Survey on Copel's Accessibility for People with Disabilities. Copel is the best energy distribution company in terms of customer care in Latin America, according to the Regional Energy Integration Commission – CIER. The level of residential customer approval reached 94.4% of satisfied consumers in 2011. In order to maintain the high level of satisfaction of its customers, and by determination of the sector's regulatory agency, Annel, Copel has extended its service network even further. The Company opened 256 new service stations in 2011 alone. This increase resulted in Copel's physical presence in all municipalities of its concession area. Electronic service channels were diversified, and in addition to the virtual branch, service through SMS was introduced. This channel enables customers to register power outage in a quick and efficient manner, by sending an SMS to 28593. As soon as the message is received, the system will automatically register the request, open a service order, and send the service protocol via SMS. During the first year of activity of this channel, the request volume reached 87,000 services registered. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 76 Customer satisfaction 2011 2010 2009 Satisfaction rates obtained in the IASC Survey Aneel * 62.22 69.9 ISC Customer Satisfaction Rate (price and quality) 59.2 63.9 64.4 ISQP Satisfaction Rate with Perceived Quality 88.1 90.2 89.9 IAC – Customer Approval Rate 94.4 85.7 88.7 Total calls answered (call center) 6,386,651 7,231,453 6,371,942 No. of services in regional offices 2,571,199 2,127,185 1,721,112 Complaints in relation to total services (%) 2.12 1.53 1.75 Average waiting time until the beginning of the phone service (sec.) 31’’ 14’’ 70’’ Average service time (min.) 3’33’’ 3’14’’ 3’18” No. of consumer complaint escalations 2011 2010 2009 To the Company 190,252 142,822 141,764 To Procon 1,028 358 To Justice 1,302 1,588 Complaints: main reasons (%) 2011 2010 2009 No. of consumer complaint escalations to the Ombudsman 5,987 5,134 6,859 Main reasons of complaints to the Ombudsman: (in %) 2011 2010 2009 Irregular procedure: includes self-reconnection, energy deviation and 7.0 14.9 9.4 modified measurement Customer service: includes waiting time, return/response, respect/politeness 9.8 10.5 15.1 Energy bill total cost: includes reading of the energy consumption, 17.3 3.8 20.4 fee and pending debts.

Rational and safe use of energy: communication initiatives Another efficient way of informing the population about the safe use of electric energy consists in messages announced by radio broadcasters, through a partnership with Associação de Radiodifusão do Paraná [Paraná's Radio Broadcasting Association], with 240 broadcasters. Each broadcaster announces eight messages per day, representing 1,920 messages per day and 57,600 per month. (GRI EU7) Technical quality and continuity of the services provided: indicators The chart below shows technical quality data related to the services provided between 2009 and 2011 (GRI EU28): Technical quality of the services provided 2011 2010 2009 Equivalent Duration of Interruption per Consumer Unit (DEC): 10.64 11.46 12.91 (1) overall for Copel (value determined) Equivalent Duration of Interruption per Consumer Unit (DEC): 13.53 14.01 14.01 overall for Copel (limit) Equivalent Frequency of Interruption per Consumer Unit (FEC): 8.26 9.46 11.04 (2) overall for Copel (value determined) Equivalent Frequency of Interruption per Consumer Unit (FEC): 11.94 12.80 13.50 overall for Copel (limit) (1) The DEC represents the average time interval during which each consumer of the group under analysis was prevented from receiving electric energy supply, in the observation period, considering interruptions of three minutes or more. (2) The FEC represents the average number of interruptions to which each consumer of the group under analysis was subject to, in the observation period, considering interruptions of three minutes or more. Customer and consumer health and safety In the sense of mitigating risks to society, Copel develops practices such as sectioning and landing of rural fences and grounding of transformers to avoid accidents under rural distribution lines; the program to prevent energy-related accidents with the population, entitled Kit Escola [School Kit], through which employees have been giving lectures to 4th grade students in all state schools, distributing several materials, such as rulers, notebooks and rubbers, since 1998; the national campaign for electric energy safety, promoted by Abradee since 2006, aims at establishing direct contact with consumers, delivering educational materials in the streets, showing the potential risks and means of prevention that can help the population not to use energy erroneously, which may lead to accidents. In 2011, 17 casualties were registered due to poor utilization of electric energy in the entire concession area of Copel. However, there are no lawsuits against the Company claiming illness related to electric energy. (GRI EU25) Employee and community health and safety (GRI LA8, LA9) At Copel, Workplace Health and Safety is comprised of Workplace Safety Technicians, Safety Engineers, Workplace Doctors, Workplace Nurses, and Workplace Nursing Assistants. Copel has 49 Cipas [Internal Commission for Accident Prevention] distributed throughout the State. The means of operation is based on the requirements of Regulatory Standards no. 4 and 5 of the Ministry of Labor and Employment, as well as the Company's specificities. Health and safety professionals are regionally allocated, instructed by standards and procedures issued by the Workplace Safety Coordination Group and the Occupational Health Department, in the corporate scope, developing Programs for Environmental Risk Prevention PPRA, Program for Medical Control and Occupational Health PCMSO, technical specifications for individual protection equipment, issuing reports, coordinating campaigns, and guiding the activities of workplace health and safety professionals and Cipas, under the whole scope of the Company. In order to contribute even further to the prevention of accidents with transport equipment, Copel maintains Accident Analysis Commissions CAA, with the purpose of determining responsibilities, in the case of accidents, and awarding employees for their good performance in the conduction and maintenance of the Company's vehicles. The CAA has regional commissions and a central one. Each commission is comprised of members appointed by the Company and elected employees. Both the commissions and the workplace health and safety professionals follow the corporate guidelines established by a Workplace Health and Safety Policy. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 78 The analysis and control of risks related to the safety and health of employees are integrated to all stages of Copel's activities, through joint actions of the workplace safety, occupational health, social service, training and environment divisions, with the direct involvement of managers and employees, as established by the Workplace Safety Policy. The workforce participates in the identification of factors that influence health and safety through an application entitled Caça ao Risco [Risk Hunt], Safety Sector Meetings, meetings and actions of the Cipas, training, Preliminary Risk Analysis, events analysis, campaigns and inspections, which address specific problems. Communication about health and safety to employees is made through the Intranet, in the Workplace Health and Safety portal, which can be accessed by all employees and provides information and interactivity. Accidents with the community are prevented through training at schools, companies and community meetings, using standard didactic materials with qualified instructors, interviews in radio stations throughout the State of Paraná, in partnership with the State Health Department, direct arrangements with broadcasters for a daily disclosure of information about the safe use of electricity, and monthly messages on electric energy bills sent to all customers. Health and safety actions for contracted employees are established in a specific manual that integrates the service provision agreement. The Company holds integration lectures every time a new agreement is signed, addressing risk activity standards focused on workplace safety, in addition to monitoring compliance with legal requirements through periodical inspections. The control of the compulsory minimum training in electricity works is made through a specific application, which contains information about the employees of contractors and the agreements executed by them. (GRI PR1) 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 79 4.8. Suppliers Copel contracts materials and services in compliance with Law no. 8,666/93 (Bidding Law) and other legal instruments applicable, and it is not possible for them to establish criteria that aim at regionally selecting suppliers. The Law provides for isonomy to participants in the bid, and the management is responsible for establishing the technical and commercial requirements and for publishing the process. In 2011, approximately 45.68 % of the total amount of agreements for materials and services established by Copel were related to suppliers in the State of Paraná, 54.08 % to suppliers from other Brazilian states, and 0.24 % to foreign suppliers. (GRI EC6) In the processes of supplier registration and stages of qualification of participants in the bids, the Company is required to present a statement, signed by a duly identified partner, owner or officer, that the registered or bidding company does not contract night, hazardous or unhealthy work to individuals under 18 years old, and that it does not contract any type of work from individuals under 16 years old. Companies are also required to inform in the statement whether they employ any minor as of 14 years old in the condition of apprentice. In the qualification of suppliers, which are classified according to the specificity of the service and its size, there is an evaluation of aspects related to issues of legal, tax regulation, economic-financial, and technical nature, the qualified companies receive a Registry Certificate, which is used to qualify them in the Company's bidding processes. (GRI HR6) All material and service agreements executed by Copel with its suppliers include a clause related to social responsibility and human rights issues, in which the parties to the agreement undertake to (GRI HR1, HR2): Not allow the practice or maintenance of discrimination that limits access in employment relations, or negative discrimination in relation to gender, origin, ethnicity, color, physical condition, religion, marital status, age, family situation or pregnancy, as well as implement efforts in this sense together with the respective suppliers. These agreements also include specific clauses regarding the condition of child, slave or analogous work, in which the parties to the agreement undertake to: Not allow the practice of work analogous to slavery or any other means of illegal work, as well as implement efforts together with the respective suppliers of products and services in order for them to make the same commitment. Similarly, concern with the environment stands out in a clause under which the parties undertake to: Protect and preserve the environment, as well as prevent and eradicate damaging practices, exercising their activities in compliance with legal, regulatory and administrative acts regarding the environment and related areas, issued in the Federal, State and Municipal scopes, including, but not limited to compliance with Federal Law no. 6,938/81 (National Environmental Policy) and Law no. 9,605/98 (Environmental Crime Law), also implementing efforts in this sense together with their respective suppliers. The contractual conditions for materials and services also establish that Copel may, at any time, inspect the compliance with obligations granted to the contracted supplier, with visits allowed to any facilities of the supplier. These agreements executed by Copel and its suppliers are managed by agreement managers available in all of the Company's units, responsible for the continuous and broad monitoring, inspection and control of its object and contractual conditions established between the parties until its termination, in accordance with the Company's technical and administrative standards and guides. In industrial evaluation inspections, there are specific verification items related to environmental risks, the occurrence of discrimination, child labor or labor in analogous conditions to slavery or similar. In 2011, COPEL signed the Pact for the Eradication of Slave Labor, complementing this clause with regard to compliance with the obligations established in the commitment to fight slavery, promoted by the Ministry of Labor and Employment MTE, through Circular Letter no. 540, dated 10.15.2004, and with the purpose of incorporating the Principles of the Global Compact into management, through its suppliers. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 80 Employees (GRI HR5, EC7) – Internal Public Labor relations are governed by the CLT [Consolidation of Labor Laws], and employees are represented by nineteen unions. Since it is a mixed-economy company, the contracting of employees can only take place through a civil service examination, mainly for basis positions, with many possibilities of participation for native or naturalized Brazilians, regardless of their gender, ethnicity or belief. Copel allocates vacancies in its civil service examination to candidates with special needs and afro-descendants. Copel also has interns, who are not computed in the calculation of its workforce, since the law that governs such activity defines it as a complement of educational qualification. Thus, in addition to its employees, the Company's workforce is comprised of third-parties linked to companies providing services to Copel, in the following activities: Customer care, Emergency care, Construction of Distribution Lines and Networks, Maintenance of the electric system, Connection, Suspension and Reconnection, Reading of Low-voltage Meters, Janitor activities, Surveillance, Building maintenance, among others. Copel is not responsible for directly coordinating the execution of such activities, but rather for managing agreements executed with service providing companies. All contacts required (transfer of information, correction of occasional problems, among others) are made directly to the appointed agents to act as representatives of the service providers before Copel. By doing so, the company complies with the legislation related to the contracting of employees and seeks to avoid any labor lawsuits that may require equivalence with Copel's workforce. Workforce is distributed based on educational level and career. The needs and expectations identified among employees are opportunities for growth and professional development, fair salaries, appropriate work conditions, acknowledgment by managers, workplace safety, training programs and recognition of the company by society. Professional Development (GRI EU14) The identification of qualification and development needs is based on the methodology of Diagnosis of the Need to Develop, carried out on an annual basis in all divisions. In 2011, 3,026 training and development sessions were held (courses and events), of which 2,061 were internal, 963 external in the country, and 2 abroad, totaling 38,296 participants. The annual average was 68.1 hours/employee. With regard to Sustainability training and development, 1,743 employees from various divisions of the Company participated in these activities in 2011, in which R$ 300,000 were invested. There are also courses provided by Copel to contracted parties, such as those required by NR-10, commercial measurement, network and substation operation, and others established by contract. These training sessions are controlled by the Contractor Employee Registration system. All professionals working in the Company's corporate safety division are subject to training involving aspects related to human rights. (GRI HR8) Outsourced employees participate in the integration program, where issues on workplace health and safety are addressed. (GRI EU18) 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 81 Salary policy Compensation, acknowledgment and incentive practices are based on the compensation model structured by the Company, supported by two pillars: fixed compensation (comparison between market and merit) and variable compensation (Employee Profit Sharing PLR). The PLR for employees of Copel takes place according to Federal Law no. 10.101/2000, State Decree no. 1978/2007, and State Law no. 16560/2010. Copel's Career and Compensation Framework, conceived with the purpose of reflecting the Company's occupational reality, serves as a reference for fixed compensation and seeks to compare salaries paid by Copel to market values, and apply a salary policy. The proportion between the lowest salary practiced by the Company in December 2011 (R$ 1,180.19) and the national minimum wage on that date (R$ 545.00) was 2.17 times, with no difference in the same period with regard to the base-salary proportion between men and women. The achievement of high-performance goals and the culture of excellence are encouraged by the compensation model comprised of fixed and variable portions. Fixed compensation is established according to the employee's qualification under the Career and Compensation Framework. Upgraded in 2011, with the adoption of career concepts (professionals of average level, technical professional of average level, and professional of higher level), positions and functions, considering the demands of the main processes and supporting demands, and in line with the processes established in the People Management Model, the Career and Compensation Structure guides the evolution of employees in terms of salary and function, based on the best market practices. The evolution of functions is based on characteristics that include multi-functionality, complexity, flexibility, initiative and creativity in careers. This evolution is a means of acknowledging the performance of employees, in addition to increasing the potential of salary increase. The Career and Compensation Framework provides managers with information on the jobs and functions for a better use of the capacities of employees in the conduction of their activities, encouraging the achievement of high-performance goals and the culture of excellence, in addition to allowing employees to have a clear vision of their position and career outlooks. Also in 2011, the salary ranges were revised, and in 2012 the career framework is under revision, with the revaluation and reclassification of the levels of some administrative and operating functions, ensuring an appropriate position of these functions in relation to the complexity and other requirements of the activities. (GRI LA11) Since 2003, percentages varying from 1 to 3.8% of the nominal payroll are distributed, on an annual basis, to high-performance employees or to correct salaries in relation to market salaries. Based on the employee's performance, managers determine individual salary promotions. The comparison between salaries in relation to the market is obtained through a survey carried out every year with companies in the electric sector and the market in general, acquired from specialized consultancy firms. The sample is comprised of state and national organizations of the same size. (GRI EC5) Seeking to value the acknowledgment of performance and guarantee transparency and isonomy in the promotion of employees to senior professional stages and consultants, a formal evaluation process of higher-education employees with the necessary requirements is conducted annually. Employees have a standard CV, with information about their education, training courses taken, results obtained, works performed in the company, among others.The variable compensation component occurs based on two practices: salary discount granted on the reference date of the Collective Labor Agreement ACT, in October of each year, and through a specific ACT, the distribution of Profit Sharing PLR, in May of each year. (GRI LA5) The results indicators and goals to be considered for the PLR distributions are negotiated, since 1996, between the company and an employee commission specifically installed for this purpose, comprised of six elected employees and eight representatives of union entities. Currently, the amount to be distributed as PLR considers the results of thirteen indicators associated to the financial, operating, workplace safety and customer satisfaction goals of the strategic map. As of 2012, the final amount of the PLR started being equally distributed to all employees of the Company, in compliance with State Law no. 16650/2010 of August 9, 2010. Other means of acknowledgment that promote employee motivation include: homage paid to employees completing 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 years at the company, during a celebratory event (usually lunch or dinner); award for safety in traffic granted to employees who use Copel's vehicles when they reach 10,000, 50,000, 100,000 and 150,000 kilometers without getting involved in any accident, exceeding speed limits or getting fined; leisure trip with the family to employees who reach 200,000 kilometers with no accidents; complimentary letters for material acts; acknowledgment among the internal public with articles on Copel Online and in the Copel Informações Magazine for material acts or facts; credits for courses or events for the winning projects of Copel Inovações; and participation in national and international events as a result of the R&D+i projects. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 82 Benefits Among the benefits directly granted by the Company to all employees, in addition to those provided by law, the following stand out: educational and foreign language support, vacation payment advance, food and meal support, day-care support, support to people with disabilities and complementary illness support, and others enabled by the partnership established between Copel and the Instituto Nacional de Seguridade Social – INSS [National Institute of Social Security]. The educational support program seeks to contribute to the growth and development of employees, stimulating self-development as a means to improve Copel's performance. The employee is subsidized with 60% of the monthly fee for the course, which can be a technical, undergraduate or graduate course. In this program, employees have freedom of choice, being able to choose any qualification area of their interest, regardless of the company's immediate needs. Incentive to foreign language training provides for reimbursement of part of the monthly fee for the course. Vacation payment advance consists in an option for employees to receive their compensation in the month before their vacation, added to their regular monthly compensation, to be returned in up to 10 fixed installments, with no interest. In addition, in order for employees to be able to use their vacation period with tranquility, Copel also provides an additional payment of 1/3 of compensation, as well as the mandatory amounts determined by law. Food and meal support provided by Copel upon its enrollment in the Federal Government's Employee Food Program – PAT helps employees with food and meal expenses. COPEL maintains this benefit to employees during the vacation period, and also grants extra credit in December, based on the Christmas bonus payment, in the same amount as other installments. Day-care support benefits, support to people with disabilities and support to complementary illness contribute to improving the quality of life of employees and their dependents. Through Fundação Copel de Previdência e Assistência Social [Copel Foundation for Private Pension and Social Assistance], which is maintained by Copel, the Company grants a private pension plan, in addition to the official social security amount, with the purpose of offering security and protection to participants, ensuring income complementation in the case of retirement, illness or impairment, and broad health and dental care plans, among the best offered in the market, promoting and protecting the health of its participants and beneficiaries. (GRI EC3) Fundação Copel manages a private health care plan entitled Prosaúde, under a self-management model. The functioning of the plan is authorized by Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar [National Supplementary Health Agency] under no. 35515-1. Prosaúde represents a medical and social instrument that enables resources targeted at covering the health expenses of its participants and their dependents, with accredited resources and services, or chosen freely (through refund). The health plan operated by the foundation is one of the best ranked by the Performance Index of Supplementary Health by the National Health Agency. It is acknowledged for providing participants with the most recent advances in medical and hospital care, as well as dental care, covering a broad range of procedures. Another benefit provided by Prosaúde is pharmaceutical assistance. Its purpose is to grant benefits of a pharmaceutical nature to all of its participants and dependents enrolled in the Medical, Hospital and Dental Module and this plan, providing refund for expenses with medication, according to the coverage provided by the plan. Fundação Copel also provides a loan portfolio to its participants, complying with the legal provisions that govern investments of reserves of the social security fund. Freedom of collective association and negotiation (GRI LA4) The totality of Copel employees is represented in the work relations with the Company through independent unions which, in compliance with Brazilian law, can be organized by category and territorial basis (municipality). Copel maintains a strict relationship with all 19 entities representing employees: unions of base categories (electric workers) and professional and/or distinguished categories. Union management has free access to local managers and all of the Company's facilities, in order to deliver communications in the interest of employees, in addition to having a formal direct channel with the human resources division. The participation of employees in negotiations performs a key role, and includes attendance in union meetings for the development of a claim agenda, and category resolution for the acceptance or refusal of proposals from the Company. Copel also encourages employee participation in councils, class entities and professional associations, among other entities. In addition, the Company makes efforts in the sense of providing previous knowledge to employees on significant changes in its operations, always with as much advance notice as possible, and with the participation of union entities, when applicable. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 83 Workplace Health and Safety (GRI EU16) Considering the context of the specialized service in workplace health and safety engineering and the monitoring and control of occupational health, Copel relies on workplace doctors, distributed among the Company's main regions, a nursing team and administrative support. These professionals carry out not only legal and mandatory medical tests, but also a series of health prevention programs. It also maintains statistical control of the indexes and causes of lost time at work due to illness, in addition to monitoring Social Security processes when long lost time is required, through a specific partnership with the Social Security Institution. Whenever the labor capacity is compromised by any factor, a study is conducted, together with the required readjustment to guarantee that the professional exercise is as safe and appropriate as possible, with the participation of the multi-disciplinary team. Copel also provides advisory to CIPAs on various segments, with lectures about health issues, including first-aid training, spreading information to the Company's staff and promoting quality of life. The Copel Program for Quality of Life, implemented in 1998, has the purpose of arousing the interest of employees in the constant pursuit of improving quality of life and consolidating actions developed on an annual basis at Copel. Many programs are developed for that purpose, including: Health Promotion Program, which is comprised of Personal Health Management; periodical medical tests; social assistance and social security benefits; drug abuse program; absenteeism-illness program; Dê Preferência à Vida [Choose Life] Campaign; Valorizando a Vida [Valuing Life] Campaign; Caça ao Risco [Risk Hunt] Program, and Minuto da Segurança [Safety Minute]. In addition, complementary actions are offered, such as the Health Meal Program (meals offered inside the Company), Health Week, vaccine campaigns and health newsletters on Copel Online. In order to improve social relations at work, the Company conducts care and social relations programs, the EletriCidadania Social Responsibility Program, and also discloses and promotes the understanding of the Code of Conduct. Celebratory programs are promoted on Copel's birthday, Copel's employees are honored on their birthdays (date of hiring), and messages are sent on commemorative dates (hiring birthday, actual birthday, profession day, among others). In order to improve the personal and family lifestyle of employees, the Company offers the following educational actions: Retirement Preparation Program; Financial Management Program; Energy and Health Program (labor gymnastics activities, physical fitness and anti-stress activities); Copel Internal Games; Sesi Games; and Educational Support Program. With regard to the formal health and safety committees, Copel maintains the following staff, which, from a total of 9,400, amounts to 7.7%: (GRI LA6) • 65 Workplace Safety Technicians; • 05 Workplace Safety Engineers; • 05 Workplace Doctors; • 01 Doctor; • 03 Workplace Nurses; • 03 Nurses; • 01 Nursing Assistant; • 03 Workplace Nursing Assistants; • 01 Workplace Nursing Technician; • 06 Nursing Technicians; • 630 CIPA Members. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | SOCIAL AND SECTORIAL SCOPE 84 4.9.

Environmental impact control (GRI 1.2, EN26) Copel seeks to align efforts in order to guarantee compliance with the economic, social and environmental results in a balanced manner for stakeholders, in addition to sustainable development. All projects, programs and actions developed by the Company are guided by the Sustainability and Corporate Citizenship Policy, available at www.copel.com. 5.1.1. Integrated Management System In September 2009, aiming at the continuous improvement of its social-environmental performance, works related to the implementation of the Integrated Management System SGI in plants operated by Copel were initiated. With the SGI, Copel seeks to obtain ISO 14.001 and OSHAS 18.001 certifications, and its integration with the previously acquired ISO 9.001:2008 certification. In 2011, the activities were focused on the execution of Internal Audits at the plants to identify improvement opportunities, as well as execute action plans. The Company expects to carry out internal audits in all development undertakings controlled by the SGI throughout 3 years. 5.1.2. Social-environmental Management of new development undertakings • Implementation of the Basic Environmental Project PBA of the Mauá HPP The PBA of the Mauá HPP is comprised of 21 environmental programs and 13 sub-programs, the development of which will allow the prevention, mitigation and compensation of negative impacts arising from its construction, as well as boosting and optimizing positive impacts. In 2011, the following actions stood out: Storage basin cleaning program Deforestation sub-program of the storage basin: vegetation suppression activities in the area where the future reservoir of the Mauá HPP will be located started in January 2011, and were divided into four stages: felling; tracing (separation of the material with commercial use of the waste); removal of the material, with commercial use outside the reservoir area; and finalization (burying of plant waste). 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 90 Flora and fauna conservation program Sub-program to recover and assemble the riparian forest protection area: throughout 2011, the Caviúnas Plant Nursery was created, where more than 140 kg of seeds were processed, and around 87 species were sown, which produced 25,862 seedlings of 50 species. Flora Recovery Sub-program: it comprises the collection of seeds, epiphyte, and vegetable propagule found in the region of the reservoir during vegetable suppression and future filling. In 2011, 152,706 individuals were recovered belonging to 264 species. The recovery of seeds totaled 594.5 kg of 36 families. In relation to the material collected to comprise scientific collections, 172 logs from 17 families have been recovered so far, and individuals representing 37 species for the Xylotheque, from 46 families and 110 species for the Carpotheque, and from 75 families and 264 species for the Herbarium. Sub-program of Recovery and Scientific Salvage of Fauna: it comprises the recovery of wild animals in the reservoir area during vegetation suppression and future filling. In 2011, 3,336 captures/collections of animals were recorded in areas of suppression, construction sites and access ways, 162 species confirmed. Sub-program of Fauna Monitoring and Conservation: Through this program, previously unknown species were recorded in the region of the development undertaking. The species recorded, the occurrence of which has already been published in scientific magazines and periodicals, are the following: Urostrophus vautieri; Echinanthera cyanopleura; Trachycephalus dibernardoi; and Ischnocnema henselii. Sub-program to Recover Native Bees: pioneering effort in Brazil to protect species of native bees under threat of extinction and of commercial interest. It consists in the recovery of beehives in the reservoir region during the vegetation suppression and future filling. Throughout 2011, 1041 nests of 15 species were recovered. Program to recover the archaeological heritage: 83 archaeological sites were recovered; Heritage Education activities and workshops were carried out with the local community and schools. Systematic integration activities about Archaeological Heritage were also carried out with all employees contracted for the project. The Heritage Education and Social Inclusion Program began, engaging all 8 Indigenous Lands of the Tibagi River basin. In partnership, Copel and Eletrosul, through the Cruzeiro do Sul Consortium-CECS, IPHAN, MPF and IAP, developed the Conduct Adjustment Term – TAC for Archaeology, seeking to preserve and spread the historical, cultural and archaeological heritage of the middle section of the Tibagi River. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 91 • Implantation of the Basic Environmental Project PBA of the Colíder HPP The purpose of this PBA is to give continuity to the environmental licensing process, complying with the instructions from the Mato Grosso State Department for the Environment Sema MT, expressed in the Preliminary License, and mainly consolidate the environmental programs proposed in the Environmental Impact Study EIS, as a means to guarantee that the implementation of the development undertaking will result in social-environmental gains capable of offsetting and mitigating the negative impacts caused to the social and natural environment in the region affected by the construction project. This PBA includes 32 programs, contemplating the physical, biotic and social-economic mediums. In 2011, 14 environmental programs started being executed. Other programs are in the process of planning, contracting or negotiation with local institutions. • Implementation of the Cavernoso II SHP PBA The project for the Cavernoso II SHP began in April 2011. In order to meet the conditions established by the environmental agency for the project's licensing, the PBA was developed, comprising 16 social-environmental programs, which are being implemented according to a schedule. During the vegetation suppression activities, fauna and flora recovery was conducted. In flora recovery, the species collected were duly stored in a greenhouse at the plant nursery of the Segredo HPP, and part of this material will return to the Cavernoso II SHP area to recompose the APP of the future reservoir. The programs to support the migrating population and public health are being carried out through a partnership with the municipal government of Virmond. All interventions in the land were accompanied by archaeological prospecting and recovery, when necessary. During construction of the development undertaking, environmental inspections have been conducted since June 2011, in order to evaluate aspects such as mitigation of the induction of erosive processes, carrying of sediments, contamination and management of solid waste. Based on the results of the monitoring of water quality, the following stands out: the IQA result indicated good quality in the waters of the Cavernoso River, in the future region of the Cavernoso II SHP; During the floristic survey of macrophytes, 12 species belonging to 9 different families of the angiosperm group were found. No free or fixed submerged species were found. • Araraquara II — Taubaté Transmission Line TL The project to implement the Araraquara II — Taubaté TL, with a 500 kV voltage, is focused on increasing the availability of energy in the Southeastern region of Brazil. This transmission line will cross 28 municipalities of the State of São Paulo, to interconnect the Araraquara II Substation, located in the municipality of Araraquara (SP), where the energy provided in the Hydropower Complex of the Madeira River will be distributed, in the State of Rondônia, to the Taubaté Substation, in Taubaté – SP. This development undertaking is considered to be one of the priority projects for the Federal Government's Growth Acceleration Program PAC. Main actions conducted in 2011: • Development of the EIS/EIR and request for a Preliminary License; • Field inspections to analyze the selected tracing; • Public hearings about the EIS/EIR for the TL in five cities: Campinas, São José dos Campos, São Carlos, Bragança Paulista and Limeira; • Monitoring of the inspection conducted by the technical body of CETESB to evaluate the tracing; and • Contracting of Studies of Impact on the Surroundings SIS, developed to meet the pre-requisite for the issue of a letter of no obstacle to the development undertaking. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 92 • Cascavel Oeste — Foz do Iguaçu Transmission Line LT The PBA for the Cascavel Oeste TL — Foz do Iguaçu is comprised of eight environmental programs, seeking to prevent, mitigate and offset the negative social-environmental impacts caused by the construction of the transmission line, as well as the boosting and optimization of positive impacts. Throughout 2011, the six social-environmental programs provided in the PBA were implemented. The OperatingLicense OL was obtained in November 2011, and is valid for six years. Due to the interference in the Iguaçu National Park, Environmental Compensation Commitment Terms were executed with the IAP and Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade ICMBio, in order to mitigate the environmental impacts caused by the implementation of this development undertaking. 5.1.3. Significant fines and the total number of non-monetary sanctions resulting from non-compliance with the environmental laws and regulations. (GRI EN28) In 2011, Copel received 3 notifications of environmental infringement, totaling R$35,695.00. For non-monetary sanctions, the Company executed the Term of Commitment with Instituto Ambiental do Paraná IAP to offset the environmental interferences caused by a renovation in an office located at Ilha do Mel – PR. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 93 5.2. Social-environment Management of Reservoirs It consists in the implementation of a Company reservoir management process, in order to analyze the risks and propose alternatives for the decision-making process. It also has the purpose of developing projects and actions by means of environmental management through water basins, seeking to increase the water quality and availability in the reservoirs of Copel's HPPs, as well as providing for their multiple uses. Throughout 2011, the following actions were carried out: • Breakdown and structuring of the reservoir management process; • Formalization of the Local Commission of the Curitiba Production Plant UPTCA; • Beginning of implementation of the process in the GPS HPP's reservoir, coordinated by UPCTA; • Conduction of a survey of events in sectors 01 and 02 of the reservoirs of the GPS HPP; • Development of the service contracting call notice to verify any events in the reservoir of the GPS HPP; • Beginning of the development of the Social-environmental Geo-referenced Information System for Reservoir Management SIGSAM-GR, a geo-referenced application to support reservoir management activities; and the Implementation of data dictionaries in GPS equipment to computerize inspection works. 5.2.1. Control of reservoir water quality With the purpose of understanding the phenomena related to the functioning of the reservoir and substantiating the necessary actions to preserve water quality and ensure its multiple uses, in addition to compliance with legal requirements, Copel conducts a quarterly monitoring of the water in its reservoirs by collecting and analyzing upstream and downstream water, and water in the reservoir of hydropower plants, in addition to measuring the dissolved oxygen profile and temperature. The samples collected are submitted to certified laboratories for physical, chemical, micro-biological and phytoplankton analyses. The data obtained are used in the development of reports about water quality in the reservoirs, which are annually submitted to the environmental agency. Some reservoirs, due to their distinct conditions, require more specific actions, which is the case of the Governador Bento Munhoz da Rocha Neto Hydropower Plant (GBM HPP), where bi-monthly analyses have been conducted since 2009 in upstream, downstream and reservoir points. In addition to this more frequent monitoring, a bi-monthly analysis of the DBO, nitrogen and phosphorus loads originated from the eleven main tributaries of the reservoir is conducted. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 94 5.2.2. Algae monitoring and control program in reservoirs Eutrophication is the over-concentration of nutrients in a body of water. This is an environmental problem, originating mainly from sewage unloading in large volume in the contribution basin, as well as fertilizers, manure and certain pesticides carried by the rain into the basin. Eutrophication, together with high temperatures and the great lighting provided by the sun in large reservoirs, unleashes the exaggerated growth of algae populations, especially cyanobacteria (blue algae), in a process known as algal bloom. (GRI EN13) When in excess, cyanobacteria may cause unpleasant taste and odor in water, and unbalance water ecosystems. Some cyanobacteria are capable of releasing toxins, and can cause serious consequences to people and animals that ingest or have any direct contact with the contaminated water. Therefore, the reservoirs of Hydropower Plants operated by Copel are monitored on a quarterly basis, with an evaluation of physical and chemical parameters, as well as of algae concentration, discriminating the count of cyanobacteria and potentially toxic cyanobacteria. For the reservoir of the GBM HPP, which has problems related to eutrophication, monitoring is conducted on a bi-monthly basis. In 2011, in addition to the monitoring of the five points sampled on a bi-monthly basis, other measures were adopted, seeking to determine the loads of nutrients that reach the reservoir. Studies in partnership with Lactec and Associação Instituto Internacional de Ecologia e Gerenciamento Ambiental AIIEGA [International Institute Association for Ecology and Environmental Management] sought to estimate the sources of the largest loads of nutrients, seeking to promote actions to minimize the problem. Since these actions are conducted in the long run and depend on the mobilization of Public Authorities, companies and the population, Copel seeks to engage all of these segments through environmental programs, such as Riparian Forests and Social-environmental Management of Reservoirs. For plants under implementation, which is the case of the Mauá HPP, Copel conducted the monitoring of algae in eight stations, with a monthly collection frequency. Copel is negotiating with other institutions, such as: Sanepar, Emater, Department of Agriculture, among others, with the purpose of promoting actions to improve the environmental quality in the water basin, and mitigate the possibility of eutrophication of the future reservoir. 5.2.3. Monitoring program and Ichthyofauna repopulation (GRI EN15) One of the most important actions developed by the Company, seeking balance among the ecosystems, is the repopulation of reservoirs with native fish species, some under risk of extinction, which is the case of Steindachneridion melanodermatum from the Iguaçu River, the biggest fish in the river. The need for studies about the reproductive behavior and the biology of fish species migrating from their natural habitat, after the construction of dams, as well as the definition of conducts for repopulation of the reservoirs, have been a constant concern of Copel. Copel's Experimental Station for Icthyological Studies EEEI, located at the GNB HPP, is a center dedicated to research on native species of the Iguaçu River, and reproducing them in large scale, contributing to maintain the environmental balance of the entire basin. Using enhanced scientific methods and the most modern equipment, the station accounts for the conduction of major research focused on the Iguaçu's Ichthyofauna. EEEI relies on a flooded area of 6,250 m², distributed into 10 tanks. It produces an annual average of approximately one million alevins, and started producing fish for repopulation in 1996. In 2011, the production of native species alevin reached 955,100 individuals, a similar production to the one recorded in 2010. Repopulation actions included 19 reservoirs, in which 498,000 alevins of native species from the water basins were released. From the remainder, 30,000 were transferred to Sanepar, 310,000 to IBAMA, 20,000 to EMATER, and 92,500 to city governments, to be used in environmental education programs and events for environmental recovery and education. Also, 4,600 alevins were transferred to universities in the region, to be used in the qualification of professionals in research activities in biology, fish-farming and other co-related activities. Another activity developed by EEEI technicians is the recovery of fish stuck to the turbines, closing of the spillway, and SHP maintenance works. 30,112 fish were recovered, 29,108 of which were alive and immediately released downstream from the plant. Research carried out in 2010 allowed for the cryopreservation of the semen of the Iguaçu's Steindachneridion melanodermatum, in addition to the full expertise in controlled reproduction of Astyanax sp B, both native of Iguaçu. The Iguaçu's Steindachneridion melanodermatum in the lower sections of the river, and most samples reach between 12 and 15 kg in their natural habitat. Astyanax sp B is the largest of this type in the Iguaçu river. Actions of the repopulation program are being reassessed, based on new research, with the purpose of expanding the conservation of fish communities subject to the program. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 95 5.2.4. Riparian Forest Program (GRI EN13) The main purpose of the Program is the recovery of natural environments surrounding the reservoirs of plants that, according to the phyto-ecological position of most of them, should be essentially conducted through forest planting. The work is conducted at Copel's properties, as well as third-party properties whose owners are interested in adhering to the Program. Depending on the region's natural characteristics, local rehabilitation will also be linked to the closing of artificial drains in plain areas, the planting of herbaceous species on sites that used to be fields, and the structural strengthening in areas subject to strong erosive processes. In 2011, 71,861 seedlings were planted in Copel's properties, corresponding to a recovered area of 70.43 hectares. 25,872 meters of fences were also installed to protect the reforestation areas. In addition to the recovery of the Company's own areas, through the Forestry Cooperation Project, the environmental recovery of permanent preservation areas is also supported in third-party properties voluntarily adhering to the project. This action is important because most of the marginal areas of reservoirs do not belong to Copel. In 2011, recovery works in approximately 200 hectares of permanent preservation areas stood out, located in the micro-basins of the Cruz Machado region, in rivers that directly flow into the reservoir of the Governador Bento Munhoz da Rocha Neto HPP (Foz do Areia). 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 96 5.3. Social-environmental management of energy transmission and distribution assets 5.3.1. Sustainable handling of vegetation on transmission lines The environmental impacts of the implementation of new Transmission Lines TLs are mitigated through several actions, from the design phase to the construction phase. The tracing of the line prioritizes agricultural areas, pasture, brush land or vegetation of less preservation interest, even if that results in additional cost for the inclusion of successive vertexes and higher towers. When it is not possible to prevent the TL from crossing small sections of forest coverage, the forest inventory conducted in the topographic survey phase supports mitigating actions. In this stage, higher towers may be defined to enable the passage of cables over the vegetation and minimize interferences. Towers eventually inserted in the preservation area occupy a minimum area corresponding to the area of the tower base, increased by a surrounding area required for construction and maintenance. As a compensatory measure, seedlings are planted to recover the deforestation area. 5.3.2. Social-environmental program for urban forestry Program for cooperation with city governments to improve the management of urban forestry, conceived based on the understanding that it will only be possible to maximize the benefits from power distribution networks and urban forestry if both fronts are addressed in an integrated manner. In addition, the program seeks to promote safety, mitigation of impacts caused by the lopping of trees and improvement in the continuity of electric energy supply. With that purpose, Copel establishes partnerships with city governments to replace trees that pose risks to the electric systems, as well as for the supply of seedlings. In 2011, partnerships were established with the municipalities of Cafelândia, Campo Bonito, Florestópolis, Ibiporã, Irati, Mandaguaçu, Marmeleiro, Paranavaí, Pitanga, Porecatu, Prudentópolis, Porto Vitória, Santa Fé, Santo Antônio do Paraíso, Vera Cruz do Oeste and Wenceslau Braz. The Company also started partnerships with the Municipal Governments of Leópolis, Quedas do Iguaçu and São João do Triunfo, and executed partnerships with the municipalities of Atalaia, Floresta, Jandaia do Sul and Jaguapitã. In 2011, 2006 trees that posed risks for the energy networks were removed, and 6154 seedlings were supplied, in standard size, for planting on the sidewalks of partner municipalities. Copel has been a member of the International Society of Arboriculture ISA since 2008, and of Sociedade Brasileira de Arborização Urbana SBAU [Brazilian Society of Urban Forestry], seeking to prospect the most modern techniques in the management of urban forestry and to include them in its processes. 5.3.3. Technologies of energy distribution networks The most significant social-environmental impacts of distribution networks are: risks of accidents with third parties, conflicts with arboriculture and visual pollution. In order to mitigate these impacts, places with trees or rural areas with vegetation protected by law, Copel adopts technologies that replace naked networks, such as the protected compact network, the isolated secondary network, the isolated network and the underground network. • Protected Compact Distribution Network RDC and Isolated Secondary Distribution Network RSI The RDCs reduce the areas of interference with vegetation and the need to lop trees. RSIs allow for more proximity to tree branches, without the risk of causing interruptions in the case of occasional and non-permanent contact with conductors. Together, the RDCs and RSIs account for 85.5% and 11.0% of the total networks built in 2011, in the urban and rural areas, respectively. • Underground Network Today, the Company has approximately 104.5 km of medium-voltage network, 212 km of low-voltage network, and 2,054 inspection boxes and wells. Many development undertakings are under implementation (projects, studies and construction), such as: the Iguaçu National Park (13 km) and service to the communities on the coast of Paraná (35 km). In partnership with designers, entrepreneurs and suppliers, Copel also studies and provides for the implementation of underground networks inside residential condominiums. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 97 • Isolated network Another network technology that has been studied by Copel is the isolated area network. This technology consists in isolated cables that allow for permanent contact with trees. This network type makes it virtually unnecessary to lop trees. • Replacement of insulating mineral oil with vegetable oil Copel has been conducting studies and surveys on transformers and distribution circuit breakers through the gradual implementation of equipment isolated with insulating vegetable oil, as shown below: Municipality Equipment Amount Electrical Potential / Apparent Power Location Foz do Iguaçu Transformers 21 15 kV / 500 kVA Underground Network Aerial Network surrounding 17 15 kV / 112.5 kVA the municipal lake Transformers Aerial Network in the Cascavel 5 15 kV / 75 kVA Tarquínio Park Circuit breakers 4 15 kV / 34.5 kVA Substations Maringá Transformers 18 15 kV / 500 kVA Underground Network Transformers 2 15 kV / 500 kVA Aerial Network of Curitiba Copel's Central Storeroom Voltage Regulators 3 34.5 kV / 400 kVA 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 98 5.4. Natural resource management 5.4.1. Materials (GRI EN1) With regard to the acquisition of materials, Copel has actions directly connected and aligned to its Sustainability and Corporate Citizenship Policy. In the Supplier Registration CDF system, which started being used 30 years ago, the supplier is identified and classified, considering as criteria the technical, legal, tax compliance, social responsibility, environmental, economic and financial aspects, helping guarantee the availability of supply in the long run. Copel develops its material and equipment suppliers through industrial evaluations and approval of materials. In industrial evaluations, which are part of the supplier registration process since 1985, the person responsible for the evaluation carries out this activity indicating improvement opportunities in installations and processes of the supplier in question, thus establishing a cycle of improvement that allows for its development and for the extension of the chain's supply and sustainability. • Recycling and reuse of materials (GRI EN2, EN7) In 2005, Copel implemented a decontamination and recycling program of burnt light bulbs containing mercury in their composition, which are disposed of in an environmentally correct manner. In 2011, 122,000 light bulbs were decontaminated. Transformers removed from the electrical system are subject to technical evaluation and sorting of unserviceable and recoverable parts. After the recovery, the equipment is reincorporated into the company's inventories. In 2011, 3,700 transformers, both singleand threephased, were recovered. Another initiative related to the reuse of materials is the recovery of damaged meters removed from consumer units. Small repairs are conducted internally, and meters whose technical need requires more significant repairs and replacement of parts are sent to companies specialized in recovering them. In the following stage, the meters are sent to the test stations, authorized by Instituto Nacional de Metrologia, Normalização e Qualidade Industrial Inmetro [National Institute of Metrology, Standardization and Industrial Quality], existing at Copel, where metrological tests and technical verifications are conducted for the subsequent release and reuse of the meters. In 2011, 83,250 meters were decontaminated. • Paper Consumption (GRI EN7) In 2011, approximately 58.2 million paper sheets were used. Total paper consumption had an 8% reduction in relation to 2010, mostly due to the self-enveloping of bills, a practice implemented in the second half of 2010. 5.4.2. Water Consumption In 2011, consumption of water deriving from the public supply network reached 169,543 m3, showing an increase of 3.27% in relation to consumption in 2010, which was 164,182 m3. Since 2010, the building of the North Transmission Plant, in Londrina, is adapted to use rain water in activities that do not require the use of treated water, resulting in significant savings. Another three branches in the region of Ponta Grossa have already installed the rain water capturing and storage system: Telêmaco Borba, Castro and Jaguariaíva. (GRI EN10) Copel's activities do not interfere with the humid areas listed by the Ramsar Convention (1971), which addresses the conservation and rational use of humid zones, and water consumption does not significantly affect ecosystems and natural habitats. The process of electric energy generation simply consists in the sending the water in reservoirs to turbines, therefore not considering the water consumed. At the plants, the cooling system uses gross water from superficial bodies of water, taking place in an open circuit, with no recirculation, except in the Araucária Electric Gas Plant UEGA. Copel does not recycle the water used in its administrative units. (GRI EN9) 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 99 5.4.3. Energy (GRI EN3) Own consumption of electrical energy refers to the functioning of administrative offices and substation support points. The amount consumed in 2011 was 25,243 MWh. Energy consumption per employee was 2,685,4 kWh in 2011, versus 2,778.4 kWh in 2010.(GRI EN4) The Company's generation park has two plants using non-renewable fuel: the Figueira Thermal Power Plant, which uses mineral coal, and UEGA, which generates energy from natural gas in a combined cycle system. The table below shows the consumption of non-renewable fuels in these plants between 2009 and 2011 (GRI EN3): Direct energy produced – Thermal Power Plants Figueira Thermal Power Plant Energy from Primary Sources 2011 2010 2009 2008 Mineral coal (t) 77,973 80,312 80,216 70,618 Mineral coal (GJ) 2.03 x 106 2.09 x 106 2.01 x 106 2.80 x 105 Araucária Thermal Power Plant Energy from Primary Sources 2011 2010 2009 2008 Natural gas (m³) 501,402 273,056,374 195,644,368 149,429,548 Natural gas (GJ) 19.6 x 103 10.65 x 106 7.69 x 106 5.83 x 106 The vehicle fleet used in operating activities and to transport people at the Company's service is acquired with priority for models that use alcohol as fuel. Whenever it is necessary to acquire a model that uses diesel, it is recommended to verify compliance with the legal requirements regarding the emission pollutants. At Copel, the transport section and other areas that use the company's vehicles deploy operating, preventive and corrective maintenance practices, especially with regard to the catalyst and the exhaust system to control the emission of pollutants. (GRI EN29) The consumption of fuels by the Company's fleet is shown in the table below: Consumption of fuel by the Company's own fleet 2011 2010 2009 Fuel Amount Energy (GJ) Amount Energy (GJ) Amount Energy (GJ) 6 6 6 Gasoline (l) 1,914,369 63.47 x 10 1,427,331 47.32 x 10 1,356,964 44.98 x 10 9.29 x 106 24.94 x 106 6 Alcohol (l) 386,813 1,038,429 1,190,769 28.60 x 10 Natural gas (m³) 191,9 7.49 227.4 8.87 47,8 1.86 Diesel (l) 4,489,045 16.53 x 107 4,344,142 16.00 x 107 4,460,271 16.42 x 10 7 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 100 5.5. Emissions 5.5.1. Greenhouse Gas – GHG Emissions (GRI EN16) Copel conducts an annual inventory of greenhouse gases GHG, based on the calculation model of the GHG Protocol Brazil. When developing the inventory of emissions, the Company chose to report its emissions based on the approach for operating control. According to the inventory, Copel's main sources of emission are the Figueira Thermal Power Plant and the company's fleet. The table below shows the Company's GHG emissions, according to the inventories conducted from 2009 to 2011: GHG Emissions per scope Emissions (tCO2e) Year Scope 1 Scope 2 2009 208,134.36 582.20 2010 212,070.80 100,242.08 2011 208,992.9 103,878.9 5.5.2. Other indirect emissions of greenhouse gases (GRI EN17) Emissions regarding energy acquisition are published in the Company's inventory of GHG emissions. Other indirect emissions of gases that cause the greenhouse effect are not deemed as significant by Copel. 5.5.3. Initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GRI EN18) In 2008, Copel was one of the companies that adhered to the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program. The program seeks to promote the measurement and voluntary management of GHG emissions, providing participants with access to international quality instruments and standards to account for and develop GHG reports. The Program also intends to constitute a national platform to publish corporate and organizational GHG inventories. The Program is implemented through a partnership between the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment, the Center of Sustainability Studies from Fundação Getulio Vargas FGV, the Brazilian Corporate Council for Sustainable Development CEBDS, the World Resources Institute WRI, and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development WBSCD. Copel also carries out the following activities: • Development and disclosure on the company's website of the corporate inventory of greenhouse gases, in accordance with the initial definitions of the GHG Protocol Brazilian Program; • Publication of information about GHG emissions in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). • Participation, together with other companies in the electric sector, in the R&D project, to determine a methodology to measure GHG emissions of hydropower plant reservoirs; • Conduction of the R&D project, along with Lactec, to measure GHG emissions in the storage basin of the Mauá HPP's reservoir, in the phases of formation of the reservoir, i.e. before, during and after its filling. The project has been approved, and the study, designing and lab test phases have already shown results. This study will enable the energy sector, and therefore the Company, to analyze the formation of GHG in the reservoirs, enabling the evaluation of questions arising in the last few years about the volume of emissions caused by the reservoirs. The Company also adopts meetings through conference calls and video calls between its many units as a means to reduce physical travel and the use of vehicles, saving fuels and reducing GHG emissions. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 101 5.5.4. Carbon Efficient Index – ICO2 Investors increasingly more concerned about environmental issues believe that companies should adopt transparent practices with regard to their GHG greenhouse gas emissions, and policies related to climate change, preparing to operate in a low-carbon economy. In order to meet this expectation of investors, BM&FBOVESPA and BNDES, in a joint initiative, have developed the Carbon Efficient Index (ICo2), which seeks to measure the return of a theoretical portfolio comprised of IBrX-50 securities, re-weighted according to the level of efficiency of GHG emissions of the companies. The ICO2 was introduced in December 2010 with excellent repercussion, both in Brazil and abroad, with the purpose of encouraging the Brazilian corporate environment to measure GHG emissions of companies, seeking to mitigate them later and providing investors with an additional measurement instrument. Since Copel is a member of IBrX-50, it was invited to participate in the evaluation process for the last four months of 2011, taking on the challenge by formalizing its adhesion and submitting its GHG inventory for verification by Trucost (a consultancy firm contracted by BM&FBOVESPA). After the process of verification of GHG emission data, Copel started integrating the theoretical portfolio of the ICO2 between September and December. Copel's entrance in the ICO2 portfolio in 2011 makes it clear that the development of its sustainable practices is in line with the interests of shareholders and the strategic benchmarking. 5.5.5. Emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides Emissions of nitrogen oxides NOx and sulfur dioxides SO2 at the Figueira and Araucária Thermal Power Plants are shown in the table below. The amounts were obtained by means of an analysis conducted in these plants, reported to Instituto Ambiental do Paraná IAP. (GRI EN20) Nox and SO2 Emissions Atmospheric emissions 2011 2010 2009 Nox (t) 437.4 141 414 SO2 (t) 3721.3 1,822 3,908 5.5.6. Emissions of Particulate Material MP As emissões de material particulado de fontes fixas ocorrem na Usina Termelétrica Figueira e são monitoradas semestralmente. Em 2011, o volume gerado foi de 77,4 toneladas. 5.5.7. Use of Ozone-depleting Substances – ODS (GRI EN19) Copel uses ozone-depleting gases only in the operation and maintenance of air-conditioners at its facilities. The company does not have these substances in stock, because their replacement, when necessary, is made by companies contracted to conduct this service. With that purpose, Copel has a Federal Technical Registration with IBAMA, and issues an annual consolidated report of substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 102 5.6. Effluents (GRI EN21) In 2011, revamp works at Effluent Treatment Stations of HPPs were resumed, diagnosis reports for most of the plants were completed, and improvements in priority systems were implemented, all through the Effluent Management Program. At the Company's plants, the raw water from superficial bodies of water used in the cooling systems is returned to the source, downstream, with quality similar to the original. The volume disposed of is virtually the same volume removed from the source, since there are only a few losses through evaporation. In 2011, the volume of effluents generated in the cooling process was 138,994 million m³, showing a 5% increase in relation to the volume generated in 2010. Domestic effluent generated in the Company's administrative units is allocated to the municipal sewage collection system. Effluents from the Araucária Thermal Power Plant are monitored on a bi-weekly basis by Lactec, which issues bi-annual reports on the quality of effluents. At the Figueira Thermal Power Plant, monitoring is conducted by the company itself. Physical-chemical and microbiological parameters are assessed with the purpose of evaluating compliance with release standards established by law. Therefore, the removal of water and disposal of Company effluents do not have a significant impact on bodies of water and related habitats. (GRI EN25) 5.7. Waste In 2011, in the scope of the Corporate Waste Management Program, the publication of corporate standards for appropriate handling of the following waste stands out: lead-acid batteries, fluorescent and gas-releasing light bulbs, materials with amiantus, portable batteries, tires, civil construction waste, smoke detectors and lightning arresters. Still in 2011, the development and implementation of Solid Waste Management Plans PFRS was resumed at 45 installations of the Company subject to contracting in 2010. In addition, the conclusion of the development of a waste management tool stood out (Corporate Waste Registry RCR) with implementation expected for 2012. With regard to the handling of Polychlorinated Biphenyl PCBs (Ascarel), 32,000 liters of insulating mineral oil contaminated with PCB were decontaminated. (GRI EN1-EU) It is important to point out that the hazardous waste generated by the Company is sent to companies specialized in their treatment and final disposal, duly licensed to carry out these activities. The table below shows data on the treatment and final disposal of hazardous waste generated in the Company in 2011 (GRI EN22): Amount Treatment method/ 2011 Cost Waste Unit (in thousands 2011 2010 2009 final disposal of R$) Insulating mineral oil l 359,852.0 259,958.0 201,770.0 Regeneration 142.5 Solid and liquid waste contaminated Co-processing in furnaces of t 49.98 38.5 21.3 73.47 by oils and solvents cement industries Cloths contaminated by oils un 26,667.0 49,800.00 56,160.0 Reuse after industrial washing 6.8 Soil contaminated by oils t 15.0 8.00 Industrial grounding class I 15.3 Fluorescent light bulbs un 126,170.0 182,272.0 De-mercurization and recycling 56.8 (mercury steam and mixed) Batteries kg 7,425 Recycling 7.35 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 103 Copel does not export or import waste, pursuant to the Basel Convention. The waste is transferred by a contracted company (bidding) for transportation and final disposal in the country. (GRI EN24) 5.8. Ascarel Elimination – environmentally-appropriate handling and final disposal (GRI EN1 EU) Copel has developed an inventory of electrical equipment isolated by PCB. All PCB equipment is sent to final disposal by a contracted company licensed to decontaminate and recycle waterproof metal carcass of equipment and incinerate contaminated oil and permeable solids. Copel currently has nine power transformers isolated by PCB in operation, and the total weight of equipment is 29,970 kg, whereas the total volume total of this fluid is 10,410 liters. This equipment is located at the Figueira Thermal Power Plant and will be properly allocated upon the Plant's modernization. Copel has been progressively developing the inventory of electrical equipment isolated by mineral oil that may be contaminated by PCB. Up to 2011, analyses of the PCB level in insulating mineral oil was conducted as per standard ABNT NBR 13882 Electrical Insulating Liquids Determination of the Level of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB), in the Company's power transformers. The results of this inventory are shown in the table below. Equipment isolated by insulating mineral oil contaminated by PCB (PCB low level) Copel Distribuição S.A. Copel Geração e Transmissão S.A. Total power transformers isolated by mineral oil 645 206 Total power transformers analyzed regarding the level of pcb in the insulating oil 588 133 Total power transformers analyzed presenting a level of pcb of more than 50 mg/kg 107 10 Volume of insulating mineral oil with a pcb level of less than 50 mg/kg in liters 520,937 108,240 Expectation is that, in 2012, the analysis of the PCB level in insulating mineral oil will be resumed, as per standard ABNT NBR 13882 Electrical Insulating Liquids Determination of the Level of Polychlorinated Biphenyl PCB, in electrical equipment that did not undergo oil analysis yet. 5.9. Significant Spillage (GRI EN23) In 2011, there was no significant spillage in Copel's operations, only small leakage of insulating mineral oil due to the theft of transformers and faults in oil-insulated equipment. In November 2011, a transformer of the Governador Bento Munhoz – GBM HPP exploded. Virtually all the oil that leaked, approximately 400 liters, was retained in the power house. 5.10. Biodiversity Management Program (GRI EN11) With the purpose of actively contributing to the preservation of biodiversity in Paraná, Copel implemented the Biodiversity Management Program, which includes the following strategies: a) using the potential of well-preserved natural areas belonging to the Company that are not areas of permanent preservation or legal reserve; b) encouraging the environmental recovery of natural areas belonging to the Company, representing the various phytogeographic regions of the State, located in administrative and operating spaces; as well as the preservation of biodiversity in water basins forming Copel's reservoirs; c) implementing actions to contribute to the establishment of biodiversity corridors in Paraná; d) encouraging the Company's construction and maintenance divisions to adopt methods to reduce impacts on biodiversity in its projects; and e) promoting synergy with already existing corporate programs. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 104 5.10.1. Biodiversity recovery in degraded areas (GRI EN12, EN14) The main recovery work in degraded areas is focused on the construction sites of Copel's hydropower plants. These areas hosted civil structures at the time of the construction of these development undertakings. The final purpose is to recover the ecosystem, so that it will return to its original aspect. In transmission line installations, vegetation recovery is conducted with hydroseeding, seeking to recover sites with exposed soil, avoiding erosive processes. As for substations, forestry seedlings are planted in their surroundings, seeking to adjust the landscape and reduce the visual impacts of the development undertaking. With that purpose, Copel produces tree/bush species in its Plant Nurseries in 2011, totaling 330,000 seedlings. Seeking to meet the demand for seedlings in the entire State, and considering the importance of obtaining local seeds to maintain the genetic variability of each ecosystem, Copel has six plant nurseries, covering all phytogeographic units in the state of Paraná, namely: Plant nurseries and their respective phytogeographic units Copel's forestry plant nurseries Phytogeographic unit GPS HPP Dense ombrophil forest (Atlantic Forest) GBM HPP Ecotone Semideciduous Seasonal Forest and Mixed Ombrophil Forest GNB HPP Mixed Ombrophil Forest (Forest with Araucária) GJR HPP Semideciduous Seasonal Forest MUA HPP Ecotone Semideciduous Seasonal Forest and Mixed Ombrophil Forest Semideciduous Seasonal Forest with the occurrence of Savannah Mourão HPP spots (Cerrado) The Faxinal do Céu Nursery of the GBM HPP is categorized as a Botanical Garden due to its landscape characteristics and ex-situ preservation of the species. The seedlings produced are used in the landscape adjustment of green areas of the Plants, the Company's administrative areas, as well as actions for the environmental recovery of Permanent Preservation Areas of the surroundings of the reservoirs. In addition, seedlings are made available for the environmental compensation of deforestation deriving from the opening of a section for Transmission and Distribution Lines, and the transfer of seedlings for urban forestry for partner city governments. 2011 ANNUAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | ENVIRONMENTAL SCOPE 105 5.10.2. Preservation of species under threat in the Mauá HPP (GRI EN15) The Mauá HPP and its reservoir will cover a total area of 9,000 hectares, of which 3,000 are currently covered by forests in many successive stages. The vegetation survey conducted in the EIS/EIR and the forest inventory for suppression have identified the occurrence of 4 species included in IBAMA's list of species under threat of extinction (federal list) and 20 species included in the IAP's list of species under threat of extinction (state list), whereas 3 have the “In danger” status, and 17 have the “Rare” status. The nursery of the Mauá HPP is producing seedlings of 33 species, whereas 6 of these are present in the IAP's list of species threatened of extinction. 5.10.3. Mapping of Permanent Preservation Areas in the State of Paraná Paraná does not have an official map of the State's Permanent Preservation Areas APP. As an energy concessionaire, Copel cannot make light connections in these areas. This need led to the constitution of an official work group in the State, coordinated by the State Department for the Environment – SEMA, and with representatives of Instituto Ambiental do Paraná – IAP, Instituto das Águas, Instituto de Terras, Cartografia e Geociências – ITCG and Copel. The SEMA Resolution no. 042/2011 made the group official, which has the purpose of developing and defining concepts for the development of the Official Maps of the State's urban and rural APPs. 5.10.4. Research and Development – R&D Projects focused on the environment(GRI EU8) • Evaluation of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) in the area of influence of reservoirs under construction – Case Study: Mauá. Duration: 2010 -2013. Purpose: studying GHG emissions in reservoirs under construction. About the project: Determining the contribution of the reservoir formation in the Mauá HPP in relation to GHG emissions through the modeling of the reservoir and determination of measurement points in the region to be flooded. The modeling of conductions based on which the reservoirs will suffer contributing effects will be conducted: settling, climatology, hydrology, and other research areas. With this information the points of collection will be selected. Measurements will be carried out before, during and after the filling of the reservoir, evaluating the formation of greenhouse gases.
