Each local employee is treated with the respect they deserve and have earned on our work site. Gossamer does not only adhere to the Global Compact standards but to Gossamer Standards as well. We have taken the initiative to make sure each employee has the tools and education they need to complete the task being asked of them. The local workforce leaves our worksite with more knowledge than they began the project with. Our goal is to teach new skills so when the contract/project is complete they are left with a skill to apply in the local market. Implementation Each new employee added to the Gossamer Crossing team is educated on our Human Rights policy. We have very high values and we expect our team to comply with these standards. Measurement of Outcomes Monthly our senior staff on ground observes the employees to guarantee our standards are being met on a day-­‐ to-­‐day scale. Quarterly our Executive Group reviews each member of the team (including senior staff) making sure they are following with our set objectives. 16520 Wedge Parkway, Suite 300  Reno, NV 89511  Direct: 775-­‐345-­‐3505 E-­‐Mail: contact@gossamercrossing.com  Web: gossamercrossing.com LABOUR Assessment, policy, and goals Our company, Gossamer Crossing, does most of its work in East Africa.

Buying locally we are limiting the amount of packaging materials needed to ship items across seas or countries. Gossamer tries to purchase from environmentally friendly companies whom recycle and produce recycled goods. Preserving our environment is a top priority and we work each day at our work sites to uphold Principles 7, 8 & 9. Implementation Gossamer’s Environmental policy is distributed to each new employee we add to our team. It is stressed that we take this policy seriously. Our mission is to improve our environment not harm it while we are at the work site. The Environmental policy is upheld by the Project Manager and the Senior Management and reviewed quarterly to update as needed. Measurement of outcomes Over the past year Gossamer has improved vendor selection to reflect our environmental policy; by choosing vendors that are environmentally conscious we have limited the damage to the work area. As a company we try very hard to limit our footprint (so to speak) on our work sites, always cleaning up any waste and limiting the amount of waste produced. 16520 Wedge Parkway, Suite 300  Reno, NV 89511  Direct: 775-­‐345-­‐3505 E-­‐Mail: contact@gossamercrossing.com  Web: gossamercrossing.com ANTICORRUPTION Assessment Corruption is our biggest challenge, not because Gossamer takes part (we do NOT) but because we are surrounded by it in East Africa. With Piracy at its height, Gossamer works very hard to ensure our employees are not taking part in such actions. Gossamer has a strict, but simple policy regarding corruption and bribery: DO NOT TAKE PART IN IT!! We hold each employee to these standards; no one is above this policy. Implementation When each new employee is hired they are informed about the possible bribery that occurs in East Africa. They are also given the anti-­‐corruption anti-­‐bribery policy that they sign before they start their first day. This is a policy that is enforced from the top down, each level monitored by the senior management. Measurement of outcomes Gossamer Crossing has monthly reviews where the senior staff evaluates that all of our processes are being followed and improved as necessary. 16520 Wedge Parkway, Suite 300  Reno, NV 89511  Direct: 775-­‐345-­‐3505 E-­‐Mail: contact@gossamercrossing.com  Web: gossamercrossing.com
