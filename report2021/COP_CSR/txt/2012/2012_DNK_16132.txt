For more information on DSB’s products, ownership and organisational profile, we refer to DSB’s Annual Report 2011. In 2010, DSB signed the International Union of Railways’ (UIC) Declaration on Sustainable Mobility and Transport. With this declaration, the UIC provides its interpretation of the UN Global Compact. DSB signing the UIC’s declaration is a confirmation and expression of support for UIC’s efforts to create awareness of train travel as a sustainable form of transport. Virksomhedsforum for Socialt Ansvar DSB is a member of Virksomhedsforum for Socialt Ansvar (VFSA) (Business Forum for Social Responsibility), and via this network, DSB participates in advising the Danish Minister of Employment on the integration of minorities on the Danish labour market. As a member of the VFSA, DSB also has an influence on the national initiatives that are implemented to further the integration of minorities on the labour market. There are, for example, projects such as High Five and Route 25 which focus on getting young people with criminal records into employment. 9 Environment and Climate We take ownership of ongoing environmental and climate improvements of our train products and the operation of our corporation. We are environmentally innovative in relation to our product. The train is one of the modes of transport that has CO2-emission for a 12 km trip in Copenhagen area kg per person the least impact on the environment, and DSB’s long-term objective is that DSB trains are CO23 neutral by 2030.

S-trains In 2011, S-trains were more fuel efficient, as the CO2 emissions from selected transport subcontractors fell by 22 per cent. The primary reason is energy consumption per seat kilometre fell by 10 that there was less track improvement work than per cent. The total consumption of traction current in 2010, and therefore fewer replacement busses fell by 4 per cent despite the fact that production were deployed. In addition, the travel pattern for rose by 7 per cent, measured in train set kilomeschool trips was different in 2011 compared to tres. The reason for this decrease is that the 2010, as fewer schools booked for their pupils to weather was warmer (21 per cent fewer degree travel on the ferry to Bornholm and more school days compared to 2010) and that the temperature trips were undertaken by bus which emit less CO2 in the passenger sections was adjusted to the outemissions per journey. side temperature.

The smoke comes from the rather old diesel rolling stock where lubricating oil is combusted in the engine producing smoke with a strong unpleasant smell. For the last couple of years, DSB has focused on reducing the lubricating oil in the engine, but it has not been possible to eliminate the problem. In 2011, DSB was not issued with any enforcement notices or given notice of any such enforcement notices. Reducing the nuisance of smoke During 2011, DSB fitted six MR train sets with catalytic converters, which cut the emission of HC and particles and reduce the opacity, and this means less black smoke. DSB also fitted emission kits on 20 ME locomotives in 2011. An emission kit reduces a locomotive’s emission of nitrogen and carbon. It provides a 34 per cent reduction of the emission of NOx and the emission of particles drops by 37 per cent.

Natteravnene are permitted to travel free on all DSB trains and DSB assists in recruiting new Natteravne. In addition, DSB S-tog makes rooms available to Natteravnene at selected stations, offers them cups of coffee at the 7-Eleven shops when they are on their rounds and sponsors sweets that may be distributed among the young people who speak to Natteravnene. To DSB, the cooperation with Natteravnene is very important, as the group of volunteers in their characteristic yellow jackets provide a sense of security in the public space during Friday and Saturday evening and night time. Experience from all over the Nordic Countries shows that the work of these volunteers significantly increases people’s sense of security both on the trains and at stations. Their mere presence normally calms down any unruly elements, and the young people who speak to Natteravnene almost always appreciate the interest that the adults show in them and their welfare. 1 Natteravnene (“Night Owls”) is a national voluntary organisation. Volunteers in groups of three wearing their characteristic yellow jackets walk around at night engaging with young people, providing a sense of security and good role models. 16 Responsible supplier management DSB will proactively secure and develop responsible business relationships with suppliers and business contacts.

The objective reflects the gender distribution that prevails at DSB generally. In order to increase the proportion of female executives, DSB has:  established a network for female executives  informed recruitment companies that a minimum of 30 per cent of the candidates that they present to DSB must be women.

The result of the reputation survey depends to a certain extent on the population’s general view of DSB. Despite a fall in DSB’s overall reputation, 2011 saw a rise in the population’s view that DSB supports good causes. Help for the homeless around Copenhagen Central Station For a number of years, the homeless and service employees have posed challenges for one another on a daily basis at Copenhagen Central Station. In 2010, DSB entered into a partnership with the 21 local homeless organisations: Hjemløseenheden, DSB handing out fines to passengers without tickMændenes Hjem, En varm seng, Reden, Gadejurisets.

In the autumn of 2011, the partnership was extended, and for a three-month trial period, selected homeless people had the possibility of buying travel cards at a reduced price. We do this to enhance the homeless people’s sense of dignity when travelling with DSB, and to make more effective 22 Operation Dagsværk For the fourth year in succession, DSB was host for 400 upper secondary school students as part of Operation Dagsværk (a day when young people work instead of going to school and then donate the money earned to charity). I 2011, Operation Dagsværk helped S-train customers handle their bicycles on the trains and at the stations. The work ties in with DSB’s objective to make it easy to get in and out of the train, and therefore make train travel more attractive on a day-to-day basis. Computer glasses for the visually impaired in Ghana In 2011, DSB’s employees collected old computer glasses and sent them to Africa to help visually impaired people to get a better quality of life. A dedicated DSB employee from DSB’s Customer Centre got an agreement with a local Synoptik shop (optician’s chain) that cooperated with the Danish Society for the Blind in Ghana. Via DSB's internal anti-waste portal, all employees could Danmarks Indsamling (Denmark’s Collection) hand in their used computer glasses at Synoptik In 2011, 170 employees went around DSB stawhen they collected their new glasses.

DSB has decided on an average between a fairly small and a fairly large car, both with EURO III engines. 26 This key figure is close to the average for the Danish fleet of cars. To calculate the CO2 emissions from aeroplanes, we use Scandinavian Airlines’ CO2 calculator. We use the default value for the most commonly used planes on the selected route. The occupancy rates for cars come from the sta‐ tistics of the Danish Road Directorate. We esti‐ mate that there is an average of 1.54 passengers in the car, and for calculations during rush hours, we estimate that there is an average of 1.1 pas‐ sengers. For environmental disclosures for types of rolling stock, we use the annual energy consumption and emissions as well as the number of seat kilometres covered by the rolling stock. The dis‐ tribution on the different types of rolling stock is performed using the annual statement tool. External declaration In 2008, RISØ updated the professional assess‐ ment of the method of the annual calculation of the energy consumption and emissions of train travel which DSB uses as a declaration. The origi‐ nal declaration is from 2001 and it still applies, as the method and prerequisites remain unchanged in relation to the date of the declaration. 27 Environmental key figures The environmental disclosures include energy consumption and emissions of various types of air pollutants for product types and types of rolling stock.

Note 8 As of 2008 DSB has used power produced via renewable energy sources for train operations as well as for electricity in buildings. This means that there are no emissions in this regard in the report. Note 9 The calculation of emissions from train operations is based on key figures.

The data are the responsibility of the Preben J. Sørensen Company’s Management. Our responsibility is to State Authorised Public Accountant express a conclusion on these paragraphs based on our review. Scope of review We conducted our review in accordance with the Danish Standard on Assurance Engagements (“RS 3000 Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ). The purpose was to obtain limited assurance about whether the data presented in “Environment and Climate” are consistent with the reporting basis described on page 24-26 and with the data reported by the entities included. Our review was based on an assessment of the risk of material misstatement. We have evaluated the basis of accounting applied and analysed correlations to the Company's activities. As agreed with Management, we did not review the data for the individual entities. The review was limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and an analysis of the consistency of figures and the Company’s most important quality control procedures, thus providing less assurance than an audit. Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the data for 2011 as contained in “Environment and Climate” (pages 9-13) and “Environmental report” (page 27-31) are not consistent with the accounting policies described or the data reported by the entities included. 34 External assessment of methodology operations in Denmark. The method is used for for the annual statement of the energy the preparation of DSB’s green accounts. consumption and emissions of train (Environmental report) operations (update of assessment Overall conclusion from 2001) It is estimated that the methodological basis for In the assessment of the methodological basis for the Annual Statement Tool is entirely appropriate the Annual Statement Tool I made in 2001, there and that its application for the current purposes is was one minor reservation in that the data basis acceptable from a technical perspective. The for the energy and emission factors for electric uncertainties that necessarily exist are at an trains freight trains, passenger trains and Sacceptable level. The greatest uncertainty is trains was relatively poor. At that time, this was associated with an unavoidable principle factor, far more aggregated than for diesel trains as it i.e. the calculation convention for determining the was only divided into S-trains and long-distance environmental impact from electricity trains of which the latter was not broken down consumption. The calculation principles chosen into freight and passenger trains, let alone into can be defended, although they are not, and never different types of passenger trains. can be, beyond discussion. These reservations have now been eliminated. Generally, the values used are reasonable in First, freight trains are no longer included in the comparison with the values used by others and green accounts of DSB. Second, the data basis for results for similar statements, pursuant i.a. to electric long-distance trains is far better today and Schipper et al.: ”Energy Use in Denmark: An allows for an easy description of the main types International Perspective”, Lawrence Berkeley of electric long-distance trains (train sets, engine Laboratory, Berkeley, California, 1992; OECD: powered). Third, S-trains are now a much more ”The Environmental Effects of Freight”, Paris, homogenous group in that the latest S-train 1997; IEA & Lawrence Berkeley National generation is now dominant.

February 2008 This applies to the assumptions employed and to Kaj Jørgensen, research fellow the results as well as to specific figures (for Department of Systems Analysis, example, unit consumption and emissions per unit Risø DTU of traffic) and to the overall results. Finally, it applies to both the underlying documentation and as far as can be judged to the application in the Assessment of the methodological model tool. The fact that the data basis for the basis for the annual statement tool energy and emission factors of electric trains freight trains, passenger trains and S-trains is (2001) relatively poor is a weakness. This shortcoming, In 2001 DSB asked Kaj Jørgensen from the however, does not prevent the preparation of the Department of Systems Analysis at the Research environmental assessments which, for example, Centre in Risø to make a professional assessment are included in the green accounts. Nevertheless, of DSB’s method for data handling of the energy it would definitely be an improvement to have consumption and calculation of emissions for the more disaggregated material.” individual train types in connection with the Kaj Jørgensen annual statement. The following is the general Department of Systems Analysis, conclusion of the assessment: “The purpose of Risø National Laboratory, 2001 this assessment is to provide a professional assessment of the methodology the so-called “Annual Statement Tool” used by DSB to state energy consumption and emissions from train
