Since then, we have embraced, supported and enacted, within our sphere of influence, the UNGC principles on human rights, labour standards, the environment and anticorruption. This report gives a brief overview of our communication on progress on the ten UNGC principles and our performance on sustainability indicators defined in the Global Reporting Initiative's G3.1 guidelines on sustainability reporting. This sustainability update has been effectively divided in to four main sections in the report across aspects of corporate governance, people management, environment management and community development. In each section, we have attempted to give a balanced view of how we have performed. The Euro zone debt crisis continued in 201112 dampening the global economic recovery, high inflation and depreciation of the Indian Rupee. Thisalso translated in to amoderate growth in the tourism industry. The international touristsarrival grewby 4.4 percent worldwide, while in India the foreign tourists arrival and domestic traffic increased by about 9 percent over last year. Amidst this, we continued to pursue the completion of ongoing builds, both in the domestic and international market, under various brands to achieve sustainable and profitable growth. In 201112, our inventorystood at 112 hotelswith 13,629 rooms. The Tata Code of Conduct continues to articulate the values, ethics and business principles that should be adhered to by our employees, as part of our philosophy on Corporate Governance. We have extended the purview of our governance mechanisms to encompass guest and associate satisfaction, interactions with vendors and suppliers, business relations with JVs and partners, commitment to qualityand brand standards, accountability, transparencyand businessethics. Continuing from the previous years, we have focussed on internal redeployment of human resourcesasan effective way of optimising our operations. Thisyear, we also implemented several other projectsaimed at building ahigh performancework culture. Through project 'Vidya', weaim to achieve100%computer literacyacrossIHCL, whilethrough 'MiUniversity' – an onlinelearning 2 management system, we aim to provide impetus in skill and knowledge development among all levels of employees. In 201112, we introduced flexible compensation architecture on Cost to Company principles allowing our executives to enhance value of their existing remuneration. We also continued our efforts towards building leadership capability across all levels through dedicated programmes. Safety and security of associates and guests have been an integral component of our business and we have defined systems and processes to ensure awareness and trainingalongwith regular safetyand securityperformancereviews. We are conscious of our environmental impact across our operations and strive to reduce consumption. We continue to certify our hotels under EarthCheck, which is an extensive assessment and audit of individual hotelsby independent assessorsacrossindicatorsranging from energy use, water consumption, waste management to sensitivity exhibited visavis social and cultural dimensions. Wearealso focussingon reducingour dependencyon fossil fuelsbyincreasing the use of renewable and alternative energy sources. Our hotels are also working towards effective water management. We have achieved a zero discharge status for 33 hotels, while 17 hotels have active rain water harvesting systems. We have deployed innovative waste management systems across hotels to optimise resource usage. In some of the hotels, we have installed a biogas plant to effectively disposekitchen and horticulture waste. Weare consciousof biodiversity preservation in ecosensitiveareaswhereour hotelsoperate. ‘Building sustainable livelihoods’ continues to be the foundation of our social responsibility agenda. Most of our projects are designed to extend our core competencies of food and beverage service, hospitality, wellness and spas. We work alongside the national and state systems towards evolving realistic and sustainable solutions for national challenges like malnutrition, unemployment and gaps in vocational training and education. Our association with the rich heritage of India enables us to provide a platform to showcase indigenous art and culture to the world, whileencouragingand benefittingthecraftsmen who create it. We encourageour associates, vendors and partners to volunteer their time, knowledge and resources for identified causes and social projectsfor not just reaching out to the beneficiaries, but also to enrich their personal lives. We have renewed our commitment to promote the spirit of volunteering through our campaign 'Give Back' and are keen to open up opportunitiesfor volunteering to our guestsaswell in yearsto come.

Madhukar is the man behind the beautiful Bidriware products that grace the lobby of Taj Residency, Aurangabad. Bidri work, a long-forgotten tradition, which traces its origins to 2,000 years ago, first originated in Damascus, Syria. The tradition was introduced in India by the Mughals to the city of Bidar, after which, it flourished in cities such as Hyderabad and Lucknow. Today, an age-old custom is being kept alive by Madhukar, who came close to giving up Bidri work, a few years ago. When Madhukar was having second thoughts about giving up his business, he was introduced to Paramparik Karigar, an NGO which works towards reviving art and craft in various locations around India. This preamble which took place in 2005 changed his life. Paramparik went on to introduce Madhukar to Taj Residency, Aurangabad, who gave him a counter in the lobby of the hotel to display and sell his products. Within a span of 3 years, Madhukar’s earnings multiplied manifold and he now looks forward to a brighter future. 18 T RA I N I N G A N D SU PPO RT F O R N U T RI T I O N PRO G RA M M ES We have developed training content on nutrition, cooking and personal hygiene, lowcost, delicious and diverse nutritiousrecipesfor children in partnership with government and identified NGOs.
