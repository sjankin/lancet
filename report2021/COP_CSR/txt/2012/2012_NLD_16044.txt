Imagine the result CLIENT FOCUS Annual Report 2011 Imagine the result Our mission is to improve quality of life around the world by creating places of distinction and providing sustainable solutions that enhance the built and natural environments. In doing so, we produce exceptional value for our clients, employees, shareholders and society. Leadership, Balance, Growth Our strategy bears the title: Leadership, Balance, Growth. Leadership represents our goal to be recognized as a leading company “in each of our markets”; Balance reflects our commitment to leaving the environments, the places and the lives we touch better than we found them; and Growth not only signals our aspiration to increase the size of our business and market share, but also the development of our people. ARCADIS differentiates itself from competitors in two main ways. The first is our unswerving focus on solving our clients’ challenges. The second is our commitment to making the world a better place. This first differentiator helps us in our day-to-day professional lives, and the second motivates to a higher purpose. We believe in both. The work we do helps to put the world in balance. In striving to improve quality of life we seek to strike a balance between the built and natural environments, the creative and the functional, the innovative and the proven, and between imagination and results. We achieve balance by taking a long-term view of our activities, while providing value to our clients in the short-term. This means we conduct our business on a client basis rather than on a project basis as we foster long-term relationships with select multinational, and key national and local clients who appreciate the value-added services we provide.

In 2011, we realized organic growth throughout the year, resulting in 3% for the total year. This growth came from Brazil and Chile, where we benefited from investments in mining and energy, from Asia and the Middle East, where RTKL benefited from attractive property markets and from the United States environmental market where private sector demand was strong and we gained market share. In Europe, France and Germany contributed to growth, while private sector spending supported recovery in the United Kingdom in the second half of the year. Reduced government demand, especially at the municipal level, led to a decline of activities in the US water market, and in the Netherlands, Belgium and the Czech Republic. In Poland several large road projects were put on hold resulting in a significant drop of activities.

This resulted in an organic decline of net revenues of 5%. The 10 401 decline was slightly lower at the gross revenue level due to a large amount of third 09 423 party work for the Floriade project, the major horticulture exhibition park near 08 404 Venlo to be opened in 2012. The negative impact from acquisitions resulted from 07 374 the divestment of our 50% interest in the facilities management business (AAFM, sold in June 2011, but already deconsolidated as per year-end 2010) and of a small local urban planning firm (Witpaard, sold in February 2011).

Despite 07 26.2 government austerity measures, investments in large projects generally continued. ARCADIS has a strong position in that market. We worked on the Operational A2 tunneling project in Maastricht and the second Coentunnel, while also the rail infrastructure market provided a lot of work, partly resulting from the High EBITA-margin The Netherlands in % Frequency Rail program to increase capacity of existing lines. In addition, we worked on the design of a new sustainable railway station near Driebergen11 9.4 Zeist and were involved in preparing proposals for a better integration of 10 9.8 infrastructure at the Zuidas in Amsterdam, including redevelopment of the eedt 09 11.0 Amsterdam South railway station. In the water market, we saw some recovery 08 8.9 07 10.2 in the second half of 2011, based on our strong position in water management, while initiatives focused on niche markets in water treatment were paying off. Operational In environment, the focus is on growth with industrial clients in the oil and gas and chemical sectors. However, this was insufficient to offset declining demand from the public sector with less work in environmental impact assessments. Less spending by the public sector and by institutions in healthcare and education led to declining revenues in the building market. Margin at good level To match lower market demand the number of staff was reduced by some 250 people. Restructuring charges amounted to €4.4 million (2010: zero). Excluding these charges, the operational margin was 9.4%. Despite price pressure from increased competition, this was only slightly below the 2010 margin, due to timely cost savings.

We got involved in the Grand Paris Metro, the largest infrastructure project in Europe, and extended our contract for the high speed line between Tours and Bordeaux. Also in EBITA Europe excluding environment and buildings revenues grew organically due to increased demand The Netherlands from private sector clients. In Germany, our project management business did well in € million in both the buildings and infrastructure market. We provided project management 11 7.1 services for the new airport near Berlin, and for the first proton therapy oncology 10 13.3 clinic in eastern Germany. In environment we won a $20 million contract for the 09 20.7 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and benefited from more private sector demand. In 08 28.3 Belgium, we suffered from less spending at the municipal level, resulting in less 07 22.5 activities in infrastructure and water. This was partly offset by growth in environOperational ment and especially in buildings where our activities to support industrial clients grew considerably. EBITA-margin Europe excluding The Netherlands Recovery in the United Kingdom, difficult market in Central Europe in % Although UK revenues for the total year still declined organically, the second half 11 2.5 of the year saw a recovery, driven by increasing private sector demand for 10 5.0 environmental services, while the activities in the property market stabilized. 09 7.6 Public sector investments are under pressure, but the market in London and the 08 9.5 South East offers ample opportunities. 07 8.2 Due to government budget issues several major road projects in Poland were put on Operational hold, leading to a strong revenue decline. The rail infrastructure market held up, while the environmental market was under pressure, despite opportunities in alternative energy. In the Czech Republic, reductions in public sector spending caused revenues to decline. Margins under pressure The low margin was caused by severe losses in the UK and Poland. The reorganization in the UK in the first half of 2011 resulted in a strong recovery of profitability in the second half of the year. EC Harris performed in line with expectations. The losses in Poland were caused by overcapacity and cost overruns on a specific project. The Polish business is being reorganized, resulting in a strong capacity reduction. Restructuring charges , mostly UK related were €3.5 million (2010: €3.6 million). Excluding these charges, the operational margin declined to 2.5%.

This paid off very well with substantial additional revenues booked in the United States, and internationally. Integration with our US Operational operations took place in three phases. Per the end of 2010, the companies were integrated into a divisional management structure, consistent with the global business lines. By mid-2011, integration of the corporate functions was completed, resulting in significant cost savings. Per the end of 2011, integration of the front offices was finished. Although market conditions in healthcare architecture remained challenging due to uncertainty about new legislation, the commercial market is gaining some strength. Partly on the back of strong markets in Asia and the Middle East, RTKL’s activities in the US showed modest growth. Strong performance continued Restructuring charges amounted to €4.7 million (2010: €3.0 million) and were related to the integration with Malcolm Pirnie and the adjustment of the organization to reduced demand, especially in the water market. Excluding these charges, the operational margin improved to 12.0%, largely due to strong results in environment and efficiency gains resulting from the integration with Malcolm Pirnie and the integration of Rise.

RTKL was very successful in winning high level master planning and architectural design work for commercial property and mixed use developments. In the Middle East, RTKL benefits from investments in new hospitals, based on delivering an integrated service offering, including architecture, installations and equipment planning. Through the merger with EC Harris we will be able to benefit even more from growth in these regions. Profitability at good level Profitability was impacted by several non-operational items. The sale of energy projects in Brazil and the fair value adjustment of the remaining energy assets, resulted – net of operational losses – in a contribution of €12.6 million, while in 2010 the energy business caused a loss of €3.2 million. The sale of carbon credits in Brazil contributed €2.8 million (2010: €1.9 million). Corrected for these items, underlying EBITA increased to €23.7 million (2010: €19.0 million) with an operational margin of 13.0%. This margin was somewhat lower than in 2010 due to investments in systems and processes to facilitate continued growth.

Annual Report 2011 Report by the Executive Board 43 In control statement The Executive Board is responsible for the design and functioning of the internal risk management and control systems. Although such systems are intended to optimally control risks, they can never, however well designed or functioning, provide absolute certainty that human errors, unforeseen circumstances, material losses, fraud or infringements of laws or regulations will not occur. In addition, the efforts related to risk management and internal control systems should be balanced with the costs of their implementation and maintenance. Based on the approach as outlined above, the Executive Board believes that to the best of its knowledge, the internal risk management and control systems provide a reasonable assurance that the financial reporting does not contain any errors of material importance and that the risk management and control systems worked properly in 2011. Responsibility statement In accordance with article 5:25c of the Financial Markets Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht), the Executive Board confirms that to the best of its knowledge: • the Annual Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of ARCADIS and its consolidated companies, • the Annual Report gives a true and fair view of the position as per December 31, 2011 and the developments during the financial year of ARCADIS and its group companies included in the annual Financial Statements, and • the Annual Report describes the principal risks ARCADIS is facing. The names and functions of the Executive Board members are mentioned at the end of the Report by the Executive Board, on page 62 of this annual report.

The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could change in the near term if future estimates of projected taxable income during the carry-forward period are revised. Unrecognized deferred tax assets and liabilities In 2011, a deferred tax asset of €2.9 million for net operating losses was not recognized. The opinion of management is that it is not probable that these losses will be compensated by future profits in the companies where these losses were made. At December 31, 2011, the gross amounts of the net operating loss carry forwards for which no deferred tax assets have been recognized in the balance sheet, with a total of €11 million (2010: €5.2 million), can be carried forward indefinitely.

All financial instruments carried at fair value within the Company are categorized in level 2. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the term and maturity of the contract, using market interest rates. The fair value of interest rate swaps is consistent with bank valuations. These valuations are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at measurement date. For loans and receivables fair value is determined for disclosure purposes based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the Company specific market rate of interest at reporting date. For financial leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at reporting date. Due to the short-term character of the receivables, the fair value equals the carrying value. 33 Subsequent events There were no material events after December 31, 2011 that would have changed the judgement and analysis by management of the financial condition of the Company at December 31, 2011 or the profit for the period of the year 2011.
