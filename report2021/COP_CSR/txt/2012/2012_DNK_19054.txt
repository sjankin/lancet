HANSEN – ANNUAL REPORT 2011/12 – CSR 14 Notes to Non-financial statements Note 2 Environmental performance indicator Overall environmental performance for fiscal year 2011/12 was satisfactory. The reduction target was more than met for energy, where a reduction of 32% was achieved versus 2008/09. For water, performance was at a level similar to the basis year 2008/09. Chr. Hansen is not satisfied with this development and have identified the main reason for this significant change: technical defects in the water supply, which forced an increased consumption for a period this year. Natural Colors successfully continued to grow the business in a sustainable way. The Energy EPI for Natural Colors has now improved by more than 62% since 2008/09 and by more than 18% since 2010/11. Cultures & Enzymes delivered fine reductions on energy. The EPI development for Health & Nutrition is influenced by process upgrades and by refurbishment in general. Chr. Hansen is striving to improve performance in all divisions. Besides less efficient water utilization, Chr. Hansen is satisfied with the result and is striving to continue the positive development and deliver new reductions in 2013 according to the 2020 environmental ambitions.

HANSEN – ANNUAL REPORT 2011/12 – CSR 15 Note 4 Energy In 2011/12 Chr. Hansen saw only a minor increase in total energy consumption compared to 2010/11, which is insignificant compared to the increase in production volume. The energy sources were unchanged and consumption was steady. Steam consumption increased by 11%, driven primarily by a change in the product mix which resulted in more steam consumed for sterilizing processes. Energy optimization and a focus on energy efficiency is an important part of the strategy toward 2020.

The primary increase was in potable water. Two unforeseen technical issues in the Cultures & Enzymes Division have challenged the positive trend curve in water performance. Chr. Hansen is not satisfied with the result and are striving to reduce consumption during the next financial year. Reducing water consumption is a high priority target in the 2020 strategy.

Waste water discharge is a function of the water consumed. Please see Note 5 for further information. Nitrogen and Biological Oxygen Demand (Total N & BOD) were within acceptable ranges. Phosphorous (Total P) was reduced by 18%. The discharge is determined by the product mix and therefore also the now-divested Flavor business. Chr. Hansen is very satisfied that it has succeeded in lowering the impact on nutrient enrichment. The Company expects to keep the same level in 2012/13.

HANSEN – ANNUAL REPORT 2011/12 – CSR 16 Note 8 Waste The solid waste generated increased by 4% compared to 2010/11. The total recycled waste declined by 3%. The specific recycling categories fluctuate considerably. More sites have new recycling fractions (plastic and metal) and other sites performed clean-up activities such as the recycling of production equipment. The decrease in the recycled paper fraction was linked to the divested flavor business. The increase in the Recycling Other fraction originates from obsolete equipment. A waste fraction moved from incineration to landfill due to new regulatory limits for moisture content, causing the landfill volume to increase. Chr. Hansen is striving to improve performance in the coming years.

Energy consumption was kept low and the energy mix did not change. Chr. Hansen is satisfied with the ongoing positive development from previous years, which has seen us increase production while keeping CO2 emissions at a steady level. The emissions are based on 2010/11 emissions factors. Unit 2011/12 2010/11 2009/10 2008/09 2007/08 CO2 ton 61,988 61,635 61,165 53,527 54,772 Note 10 Instances of environmental non-compliance Chr. Hansen received nine notices of violations of regulatory requirements in 2011/12 from the authorities. Eight related to wastewater discharge , one related to emissions to air . All notices have been handled in cooperation with the authorities, and there are no outstanding claims. Chr. Hansen recorded an additional 33 non-conformities, including accidental releases that have been reported to the authorities. Twenty-seven of these were nutrient concentrations above the waste water discharge permit limit (mainly BOD, N and P), including accidental product releases ; three were related to the handling of waste ; one was related to spills to soil . In addition, there was one non-conformity relating to dangerous goods/substances (incorrect storage of flammable goods) and one in emissions to air . No adverse effects from the non-compliances indicated above have been observed. The increase in the number of violations is primarily a result of the increased focus on reporting incidents. In 2011/12 the company received no environmental complaints from stakeholders.

HANSEN – ANNUAL REPORT 2011/12 – CSR 17 Note 11 People During 2011/12 the number of employees increased by 5% to 2,472 as of the end of the year, which equals 2,448 full-time-equivalents (FTEs). The average number of employees during 2011/12 was 2,425. In Europe, North America and South America, the number of employees increased as a result of additional activity. The greatest percentage increase was in South America (by 14%). In Asia-Pacific, Middle East & Africa, there was a slight decrease in the number of employees due to changes in the distribution setup for the products. The employee turnover rate has decreased from 13% to 10% (voluntary 7.5%; involuntary 2.7%), which lies within the target of 10-15%. Attracting and retaining the right talents is a key objective for Chr. Hansen.

HANSEN – ANNUAL REPORT 2011/12 – CSR 18 Note 12 Diversity & Inclusion Chr. Hansen has been reporting the gender ratio for the entire company for several years. In 2011/12 the gender ratio changed to 60% men and 40% women, marking an increase for women. 2011/12 was the first year where the Company reported more detailed data on diversity and inclusion, focusing on gender, nationality and age. For the first two criteria, Chr. Hansen has established concrete targets, while for the latter the Company will continue to monitor so as to maintain an optimal distribution. With regard to gender, the Company aims to achieve the same distribution at management level as within the company as a whole. The percentage is now 32% women in management compared to 40% at a company level; this requires an increase of 8% in 2020. In key positions, Chr. Hansen is aiming for at least 25% women by 2020, versus the current level of 17%. In terms of nationality, Chr. Hansen is aiming to increase the number of non-Danes in key positions from 40% currently to 55% in 2020 in the effort to become a truly global company. Diverse management teams are another focus area, where the goal is to make 80% of management teams diverse by 2020, starting from 46% in 2011/12. The strong points of a diverse organization will not fully evolve if Chr. Hansen does not embrace its role as an inclusive organization. Making sure the Company does not discriminate and promotes equal opportunities is an integrated part of this. Chr. Hansen measured inclusiveness for the first time in this year's Employee Satisfaction Survey (ESS) (see Note 13). Seven indicators are used to establish the inclusiveness index. Four indicators were already included in the survey, to which was added three new questions about discrimination and harassment, the Company's ability to value diversity, and managers' respect toward people. The index score was 80, where 75 is very good according to Ennova, the partner for ESS. The result indicates Chr. Hansen is on the right track regarding diversity and inclusion.

HANSEN – ANNUAL REPORT 2011/12 – CSR 19 Note 13 Training and performance development interview In 2011/12 the number of training days globally increased by 26%, equaling an increase of 1,605 days. The actual number is likely to be higher, due in part to the fact that Danish data only include external training to a certain extent (open enrolment courses). The total number of training days per employee was approximately 3.1, equivalent to a 21% increase per employee compared with the prior fiscal year. The increase in training days was primarily driven by a large increase in South America. The strong and persistent focus on training and development since 2006 as illustrated by the increase in the number of training days will continue in the coming years. Training and development is a strategic focus area for Chr. Hansen globally.

Chr. Hansen did not conduct the Employee Satisfaction Survey in 2010/11. The reason behind the variation in the percentage between 2011/12 and 2010/11 is that employees who are employed from November onwards do not have an official PDI with their immediate manager. This also accounts for the variation between 2009/10 and 2008/09.

HANSEN – ANNUAL REPORT 2011/12 – CSR 20 Note 14 Employee satisfaction 95% of Chr. Hansen employees globally responded to the Employee Satisfaction Survey in 2011/12, which indicates a very high level of support from the organization, i.e. voting rights are used. A score between 65 70 is fair, between 70 75 is satisfactory and above 75 is very good according to Ennova, our partner on the survey. Generally, the Company has seen a small decline in the scores, although they continue to be at a very high level. The survey indicates that loyalty as well as satisfaction and motivation is very high, in spite of the small decline from 2009/10 when the survey was last conducted. Compared to a benchmark (European Employee Index) prepared by Ennova, satisfaction is significantly higher at Chr. Hansen. The indicator for psychological work conditions ( daily work ) saw a small decline but is still at a very high level, indicating that Chr. Hansen has succeeded in striking an appropriate work-life balance. The Company also saw a small decline for the indicator for development opportunities ( professional and personal development ), but the focus on performance development and training is still recognized by our employees. The rating of immediate managers is at the same high level as in 2009/10 (80.1), and according to the benchmark prepared by Ennova the share of sterling managers is higher at Chr. Hansen than the country average.

The lost time incidents fell consistently in the categories strains, contusions and heat injuries. However, it has been noted that the severity of accidents increased a little. Chr. Hansen has had no fatal accidents. There is focus on preventive measures, safe behavior initiatives and incentive drivers such as the implementation of health and safety performance in the bonus program. The aim for 2012/13 is maintained at reducing the frequency to five accidents with absence per one million working hours. The number of occupational illnesses increased from nine to eleven in 2011/12. Muscle-skeletal disorder is the main cause for illness. The incidents have not required transfer to other jobs, either internally within Chr. Hansen or to outside companies. We are, however, monitoring the situation closely and looking at ways to reduce manual handling. Chr. Hansen did not receive any notices of violation from the authorities in 2011/12 related to health and safety, but the Company received one neighbor complaint regarding unsafe driving.

Note 17 Quality and product safety Chr. Hansen was not disapproved in any audit in 2011/12. The Company is benchmarking audit performance between the sites and measuring out the certifying body's (Bureau Veritas Certification BVC) audit findings against a Product Safety KPI. The number of customer complaints increased 2% in total numbers, but decreased 9% compared to total turnover. The operational target was a 10% decrease compared to total turnover. The historical complaint data have been cleansed after the sale of our Flavor business and inter-company complaints to make them historically comparable.
