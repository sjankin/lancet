Marcy l’Etoile, July 6, 2012 bioMérieux has a long-standing commitment to corporate social responsibility. It is thus important to us to uphold and promote the principles of the Global Compact. These principles guided many actions that we implemented during 2011. As a company dedicated to public health, bioMérieux has worked, for many years, alongside the Mérieux Foundations as well as with Institut Mérieux. We join forces to help disadvantaged populations by reinforcing their clinical biology capacities, living conditions and access to healthcare, as illustrated by our current initiatives in Haiti. bioMérieux places patients and, more broadly, people, at the heart of its activities. We have a global initiative to foster the professional fulfillment and development of our employees. Through our “BIOMÉRIEUX GOES GREEN” program, we strive to limit the impact of our activities on the environment. An integral part of the values, culture and philosophy of the Company, we established the Ethics and Compliance Program to ensure policies and practices that clearly convey, both internally and publicly, bioMérieux’s commitment to an organizational culture of ethics and integrity. Through these actions, we renew our commitment to the Global Compact and continue to engage in initiatives in the areas of Human Rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption: the four pillars underpinning the Global Compact’s principles.
