When the campaign was evaluated in 2011, 65% of the respondents were aware of the campaign, which had made a positive impression on the vast majority. TDC also helped initiate the 'Digital mirror' project involving a large school campaign aimed at increasing pupils’ awareness of the risks and dilemmas associated with the use of the internet and social media, and initiating discussions on these subjects. With this campaign, TDC contributed actively towards ensuring that young people are well-prepared to use digital media securely and safely. Finally, in 2011, we maintained our high safety level for our internet-based and mobile services, including TDC's general spam and virus filters that stop approximately 270 million spam e-mails every month before they reach our 72 TDC Group Annual Report 2011 4 customers’ inboxes. We also continued to offer advice and information on IT security to our customers through our security portal. Improved customer dialogue In 2011, we continued expanding our proactive dialogue with customers through social media such as Facebook and Climate and environment Twitter, where we invite customers and Danes in general to give us feedback on products, etc. The contact through TDC’s ambition these media is continuously increasing, and in 2011 the At TDC, we constantly work to minimise our impact on the number of people posting that they 'like' TDC on Facebook climate and environment, both in terms of impacts from our increased from 2,600 to approximately 22,000.

With 2010 as a baseline, we have therefore decided to aim for a 40% reduction of CO2 emissions by 2020. This target is in line with the most recent – and ambitious climate goals from both the EU and the Danish government. In order to achieve our ambitious target, we have implemented a number of large projects in-house. For example, we work systematically to ensure that our traditional telephony platforms are closed down and turned off as our customers migrate to other solutions. Externally, we take responsibility for our customers by signing a number of 'Codes of Conduct' that stipulate requirements for equipment that we buy from suppliers, and which is placed at customer premises. These products may contribute to society as a whole by reducing CO2 ______________________________________________________________________ 4 Compared with 2010, TDC saw a downward trend in the number of spam mails, which emissions by up to 15% by 2020. These reductions are is part of an international trend, most probably due to the closure of several so-called 'botnets'. supported by on-going technological developments. 73 TDC Group Annual Report 2011 At TDC, we continued to increase the amount of videoconferencing equipment in 2011, and now have 100 videoconference systems at our disposal. In addition, we have 500 PC licences that enable employees to connect via their own PCs and participate in video meetings no matter where they are. With this initiative, TDC has made substantial savings on transportation and therefore CO2 emissions, Employee well-being and diversity and employees avoid long days spent travelling.

Our ambition for 2012 is to be able With TDC's diversity strategy, we have devised a framework to measure and thereby control the energy consumption of for working systematically with diversity. We work each business area and each platform at a more detailed strategically with diversity to exploit the scope and variation level. of our employees' competences and create variation and innovative thinking in day-to-day work. At TDC, we also focus on our employees' well-being, and believe this is closely linked to our employees' health. Consequently, our health, safety and working environment policy has clear targets for minimising work-related accidents and long-term absence due to illness. Actions, results and objectives Diversity TDC has defined clear targets for more women in management and is committed to working with diversity in broad terms to ensure increased diversity among both executives and employees in general at TDC. For example, at year-end 2015, 33% of the top 250 managers in TDC Denmark must be women, and we will be implementing a number of initiatives to promote diversity. During 2011, we worked together with partners on developing activities for 2012 that will focus on maximising the benefits of diversity in relation to innovation. TDC also focuses on gender equality in relation to parental leave, for example with the 'Fars Kram' (Father’s Hug) scheme, which allows all fathers to take up to 13 weeks of paternity leave – an offer that more than 70% of new fathers were happy to accept in 2009, 2010 and 2011. By supporting paternity leave, this scheme also contributes 74 TDC Group Annual Report 2011 towards greater gender equality in society. Naturally, the In 2011, TDC reduced the average number of sick days for 'Father's Hug' scheme is also available to homosexual employees with long-term illnesses by 8% compared with parents, as all employees enjoy the same parental leave 2010. This result was achieved through our continued focus options. on the management’s early attention to symptoms and targeted efforts to find solutions that enable faster partFinally, in 2011, TDC has also continued its cooperation time return to work.

Employee well-being and motivation Over the past five years, general employee satisfaction has increased considerably. In 2011, TDC Group achieved an overall employee satisfaction score of 79 points (80 for TDC domestic), which represented a significant increase compared with 2010. These impressive results are due to many initiatives, e.g. a focused effort to improve employee Social partnerships well-being through good management, and the Group’s clear focus on improving customer experiences. TDC’s ambition TDC forms part of society and we are committed and keen The targeted efforts and clear prioritisation within TDC to contribute positively to its development.

Actions, results and objectives The Danish Red Cross In 2011, TDC continued its close cooperation with the Danish Red Cross that began in 2009. This partnership has focused on supporting the humanitarian efforts of the Danish Red Cross in disaster areas, and includes providing warehouse capacity at TDC for storing and maintaining emergency equipment to be sent to disaster areas around the world at short notice. At the end of 2011, TDC renewed its partnership with the Danish Red Cross for three more years, from 2012 to the end of 2014. In future, the cooperation will be extended from supporting work in disaster areas to also including activities where TDC can contribute to efforts by the Danish 75 TDC Group Annual Report 2011 Red Cross for vulnerable population groups in Denmark. This will be implemented primarily by involving TDC's core competences and resources within communication technology to create new opportunities for contact and networks for these groups. The Danish Cancer Society TDC has worked with the Danish Cancer Society for several years on a campaign using SMS texting to reduce incidences of skin cancer through information on sun protection. We have also worked together concerning research into mobile radiation in the context of the COSMOS project, which collects information on the longterm effects of mobile radiation from a number of countries. In 2011, TDC raised funds for the Danish Cancer Society by selling small 'cord controllers' for headphones and headsets shaped as the Society's logo. These practical cord controllers were sold in the TDC Shops, and the funds were donated in full in advance to the Danish Cancer Society. Denmark's Collection As in previous years, TDC contributed towards setting up and holding ‘Danmarks Indsamling’ (Denmark's Collection); a nationwide event that raises funds for specific humanitarian purposes and development projects. TDC employees volunteered and TDC technology was contributed free of charge for the fundraising event, which involves collection donations made by SMS and phone calls. In January, TDC therefore played a vital role in collecting more than DKK 87m for young people in Africa. Due to the acute drought and famine affecting the Horn of Africa, an extraordinary fundraising event was held in August 2011 under the heading 'Africa Now!'. TDC supported this event with technology and volunteer employees in the same way as for 'Denmark's Collection'. A total of DKK 110m was raised for the disaster victims. 76 TDC Group Annual Report 2011 77 YouSee and TDC in combination delivered pay-TV revenue growth of 10.6% in 2011 The number of VoD sessions grew by >300% in 2011 TDC Group Annual Report 2011 We connect Denmark Entertainment & learning Odense, Funen, Denmark TDC Group Annual Report 2011 Corporate Governance Recommendations from the Committee on Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
