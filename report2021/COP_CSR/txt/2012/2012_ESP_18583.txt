In 2011, NH Hoteles has redefined its model, size and organisation in order to manage its business more efficiently in the new competitive context. The organisational change is aimed at growing and boosting the Group’s profitability by using a more functional structure, through greater integration of the Business Units, the markets in which we operate, the hotel brands and operation models, as well as strengthening commercial, operational and management skills. We have finished the year with solid results. The main NH Hoteles figures at the close of 2011 reflect a considerable recovery compared to 2010. It is worth highlighting the strong cost-reduction policy maintained throughout the year, with particular efficiency in the latter months of 2011, as well as the intense commercial boost. This has all enabled the Group to generate an EBITDA of €202.4 million, a 37% increase compared to the previous year; the total revenue also increased by 7%, reaching €1.4 billion. I want to thank all of our employees, not only for their effort and commitment in the current climate, but also for their continued dedication to offering a quality service which has always made us stand out to our customers. In addition to this, I am pleased to announce that in 2011 we exceeded the ambitious environmental objectives that we set ourselves. Thanks to the effectiveness of all of the programmes implemented, not only has the efficiency of NH Hoteles increased but we have also made a saving of €15.1 million on the energy consumed throughout the year. We continue to incorporate improvements to the quality of our service; furthermore, customer comments have practically doubled compared to last year, reaching 210,000 due to an increase in the surveys received and the incorporation of online comments from external websites. Also in 2011, our new Corporate Website was launched with the aim of offering global, transparent and effective communication to our stakeholders who are connected to NH in different ways, both with regard to our service offering and to our performance at all levels. Another of the year’s milestones was the approval of the new NH Hoteles Code of Conduct which covers all of the stakeholders and sets guidelines relating to each of Mariano Pérez Claver, them, strengthening our commitment to act in line with the most demanding ethical Chairman of NH Hoteles principles. As such, we promote trust and responsibility to everyone who shares our values and standards.

For this reason, we have developed a global indicator system that will enable us to measure the social impact of the actions in progress. We continue to work to offer high-quality sustainable services with the spirit of leadership that we are known for, in order to continue being the sector’s leaders in sustainability and boost the Company’s maximum performance.
