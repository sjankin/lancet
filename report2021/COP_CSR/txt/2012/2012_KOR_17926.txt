The project seeks to minimize the amounts of energy POSCO E&C‚Äôs buildings consume by developing and applying new techniques for minimizing energy losses as well as new and renewable sources of energy. The project has so far led to the development of new, more efficient building facades, indoor temperature control techniques, new and renewable energy, and smart systems. POSCO E&C invested 12.3% of the total R&D budget and Ecological Preservation into developing environment-friendly techniques and products. Of the 116 new techniques of steel building materials, construction, machinery, and electric  technology developed, the company applied 66 to its new projects.
