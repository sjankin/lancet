In effect, for 2011, Essilor anticipated the publication of the Grenelle II Act, by beginning to progressively include in its non-financial report the entities consolidated financially in the group, starting with those that are significant because of the number of employees. Note that Essilor, until 2011, wanted to integrate only the entities in which the group exercised daily direct operational control. The 2011 perimeter includes the addition of two recent, major acquisitions: Satisloh and FGX International, the joint-venture Nikon-Essilor in Japan, the GKB entity in India, Polylite in Taiwan and Chemiglas and Essilor in South Korea. These changes raised the reporting perimeter from 92.2% in 2010 to 95.1% in 2011 et and the scope of gross reporting from 58.4% in 2010 to 68.9% in 2011.

This policy is operation generally applied to raw materials and the various key products or services used in the composition or production of corrective lenses. The Group also generates significant business flows with its suppliers of generally consumable products and local services, on a quasi exclusive base for all purchases out of the scope of this central referencing. The centrally referenced local product distributors also benefit from the proximity of the group, resulting in a balanced situation.

In 2011, the first two categories were calculated and translated into tons of CO2 equivalent emitted, which are provided under EN 17. A second evaluation of emissions of CO2 equivalent from tertiary transportation was done in 2011 over a perimeter that includes a measurement of direct fllows to the end customers of six, high-volume prescription laboratories in the world, and the flows from the last kilometre of the prescription labs in France and the United States.. This perimeter will be increased again in 2012 for the first pertinent publication. The emissions related to professional travel recorded for a population of about 1500 people, 700 of whom are considered major travelers are also provided under EN 17. The geographic and infrastructure differences among the countries and continents does not allow extrapolation of the partial results obtained to a larger perimeter with sufficient reliability. This type of measurement will therefore be extended to other categories. The use of corrective lenses does not require any energy source. Their end of life impact is negligible.

The source of our data came from monthly monitoring of the content of greenhouse gases from EDF's production which this company has published every month since 2002, using the ACV method. For 2011, Essilor decided to change the source of this data and, for the first time, use the conversion factors published by the International Energy Agency. At the time of the annual reporting, only the data published in the IEA Statistics 2010 Edition were available. The average value for France (Average 06-08) was used, which is 86 grams CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour (87 in 2006 / 90 in 2007 / 83 in 2008). It was applied to the total consumption of the entities that report consumption. The use of this new conversion factor along contributed to an increase of 72% in the calculations (86/50). ► Likewise, since 2002, Essilor has published its Carbon Footprint using a conversion factor of 200 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour of gas for the portion of the emissions related to its gas consumption and 300 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour of fuel oil which are applied to the total consumption of the entities that report it. The source of our rounded off data comes from the guide for emission factors of ADEME, which has transferred this activity to the Association Bilan Carbone (ABC). For 2011, Essilor decided to change the source of this data by including the sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 of the GHG Protocol, while remaining faithful to the same source and continuing to round off these values to the next highest value. At the time of the annual report, only the data published in the Guide to Emissions Factor Version 6.1 of June 2010 were available. The rounded-off data used retain the same conversion factor of 200 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour of gas and 300 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour of fuel oil. They have been applied to the total consumption of the entities that report it.. The use of this new factor is, therefore, neutral for the calculations. (b) The Group’s NOx and SOx emissions are negligible. This indicator is not currently part of non-financial reporting. (c) Two sulfuric acid tanks fell during transport because of a break in the pallet on which they were placed, spilling most of the content of 400 liters on the ground. Safety procedures, including evacuation of personnel and immediate calls for assistance from emergency crews, assisted by the local safety response team from Essilor were effective.

In 2011, a new opinion poll was conducted with all Essilor employees in thirty-six countries of the world, representing 30,206 people. The primary objective was to give them the opportunity to express their opinions and obtain an update of changes in their opinions since the previous three surveys. It was also designed to refine the new analyses by geographic region, seniority and managerial responsibility. This gave us a comprehensive mapping of employee opinion in 2011. Finally, it was used concretely to implement action plans as part of continuing improvement in the group's Human Resource policies, both globally and locally. It contained a question with thirty-nine points, organized on the basis of five theme, which included 15 new questions, six questions just for managers, questions specific to certain regions and/or grouped entities, five segmented questions (work place, activities, responsibilities, seniority, gender) and one open question. Space was reserved for open ideas and individuals comments. Twenty-four thousands employees completed the survey, 81%, which improved the 59% return rate from the previous survey. Returns based on regions varied from 72% to 92%. Return from managers was 22% and from non-managers 78%. The breakdown by seniority in the group reveals a significant portion of employees with less than ten years (31% with 1 to 4 years and 27% with 5 to 10 years). The satisfaction rate remained generally high, along with relations with the hierarchy, with a desire for them to show a stronger daily presence. Essilor continues to be a company considered to be committed to innovation with good growth potential. Employees often expressed a desire to improve employee motivation and we noted, without surprise, that the emerging countries in particular expressed a remarkable confidence in the future, both individual and collective. Finally, the survey shows that the actions implemented to improve the transmission of general information about the group have had a positive result, which has significantly improved since the last survey.

This does not prevent Essilor from respecting and ensuring they are respected, within its sphere of influence. Essilor pays very close attention to the selection of its local suppliers in countries considered more exposed to Human Rights challenges. The General Conditions for Purchasing, which include social, societal and environmental responsibility criteria which are considered in the evaluation of suppliers have been completed by a Charter of Responsible Purchasing which restates, among other items, the 10 principles of the Global Compact. This charter was the subject of an awareness campaign for procurement employees during 2011.

The few allegations brought to us each year which have triggered a procedure to classify incidents of discrimination, generally average two to five a year groupwide, have not been proven. There was no procedure leading to sanctions in 2011. ► in the case of the HR5 indicator, more specifically fundamental conventions No. 87 governing union freedom and the protection of union rights and No. 98 concerning the right to organize and collective bargaining. As of this date, no activity has been identified as presenting a risk in this area. ► for the indicator HR6, more specifically the fundamental conventions No. 138 on the minimum age and No. 182 on the worst forms of child labor. As of this date, no activity has been identified as presenting a risk in this area. ► for indicator HR7, more specifically the fundamental conventions No. 29 on forced labor and No. 105 on the abolition of forced labor. As of this date, no activity has been identified as presenting a risk in this area. (c) The sector in which Essilor operates is fortunately considered to be a sector in which corruption is not a characteristic challenge. This does not prevent Essilor from taking action, within its sphere of influence, against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery. A signatory to the Global Compact and member of Transparency International®, Essilor complies with, supports and promotes the UN convention against corruption. As needed, certain areas of strategic activities, including but not limited to acquisitions, are analyzed for corruption risks. This is why a negligible percentage is indicated in the table.

Following a request that has been made to us by the Essilor Group, we have performed a review allowing us to express reasonable assurance on the 2011 environmental and social performance indicators1 ( the Data ) selected by Essilor Group and identified by a symbol in the tables in Section 26.3 of the 2011 Registration Document. The conclusions below pertain only to these Data and not to all indicators contained therein. These Data were prepared under the responsibility of the Sustainable Development Department, in accordance with the reporting protocol that can be obtained from the Sustainable Development Department ( the Reporting Criteria ). The methodological note at the end of Section 26.3 of this Registration Document provides details of the methods used for collecting and calculating the published indicators. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the selected Data based on our review. Nature and extent of the assurance engagement We performed our review in accordance with ISAE 3000 and professional standards applicable in France. We implemented limited procedures leading us to express reasonable assurance that the selected Data are free of material misstatement. A higher level of assurance would have required a more extensive engagement. For the selected Data, we have:  assessed the Reporting Criteria for relevance, reliability, objectivity, understandability and completeness;  conducted interviews and surveys on the implementation of the Reporting Criteria at certain sites2 (the Entities ); and  tested the consolidated Data for consistency. The Entities selected for the Group Data account for 22% to 27% of the environmental performance Data and 17% to 35% of the social performance Data. Comments on our procedures The reporting procedure requires us to make the following comments:  for indicators relating to absenteeism and workplace accident with lost work time frequency and severity rates, greater effort is required to educate users about the reporting criteria and the systematic upload of data;  for indicators relating to the use of water and energy, in the absence of supporting documentation such as invoices, methods for estimating data are not consistent between sites. Consequently we are clarifying the reporting procedures used;  the rules for uploading certain data should be standardized. In particular, consolidation of data from entities lying within the scope of France should be done within the same IT system in order to automate calculations, store data and implement automatic consistency checks. _______________________________________________________ 1.

ESSILOR 2011 Registration Document and Annual Financial Report 241 26 APPENDICES TO THE REGISTRATION DOCUMENT Conclusion During the course of our review, it came to light that for data identified by a symbol and indicators regarding:  the rate of absenteeism, when no data was uploaded by an entity, data were based on a flat rate and not on the actual findings at the site;  workplace accident with lost work time frequency and severity rates, our checks showed that the data used to calculate these rates came from an operational management system whose scope is currently being expanded and, for the year in question, is narrower than the reporting scope of other indicators. Furthermore, the definition of days lost to accidents was not always properly implemented at the Group's sites. Based on our review and subject to the reservations expressed for the above indicators, we have not identified any other material anomalies likely to call into question the fact that the examined Data contained in Section 26.3 of this 2011 Registration Document and identified by the symbol  have been prepared in all material respects in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
