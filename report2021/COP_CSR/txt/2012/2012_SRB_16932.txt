BMS enables remote control over temperature, time schedules, statuses and alarms. BMS allows optimization of electrical energy consumption by:  Time scheduling of lightening switching on and off  Programming of desired temperature  Using part of used air for pre heating or pre cooling of fresh air  Using rest of used air for heating/cooling of condensators  Using energy from heating pumps for heating sanitary hot water In addition, Head office building is constructed with:  Aluminium windows  Self-ventilated façade  Neon light in the offices  Saving lights on the corridors Carbon Neutrality Program Bank is also involved in the Group’s Carbon Neutrality Program which is related to the offsetting of the annual carbon emission by purchasing the green certificates. The main goal of the Societe Generale Group is to offset all CO2 emissions and to define the carbon offset programme for the years to come. Societe Generale is the first bank in Serbia that will offset its annual carbon emission by purchasing green certificates. 9 I All other activities aimed to reduce the negative impact of our business to the environment has been improved constantly. Considering our direct environmental impact, we are focusing on reducing the consumption of resources by introducing new measures such as electronic archiving of documents, electronic credit approval, e – mail statements, etc Below are the Societe Generale Srbija environment data values for 2011 and 2010. Although Bank increase total energy consumption due to the opening of 15 new branches in 2011 and hiring more than 100 new employees, we remain on the same level of consumption per occupant.

Through citizenship strategy we are trying to support values which are incorporated in our business. Main Corporate Citizenship priorities:  Professional integration through education  Social Inclusion When defining the priorities we took into account the analysis of the current situation in society, stakeholders expectations and opportunities to contribute to solving problems. If we consider that in Serbia, more than 690 000 people living below the poverty line, it is evident that such a serious social problem requires engagement of all social actors, including companies. Additionally, we believe that companies can make a contribution in the fight against unemployment, especially among young people. Educational system in Serbia mismatch with market needs and that is the main reason for increasing number of young people who can’t find a suitable job, although they have university or college degree. We think that the Bank’s support for various programs of education and vocational guidance could significantly contribute to greater integration of young people in the labor market. Inclusive Academy is the program launched in 2011 in partnership with Youth with Disabilities Forum aiming to improve professional skills and employment opportunities of people with disabilities in Serbia. Inclusive Academy provide its students with career guidance and professional development through participation in a specially designed training program and educational workshops. It is important to note that most of the trainers and lecturers are our employees who volunteer in this project. They are giving the additional value to the project as volunteers, holding a lectures and workshops on the topics from their field of interest. The first group of 20 participants sucesfully finished the program, wich is split into three phases. In the first phase participants attended workshops for basic business skills such as foreign languages, computers, presentation skills, continued with specialised workshops on business, banking and finance. Finally, best participants performed intership in our bank. Program is organised twice a year, in each semester. 13 I Societe Generale Bank is the main corporate partner of the program Student Companies , run by Junior Achievement Serbia. This program helps students in their economic education and foster youth entrepreneurship through simulation of real business. Through the “Student Company” Societe Generale and Junior Achievement want to support young people in their professional development and enable them to acquire new business experience and knowledge in the field of entrepreneurship. In the frame of partnership with Junior Achievement Serbia our employees volunteer as business mentors of the student companies and jury members at student companies competitions. Within this program several events were organized during the 2011 year, including business challenges, regional competitions of students companies, and most important – National Competition of Student Companies. The best national student company represented Serbia at the European Competition. Zdravko Krunic, member of the Executive Board of Societe Generale Srbija was a jury member at the European Competition of Students Companies, held in Norway in August 2011 Citizen Act is the global business student competition related to corporate social responsibility organized by Societe Generale Group. The game enables students to improve their knowledge in the field of CSR and to provide a useful and innovative solutions to improve CSR policy of Societe Generale Group. In the last season, 500 student teams from 58 countries took part in the competition. In partnership with student organizations and centers for career development Societe Generale Srbija is actively working to promote this contest in Serbia in order to include as many of our students. Local act, team of students from the Belgrade Faculty of Economics achieved great success last year winning the third place in the finals in Paris in a very tough competition which included teams from prestigious business schools and universities around the world. 14 I Food Bank The Bank recognized poverty as one of the most important social problems in Serbia. Heaving that in mind, we have established a strategic partnership with the Food Bank Belgrade, humanitarian organization that distributes food for vulnerable groups. This partnership has been established since the foundation of the Food Bank in Serbia in 2006. and includes cross-sector cooperation, joint efforts and actions aimed to reduce poverty. For the cooperation with the Food Bank, Societe Generale Bank was awarded in 2009 with VIRTUS Corporate Philanthropy Award in the category of long-term partnership between profit and nonprofit sector In 2011 we organized food donation for the refugees collective center in Krnjaca. Also we supported big humanitarian action “Grad pobedjuje grad” Mali Veliki Ljudi is the humanitarian organisation that take care of children with disabilities. Societe Generale Serbia support this organisation since 2007. In 2011 we were the main partner of the two major actions: Humanitarian Bazaar and Santa’s Sleigh. In the frame of Humanitarian Bazaar, children with disabilities from 10 orphanages exhibited their art work in Holiday Inn hotel and Head Office of our bank. By purchasing these items, our employees and other guests donated the funds for orphanages Santa’s Sleigh is the largest New Year's action for children with disabilities, organised by charity Mali Veliki Ljudi. From 20.12.2011. to 16.01.2012. New Year’s caravan visited orphanages across Serbia and deliver presents to more than 2000 children with disabilities. Societe Generale bank was the main partner of this action and bank’s employees were involved in the action as volunteers. 15 I In 2011.we donated funds for Radionica Integracije (Integration Workshop), unique cultural center in Belgrade for people with disabilities. So far, this cultural center has organized numerous art programs, theatre performances and workshops dedicated to blind and visually impaired people and other people with disabilities. Radionica Integracije connects commitment to social integration with culture, which is in line with our strategic orientation. Women Day Donation On the occasion of the International Women’s Day, since 2006. our bank traditionally donates funds on behalf of the women employed in our bank to the organizations involved in the protection of women's rights. So far, we have donated funds for SOS Women's Center, Safe Houses, women with disabilities, fight against domestic violence etc. This action presents our commitment to gender equality and activities aimed to support fight against domestic violence. In 2011. we supported Regional Safe House in Nis in partnership with Municality of Nis Societe Generale Srbija Bulevar Zorana Đinđića 50a/b 11070 Belgrade www.societegenerale.rs 16
