HP maintains ownership of the products and ensures responsible recycling at the end of customer use. HP will also provide management of printing supplies, such as ink and paper. Examples of customers using our Imaging and Printing services include: • HP Managed Print Services redesigned and managed a customer’s entire printing operation, reducing their total printing costs. One customer realized an 11% cost reduction per page and reduced energy use by replacing 267 older printers with 165 state-of-the-art devices • HP provided an all-in-one copy, network and desktop printing service for a large customer’s retail and business operations.
