UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2012 The Swedish Export Credit Corporation (SEK) signed the UN Global Compact in 2011, a strategic initiative for businesses to align their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. As part of SEKâ€™s commitment to this initiative, we report on our activities and performance in an annual UN Global Compact Communication on Progress. This Communication on Progress covers the fiscal year 2012 and consists of this report together with our sustainability report 2012.
