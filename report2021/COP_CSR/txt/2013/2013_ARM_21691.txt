(Ameria CJSC Employment Policies And Procedures Manual) Global Compact Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor; Ameria expressly prohibits any form of retaliatory action against any staff member for filing a bona fide complaint or for assisting in a complaint inquiry. In hire of employees or performance of works, no direct or indirect restriction and no granting of direct or indirect privileges on the basis of person’s sex, race, origin, belief is permitted. Candidates are usually recruited using local, national, or international search and selection methods deemed appropriate to the needs of Ameria and the position’s location. Ameria usually posts all open positions internally. staff who believe they are qualified are urged to apply; all internal candidates are interviewed. However, in its discretion, Ameria may choose to use a different recruitment method or forgo an external search entirely. The employee hire is conducted in compliance with the applicable provisions of the labor legislation of the Republic of Armenia. Ameria’s staff is appointed by the Managing Director through the execution of the employment contract. Inaccurate non-payment of wages and excessive overtime hours are common violations. We regularly review timecard, payroll and records and verify their accuracy through worker interviews. When violations are discovered, we typically require back-payment of wages as appropriate. Labor code defines work hours. The overtime procedure has a provision for employees to sign if he/she agrees to render more than 8 hours duty. The overtime is paid. The hiring and firing policy of the group is based on the Armenian labor code. There is a system for hiring people, evaluating them, training and rewarding them on their achievements. The system applies to everyone ensuring that there are no discriminations at all. 2 The automated process of personnel evaluation is carried out using a valuation of Key Performance Indicators KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), as well as the evaluation system 360 degrees in order to identify the strengths and weaknesses and create an individual development plan for each employee. We do the evaluations twice a year based on which we revise salaries and distribute bonuses for each employee annually.

The company as a whole, work representatives of different cultures and nationalities, which is very important in terms of exchange of experience and the development of a versatile mind. We give great importance to corporate culture, traditions, values and relationships. For us it is important that each team member is aware of and understands their involvement in the process of achieving the global objectives, the ability to make a difference both in the scale of the company and the country, and to themselves. The demographic structure of the team is quite balanced with 56% female and 44% male employees; the mean age is 30 years and personnel flow is rather low 3.5%, taking into account the active growth rate of the company. Any staff with questions or concerns about any type of discrimination in the workplace is encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of their immediate manager, HR manager or the Managing Director. Staff can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal. It is Ameria's policy that all staff should be able to enjoy a work environment free from all forms of harassment. In support of this policy, Ameria expressly prohibits any form of employee harassment by another employee, supervisor, or a third party for any reason including race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability or any other status protected by applicable law. Improper interference with the ability of Ameria’s staff to perform their expected job duties will not be tolerated. Specifically, Ameria prohibits: 1. unwelcome sexual advances, 2. requests for sexual favors, 3. verbal, physical, and visual harassment.

Tree planting is aimed to support forestation and ecologically clean environment in Yerevan. The whole event was held with great enthusiasm which once again demonstrated the unity of Ameria Group’s Dream Team, commitment to common ideas, the will and desire to achieve goals in teamwork. This year we have also initiated a paper saving policy in order to print less paper as within the company as well as amongst our partners Global Compact Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; Ameria Group finances projects in the field of energy and each project is accompanied with thorough environmental impact assessment. We would like to stress that no project is financed with negative environmental impact assessment. Moreover with the support of the Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO), and DEG Deutsche Investitionsund Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH, we successfully completed the introduction and implementation of an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS). It is one of the first banks in the region to have developed and implemented an ESMS. As a result of this, FMO and DEG grant Ameriabank a certificate of appreciation, as well as a reduction in the interest rate of the facility signed between FMO, DEG and Ameriabank in December 2009. By implementing the ESMS, Ameriabank commits to comply with local and international environmental and social regulations and worldwide best practices applicable to its operations and business services. April 2010, Ameriabank started exploring the principles of environmental and social risk management: the development of an internal ESMS policy, procedures and tools, training of staff and the realization of a pilot running of the System. By July 2010, Ameriabank had adopted and integrated environmental and social risk management in all ongoing corporate lending/finance operations. Ameriabank was supported by the International consultant FI Konsult s.r.o (Czech Republic) and FMO’s Capacity Development (CD) Program. The purpose of the bank’s Environmental and Social Risk Management Policy is to create a framework and culture for understanding and managing our direct and indirect environmental and social impacts, risks and opportunities. Global Compact Principle 9: and encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Ameria CJSC develops business projects in different sectors of economy and pays special attention on the issues of environment protection. In those projects we promote usage of environmentally friendly technologies, e.g. support in establishment of state of the art hog farm in Armenia, where most recent technologies are used. An element of these technological solutions is establishment of biomass processing facilities within the farm. This will ensure availability of own electricity and heat resources for the whole farm through application of renewable energy technologies. Global Compact Principle 10: Businesses should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery. By our company’s orientation, it is clearly disseminated that no employee is allowed to deal with any corruption practice. Staff may not accept gifts or favors from any customer, supplier, applicant, client, or competitor. It is unlawful to accept anything of value in exchange for a promise to influence company's decision in the selection of an assignment, contract, vendor, or other collaborator. Ameria may accept gifts only if presented to the entire organization as a culturally-appropriate memento or token of appreciation and even then only so long as the value does not exceed USD $50 (Ameria CJSC Employment Policies And Procedures Manual). 4
