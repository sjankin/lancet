Whoever’s feet are firmly planted on the ground has a good overview of things and can act with foresight – for a successful EVN. We ensure quality and success. If you have ever stood on the wall of a dam, you know that a solid foundation provides security. Here, on the highest point of this impressive building, which stands for engineering ingenuity and performance, you have the overview you need to help shape the future. The employees at EVN allow themselves to be inspired. They are willing and motivated, competent, reliable and focused on quality. Their objective is to optimally provide all customers with energy and environmental services. One thing is certain: this attitude is what serves as the basis for the stable and ongoing growth of EVN. 2 EVN Full report 2011/12 EVN Full report 2011/12 3 Enable Key value II. EVN is the key to a bright future. Our employees do not only talk: they walk the talk, working on new, sustainable solutions. We make the future possible. Our world is in a state of transformation, and demands innovative solutions in all areas. As an internationally operating utility company with a strong base in Lower Austria, our more than 7,500 employees are working on developing new approaches to make the future more liveable – little by little. EVN knows that only those people who think in a sustainable and solution-oriented manner will enable EVN to be successful – for the well-being of its customers, its employees and its shareholders. And, in the process, EVN never loses sight of the environment from which the energy is derived. In any case, one thing is clear: EVN enables. EVN is forward looking. This is how we are ensuring a secure future for the company and its employees. 4 EVN Full report 2011/12 EVN Full report 2011/12 5 Encourage Key value III. The future belongs to whoever is brave and encourages others. A fresh way of thinking and decisive action are what make the impossible possible. We encourage people. Can one make balls emit light or even fly? Whoever says “no” without even trying might just miss an opportunity. But whoever works together with others on developing solutions and overcomes barriers can solve even the most difficult problems. That is why EVN encourages its employees to think courageously, and sometimes even unconventionally – without losing sight of the objectives of the company. And because we are only strong as a team, we ensure a great atmosphere and a positive working environment. This also means being open to what is new, and considering learning as a value. And also being able to voice constructive criticism – as well as to accept it. This requires courage – the type of courage which will lead to success for everyone. 6 EVN Full report 2011/12 EVN Full report 2011/12 7 The focus is on consolidation and solidity. We are optimistically looking ahead to the new financial year. EVN sees itself as a company bearing responsibility for society and the environment. 8 EVN Full report 2011/12 Highlights EVN presents the highlights of the 2011/12 financial year. 10 Renewable energies EVN is focusing on the massive expansion of renewable energies. 12 Security of supply EVN is investing in a reliable, secure energy supply and network quality. 14 Diversification EVN’s operational and regional diversification is a competitive edge. 16 Solid balance sheet EVN’s sound business practices and innovative strength lead to success. 18 Strong team EVN’s 7,594 employees comprise Innovative solutions for everyone. a strong team.

EVN Full report 2011/12 9 10 EVN Full report 2011/12 Renewable energies EVN is focusing on the massive development of renewable energies. The focus is on exploiting the power of water and the wind. Energy for everyone. Wind and water – two elements which have accompanied people since time immemorial. For Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, water was the symbol of the soul, and wind symbolised destiny. And how does EVN see things? We consider the elemental forces of Water is life. And gives us all new energy. water and wind to be renewable energy sources. Expanding their use is a top priority. The company’s ambitious target is to increase the long-term share of renewable energy as a proportion of the power generation mix to 50%. Today, twelve wind parks with a total output of 190 MW are already supplying environmentally-friendly electricity to more than 100,000 households. Two newly constructed wind parks, in Tattendorf and Glinzendorf, and another turbine in Markgrafneusiedl, all in our core market of Lower Austria, were connected to the power grid in this past financial year. In Bulgaria, eight turbines were commissioned at the Kavarna wind park. In total, EVN has invested a total of around EUR 200m in wind energy so far. And, in the hydropower business, EVN is relying on the operation of smallscale hydropower plants in Lower Austria, in addition to its 13% stake in 13 hydropower plants along the Inn River. In Albania, the first stage of the Ashta hydropower plant on the Drin River was opened. Their ecological scorecard: 100,000 households are being supplied with renewable energy, saving 79,000 tons of CO2 each year. Sustainability – walk the talk instead of just talking. Whoever banks on renewable energies acts sustainably. Whoever considers the three dimensions ‘people’, ‘environment’ and ‘economy’ as a holistic whole and makes an effort to reconcile divergent interests, acts in a future-oriented manner. Whoever embodies and lives the principles of sustainability in day-to-day business operations has recognised the signs of the times. This is what EVN and its employees stand for.

In the 2011/12 financial year, EVN generated revenue of EUR 2,846.5m in spite of a difficult business environment, a rise of 4.3% from the previous year. In the energy business, higher energy sales due to the historically coldest winter on record and higher end customer prices in South Eastern Europe led to a revenue increase of 5.2%. In the environmental services business, revenue fell by 3.3% compared to the prior-year level as a result of the lower project implementation volume. In spite of the higher revenue, EBITDA fell by 3.6% to EUR 458.0m. This development can be mainly attributed to the increase in the item “Electricity purchases and primary energy expenses” related to the higher procurement costs for energy, as well as the allocation to a provision for impending losses in connection with the marketing of EVN’s own electricity production. Depreciation and amortisation, characterised by one-off effects both during the year under review and in the prior-year period, fell by 0.6% to EUR 251.3m. As a consequence of these developments, the results from operating activities were down 7.0% from the previous year, to EUR 206.7m. The financial results, which could be improved by 26.8% to EUR 53.0m, reflected a EUR 21.8m increase in the income from investments, which more than compensated for the lower interest balance. Whereas the profit before income tax decreased by 1.6% from the previous year to EUR 259.7m, the Group net profit was up 1.4% to EUR 194.9m, which is mainly due to the lower income tax as well as the reduced share of non-controlling interests. Earnings per share amounted to EUR 1.09 (previous year: EUR 1.08). Investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment during the 2011/12 financial year fell by 25.8%, or EUR 107.4m, to EUR 308.3m. The focus was on expanding and modernising the network infrastructure in Austria and abroad, as well as increasing power generation capacities from renewable energy sources. In the light of the challenging business environment and the previously mentioned effects, we look favourably on the business results in the 2011/12 financial year. We see them as confirmation of our strategy to increasingly focus on the consolidation of our existing core markets and the domestic market and the realisation of investment projects which have already been initiated. Our medium and long-term corporate strategy featuring a focus on renewable energy sources was confirmed during the reporting year in the light of the fundamental changes taking place in Europe’s power generation mix. Our ambitious target is to increase the share of renewable energies as a proportion of EVN’s total power generation mix to 50%. In the 2011/12 financial year we succeeded in consistently implementing this strategy. We were able to successfully conclude several projects in the energy business. In the field of wind energy, EVN’s focus was on Lower Austria. Two newly constructed wind parks in Tattendorf and Glinzendorf and a further facility at the Markgrafneusiedl wind park, completed in July 2011, are now feeding electricity into the power grid. We also acquired a wind park in Pöttelsdorf, Burgenland, which has been operating since 2006. Eight wind turbines of the Kavarna wind park in Bulgaria with a total capacity of 16 MW came on stream. On balance, EVN now boasts a total of twelve wind parks in its portfolio, with a total capacity of over 190 MW, supplying more than 100,000 households with environmentally-friendly electricity. This represents a capacity increase of 38% compared to the previous year. In recent years we have invested some EUR 200m in our wind parks. 20 EVN Full report 2011/12 Statement by the Executive Board EVN Group In the field of hydropower energy, we were able to move ahead with other projects after the acquisition of a 13% stake in the Verbund-Innkraftwerke GmbH in August 2011. Smaller hydropower plants were put into operation in Lower Austria. Since April 2012 the revitalised small-scale hydropower plant in Schaldorf on the Mürz River has been supply electricity for about 1,500 households. Two historic small-scale hydropower plants were acquired on the Erlauf River, providing electricity to around 200 households. In Northern Albania the first section of the Ashta hydropower plant along the Drin River was opened after about 30 months of construction work. The second section will likely come on stream in March 2013. With a total capacity of 53 MW, the power station will generate about 240m kWh of electricity each year, providing about 100,000 Albanian households with renewable energy and saving about 79,000 tons of CO2 per year. Furthermore, EVN now operates five storage and 67 run-of-river power plants in Lower Austria and Styria. With a total capacity of 111.1 MW and a standard operating capacity of 301.9 GWh, this corresponds to a capacity increase of 3.3% compared to the previous year. EVN Full report 2011/12 21 The activities in the heating business also concentrated on the expansion of natural heat projects. Two existing biomass heating plants in Waidhofen and Aschbach were acquired by EVN. In addition, EVN opened new facilities in Hagenbrunn and Langenlois and commenced construction on a biomass plants in Steyr, Amstetten and in Markt Piesting. The highly advanced combined heat and power plant in Steyr will be built in cooperation with Energie AG Oberösterreich, and will feature a thermal output of up to 20 MW and an electrical output of 5 MW. Starting in the 2012/13 heating season, it will supply approximately 12,000 households and companies with district heat and electricity from renewable biomass. At present, EVN is currently operating 63 biomass plants in Lower Austria, and is thus the largest supplier of natural heat in Austria. Following a construction period of about one year, a state-of-the-art co-generation facility in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, has been supplying about 33,600 households with heat and also feeds electricity into the power grid. In the field of photovoltaics and biogas, EVN could also achieve significant progress in the 2011/12 financial year. In May 2012, EVN and the Federal Province of Lower Austria initiated a public participation model for the photovoltaic plant at the Zwentendorf power plant site. After the expansion work has been completed, this facility will encompass 2,300 panels and generate an output of 450 kWp of environmentally-friendly solar power for the region. Due to the high demand, a further public participation model is being planned. Since the beginning of September 2012, EVN has also offered its customers products with a share of biogas, and feeds biomethane from two biogas plants which are not needed by the facilities themselves into Lower Austria’s natural gas network. In this way we have further extended the offering encompassed in EVN’s environmentally compatible portfolio. With respect to network expansion, the focus was on two projects implemented in the 2011/12 financial year. In Lower Austria, the first construction phase for the western section of the natural gas transport pipeline Westschiene was completed. In Croatia, the first gas customers in Zadar have now been served by EVN since June 2012 via the natural gas network constructed by EVN. The Environmental Services business also showed positive developments we can report about, considering that we finally did manage to enter the markets in the Czech Republic and Serbia. As a general contractor, EVN won a contract with a project volume of EUR 250.0m for the planning, refitting, modernisation and turn-key expansion of a wastewater treatment facility in Prague. EVN’s share in the project totals EUR 35.0m. In addition, EVN was awarded a contract valued at EUR 25.3m to plan, construct, finance and operate a drinking water purification plant for a municipality in Serbia and thus supply water to its 86,000 inhabitants. Following a three-year period of construction, EVN will assume responsibility for operating the facility for a period of 15 years. EVN was contracted to implement a fifth project on Cyprus, involving the refitting and expansion as well as the twelve-month operation of a wastewater purification plant in Larnaca. The project volume totals EUR 35.9m. On balance, EVN’s Environmental Services segment is currently active in 18 countries and features a corresponding project volume of about EUR 1.3 billion. In Lower Austria’s drinking water supply, EVN made further investments, and is now supplying water to half a million customers. As a result, EVN is now the second largest drinking water supplier in Austria. Our 50 years of experience in this area are convincing an increasing number of municipalities to hand over direct responsibility to us for their drinking water supply networks. On this basis, the number of customers directly supplied with water by EVN rose by close to 10% to about 79,000. 22 EVN Full report 2011/12 Statement by the Executive Board EVN Group In addition to the operational improvements in South Eastern Europe, a consolidation of our subsidiaries there also took place during the period under review. Our shareholdings in EVN Bulgaria Electrorazpredelenie AD (EVN Bulgaria EP) as well as in EVN Bulgaria Electrosnabdiavane AD (EVN Bulgaria EC) were increased in each case from 67% to a 100% stake. In September both companies, i.e. the shares of both firms, were delisted from trading on the stock exchange in Sofia. The optimisation of EVN’s financial position and the improvement of its financial flexibility comprised a further strategic priority in the reporting year 2011/12. Accordingly, a Eurobond due in December 2011 with a volume of EUR 257.4m was replaced by a ten-year bond issue in the amount of EUR 300.0m. Furthermore, two private placements were concluded for a period of 20 years, featuring a total volume of EUR 125.0m. Moreover, an existing revolving credit facility which existed since September 2006 was replaced by a new syndicated revolving credit facility with a nominal value of EUR 500.0m. This new credit facility has a maturity of five years, primarily serves as a liquidity reserve and comprises the cornerstone of a stable financing structure. In addition, EVN issued a long-term promissory note loan in the amount of EUR 121.5m in October 2012, following the reporting date of the 2011/12 financial year. In May 2012 the rating agency Moody’s confirmed the long-term credit rating of EVN as A3 (stable outlook). In contrast, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the long-term credit rating of EVN in the “Investment Grade” segment from A– to BBB+ in August 2012, but the outlook was raised from negative to stable. This solid orientation enables us to propose to you at the upcoming 84th Annual General Meeting to be held on January 17th, 2013 that a dividend of EUR 0.42 per share is to be distributed to shareholders, which enables an increase of the dividend payout ratio to 38.7%. The dividend yield amounts to 3.9% in relation to the EVN AG share price of EUR 10.84 as of September 30th, 2012. With this approach we want to ensure a steady dividend policy as well as the financing of previously initiated investment projects of EVN. Outlook: EVN’s result for the 2012/13 financial year will be significantly influenced by the persistently difficult market environment, so that our economic and energy sector expectations are dampened. No trend reversal is on the horizon with regard to forward prices for electricity, and primary energy prices remain high. In addition, economic prospects in Europe have not improved. In our South Eastern European markets, we continue to assume weak growth throughout the entire region. A further challenge will be the changed regulatory conditions for interim financing of the additional costs of renewable electricity in Bulgaria. In spite of the challenging environment, we expect Group net profit in the 2012/13 financial year to be close to the prior-year level. We will determinedly continue on our defined path, and exploit our strong operational basis in order to once again be able to assert ourselves in the marketplace in an above-average manner. We consider our broad customer base in our domestic market and the high level of customer satisfaction to be an important success factor.

In the following years, EVN expects especially the energy business to face a rather difficult business environment. In the segment of Generation, EVN needs to find the ideal reaction to the higher burdens based on the new 2013 regime of CO2 emission certificate trading as well as the changed structures of the generation market. The challenges of the network segment are found in the required high investments as forced primarily by renewable capacities and the pressure of regulation. In the segment Energy Trade and Supply, the most relevant questions remain the increased competition and stagnating demand. In the segment Energy Supply South East Europe, EVN needs to face the difficult political environment and the crude regulation for supplying energy. And in the segment Environmental Services, EVN has to react to the changed demand towards markets still not developed by EVN as well as to the difficult market environment of waste disposal. 30 EVN Full report 2011/12 Business overview — Corporate strategy EVN Group EVN environmental policy statement Minimisation of environmental impact Landscape conservation We seek to minimise the environmental impact of our In the course of its energy generation and transmission activities and thus make an important contribution to the activities, EVN pays close attention to landscape consermaintenance of the general ecological balance. vation.

Through increased efficiency, the forced expansion of renewable energy sources and waste treatment we want to make a valuable contribution to the climate protection targets of the EU, the Austrian Republic and the federal province of Lower Austria. EVN employs a flexible generation mix comprised of energy from water, heat and renewable sources. The expansion of electricity and heat generation from renewable sources is a priority for EVN. Electricity generation from thermal energy sources will continue to make an important contribution to security of supply as well as network stability and will be conducive to the integration of renewable sources in the systems.

Maria Enzersdorf, November 15th, 2012 Peter Layr Stefan Szyszkowitz Herbert Pöttschacher Spokesman of the Executive Board Member of the Executive Board Member of the Executive Board EVN Full report 2011/12 59 Report of the Supervisory Board Ladies and gentlemen! In the 2011/12 financial year, the EVN Group continued to be confronted with difficult economic and energy sector conditions. Growth of the global economy once again perceptibly weakened in the spring of 2012, and had a negative effect on the economic development of the European countries. In addition, the confidence and sovereign debt crises in the eurozone became more acute due to the increasing financing needs of banks in Southern Europe. Tensions on financial markets also increased. The economic uncertainty was reflected in the development of Europe’s energy markets, and led to a negative development of electricity prices. In spite of the challenging environment, EVN demonstrated a high level of stability in the 2011/12 financial year thanks to its business model. The Supervisory Board actively monitored and supported EVN’s strategic steps as part of its designated responsibilities. It convened four times for plenary meetings during the period under review, fulfilling the tasks and duties incumbent upon it in accordance with legal regulations and the Articles of Incorporation. The Executive Board reports provided the Supervisory Board with regular, timely and comprehensive information about all relevant aspects of the Group’s business development, including the risk situation and risk management of the company, as well as the development of key Group subsidiaries. Thus the Supervisory Board was able to continually supervise and support the Executive Board’s management activities. The advisory and control functions exercised by the Supervisory Board within the framework of open discussions with the Executive Board did not lead to any objections. Suggestions made by the Supervisory Board were taken up by the Executive Board. Main resolutions passed by the Supervisory Board Among the main decisions made by the Supervisory Board during the 2011/12 financial year were, in addition to approving the 2012/13 budget for the EVN Group, particularly the approval given to acquiring the Bulgarian government’s shareholdings in the two companies EVN Bulgaria EP and EVN Bulgaria EC. Other important issues were the renewal of the syndicated line of credit to the amount of EUR 600.0m, and establishing a financing framework totaling EUR 200.0m for refinancing measures. The Supervisory Board revised the mission statement of EVN and the EVN Code of Conduct to reflect legal changes. In the past financial year, the Supervisory Board in cooperation with the Executive Board carried out a tender for providing auditing services to EVN AG and its direct or indirect subsidiaries during the 2012/13 financial year. It also evaluated the submitted offers, and resolved to recommend to the Annual General Meeting to select KPMG Austria AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsund Steuerberatungsgesellschaft as the auditor of the company’s Financial statements and Consolidated financial statements for the 2012/13 financial year. With respect to the Generation segment, the Supervisory Board approved the acquisition of small-scale hydropower plants, in part including the distribution network acquired by EVN Netz GmbH, as well as the construction of wind park projects in the supply area of Lower Austria covered by EVN. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board also dealt with public participation models for photovoltaic plants in Lower Austria. 60 EVN Full report 2011/12 Report of the Supervisory Board With respect to the subsidiary EVN Wärme, the Supervisory Board granted approval to the Corporate governance report investments in the co-generation plant in Vösendorf and the Guntramsdorf heating plant. In the Environmental Services segment, the Supervisory Board dealt with the acquisition of municipal drinking water pipelines as well as international drinking water and water purification projects. Austrian Corporate Governance Code, Supervisory Board committees As a publicly traded company, EVN is committed to adhering to the Austrian Corporate Governance Code. The Supervisory Board resolved to apply the stipulations of the revised January 2012 version of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code to EVN as of the 2012/13 financial year. The adjustment of the provisions of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code to reflect the changes contained in Austria’s Second Stability Act is binding under this law. The Supervisory Board strives to consistently abide by the stipulations of the code pertaining to the Supervisory Board. In this regard, all rules relating to the cooperation of the Supervisory Board with the Executive Board as well as to the Supervisory Board itself are complied with except for two deviations which are correspondingly justified in the Corporate governance report. Pursuant to the requirements laid out in the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board conducted a self-evaluation of its activities during the course of the year under review. This took place in the form of a questionnaire, which primarily focused on the organisation and mode of operation of the Supervisory Board. The results of the survey were discussed at a plenary session of the Supervisory Board. In line with the requirements stipulated in the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, and the internal rules of procedure governing the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board established an Audit Committee, a Personnel Committee which simultaneously serves as a Remuneration and Nomination Committee, as well as a Working Committee. The Personnel Committee convened twice during the 2011/12 financial year, dealing with issues pertaining to the relationship of the company and the members of the Executive Board. The Working Committee held two meetings in the course of the reporting period, which in particularly dealt with the privatisation of the government’s stakes in the companies EVN Bulgaria EP and EVN Bulgaria EC, renovation work on the steam generator at the Walsum 10 power plant, approval of the joint venture model at the central wastewater purification facility in Prague, Czech Republic, as well as financing issues. The Audit Committee convened twice during the 2011/12 financial year, and mainly focused on preparing the resolution approving the annual Financial statements, the appointment and work of the certified public accountants to audit the annual accounts, as well as the company’s half-year results including the outlook for the rest of the financial year. In addition, it dealt with current developments in the business segments, and in particular discussed the internal control, audit and risk management systems. Further information on the composition and mode of operation of the Supervisory Board and its committees as well as remuneration of Supervisory Board members and guidelines the Supervisory Board has defined to ensure its independence can be found in the Corporate governance report.

Environment and sustainability As a responsible energy and environmental services provider, EVN considers the three dimensions “People”, “Environment” and “Economy” as a whole, and thus strives to achieve a balance between the requirements of different interest groups. The sustainability aspects of EVN’s business operations and the related objectives comprise an integral part of the corporate strategy. A flexible energy mix is of decisive importance for the future viability of EVN. One core element of EVN’s strategic orientation is the further development of renewable energy sources, in particular windpower and hydropower as well as biomass and photovoltaics. EVN aims to increase the share of renewable energies in its electricity generation mix to 50%. The focus is on expanding EVN’s windpower capacities, mainly in the domestic market Lower Austria. In addition, EVN is also pursuing the longterm goal of producing 40% to 60% of its electricity sales from its own power plants or electricity purchasing rights. In this way, EVN can master the balancing act between its ecological and economic responsibility, and at the same time safeguarding the energy supply.

Here, risk mitigation is achieved primarily through the use of experienced employees, regular Management report continued education and professional training programmes, efficient project management as well as the use of hedging instruments (including guarantees and insurances). Political and legal risks Changes in the regulatory environment, the exposure of major projects to political pressures as well as the tightening of requirements under environmental protection laws are the primary drivers of political and legal risks. Moreover, the existing political and economic instability in some of the markets in South and South Eastern Europe present risks that are counteracted by cooperating with local, regional, national and international government agencies and interest groups. Legal and political pressure is reduced by means of strategic partnerships for major projects, and the attendant liability rights and rights of recourse are managed on the basis of suitable corporate structures. Primary influencing factors on the medium-term to long-term development of market risks for EVN in the energy business is the energy policy and the resulting long-term development of the energy mix. Legal and litigation risks exist especially in connection with potential legal proceedings before courts and arbitral tribunals in regards to a variety of power plant projects. Financial risks EVN counteracts interest rate, exchange rate and market price risks on the basis of a comprehensive treasury strategy and accompanying organisational and methodical rules, including the daily risk analysis of use of derivative hedging instruments. EVN deals with credit and bad debt risk with credit rating monitoring and credit limit systems as well as a targeted strategy aiming at a diversification of business partners. Regular liquidity analyses, long-term and centrally managed financial planning, successful borrowing, bond and promissory note loan placements as well as hedging of the required financial resources (i.e. credit lines) enable EVN to prevent liquidity risk from materialising, despite the current market situation with high impact from the financial and sovereign debt crises.

The main reason for this improvement was the increase in income from investments by 9.9%, or EUR 9.6m, to EUR 106.7m. In turn, this is related to the higher earnings contribution from investments in equity accounted investees as well as the increased gain from other investments. There were contrary developments with respect to the income from investments in equity accounted investees. Whereas RAG provided a higher earnings contribution, up EUR 13.1m, the contribution of BEGAS, which merged into Energie Burgenland AG during the year under review, was down in a year-on-year comparison by EUR 7.5m. A lower interest balance was in contrast to a slight rise in the other financial results. In spite of the higher interest income, the interest balance was down by EUR 2.4m to EUR –1.2m due to the increased interest expense. The rise in the other financial results of EUR 1.2m to EUR –2.6m primarily resulted from changes in the market value of securities. 102 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated financial statements for 2011/12 According to International Financial Reporting Standards Consolidated statements of operations 104 Consolidated statements of comprehensive income 104 Consolidated statements of financial positions 105 Consolidated statements in changes in equity 106 Consolidated statements of cash flows 107 Segment reporting 108 Consolidated notes 110 Basis of preparation 113 Basis of consolidation 116 Accounting policies 129 Notes to the Consolidated statements of operations 134 Notes to the Consolidated statements of financial positions 150 Other information 160 Financial information on joint ventures and investments in equity accounted investees EVN’s investments 161 Auditor’s report 166 Financial statements EVN Full report 2011/12 103 Consolidated statements of operations EURm Note 2011/12 2010/11 Revenue 25 2,846.5 2,729.2 Other operating income 26 81.3 101.6 Cost of materials and services 27 –1,980.5 –1,879.7 Personnel expenses1) 28 –329.1 –319.8 Depreciation and amortisation 29 –251.3 –252.8 Other operating expenses 30 –160.1 –156.3 Results from operating activities (EBIT) 206.7 222.2 Share of profit of equity accounted investees 87.0 62.9 Gain from other investments 24.3 26.6 Interest income 30.9 37.6 Interest expense –87.9 –78.8 Other financial results –1.3 –6.5 Financial results 31 53.0 41.8 Profit before income tax 259.7 263.9 Income tax expense1) 32 –25.9 –28.8 Profit for the period 233.8 235.2 thereof profit attributable to EVN AG shareholders (Group net profit) 194.9 192.3 thereof profit attributable to non-controlling interests 38.9 42.9 Earnings per share in EUR2) 33 1.09 1.08 Dividend per share in EUR 0.423) 0.41 1) The figure for the prior year has been adjusted (see note 49.

Standards and interpretations applied for the first time Effective1) New Standards and Interpretations – – – Revised Standards and Interpretations IAS 19 Employee Benefits 1/1/20132) IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures 1/1/2011 IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards 7/1/2011 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 7/1/2011 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1/1/2011 IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction 1/1/2011 Several Annual Improvements 2009 –2010 7/1/2010 –1/1/2011 1) In accordance with the Official Journal of the EU, these standards are to be applied beginning with the financial year that starts on or after the date on which the standards become binding. 2) Early adoption in 2011/12 The first-time mandatory application of revised standards and interpretations did not have any impact on the Consolidated financial statements of EVN. 110 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated notes — Basis of preparation On the basis of the revisions to IAS 19 (IAS 19 (2011)) approved by IASB on June 16th, 2011, all revaluations of net debt from defined benefit plans (including actuarial gains and losses) must be directly recognised in equity. The revisions to IAS 19 were adopted in the EU in accordance with the Commission Regulation (EU) No 475/2012 dated June 5th, 2012. The change is thus to be applied beginning with the financial year that starts on or after January 1st, 2013. Early application is permitted, and EVN has exercised its right in this regard. Due to the revisions to IAS 19 the previously permissible deferral of actuarial gains and losses according to the corridor method, in which the actuarial gains were permitted to be recognised in profit or loss only if they amounted to 10.0% of the higher amount of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets, is no longer possible. The effects of applying the revisions to IAS 19 ahead of the stipulated effective date affect the provisions for pensions and obligations similar to pensions as well as the provision for severance payments and are presented in note 49. Non-current provisions. The following standards and interpretations have been issued by the IASB prior to the preparation of the Consolidated financial statements and have not yet approved by the EU. 2.

The impact of the amended standards and interpretations on the presentation of the Consolidated financial statements and the disclosures therein is continuously under examination. The new IFRS 9, which is part of a project for a standard to replace IAS 39, provides for a partial replacement of the previous measurement categories. This will have an impact on the Consolidated financial statements of EVN with regard to the classification and measurement of financial assets, but this impact cannot be reliably assessed as yet because the new standard is still undergoing revisions. EVN Full report 2011/12 111 IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 comprise the new consolidation package which was published by IASB in May 2011. IFRS 10 contains stipulations on preparing and presenting Consolidated financial statements, and also contains a new, uniform definition of “controlling interest”. In future, IAS 27 will only contain regulations on separate Financial statements prepared according to IFRS. IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31, and defines two forms of joint arrangements. Depending on the rights and obligations of the controlling interests in accordance with the concluded arrangements, a distinction is made between joint ventures and joint operations. In line with IFRS 11, jointly managed companies which fulfill the definition of a joint venture are required to be consolidated in accordance with the equity method. IFRS 12 regulates all disclosure requirements in one standard pertaining to interests in other entities. In a draft version of the guidelines published by the European Commission at the end of July 2012 in relation to the approval of the new consolidation standards, the latest proposed application is for financial years which begin on or after January 1st, 2014. The effects of applying the new consolidation standards are being analysed in detail. This will have an impact on the Consolidated financial statements of EVN, but this impact cannot be reliably assessed as yet. IFRS 13 was published by IASB in May 2011, and is the result of a joint project carried out by IASB and FASB with respect to a cross-standard concept on measuring fair value. The standard contains guidelines for determining fair value and as well as a standardisation and expansion of the notes to the Financial statements. The effects of applying IFRS 13 are being currently examined by the EVN Group. The following standards and interpretations have been issued prior to the preparation of the Consolidated financial statements by the IASB and have been endorsed by the EU and published in the EU Official Journal. 2. Standards and interpretations not yet effective Effective New Standards and Interpretations – – – Revised Standards and Interpretations IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income 7/1/20121) 1) In accordance with the Official Journal of the EU, these standards are to be applied beginning with the financial year that starts on or after the date on which the standards become binding. The revisions made to IAS 1 serve the purpose of more clearly presenting the increasing number of items contained under other comprehensive income. In future, a differentiation will be made between items in other comprehensive income which will subsequently be able to be reclassified in profit or loss (so-called “recycling”) and items in which such a reclassification will never take place. The revisions will lead to a corresponding adaption of the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income in the Consolidated financial statements of EVN. EVN does not expect the future first-time application of the other new standards and interpretations to have any material impact on its assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss. 112 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated notes — Basis of preparation, Basis of consolidation Basis of consolidation 3. Consolidation methods Consolidation is carried out by offsetting the acquisition cost against the proportionate, revalued net assets of the subsidiaries on the date of acquisition. All significant companies whose financial and operating policies EVN AG can directly or indirectly control (i.e. subsidiaries) are fully consolidated. This is usually the case when EVN’s voting rights exceed 50.0%, but may also apply if EVN has power of disposition and is the primary beneficiary of any economic benefit arising from the business operations of these companies or if it must bear most of the risks. In contrast, companies in which EVN AG owns more than 50.0% of the shares, but is not entitled to exercise control over their financial and operating policies due to special contractual arrangements are not fully consolidated. The initial consolidation of companies takes place as at the acquisition date or at the point in time at which EVN gains control over the given company and ends when it no longer exercises control over it. In accordance with IFRS 3, assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) are recognised at their full fair value in connection with acquisitions, irrespective of any existing non-controlling interests. Intangible assets must be recognised separately from goodwill, if it can be demonstrated that they are separable from the entity or arise from contractual or other legal rights. In applying this method, restructuring provisions may not be recognised separately within the context of the purchase price allocation. Any remaining allocated acquisition costs, which compensate the divesting company for market opportunities or developmental potential that has not been clearly identified, are recognised as goodwill in the local currency in the relevant segment. Any negative goodwill is recognised in profit and loss after a renewed measurement of the acquired company’s identifiable assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and the measurement of the acquisition cost. Any difference between the fair values and the carrying amounts are carried forward accordant to the related assets and liabilities during the subsequent consolidation. A change in the shareholding in a fully consolidated company is reported on the balance sheet as an equity transaction without recognition to profit and loss. The consolidation of joint venture companies within EnergieAllianz (joint management together with one or more companies outside of EVN) is carried out on a proportionate basis whilst companies on which EVN can directly or indirectly exert significant influence (i.e. associates) are included using the equity method. In both cases, the same principles outlined above are applied. The annual Financial statements of the associates included at equity are based on uniform accounting policies. Subsidiaries, joint venture companies as well as associates are not consolidated if their influence on EVN’s assets, liabilities, cash flows and profit and loss is considered to be immaterial, either individually or in total. These companies are reported at fair value, which generally corresponds to amortised cost. In order to assess the materiality of an investment, in each case the balance sheet Financial statements total, total non-current assets, proportional equity as well as external revenue are considered in relation to Group totals. Intra-Group balances, expenses and income as well as Intra-Group profits and losses arising in companies that are fully or proportionally included are eliminated if they are not material. The consolidation procedure for profit and loss considers the effect on income taxes as well as the recognition of deferred taxes. Impairment losses on and reversals to investments in Group companies in the companies’ separate Financial statements are eliminated in the Consolidated financial statements. 4. Scope of consolidation The scope of consolidation is established in accordance with the requirements of IAS 27. Accordingly, as at September 30th, 2012, a total of 26 domestic and 36 foreign companies (including the parent company EVN AG) were fully consolidated in the Consolidated financial statements (in the previous year, 28 domestic and 35 foreign companies were fully consolidated). A total of 33 affiliates (previous year: 35) were not consolidated due to their immaterial influence on the assets, liabilities, cash flows and profit and loss of EVN. EVN Full report 2011/12 113 EVN AG is the sole limited partner of EVN KG and, as such, participates to 100.0% in the assets and results of EVN KG. The general partner, without investment, of EVN KG is EnergieAllianz. Pursuant to an agreement regarding the management of EVN KG entered into between the shareholders of EnergieAllianz, EVN KG is proportionately consolidated (quota consolidation) in the Consolidated financial statements. EVN KG is thereby included to 100.0%, corresponding to the financial status. RBG, which is fully consolidated and in which EVN AG has an unchanged 50.03% interest, has a 100.0% stake in RAG. Due to special contractual arrangements EVN is not allowed to exert controlling influence on the company and RAG is included at equity. EconGas, in which EVN AG has an unchanged 16.51% interest, is included at equity due to special contractual arrangements that allow EVN to exert significant influence on the company. An overview of the companies included in the Consolidated financial statements is provided under EVN’s investments, starting on page 161. The scope of consolidation (including EVN AG as the parent company) developed as follows during the reporting period: Full Proportionate Equity 4.

This company assumed responsibility for administrative activities on behalf of the Bulgarian companies since October 1st, 2011, for the purpose of the proceeding unbundling in Bulgaria. During the period under review, EVN Gorna Arda Development EOOD joined the group of fully consolidated companies. The purpose of the new company is the planning, development and construction of power plants. In particular, the company is now operating as a service provider in connection with the hydropower plant project “Gorna Arda” in Bulgaria jointly planned by EVN and NEK. EVN Macedonia Elektrani DOOEL, Skopje, Macedonia, which was split off on the basis of the newly energy law effective January 1st, 2012, stipulating an unbundling of Macedonia power generating capacities, will now be included in the Consolidated financial statements of EVN as a fully consolidated company. In January 2012, EVN acquired the company Windstrom Wulkatal West GmbH with an existing wind park in Pöttelsdorf from AAG Holding GmbH. In April 2012, the company was merged with evn naturkraft Erzeugungsgesellschaft m.b.H. In March 2012, EVN took over an existing biomass heating plant in Hollabrunn, Lower Austria. In this regard FWG-Fernwärmeversorgung Hollabrunn registrierte Genossenschaft mit beschränkter Haftung was included in the scope of consolidation as a fully consolidated company. With the spin-off agreement dated September 26th, 2012, the operations of FWG-Fernwärmeversorgung Hollabrunn were integrated into EVN Wärme GmbH. Due to the immateriality of the remaining stake, FWG-Fernwärmeversorgung Hollabrunn was deconsolidated in September 2012. 114 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated notes — Basis of consolidation In order to construct a new wind park in Glinzendorf, EVN and Wien Energie founded the project company EVN-WIEN ENERGIE Windparkentwicklungsund Betriebs GmbH & Co KG, which was consolidated at equity for the first time starting in the first quarter of 2011/12. In November 2011, EVN and Energie AG Oberösterreich jointly established the two companies Bioenergie Steyr GmbH and Fernwärme Steyr GmbH for the purpose of constructing and operating a biomass heating plant and the district heating network of Steyr. EVN indirectly holds a 51.0% shareholding in Bioenergie Steyr GmbH via EVN Wärme GmbH, and a 49.0% stake in Fernwärme Steyr GmbH. Both companies are consolidated at equity in the Consolidated financial statements of EVN as of the first quarter of the 2011/12 financial year. As at February 15th, 2012, the previously fully consolidated subsidiary B.net Burgenland Telekom GmbH was retroactively merged with Kabelsignal AG as of September 30th, 2011. Furthermore, Kabelsignal AG was renamed kabelplus AG. On July 5th, 2012, the merger of BEGAS-Energie AG with Burgendländische Elektrizitätswirtschafts-Aktiengesellschaft (BEWAG) was entered into the commercial register. The companies were merged retrospective to September 30th, 2011, and BEWAG was renamed Energie Burgenland AG in September 2012. EVN has an indirect stake in Energie Burgenland AG via Burgenland Holding Aktiengesellschaft, in which EVN AG has a direct interest of 73.63%. The previously fully consolidated subsidiaries WTE Projektmanagement GmbH and WTE Denmark A/S were deconsolidated in the first quarter of 2011/12 due to the termination of their business activities. At the beginning of July EVN sold its subsidiary first facility GmbH to NÖ Hypo-Beteiligungsholding GmbH. The following fair value effects on the Consolidated statements of financial positions resulted from the business combinations and the attendant initial consolidation: 4. Impact of business combinations EURm 2011/12 2010/11 Non-current assets 10.3 33.5 Current assets 8.7 5.8 19.0 39.2 Equity 3.6 34.6 Non-current liabilities 14.0 4.0 Current liabilities 1.4 0.7 19.0 39.2 Financial statements Within the framework of a privatisation process, EVN increased its stake from 67.00% by an additional 30.75% shareholding to 97.75% in EVN Bulgaria Electrorazpredelenie AD (now EAD), Plovdiv, as well as its stake from 67.00% by 32.73% to 99.73% in EVN Bulgaria Electrosnabdiavane AD (now EAD), Plovdiv, on December 21st, 2011. On the basis of further purchases carried out via the Bulgarian Stock Exchange, EVN held a 100% stake in both companies as at end of August 2012. Both companies as well as their shares have been deregistered with the decision of the Bulgarian Supervision Commission from September 14th and September 4th, 2012, respectively, from the register kept under § 30 Section 1 (3) of the Financial Supervision Commission Act and delisted from the Bulgarian Stock Exchange. After deregistration both companies are not public companies any longer. Both companies were previously included as fully consolidated subsidiaries in the Consolidated financial statements of EVN. 5. Foreign currency translation 2011/12 All Group companies report their business transactions in foreign currencies at the average exchange rate in effect on the date of the relevant transaction. Existing monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at the balance sheet date are also translated at the average exchange rate on that date. Any resulting foreign currency gains or losses are recognised to profit or loss during the financial year. EVN Full report 2011/12 115 Similarly, the annual Financial statements of Group companies that are drawn up in foreign currencies are translated into euros using the functional currency method in accordance with IAS 21 for the purpose of preparing the Consolidated financial statements of EVN. According to that, monetary assets and liabilities of companies not reporting in euro, are reported at the average exchange rate on the balance sheet date, whereas any expenses and income are reported at the annual average rate. Currency translation differences are recorded in the currency translation reserve in equity. Currency translation differences directly recognised in equity resulted in a change in equity amounting to EUR 8.9m (previous year: EUR –2.0m). Additions and disposals are reported in all statements of changes at average exchange rates. Changes in the average exchange rates between the balance sheet date for the reporting period and the previous year, as well as differences arising from the use of average exchange rates to translate changes during the financial year, are reported separately under the item “Currency translation differences” in all statements of changes. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries is recorded at the foreign exchange rate in effect on the date of acquisition. This goodwill is subsequently allocated to the acquired company and translated at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. When a foreign company is deconsolidated, any related currency differences are recognised to profit or loss. The following key exchange rates were used for foreign currency translation: 2011/12 2010/11 5.

Accounting policies 6. Intangible assets According to IFRS 3, differences may arise in a business combination between the acquisition cost and the remeasured fair value of the equity interest held. If the difference is negative, the acquisition cost and the purchase price allocation must be reviewed. If the negative difference is reconfirmed, it must be recognised in profit or loss. Positive differences result in goodwill (regarding the treatment and impairment of goodwill in general, see note 3. Consolidation methods, and note 21. Procedures and effects of impairment tests). Acquired intangible assets are recognised at acquisition cost, less straight-line amortisation or any impairment losses, unless their useful life is classified as indefinite. Assets with a determinable limited useful life are amortised on the basis of that expected useful life, which is a period of three to eight years for software and from three to 40 years for rights. Customer relationships capitalised in a business combination and having a determinable useful life because of a potential liberalisation of the market are amortised on a 116 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated notes — Basis of consolidation, Accounting policies straight-line basis over five to 15 years. Expected useful lives and amortisation curves are determined by estimating the timing and distribution of cash inflows from the corresponding intangible assets over time. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are measured at cost and tested annually for impairment (see note 21. Procedures and effects of impairment tests), but this category of assets is of minor importance at EVN. In capitalising internally generated intangible assets, care must be taken that they meet the requirements for capitalisation under IAS 38, which distinguishes between research and development expenses. As in the previous year, no development expenses were capitalised because none met the criteria for recognition. Service concessions pursuant to IFRIC 12 were classified as intangible assets. Expenses and income were recognised at the fair value of the consideration in conformity with the percentage-of-completion method. The stage of completion was calculated in line with the cost-to-cost method. 7. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at acquisition or production cost, less straight-line depreciation and impairment losses. The acquisition or production cost also encompasses the estimated expense for demolition and disposal costs if there is an obligation to decommission or demolish plant and equipment, or restore property, at the end of the respective asset’s useful life. The present value of future related payments is capitalised along with the acquisition or production cost, and recognised in liabilities as a provision for the same amount. Production costs for internally produced fixed assets include appropriate material and manufacturing overheads in addition to the direct costs of materials and labour. Ongoing maintenance and repairs on property, plant and equipment are expensed, provided this work does not change the nature of the asset and no additional future benefits arise from it. These expenses must be retroactively capitalised as part of the acquisition or production cost if these measures enhance the value of the respective asset. If the construction of property, plant and equipment continues over an extended period of time, the assets become “qualifying assets”, for which the interest expense incurred until the asset is completed is capitalised as a part of the production cost in accordance with IAS 23. In keeping with EVN’s accounting policies, a project gives rise to a qualifying asset only if construction takes at least twelve months. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated from the time they are available for use. Depreciation for property, plant and equipment subject to wear and tear is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the relevant asset or its components. The expected economic and technical life is evaluated at each balance sheet date and adjusted if necessary. Straight-line depreciation is based on the following useful lives, which are uniform throughout the Group: Financial statements 7. Expected useful life of property, plant and equipment Years Buildings 10 –50 Transmission lines and pipelines 15 – 50 Machinery 10 – 33 Meters 5 – 40 Tools and equipment 3 – 25 When property, plant and equipment are to be sold, they are classified as assets held for sale at time the transaction is approved, if the requirements of IFRS 5 are met. If required, the asset is written down to the selling price less any costs to sell but not depreciated further until the date of disposal. As in the previous year, none of the property, plant and equipment met the criteria of IFRS 5. EVN Full report 2011/12 117 When property, plant and equipment is retired, the acquisition or production cost and accumulated depreciation are reported as a disposal. The difference between the net proceeds from the sale and the carrying value are recognised in other operating income or expenses. 8. Investments in equity accounted investees Investments in equity accounted investees are initially recognised at cost, and measured in later periods at the proportional share of amortised net assets plus any applicable goodwill. The carrying amounts are increased or decreased each year by the proportional share of net profit, distributed dividends, other changes in equity as well as fair value adjustments from a preceding business combination that are carried forward. Any goodwill included in the carrying amount is not subject to scheduled amortisation in accordance with IFRS 3 and is neither reported separately in accordance with IAS 28 nor tested annually for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. On the balance sheet date it is tested if there are sufficient internal or external signs of an impairment loss. If there are indicators of impairment, an impairment test must be carried out for investments in equity accounted investees in accordance with IAS 36 (see note 21. Procedures and effects of impairment tests). 9. Financial instruments A financial instrument is a contract which constitutes a financial asset for one company and a financial liability or an equity instrument for another company. Primary financial instruments The following measurement categories are applied by EVN: – Available for sale financial assets (“AFS”) – Loans and receivables (“LAR”) – Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss (“@FVTPL”) – Financial instruments held for trading (“HFT”) – Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost (“FLAC”) At EVN, the breakdown of primary financial instruments by classes – and the corresponding measurement categories – which IFRS 7 requires to be disclosed in the notes to the Consolidated financial statements, is as follows: 118 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated notes — Accounting policies 9. Classes and measurement categories of primary financial instruments Measurement category Current assets Other investments Investments in affiliates AFS Miscellaneous investments AFS Other non-current assets Securities @FVTPL Loans receivable LAR Lease receivables and accrued lease transactions LAR Receivables arising from derivative transactions Hedge Accounting Current assets Current receivables and other current assets Trade and other receivables LAR Receivables arising from derivative transactions Hedge Accounting Securities HFT Cash and cash equivalents Cash on hand and cash at banks LAR Non-current liabilities Non-current loans and borrowings Bonds FLAC Bank loans FLAC Other non-current liabilities Leases FLAC Accruals of financial transactions FLAC Other liabilities FLAC Liabilities arising from derivative transactions Hedge Accounting Current liabilities Current loans and borrowings FLAC Trade payables FLAC Other current liabilities Other financial liabilities FLAC Liabilities arising from derivative transactions Hedge Accounting Financial statements Primary financial instruments are recognised in the Consolidated statements of financial positions when EVN is contractually entitled to receive a means of payment or other financial assets from another party. Purchases and sales at prevailing market conditions are reported as at the settlement date. The initial valuation comprises the fair value plus transaction costs. The subsequent measurement is carried out in accordance with the classification in the above-mentioned measurement categories for which different measurement rules apply in each case. These are described in the notes to the individual items of the Consolidated statements of financial positions. Derivative financial instruments The derivative financial instruments that EVN uses include swaps, options, forwards and futures. Derivative financial instruments are reported at cost at contract conclusion, and at their fair value in subsequent periods. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined on the basis of quoted market prices, information provided by banks or EVN Full report 2011/12 119 discounting-based valuation methods. Derivative financial instruments are reported as other (current or noncurrent) assets or other (current or non-current) liabilities. The accounting of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used for hedging purposes depends on the type of hedging transaction. The fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments, which must be classified as cash flow hedging instruments under IAS 39, are recorded without recognition to profit or loss in the valuation reserve according to IAS 39. The realisation of a hedge is recognised through profit or loss. In the case of fair value hedges, the valuation of the underlying transaction is adjusted through profit or loss to reflect the amount that corresponds to the fair value of the hedged risk. The results are generally reported under the item in the Consolidated statements of operations that also contains the hedged transaction. Fluctuations in the fair value of hedges are basically offset by the fluctuations in the fair value of the hedged transactions. EVN uses primarily currency and interest rate swaps to hedge and control existing economic exchange rate and interest rate risks. EVN uses swaps, futures and forwards to limit risks in the energy sector arising from changes in commodity and product prices as well as changes related to electricity transactions. The forward and futures contracts concluded by EVN for the purchase or sale of electricity and CO2 emission certificates serve to hedge purchase prices for expected electricity deliveries or CO2 emission certificates as well as the sale prices for planned electricity production. Given that they lead to physical deliveries, these contracts do not constitute derivative financial instruments as defined in IAS 39, but instead represent executory sale and purchase agreements which, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 37, must be examined to determine the expected losses from executory contracts. 10. Other investments The item Other investments includes shares in associated companies which are not included in the Consolidated financial statements due to immateriality, as well as other investments with a stake of less than 20.0%, inasmuch as these are not consolidated at equity. These are classified in the category “AFS”. They are recognised in the Consolidated statements of financial positions at fair value based on share prices, if possible. The cost less impairment is used in those cases where the fair value cannot be determined based on comparable transactions during the respective period, and no measurement by means of discounting the expected cash flow was made because the cash flows could not be reliably determined. Unrealised profits or losses are recognised directly in equity. In the case of a significant or continuous decline in the fair value of an equity instrument held by the company which falls below the cost of acquisition, a write-down is prescribed. A “significant, continuous decline” is defined by EVN as referring to a decrease of over 20 percent over a period of nine months. When financial assets are sold, the unrealised profits or losses previously recognised directly in equity are recognised directly in income. 11. Other non-current assets Securities recorded under non-current assets are initially recognised as “@FVTPL”. These assets are recorded at cost as at the date of acquisition and at the fair value as at the balance sheet date in later periods. Changes in the fair value are recognised in the Consolidated statements of operations. Loans receivable are classified as “LAR”. Loans receivable subject to interest are reported at amortised cost whilst interest-free and low-interest loans receivable are reported at their present value. All identifiable risks are taken into consideration by means of corresponding provisions. Lease receivables and accrued lease transactions are related to the international project business of the Environmental Services segment and must be classified as finance leases according to IAS 17 in conjunction with IFRIC 4 (see note 22. Leased and rented assets). 120 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated notes — Accounting policies Receivables arising from derivative transactions are recognised at their fair values. Gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognised to profit or loss in the Consolidated statements of operations or recognised directly in equity (see note 9. Financial instruments). The measurement of primary energy reserves and miscellaneous other non-current assets is based on the acquisition or production cost or the lower net realisable value on the balance sheet date. 12. Inventories The measurement of inventories is based on the acquisition or production cost or the lower net realisable value as at the balance sheet date. For marketable inventories, these values are derived from the current market price. For other inventories, these figures are based on the expected proceeds less future production costs. Risks arising from the length of storage or reduced marketability are reflected in impairment losses based on historical data. The calculation of the usage of primary energy inventories as well as raw materials, auxiliary materials and fuels is determined using the moving average price method. The CO2 emission certificates allotted free of charge in accordance with the Austrian Emission Certificate Act are capitalised at an acquisition cost of zero based on IAS 20 and IAS 38, due to the rejection of IFRIC 3 by the European Commission. Any additional purchases of CO2 emission certificates are capitalised at cost, whereas additions to provisions for shortfalls are based on the fair value as at the balance sheet date. The cost of materials and services shown in the Consolidated statements of operations only includes expenses arising from an insufficient allotment of certificates. 13. Trade and other receivables Current receivables are generally reported at amortised cost, which is equal to the acquisition cost less impairment losses for the components of the receivables that are expected to be uncollectible. Receivables that may potentially require impairment are grouped on the basis of comparable default risk (especially the duration for which they have been outstanding) and tested together for impairment, and any applicable impairment is expensed. The impairment, which is recognised in the form of specific bad debt allowances by way of adjustment accounts, takes adequate account of expected default risks. Specific defaults result in a derecognition of the associated receivable. Amortised costs may be considered fair estimates of the current value, because the remaining time to maturity is less than one year in most cases. Exceptions are made for derivative financial instruments, which are recognised at fair value, and also for items in foreign currency, which are measured at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. 14. Securities Financial statements Current securities classified as “HFT” are measured based on their fair value. Changes in the fair value are immediately recognised in the Consolidated statements of operations. 15. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and cash at banks used for the temporary investment of unconditional liquidity. They are reported at current rates. Cash balances in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. 16. Equity In contrast to borrowings, equity is defined under IFRS as the “residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities”. Equity is thus the residual value of the entity’s assets and liabilities. Treasury shares held by EVN are not recognised as securities pursuant to IAS 32, but instead are reported at the acquisition cost of the treasury shares bought back and are offset against retained earnings. Any profit or loss resulting from the resale of the treasury shares relative to the acquisition cost raises or lowers the share premium. EVN Full report 2011/12 121 After-tax gains or losses recognised directly in equity comprise certain changes in equity that are not recognised through profit or loss as well as the related deferred taxes. For example, this position includes the currency translation reserve, unrealised gains or losses from the fair value measurement of other investments, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges as well as all remeasurements according to IAS 19. This item also encompasses the proportional share of gains and losses recognised directly in equity accounted investees. 17. Provisions Provisions for pensions and obligations similar to pensions Under the terms of a company agreement, EVN AG is obligated to pay a supplementary pension on retirement to employees who joined the company prior to December 31st, 1989. This commitment also applies to those employees who, within the context of the legal unbundling agreement for the spin-off of the electricity and natural gas networks, are now employed at EVN Netz. The amount of this supplementary pension is based on performance as well as on length of service and the amount of remuneration at retirement. In addition, EVN in any case, and as a rule the employees themselves as well, make contributions to the EVN-Pensionskasse pension fund, and the resulting claims are fully credited toward pension benefit payments. Hence the obligations of EVN toward both retired employees and prospective beneficiaries are covered in part by provisions for pensions as well as by defined contribution payments on the part of EVN-Pensionskasse. For employees who joined the company after January 1st, 1990, the supplementary company pension has been replaced by a defined contribution plan, which is financed through EVN-Pensionskasse. This pension fund invests its pension fund assets primarily in different investment funds, in accordance with the provisions of the Austrian Pension Fund Act. In addition, pension commitments to certain employees obligate EVN to make pension payments to these employees upon retirement if certain conditions are met. Provisions for obligations similar to pensions were recognised for liabilities arising from the vested claims of current employees and the current claims of retired personnel and their dependents to receive benefits in kind in the form of electricity and natural gas. The provisions for pensions and obligations similar to pensions are measured on the basis of the projected unit credit method. The expected pension payments are distributed according to the number of years of service by employees until retirement, taking expected future increases in salaries and pensions into account. The amounts of provisions are determined by an actuary on the basis of actuarial reports as at the respective balance sheet date. The measurement principles are described in note 49. Non-current provisions. All remeasurements, including at EVN only gains and losses from changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised according to IAS 19 (2011) in other comprehensive income. As in the previous year, the biometric measurement principles applicable to the provisions for pensions were determined using the Austrian pension tables, “Rechnungsgrundlagen AVÖ 2008-P – Rechnungsgrundlagen für die Pensionsversicherung – Pagler & Pagler”. Service costs and the interest portion of the addition to the provisions are reported under personnel expenses. Provision for severance payments Austrian corporations are required by law to make one-off severance payments to employees whose employment began before January 1st, 2003, if they are dismissed or when they reach the legal retirement age. The amount of such payments is based on the number of years of service and the amount of the respective employee’s remuneration at the time the severance payment is made. In Bulgaria and Macedonia, employees are entitled to severance payments on retirement, the amount of which is based on the number of years of service. With regard to severance compensation entitlements, the other employees of EVN are covered by similar social protection measures contingent on the legal, economic and tax framework of the particular country in which they work. The provision for severance payments was recognised according to actuarial principles. This provision was measured using the same parameters as the provisions for pensions and obligations similar to pensions (the measurement principles are described in note 122 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated notes — Accounting policies 49. Non-current provisions). All remeasurements, including at EVN only gains and losses from changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised according to IAS 19 (2011) in other comprehensive income. The obligation to make one-off severance payments to employees of Austrian companies whose employment commenced after December 31st, 2002 has been transferred to a defined contribution plan. The payments to this external employee fund are reported under personnel expenses. Other provisions The other provisions reflect all recognisable legal or factual commitments to third parties as at the balance sheet date, based on events which took place in the past, and where the level of the commitments and/or the precise starting point were still uncertain. In these cases it must be possible to estimate the amount of the obligation reliably. If such a reliable estimate is not possible, no provision is recognised. These provisions are recognised at the discounted amount to be paid. They are measured based on the expected value or the amount most likely to be incurred. Provisions for obligations related to service anniversary bonuses required under collective wage and company agreements are measured using the same parameters as the provisions for pensions and obligations similar to pensions. All remeasurements, including at EVN only gains and losses from changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised with respect to jubilee benefits according to IAS 19 (2011) through profit or loss. Waste disposal and land restoration requirements related to legal and perceived commitments are recorded at the present value of the expected future costs. Changes in estimated costs or the interest rate are offset against the carrying amount of the underlying asset. If the decrease in a provision exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the difference is recognised through profit and loss. Provisions for anticipated losses are recognised for the losses expected from what are known as “onerous” contracts in accordance with IAS 37. The provisions are recognised in the amount of the unavoidable outflow of resources. This is the lower of the amount resulting from performance of the contract and any compensatory payments to be made in the event of non-performance. 18. Liabilities Liabilities are reported at amortised cost, with the exception of liabilities arising from derivative financial instruments or liabilities arising from hedge accounting (see note 9. Financial instruments). Costs for the procurement of funds are considered a part of the amortised cost. Non-current liabilities are discounted by applying the effective interest method. When it comes to financial liabilities, bullet loans and borrowings with a remaining time to maturity above one year are reported as non-current, those with a remaining time to maturity under one year are disclosed under current loans and borrowings. Those parts of continuously redeemed loans and borrowings which have a remaining time to maturity under one year are not reclassified and Financial statements are thus reported under non-current loans and borrowings (for information on maturity see note 47. Non-current financial liabilities). Deferred income from network subsidies does not reduce the acquisition or production costs of the corresponding assets. They are therefore reported as liabilities in the Consolidated statements of financial positions in analogous application of IAS 20. Construction subsidies – which constitute payments made by customers as part of previous investments in network construction – represents an offset to the acquisition cost of these assets. The granting of investment subsidies generally requires an operational management structure that complies with legal requirements and has been approved by the authorities. Deferred income from network subsidies is released on a straight-line basis over the average useful life of the respective assets. 19. Revenue recognition Realisation of revenue (in general) At the balance sheet date, revenues from the end customer business are partly determined with the help of statistical procedures used in the billing systems, and accrued based on the quantities of energy and water supplied during the reporting period. Revenues are recognised when EVN has provided a billable service to the customer. EVN Full report 2011/12 123 Interest income is reported pro rata temporis using the effective interest rate of the asset. Dividends are recognised when a legal entitlement to payment arises. IFRIC 18 deals with the accounting treatment for business transactions in which a company receives from its customers an asset or cash which is then used to acquire or construct such an asset in order to provide the customer with access to a network or with an ongoing supply with goods or services. The reversals of deferred income from construction subsidies are currently recognised in other operating income. Regulatory account Electricity and natural gas network regulatory authorities define and evaluate appropriate “target revenue” from the individual market participants at regular intervals. Income which surpasses or falls below this target revenue is reported to the account of the regulatory authorities and is taken into consideration within the context of future tariff price adjustments. Due to the lack of clearly-defined legal regulations regarding the accounting approach in this case, there exists an “accounting policy choice” pertaining to the accounting treatment of the revenue surplus or shortfalls. In the case of revenue shortfalls, EVN is entitled, in accordance with legal regulations, to expect that this situation will be taken into account in defining the new tariff structure over the next regulatory period. In the case of excess revenue, EVN is required by existing legal regulations to compensate for this surplus in structuring future tariffs. Based on the framework concept of IFRS and the draft version of the standard on “rateregulated activities” from the year 2009, EVN recognises an asset under other assets or a liability under other liabilities. Depending on the period of time involved, a distinction is also made between current and non-current for these capitalised differences on the asset or liability side. In case clearly-defined rules exist in the future regarding the accounting treatment of a regulatory account, EVN will take them into consideration. Contract manufacturing Receivables from the project business (particularly BOOT models – Build. Own. Operate. Transfer.) and related sales are accounted for using the percentage of completion (PoC) method. Projects are subject to individual contractual terms that specify fixed prices. The degree of completion is determined using the cost-to-cost method. This entails recognising sales and profits at the ratio of the costs actually incurred to the estimated total costs. Reliable estimates of the total costs, the sale prices and the actual costs incurred are available. Changes in the estimated contract costs and resulting losses, if any, are recognised to the Consolidated statements of operations in the period in which they are incurred. Individual estimates of technological and financial risks that might occur during the remaining project period are made for each project, and a corresponding contingency fee is included in the estimated contract costs. Impending losses on the valuation of projects not yet invoiced are recognised immediately as an expense. Impending losses are recognised when it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed the contract revenues. 20. Income taxes and deferred taxes The income tax expense recognised for the period in the Consolidated statements of operations comprises the current income tax computed for fully consolidated companies on the basis of their taxable income and the applicable income tax rate, together with the change in deferred tax liabilities and assets. 124 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated notes — Accounting policies The following tax rates were applied for current income taxes: 20. Corporate income tax rates % 2011/12 2010/11 Headquarters Albania 10.0 10.0 Austria 25.0 25.0 Bulgaria 10.0 10.0 Croatia 20.0 20.0 Cyprus 10.0 10.0 Czech Republic 19.0 19.0 Denmark 25.0 25.0 Estonia1) 21.0 21.0 Germany 30.0 30.0 Lithuania 15.0 15.0 Macedonia2) 10.0 10.0 Montenegro 9.0 9.0 Poland 19.0 19.0 Romania 16.0 16.0 Russia 20.0 20.0 Serbia 10.0 10.0 Slovenia3) 18.0 20.0 Turkey 20.0 20.0 1) Taxes on corporate profits are levied when dividends are paid to the shareholders. Retained earnings are not taxed. 2) Taxes on corporate profits are levied when dividends are paid to the shareholders. Retained earnings are not taxed. Tax needs to be paid for non-tax-deductible expenses. 3) With 1/1/2012 the corporate tax rate was lowered from 20.0% to 18.0%. In Macedonia, only distributed profits are subject to corporate income tax, at a rate of 10.0%. Undistributed profits are not taxed. Irrespective of any distribution, however, non-tax-deductible expenses are subject to annual taxation in any case. The 2005 Tax Reform Act enacted by the Austrian parliament allows companies to establish corporate tax groups. EVN has taken advantage of this measure by establishing five such groups. EVN AG is in a corporate tax group of which NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH, St. Pölten, is the top-tier corporation. The taxable profit of the companies belonging to these groups was assigned to the respective superior group member or the group’s top-tier corporation. The group contracts include a tax apportionment that is based on the stand-alone method in order to offset the transferred taxable results. Financial statements Future changes in the tax rate are taken into account if the relevant law had already been enacted as of the date of preparation of the Consolidated financial statements. Deferred taxes are calculated using the liability method at the tax rate to be expected when short-term differences are reversed. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated and recognised for all temporary differences (i.e. differences between the carrying amounts shown in the Consolidated financial statements and in the annual Financial statements prepared for tax purposes that will balance out in future). Deferred tax assets are recognised only if it is considered probable that there will be sufficient taxable income or taxable temporary differences. Tax loss carry forwards are recognised as deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted in the Consolidated financial statements if the taxes may be offset and if they relate to the same tax authority. Deferred taxes are not recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet for temporary differences resulting from investments in equity accounted investees. EVN Full report 2011/12 125 21. Procedures and effects of impairment tests All assets fulfilling the criteria of IAS 36 are tested on the balance sheet date to determine whether there are sufficient internal or external signs of impairment. Besides scheduled depreciation and amortisation, both property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with definite useful lives must be tested for impairment solely if there are clear signs of potential impairment. In contrast, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives must be tested for impairment at least once a year. The impairment test of goodwill as well as of assets for which no expected future cash flows can be identified is based on an assessment of the cash generating units (CGUs). The CGUs that generate separate cash flows and – in case of impairment tests of goodwill – derive benefits from the synergies resulting from the given business combination must be identified for purposes of assignment. Any non-assignable consolidation differences are allocated to the CGUs Energy Supply and Trade, electricity distribution Bulgaria, heat generation and heat distribution Bulgaria, electricity distribution Macedonia and Environmental Services. The decisive criterion for classifying property, plant and equipment as a CGU is its technical and commercial ability to generate independent revenues. In the EVN Group, this definition applies to electricity and heat generation plants, electricity and natural gas distribution systems, wind parks, data transmission lines and electricity purchasing rights. In assessing impairment, the higher of the net selling price and the value in use of the CGU is compared to the carrying amount of the CGU and the carrying amount of the asset. The net selling price corresponds to the fair value less costs to sell. The value in use is determined based on the expected future cash inflows and outflows basically derived from medium term internal forecasts. These cash flows are discounted at the unchanged pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8.7%, taking into consideration specific corporate and country risks. This valuation process takes the future expected revenues into consideration as well as operating, maintenance and repair expenses. In case of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives, the condition of the respective asset must also be taken into account. The quality of the forecast data is regularly compared with actual results through a variance analysis. These findings are taken into consideration in developing the next medium-term corporate plan. If the recoverable amount is lower than the recognised carrying amount, the carrying amount must be reduced to the recoverable amount and an impairment loss must be recognised. If the carrying amount of a CGU, to which goodwill or any other asset has been allocated, exceeds the recoverable amount, the goodwill or the respective asset is written down to the resulting difference. Any further impairment is reflected in a proportional reduction of the carrying amounts of the CGU’s remaining fixed assets. The respective assets are written up if the reason for the impairment ceases to exist. The increase in the carrying amount resulting from the write-up may not exceed the amortised acquisition or production cost. In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill that was written down in connection with an impairment test may not be revalued, even if the reasons for the impairment have ceased to exist. 22. Leased and rented assets Pursuant to IAS 17, a leased asset is allocated to the lessee or lessor based on the transfer of significant risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of the asset. Non-current lease receivables within the context of the so-called BOOT model – in which a facility is built, financed and then operated on behalf of the customer for a fixed period of time, after which the plant becomes the property of the customer – are classified as finance leases in accordance with IAS 17 in conjunction with IFRIC 4, and recognised as such in the Consolidated financial statements of EVN. Assets obtained through finance leases are capitalised by the lessee at the fair value or the lower present value of the minimum lease payment, and depreciated or amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful life or the shorter contract period. Payment obligations resulting from future lease payments are reported as liabilities. Assets obtained through operating leases are attributed to the lessor. The lease payments are expensed by the lessee in equal amounts over the term of the lease. 126 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated notes — Accounting policies 23. Forward-looking statements The preparation of the Consolidated financial statements in accordance with the generally accepted IFRS accounting methods requires making estimates and assumptions that have an effect on the assets and liabilities, as well as the income and expenses, shown in the Consolidated financial statements, and on the amounts shown in the Consolidated notes. The actual values may deviate from the estimates. The assumptions and estimates are continuously reviewed. Impairment tests require estimates especially of future cash flows. Future changes in the overall situation affecting the economy, the industry or the company may reduce cash inflows and thus lead to an impairment of goodwill (see note 21. Procedures and effects of impairment tests). The measurement of the existing provisions for pensions and obligations similar to pensions as well as of the provisions for severance payments is based on assumptions relating to the discount rate, the age of retirement, life expectancy and future pension and salary increases (see note 49. Non-current provisions). Further applications of economic assumptions and estimates involve, for one, determining the useful life of non-current assets (see notes 6. Intangible assets and 7. Property, plant and equipment) as well as recognising provisions for legal proceedings and environmental protection (see note 17. Provisions) and, for another, measuring receivables and inventories (see notes 12. Inventories and 13. Trade and other receivables). All estimates are based on historical data and other assumptions considered accurate in the given circumstances. 24. Segment reporting Operating segments are identified solely on the basis of the internal organisational and reporting structure and information prepared for internal management decisions (the “management approach”). The segment breakdown into “Generation”, “Energy Trade and Supply”, “Network Infrastructure Austria”, “Energy Supply South East Europe”, “Environmental Services” and “Strategic Investments and Other Business” conforms in full to the internal reporting structure. The assessment of all segment information is consistent with IFRS. EBITDA is the primary indicator used to measure the segments’ performance internally. For each segment it represents the total net operating profit or loss before interest, taxes, amortisation of intangible assets and depreciation of fixed assets of the companies included in the segment, taking inter-segment income and expenses into account (see the section on the principle of segmentation and transfer prices for information about segment allocation and the settlement of inter-segment transactions). Financial statements EVN Full report 2011/12 127 The segments encompass the following activities: Business areas Segments Activities Energy business Generation Electricity generation from thermal sources and renewable energies at Austrian and international locations Energy Trade and Supply Sourcing of electricity and primary energy sources, trading and selling of electricity and natural gas to end customers and on wholesale markets as well as heat generation and sales Network Infrastructure Operation of regional electricity and natural gas networks as well as Austria cable TV and telecommunications networks Energy Supply Operation of electricity networks and electricity sales in Bulgaria and South East Europe Macedonia, heat generation and heat sales in Bulgaria, construction and operation of natural gas networks in Croatia, energy trading within the whole region Environmental Services Environmental Services Drinking water supply, wastewater disposal, thermal waste incineration business in Austria as well as international project business Strategic Investments and Strategic Investments and Strategic and other investments, Intra-Group services Other Business Other Business Principle of segment allocation and transfer pricing Subsidiaries are allocated directly to their respective segments. EVN AG is divided amongst the segments on the basis of cost information. The transfer prices for energy between the individual segments are based on comparable prices for special contract customers, and thus represent applicable market prices. For the remaining items, pricing is based on costs plus an appropriate mark-up. Reconciliation of segment results at the Group level Services performed between segments are eliminated in the consolidation column. The results in the “total” column are the same as in the Consolidated statements of operations. Entity-wide disclosures In accordance with IFRS 8, additional segment information must be provided for products (external revenues from customers broken down by products and services) and geographical areas (external revenues from customers and noncurrent assets broken down by geographical areas), if such information is not already included as part of the Segment reporting information about the reportable segment. Information about transactions with major external customers is required only if those transactions amount to 10.0% or more of the entity’s externally generated revenues. Because of the company’s large number of customers and diverse business activities, there are no transactions with customers that meet this criterion. Segment information is allocated by geographical area in accordance with the country of destination principle, by allocating revenues to those countries in which the service is performed. The South East Europe region comprises Bulgaria and Macedonia; Central and Eastern Europe comprises all European countries in which EVN operates other than Austria, Bulgaria and Macedonia. 128 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated notes — Accounting policies, Notes to the Consolidated statements of operations Notes to the Consolidated statements of operations 25.

Non-current provisions) The write-offs according to tax law in tax terms relate to the valuation of the equity investments held by EVN in EVN Kavarna which was carried out during the financial year (previous year: TEZ Plovdiv and Shkodra). Financial statements The effective tax rate of EVN for the 2011/12 financial year in relation to the profit before income tax amounted to 10.0% (previous year: 10.9%). The effective tax rate represents the weighted average of the effective local corporate tax rates of all consolidated subsidiaries. 33. Earnings per share Earnings per share were calculated by dividing Group net profit (= proportional share of profit attributable to EVN AG shareholders) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, i.e. 179,378,364 (previous year: 178,059,870). This figure may be diluted by so-called potential shares arising from options or convertible bonds. However, since EVN did not have such potential shares, there was no difference between basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share. Group net profit amounted to EUR 194.9m for the 2011/12 financial year (previous year: EUR 192.3m). Calculated on this basis, earnings per share totalled EUR 1.09 (previous year: EUR 1.08). EVN Full report 2011/12 133 Notes to the Consolidated statements of financial positions Assets Non-current assets The net value represents the residual book value, which equals the acquisition or production cost less accumulated depreciation or amortisation. Currency translation differences concern those amounts that arose from foreign companies’ translation of assets using different exchange rates at the beginning and at the end of the 2011/12 financial year. 34. Intangible assets Electricity procurement rights, transportation rights for natural gas pipelines and other rights (largely software licenses, the customer base of the Bulgarian and Macedonian electricity supply companies as well as B.net) were classified as other intangible assets. As at September 30th, 2012, the capitalised customer base in markets not yet deregulated were recognised as assets with an indefinite life at a total acquisition cost of EUR 24.5m (previous year: EUR 24.5m). Due to the merger of B.net to form kabelplus AG (formerly Kabelsignal AG), an impairment loss was recognised to the amount of EUR 0.3m in the 2011/12 financial year within the context of the acquisition of the B.Net brand “B.Net”, and a further impairment loss of EUR 0.2m was required (previous year: impairment loss on goodwill at TEZ Plovdiv amounting to EUR 9.2m and a reversal of impairment relating to electricity procurement rights for the Danube power plants totaling EUR 31.2m). The additions of goodwill from changes to the consolidation scope amounted to EUR 2.8m (previous year: EUR 0.0m). These resulted from the acquisition of the company FWG-Fernwärmeversorgung Hollabrunn registrierte Genossenschaft mit beschränkter Haftung. In the 2011/12 financial year, a total of EUR 1.6m (previous year: EUR 1.2m) was invested in research and development. The criteria required by IFRS to capitalise these items were not fulfilled. 34.

Property, plant and equipment Additions to property, plant and equipment included capitalised borrowing costs of EUR 6.1m (previous year: EUR 5.7m). The interest rate used for capitalisation ranged from 1.50% – 8.50% (previous year: 2.00% – 8.50%). Land and buildings contained land valued at EUR 66.2m (previous year: EUR 70.6m). As at the balance sheet date, EVN held a mortgage with a maximum value of EUR 1.8m as in the previous year. Own work capitalised during the 2011/12 financial year amounted to EUR 15.9m (previous year: EUR 17.7m). An impairment test on assets carried out in the 2011/12 financial year in line with IAS 36 resulted in recognition of an impairment loss of EUR 8.0m on the biomass pilot plant at the Dürnrohr power plant site due to unfavourable market conditions. In addition, an impairment loss of EUR 9.8m was also taken for the Kavarna wind park in Bulgaria as a result of a disadvantageous electricity tariff decision as at July 1st, 2012, and uncertainties concerning network access for further facilities. An impairment loss of EUR 5.0m was taken on other facilities (previous year: EUR 4.2m). Financial statements The item “Prepayments and equipment under construction” included EUR 202.2m (previous year: EUR 361.0m) in acquisition costs relating to equipment under construction as at the balance sheet date. For “Leased and rented equipment”, the present value of the payment obligations for the use of heating networks and heat generation plants is reported in the Consolidated statements of financial positions. The net value of these assets totalled EUR 14.7m at the balance sheet date (previous year: EUR 19.6m). The related leasing and rental liabilities were recognised under other noncurrent liabilities. The net value of property, plant and equipment pledged as collateral totalled EUR 116.6m unchanged to the previous year. EVN Full report 2011/12 135 Prepayments 35.

Investments in equity accounted investees and other investments The investments in equity accounted investees included in the Consolidated financial statements at equity are listed in the notes under the item EVN’s investments starting on page 161. All investments in equity accounted investees were recognised at their proportional share of IFRS income or loss based on an interim or annual report with a balance sheet date that does not precede the balance sheet date of EVN AG by more than three months. There were no listed market prices for the investments in equity accounted investees. The item “Total other investments” includes investments in affiliates and associates, which are not consolidated due to immateriality, as well as investments entailing a stake of less than 20.0%, provided these investments were not included at equity. Additions comprise the equity payments for STEAG-EVN Walsum, Shkodra, Devoll Hydropower, EVN-WE Wind, Bioenergie Steyr GmbH as well as Fernwärme Steyr GmbH. The item “Miscellaneous investments” included shares in listed companies with a market value of EUR 645.8m (previous year: EUR 869,4m), of which EUR 24.2m was used as collateral. The other investments included in this item of the Consolidated statements of financial positions, which amount to EUR 23.0m (previous year: EUR 23.0m) and are reported at amortised cost less impairment losses, involve shares in companies which are not traded on an active market, i.e. which are not freely tradable. EVN AG and Wiener Stadtwerke Holding AG (WSTW) entered into a syndicate agreement on September 22nd, 2010 regarding the syndication of their directly and indirectly held shares in Verbund AG and as a result of which jointly control over 26% of the voting shares in Verbund AG. Group net profit for the period did not include any income from the disposal of financial assets classified as “AFS”. In the 2011/12 financial year, impairment losses were made for investments in equity accounted investees EconGas totalling EUR 7.8m (previous year: Shkodra EUR 23.1m). Impairment losses for miscellaneous investments totalling EUR 223.6m (previous year: impairment losses of EUR 185.5m) concerned adjustments to changed fair values and share prices, which were offset against the valuation reserve according to IAS 39 after deducting deferred taxes. Group net profit for the period included EUR 0.9m (previous year: EUR 0.2m) of impairment losses of investments in affiliates. The stake in ZOV (equity attributable to EVN as at September 30th, 2012: EUR 77.3m; previous year: EUR 67.5m) was assigned to the lending banks. Financial statements EVN Full report 2011/12 137 36.

Other non-current assets Securities reported under the item “Other non-current assets” mainly consist of shares in investment funds and serve to provide coverage for the provisions for pensions and obligations similar to pensions as required under Austrian tax law. The carrying amounts correspond to the fair value as at the balance sheet date. Additions and disposals resulted from the regrouping of assets during the 2011/12 financial year. Of the loans receivable amounting to EUR 36.4m (previous year: EUR 24.4m), a total of EUR 3.5m (previous year: EUR 2.8m) had a remaining time to maturity of less than one year. Lease receivables and accrued lease transactions result from the project business within the context of BOOT models. Receivables from executory production contracts amounted to EUR 430.7m (previous year: EUR 330.8m). Together with current revenue from production orders, this value is included as part of additions to lease receivables and accrued lease transactions. These additions also include capitalised borrowing costs of EUR 0.8m (previous year: EUR 0.5m). The capitalisation interest rate was 1.58% – 6.03% (previous year: 2.42% – 5.72%). The receivables arising from derivative transactions include the positive fair values of interest and currency swaps. The remaining other non-current assets contain of EUR 5.6m the regulatory account according to Austrian regulatory provisions.

The interest components of lease payments in the 2011/12 financial year were largely reported as interest income on non-current financial assets. Current assets 38. Inventories Primary energy reserves are mainly comprised of coal supplies. The CO2 emission certificates relate exclusively to certificates previously purchased to fulfil the requirements of the Austrian Emission Certificate Act but which have not yet been used. The corresponding obligation for any shortfall in the certificates is reported under current provisions (see note 55. Current provisions). EVN Full report 2011/12 139 38.

This write-down was contrasted by write-ups amounting to EUR 2.8m (previous year: EUR 1.8m). The inventories were not subject to any limitations on disposal, nor were they subject to other encumbrances. 39. Trade and other receivables Trade accounts receivable relate mainly to electricity, natural gas and heating customers. The risk of insolvency by dubious customers was accounted for by an allowance of EUR 168.9m (previous year: EUR 159.8m). The allowance of receivables primarily concern South East Europe. Generally speaking, write-offs of receivables are only possible there once a court decision has been issued. Hence the amount of allowance increases over time due to the relatively long waiting period caused by the high number of pending court cases. Receivables from investments in equity accounted investees and affiliates arise primarily from Intra-Group transactions related to energy supplies as well as Group financing and services to non-consolidated subsidiaries. Receivables from partners within EnergieAllianz are receivables from customers, which are carried out by EnergieAllianz acting in the name of partners within EnergieAllianz. Receivables arising from derivatives mainly comprised the positive fair values of energy swaps and interest swaps. Other receivables and assets consist mainly of assets to the amount of EUR 25.3m due to regulatory requirements in the grid area of Bulgaria, receivables related to settlement payments for electricity futures, receivables from insurance as well as prepayments made. The net value of trade and other receivables pledged as collateral for own liabilities totalled EUR 23.2m so unchanged to the previous year. 39.

In addition to the Eurobond to the amount of EUR 300.0m issued in October 2011, and the planned redemption of an existing Eurobond issued in 2001 with an outstanding nominal value of EUR 257.4m, EVN also concluded the emission of two new bonds totalling EUR 125.0m in February 2012 within the context of private placements. Both of these bonds reach maturity in February 2032, and the fixed coupon was set at 4.125%. The foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of cross currency swaps. Measurement is at amortised cost. Liabilities in foreign currencies were translated at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. In accordance with IAS 39, hedged liabilities were adjusted to reflect the corresponding change in the fair value of the hedged risk in cases where hedge accounting was applied. The resulting change in bonds was largely offset by a corresponding development in the fair values of the swaps. EVN Full report 2011/12 143 The fair value was calculated on the basis of available market information on the respective bond prices and the exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. Bank loans The loans consist of borrowings from banks, which are subsidised in part by interest and redemption grants from the Austrian Environment and Water Industry Fund. The non-recourse liabilities incurred by project companies against EVN AG were EUR 344.8m at the balance sheet date (previous year: EUR 366.0m).

Income tax payments of EUR 28.9m (previous year: EUR 34.3m) were reported separately under net cash flow from operating activities. Dividends received, as well as interest received and interest paid, were allocated to gross cash flow. Cash flows from dividend payments received for the 2011/12 financial year totalled EUR 119.2m (previous year: EUR 102.6m). Interest received amounted to EUR 28.1m (previous year: EUR 33.5m), whereas interest paid totalled EUR 56.4m (previous year: EUR 53.7m). Proceeds from the disposal of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment amounted to EUR 10.4m (previous year: EUR 5.5m). These proceeds resulted in a profit of EUR 1.9m (previous year: profit of EUR 0.1m). Dividend payments of EUR 73.6m (previous year: EUR 71.8m) to EVN AG shareholders and of EUR 38.4m (previous year: EUR 33.7m) to non-controlling interests (those of RBG and BUHO) were reported under the net cash flow from financing activities.

Risk management Interest rate risk EVN defines interest rate risk as the threat posed by a negative change in prevailing interest rates, which could adversely affect interest income and expense as well as equity. In order to control interest rate risk, EVN works to achieve a balanced mix of fixed and variable-rate financial instruments. Risk is minimised through compliance with limits and hedging strategies, by entering into derivative financial instruments (see note 9. Financial instruments), as well as through ongoing monitoring of the interest rate risk. The valuation of these financial instruments distinguishes between those with fixed interest rates and those with variable interest rates. In addition to carrying out sensitivity analyses, interest rate risk is monitored by EVN by way of a daily value at risk (VaR) calculation in which VaR is calculated with a 99.0% confidence level for a holding period of one day using the variancecovariance method (delta-gamma approach) for calculation. At the balance sheet date, the VaR, taking the employed hedging instruments into account, was EUR 9.0m (previous year: EUR 4.4m). The increase in VaR compared to the previous reporting date arises from the capital market issues of EVN in the in 2011/12 financial year (a bond issue in October 2011 featuring a nominal value of EUR 300m and private placements at a nominal value of EUR 125m in February 2012). 150 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated notes — Other information Foreign exchange risk The risk of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that may affect profit or loss arises for EVN from transactions carried out in currencies other than the euro. Foreign exchange risk may become consequential for receivables, liabilities, and cash and cash equivalents that are not held in the Group’s functional currency. The most significant drivers of foreign exchange risk for EVN are the bonds issued in Japanese yen (JPY) and Swiss francs (CHF). Foreign exchange risk is managed by way of a central compilation, analysis and management of risk positions, and by hedging the bonds denominated in foreign currencies through cross currency swaps (see notes 47. Non-current loans and borrowings and 9. Financial instruments). The foreign exchange VaR as at the balance sheet date, taking the hedging instruments into account, was EUR 0.02m (previous year: EUR 0.01m). Other market risks EVN defines other market risks as the risk of price changes resulting from market fluctuations in primary energy, electricity supply and procurement, and securities. In EVN’s energy trading activities, energy trading contracts are entered into for purposes of managing price risk. Price risks result from the procurement and sale of electricity, natural gas, coal, oil, biomass, and CO2 emission certificates. Forward and future contracts and swaps are used to hedge these price risks. 58.

Sensitivity is calculated on the assumption that all other parameters remain unchanged. Furthermore, the derivatives concerned here are used as hedging instruments in the context of cash flow hedges. This examination does not include derivatives that are intended for purposes of the receipt or delivery of non-financial items in accordance with the company’s expected purchase, sale, or usage requirements (own use), and which therefore are not to be reported as financial instruments in accordance with IAS 39. Financial statements In the event of a 10.0% change in market prices at the balance sheet date, the effects of the derivatives on equity would be EUR 15.1m (previous year: EUR 16.5m). The price risk for securities results from fluctuations in the capital markets. The most significant securities positions held by EVN are its holdings of shares in Verbund AG. The price risk VaR for the Verbund AG shares held by EVN as at the balance sheet date was EUR 29.9m (previous year: EUR 38.8m). Liquidity risk The liquidity risk encompasses the risk of not being able to raise the required financial resources in order to carry out the payment of liabilities at the required due date, or to the inability to raise the liquidity needed at the expected terms and conditions. EVN minimises the risk on the basis of its short-term and long-term financial planning. In concluding financing agreements, special attention is paid to managing the terms to maturity in order to achieve a balance maturity profile and thus avoid the bundling of repayment times. Liquidity equalisation within the EVN Group is ensured by cash pooling. EVN Full report 2011/12 151 As at the balance sheet date, cash and short-term securities in the amount of EUR 165.5m were available to cover liquidity needs (previous year: EUR 201.3m). Moreover, EVN had contractually agreed and unused syndicated lines of credit at the reporting date to the amount of EUR 500.0m (previous year: unused lines of credit totalling EUR 600.0m) and contractually agreed and unused bilateral lines of credit amounting to EUR 175.0m (previous year: EUR 165.0m). Therefore the liquidity risk was extremely low. The gearing ratio as at the balance sheet date was 56.5% (previous year: 49.9%), demonstrating EVN’s sound capital structure. The nominal value of derivative financial liabilities in the financial year 2011/12 amounted to EUR 579.4m (previous year: EUR 1.103,0m).

To limit default risk, the company carries out credit assessments of its counterparties. External ratings (including Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and KSV 1870) of the counterparties are used for this purpose, and the business volume is limited in accordance with the rating and the probability of default. Sufficient collateral is required before a transaction is entered into if the partner’s credit rating is inadequate. Credit risk monitoring as the limiting of default risks is carried out for financial receivables in the treasury area (e.g. investments, financial and interest derivatives) as well as derivatives and forward transactions which, on the one hand, are concluded to hedge risks in connection with EVN’s business operations in the energy business and on the other hand, for end customers and other debtors in the company’s core business. To reduce credit risk, hedging transactions are entered into only with major-name banks with good credit ratings. EVN likewise ensures that funds are deposited at banks with the best possible creditworthiness based on international ratings. The default risk for customers is monitored separately at EVN, and customer creditworthiness is supported primarily by ratings and values derived from experience. EVN allows for credit risks by recognising specific bad debt allowances and general bad debt 152 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated notes — Other information allowances. In addition, efficient receivables management, ongoing monitoring of customer payment behaviour as well as the conclusion of credit default swaps within reasonable limits are in place in order to keep default risks to a minimum. 58.

Other non-current assets, 39. Receivables and other current assets and 40. Securities, excluding financial guarantees. For derivative financial instruments, the maximum default risk is equal to the positive fair value (see note 59. Reporting of financial instruments). The maximum risk in regard of financial guarantees is described in note 61. Other obligations and risks. 59. Reporting of financial instruments As a rule, the fair value is the same as the listed trading price as at the balance sheet date. If that price is not available, fair value is calculated using methods of financial mathematics, for example by discounting expected cash flows at the prevailing market interest rates. The fair value of shares in unlisted subsidiaries and other investments is based on discounted expected cash flows or comparable transactions. For financial instruments listed on an active market, the fair value is represented by the trading price as at the balance sheet date. For the most part, receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and current financial liabilities have short terms to maturity. For this reason, their carrying values at the balance sheet date correspond approximately to the fair values. The fair values of bonds are determined by means of the present value of the discounted future cash flows based on prevailing market interest rates.

The operative goal is to ensure the long-term continuity of the Group net profit. In individual cases, the Group also exploits opportunities that carry a higher risk but offer a larger profit. All derivative financial instruments are integrated in a risk management system as soon as the transactions are completed. This provides a daily overview of all main risk indicators. A separate staff unit has been established to monitor risk controlling and develop risk analyses based on the value-at-risk (VaR) method. The nominal values represent the non-offset totals of all the items classified as financial derivatives on the balance sheet date. These are reference values which do not provide a measure of the risk incurred by the company through the use of these financial instruments. In particular, potential risk factors include fluctuations in the underlying market parameters and the credit risk of the contracting parties. The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are recognised. Derivative financial instruments are comprised of the following: 9/30/2012 9/30/2011 59.

Significant events after the balance sheet date On October 29th, 2012, Gas Connect Austria disposed 45% of its shares in its subsidiary AGGM Austrian Gas Grid Management AG, equally to the provincial distribution companies EVN Netz GmbH, OÖ. Ferngas Netz GmbH and Gasnetz Steiermark GmbH. Gas Connect Austria and AGGM are thus increasingly focusing on cooperating with providers on the highest distribution network level. EVN successfully issued a promissory note loan to the amount of EUR 121.5m on October 30th, 2012 and thus succeeded in further strengthening the long-term financing of the EVN Group. The promissory note loan issue is divided into several tranches with terms to maturity of seven to 18 years and both variable as well as fixed interest rates. EVN Full report 2011/12 155 On October 25th, 2012, the biomass boiler of the biomass district heating plant in Steyr, a 50:50 joint venture with Energie AG Oberösterreich, was heated up for the first time. Industrial and commercial customers as well as households in the Municipality of Steyr will be supplied with environmentally-friendly district heat as of December 2012. 61. Other obligations and risks EVN has entered into long-term, fixed quantity and price agreements with e&t as well as EconGas to ensure its supplies of electricity and primary energy. The company has also concluded long-term agreements for the import of coal from Poland and Russia. The commitments EVN has entered into and the risks are comprised of the following: 61. Other obligations and risks EURm 2011/12 2010/11 Guarantees for subsidiaries in connection with energy transactions 108.4 85.4 construction projects in the Environmental Services segment 260.4 237.0 Guarantees related to the operation and construction of energy networks 7.0 6.2 power plants 491.1 533.2 Order obligations for investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 94.6 81.3 Further obligations arising from guarantees or other contractual contingent liabilities 5.8 7.7 Total 967.4 950.8 Neither provisions nor liabilities have been recognised for the above-mentioned obligations, due to the fact it was not anticipated at the time these Consolidated financial statements were prepared that these claims would actually be filed or that risks would actually materialise. The above-mentioned obligations were contrasted by corresponding recourse claims amounting to EUR 217.2m (previous year: EUR 148.5m). The item “Further obligations arising from guarantees and other contractual contingent liabilities” comprised chiefly outstanding capital contributions and loan commitments to affiliates as well as liability for affiliates’ loans. Contingent liabilities relating to guarantees for subsidiaries in connection with energy transactions are only recognised to the amount of the actual risk to EVN AG arising from those guarantees issued by e&t Energie Handelsgesellschaft mbH and now also for EconGas GmbH. This risk is measured by the changes between the stipulated price and the actual market price. Risks relating to procurement transactions only exist in the case of declining market prices, whereas risks concerning sales transactions exist on the basis of increased market prices. Accordingly, the risk may change equivalently because of changes in market prices after the balance sheet date. This risk assessment yielded a contingent liability of EUR 48.0m as at September 30th, 2012. The nominal volume of the guarantees on which this assessment is based was EUR 468.4m. As at October 31st, 2012, the market price risk was EUR 70.0m on an underlying nominal volume of EUR 468.4m. Various legal proceedings and lawsuits arising from operating activities are pending, or claims may be potentially brought against EVN in the future. The attendant risks have been analysed in relation to their probability of occurring. This assessment of risk has shown that these legal proceedings and lawsuits, individually and as a whole, do not have a material impact on the business, financial position, profit and loss or cash flow of EVN. 62. Information on transactions with related parties Pursuant to IAS 24, transactions with related parties arise on the basis of direct or indirect control, significant influence or joint management. Related parties include close family members of the respective natural person. Key management personnel and their close family members are also considered to be related parties. 156 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated notes — Other information Hence related parties include all companies in EVN’s consolidation range: the main shareholders NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH, St. Pölten, and EnBW Energie Baden-Württemberg AG, Karlsruhe, Germany, as well as people who are responsible for planning, management and the supervision of the activities of the Executive Board, especially members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, as well as their family members. A list of the Group companies can be found starting on page 161 under EVN’s investments. EVN AG is integrated into the Consolidated financial statements of EnBW Energie Baden-Württemberg AG, Karlsruhe, Germany, as an investment in equity accounted investee. All business relationships are based on prevailing market rates and conditions, and are not essentially different from supply and service relationships to other companies. Transactions with related companies Main shareholder A group and tax settlement agreement was concluded with NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH, St. Pölten, in connection with the inclusion of EVN AG in the group, in accordance with § 9 of the Austrian Corporate Tax Act. EVN AG has since included further subsidiaries in this group based on this agreement. This has resulted in liabilities of EUR 8.8m (previous year: receivables of EUR 7.1m) from NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH as at the balance sheet date. As at July 2nd, 2012, first facility GmbH was sold to NÖ Hypo Beteiligungsholding GmbH, in which NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH has an indirect stake of 70.49%. Investments in equity accounted investees Within the context of its ordinary business operations, EVN has concluded supply and service contracts with numerous associates included at equity in the Consolidated financial statements of EVN. Long-term agreements were concluded with e&t for the sale and sourcing of electricity. Long-term sourcing contracts were concluded with EconGas for natural gas. A cooperation agreement with BEGAS relating to gas-related services was terminated by both sides effective December 31st, 2011. The value of services provided to investments in equity accounted investees is as follows: 62. Transactions with investments in equity accounted investees EURm 2011/12 2010/11 Revenue 155.8 175.5 Cost of services received 777.2 722.4 Trade accounts receivable 74.8 89.6 Financial statements Trade accounts payable 21.3 7.2 Loans 11.7 – Receivables from cash pooling 0.1 0.2 Liabilities from cash pooling 0.0*) – Interest income from loans 0.2 – Interest balance from cash pooling 0.0*) 0.0*) *) Small amount Transactions with related individuals Executive Board and Supervisory Board The payments made to members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consist primarily of salaries, severance payments, pensions and the remuneration of the Supervisory Board. EVN Full report 2011/12 157 The total remuneration paid to active members of the Executive Board in the 2011/12 financial year amounted to EUR 1.4m (previous year: EUR 1.4m), payments to former members of the Executive Board or their surviving dependents totalled EUR 1.0m (previous year: EUR 1.6m). Expenses for severance payments and pensions for active members of the Executive Board totalled EUR 0.9m (previous year: due to the use of provisions income for severance payments and pensions of EUR 1.8m). Expenses for severance payments and pensions at EVN AG totalled EUR 0.8m (previous year: 0.2m) for active members of the senior management. Pension commitments for active members of the Executive Board totalled EUR 11.1m as at the balance sheet date (previous year: EUR 8.4m). This increase is particularly attributable to the adjustment of the interest rate applied to the calculation of this obligation as carried out during the year under review. The remuneration paid to the Supervisory Board in the reporting year amounted to EUR 0.1m (previous year: EUR 0.1m). The members of the Environmental and Social Responsibility Advisory Committee were paid compensation of EUR 0.1m in the year under review (previous year: EUR 0.1m). The basic principles underlying the remuneration system are presented in the remuneration report (starting at page 56), which is part of the Management Report. Transactions with other related companies Information related to Intra-Group facts are eliminated and need not be disclosed in the Consolidated financial statements. Thus business transactions of EVN with subsidiaries and joint ventures are not reported. Business transactions with non-consolidated affiliates and associates not included at equity are generally not reported due to their immateriality. Related parties can also be direct customers of a company within the EVN Group, in which business relationships exist at prevailing market rates and conditions, and which were immaterial to the total revenue of the EVN Group in the 2011/12 financial year. The items which were still open as at September 30th, 2012 were reported as trade accounts receivable. 63. Other disclosures In the EVN Group a cash pool exists to manage liquidity and optimise interest rates. A contract was concluded between EVN Finanzservice GmbH and the respective participating Group subsidiary. The modalities for cash pooling were stipulated in these agreements. No off-balance sheet transactions were carried out in the 2011/12 financial year. 64.

Auditing fees The auditing of the Consolidated financial statements of EVN for the 2011/12 financial year is carried out by KPMG Austria AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsund Steuerberatungsgesellschaft, Vienna. Total auditing and consulting costs amounted to EUR 2.1m (previous year: EUR 2.5m). 57.0% of the fees paid were for auditing and audit-related services, 33.0% for tax consulting services and 10.0% for other consulting services.

EVN Full report 2011/12 165 Auditor’s report Report on the Consolidated financial statements We have audited the accompanying Consolidated financial statements of EVN AG, Maria Enzersdorf, for the reporting period from October 1st, 2011 to September 30th, 2012. These Consolidated financial statements comprise the Statements of financial positions as at September 30th, 2012 and the Statements of operations, Statements of comprehensive income, Statements of cash flows and the Statements of changes in stockholders’ equity for the year then ended, and the notes. Management’s responsibility for the Consolidated financial statements and accounting system Management is responsible for the accounting system and for the preparation and fair presentation of these Consolidated financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the Consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Auditor’s responsibility and description of type and scope of the Statutory Audit Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with laws and regulations applicable in Austria and International Standards on Auditing, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). Those standards require that we comply with professional guidelines and that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Group’s preparation and fair presentation of the Consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion Our audit did not give rise to any objections. In our opinion, which is based on the results of our audit, the Consolidated financial statements comply with legal requirements and give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group as of September 30th, 2012 and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year from October 1st, 2011 to September 30th, 2012 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU. 166 EVN Full report 2011/12 Consolidated financial statements for 2011/12 — Auditor‘s report Report on the Management report for the Group Pursuant to statutory provisions, the Management report for the Group is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the Consolidated financial statements and as to whether the other disclosures are not misleading with respect to the Company’s position. The auditor’s report also has to contain a statement as to whether the Management report for the Group is consistent with the Consolidated financial statements and whether the disclosures pursuant to Section 243a UGB (Austrian Commercial Code) are appropriate. In our opinion, the Management report for the Group is consistent with the Consolidated financial statements. The disclosures pursuant to Section 243a UGB (Austrian Commercial Code) are appropriate.

The Report relates to the corporate responsibility data and information for all activities of EVN in the areas of power production and distribution, heat production and supply, water purification and supply and waste incineration. From a geographical standpoint, the Report covers EVN’s main activities in Austria, Bulgaria, Macedonia and other European countries controlled from Austria. Management Responsibility EVN’s management was responsible for preparing the Report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the data and information disclosed. LRQA’s responsibility was to carry out an assurance engagement on the Report in accordance with our contract with EVN. Ultimately, the Report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of EVN AG. LRQA’s Approach The assurance was undertaken against the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 2011 (GRI G3.1) and GRI’s Electric Utility Sector Supplement (EUSS). The objectives of the assurance engagement were to: – Confirm that the Report meets the requirements of GRI’s application level A and GRI’s EUSS – Validate EVN´s self-declaration for GRI G3’s application level A+ – Evaluate the reliability of EVN´s specified sustainability performance data and information. To form our conclusions, the assurance was undertaken as a sampling exercise and covered the following activities: – Reviewing the stakeholder engagement process and related information – Reviewing EVN´s CSR materiality matrix – Evaluating EVN’s material issues against our own understanding of stakeholder issues that this industry is dealing with – Understanding how EVN determines, responds to and reports on their material issues – Interviewing a selection of employees at EVN´s headquarters in Austria – Auditing EVN´s data management processes and reviewing supporting evidence made available by EVN. Note 1: The verification was undertaken at EVN´s headquarters in Maria Enzersdorf, Austria in accordance with our contract and therefore did not include verifying data back to its original sources, nor did it assess the accuracy and completeness of the data reported by individual locations. Note 2: Economic performance data were taken directly from the audited financial accounts. – Checking the use of performance data within EVN´s business decision-making processes – Confirming that the GRI index allows stakeholders to access sustainability performance indicators. Level of Assurance and Materiality Corporate Social Responsibility The opinion expressed in this Assurance Statement has been formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the Verifier. EVN Full report 2011/12 201 LRQA’s Opinion Based on LRQA’s approach, nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that the Report does not meet GRI’s application level A+ or GRI’s sector supplement requirements as we found nothing that would cause us to contradict this conclusion. It is also our opinion that EVN has not excluded any material issues and that its processes for reporting provide reliable sustainability performance data and information. LRQA’s Recommendations EVN AG should consider: – Improving the monitoring of the implementation of their CSR related activities. – Review the contents of the Report to ensure that it provides a more balanced and reasonable representation of all activities within the scope of the report, including the areas of power production and distribution, heat production and supply, water purification and supply, and waste incineration. Currently, there is a stronger emphasis on the aspect of power production and distribution as well as heat production and supply.

The actual, average credit interest – adjusted for tax effects – is used as the cost of debt, while the cost of equity corresponds with the return on a risk-free investment plus a risk markup, which is individually calculated for every company. Value-oriented and value-generated management The focus of value-oriented management is less on achieving traditional goals such as revenue or net profit, but on increasing stakeholder value, which not only takes account of the interests of shareholders but other stakeholder groups of the company. In this spirit, all investment decisions are measured according to their impact on achieving a sustainable value contribution. The main indicators used to assess the value development of EVN’s business operations are the economic value added and the rate of return on the capital employed. Value chain elements The electricity sector is divided into different phases of value creation: generation, distribution, sale and consumption.
