It was challenging for the global economy, for cooperation in Europe, for the Swedish economy, for Swedish agriculture and for Lantmännen. The global economy has been characterized by stagnation and uncertainty. Events in the U.S. always have a far-reaching impact – this is true of everything from presidential elections to poor harvests. The slight slowdown in China’s economy is clearly having an impact on global development as well, and in Europe, one crisis package has followed another. If we evaluate the growth forecasts for Lantmännen’s core markets, it is clear that we cannot count on a pacesetter from outside Sweden. From this perspective, it is easier to appreciate how the world around us affects Lantmännen and Swedish agriculture. Looking at agriculture and developments in Europe, we are witnessing consolidation on a grand scale. Among the driving forces are the announced changes In the EU’s agricultural policy, but even more so it is a consequence of agricultural commodities and foodstuffs being international merchandise. Several major mergers and acquisitions were made during the year. Within Lantmännen’s industry, Hankia of Finland was bought by DLA of Denmark for example, while acquisitions took place between German companies and several grain cooperatives merged in France. The decision of the Örkelljunga local association in to leave Lantmännen also demonstrates that competition is increasing. During the year, we saw Milko merge with Arla, and Skånemejerier sell their business to Lactalis of France. The squeezed profitability for milk producers has been discussed in different contexts, with Lantmännen playing an active role. Crop production this year has been good in many places, but another wet fall and late harvests in some areas led to a tough year. We have said it before, but positive development in both crop production and livestock farming is extremely important for Lantmännen. We require optimism, profitability and competitiveness throughout the entire value chain from field to fork. This means that Swedish laws and regulations in agriculture, food and energy in an EU context should ultimately be governed by competition on equal terms. Looking at environmental responsibility and long-term sustainability, Swedish agriculture is at the forefront by international comparison. We should be proud of what has been achieved, but we need to communicate our added value to customers and consumers more clearly. One of my and the Board’s top priorities in 2012 was to continue our efforts to put Lantmännen Lantbruk on the right track. Work in the area of “orderliness” has been successful in laying the foundation for a more proactive business and a 6 Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2012 Chairman’s comments One Lantmännen for optimism, profitability and competitiveness positive income trend.

Consequently, In the machinery sector, uncertainty in the economy has the Board has decided on a refund and final price adjustment resulted in restraint with regard to investments.

Testament to this is that Valtra ended issue of MSEK 80. the year as the most sold tractor for 2012. In the long run, The challenges we have faced during the year have been I feel that the strength of a local presence will be a powerful difficult, but plans for how we will parry and compensate for competitive advantage. Through co-location and coordination, changes give us both the time to think and the space to act. Lantmännen Maskin, Swecon and Lantmännen Lantbruk have I am entirely convinced that if Lantmännen is to develop its the opportunity to present attractive offers. In this, I also see competitiveness, over time, we must become more international. the possibility of creating attractive workplaces as one of our The importance of international cooperation becomes clear biggest challenges is linking skilled technicians to our facilities. when talking about the cost of plant breeding and feed develWithin the Energy Sector, we have focused on Lantmännen opment, but also just as much when talking about developing Agroetanol throughout the year.

Klockrike, February 2013 During the year the Board adopted a new dividend policy in which we seek to highlight the benefits of business relationBengt-Olov Gunnarson ships with agriculture-related operations. The objective is to Chairman of the Board, Lantmännen distribute the full operating income of the agriculture-related Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2012 7 President’s Overview President’s Overview Lantmännen’s income after net financial items, excluding items affecting comparability, amounted to MSEK 565 in 2012. This is lower than the MSEK 841 million we reported for 2011, and is largely due to a decline in earnings in the Machinery and Food Sectors. The Agriculture Sector performed well during the year and the Energy sector reported significantly better results than in the previous year. Through intensive efforts to improve our internal efficiency and a continuing focus on customers, innovation and competitive offerings, we have largely succeeded in parrying the difficult global financial situation which has seriously affected us during the year. Although net income for the year is lower than in the previous year, many of the implemented measures and economic adjustments have turned out well and had a positive effect on our results. In the fourth quarter, earnings were stronger than in 2011 for the first time during the year, and our main focus ahead is to create the conditions to deliver satisfactory financial results – whatever the market conditions. How our Sectors performed The Agriculture Sector’s operating income for 2012 is on a par with the previous year. This is mainly due to a very wellexecuted action program in the Swedish contribution-related operations, resulting in improved earnings during the year. A comprehensive improvement program enabled Lantmännen Lantbruk to create operational order and efficiency, and the focus is now on sharpening its offerings even more. Impressive contributions have been made by all the Sector’s employees. The Machinery Sector was seriously affected by the fall in demand in the market, both for farm machinery and construction machinery – the decline in Swedish tractor sales, for example, was 16 percent compared with the previous year – and the Sector reported a lower operating income than in 2011, which was a particularly strong year. However, in historical terms, the Sector’s results are at a high level and the return on operating capital remains good. It is also heartening that Valtra, which had major problems with deliveries from the manufacturer at the beginning of the year, managed to reclaim its position as the market leader in Sweden by the end of the year. All the Sector’s companies are working on measures to deal with and counteract the weak market, which is expected to continue in 2013. The Energy Sector’s operating income was significantly better than in the previous year, mainly due to a considerable 8 Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2012 President’s Overview improvement in earnings for Lantmännen Agroetanol.

Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2012 11 The brand The brand – a competitive strength Good food from Lantmännen Lantmännen is one of the largest agriculture, machinery, energy and food groups in the Nordic region. Our corporate brand is a guarantee of quality, credibility and a good reputation. Lantmännen means safety, security and someone to trust when customers and consumers make their choice. Being owned by Swedish farmers enhances our positive image. Lantmännen’s brand is strong. Almost all of the Swedish population has heard of Lantmännen. Lantmännen is primarily associated with agriculture and farmers, who represent care and stewardship of the land, safety, security, know-how and perseverance. Being associated with agriculture is a strength. Building the Lantmännen brand strengthens our competitiveness while providing more value added to our businesses. Our brand promise – we take responsibility from field to fork – permeates all our operations and is based on our unique values. Considerable business challenges and fierce competition make it even more crucial to stand out with strong brands Lantmännen’s unique values among a growing offering of products and services.

W for customers to make a decision. Our activities cover the entire chain from field to fork. We are committed to research and sustainable development. Our brands are a vital aspect of our offering and corporate culture and we continuously develop them to support our business. Our operations within agriculture, machinery and food mean that collectively we cover the entire chain from field to fork. With the inherent strength of being owned by farmers, and our investments in research and sustainable development, Lantmännen’s brand occupies a unique position in the market which strengthens the competitiveness of every single business. Lantmännen’s strong brand provides multiple benefits for owners. In particular, the brand drives demand for products containing grain. For the businesses within agriculture, machinery and energy, a strong brand means that they are connected to the values of long-term vision, sustainability and reliability. The more we communicate and highlight these values, the more attractive we also become as an employer. All this leads to a stronger company, employees who are more skilled, higher returns on invested capital and increased value for our owners. 12 Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2012 Healthy fiber – projects on the Healthy fiber beneficial properties of grain and fiber Properties such as cholesterol reduction, improved FibFlo is a study in intestinal transit and increased satiety are already which, together with the Karolinska Institute, known benefits of fiber.

The development of long-term sustainable grain cultivation is vitally important for the entire agricultural sector. Lantmännen is able to work with farmers and customers to drive development and demand for more sustainable grain primary produce. What does sustainability mean and what perspective is needed? Long-term sustainable agriculture will supply the world with food, energy and renewable materials. This means demand for lasting high crop yields with minimal adverse impacts. Key parameters are soil condition, climate impact and the impact on water and biodiversity.

The Group’s target rate of return depends on the composition of the business portfolio. The current business portfolio has an overall return potential of 8 percent on equity over a business cycle. Lantmännen’s equity ratio target is 40 percent. Target rate of return improved by 30 percent. Operating income for international 2012 outcomes operations and interest holdings was somewhat lower than 2011. Return on equity amounted to 3.8 (6.7) percent.

Innovation in all parts of our business plays an essential role in strengthening our brands, stimulating and satisfying new needs of customers and consumers, and increasing the proportion of profitable products. Innovation is also important to our internal efficiency work, with innovative thinking required at every stage. Good leadership is an important factor in creating motivation and attracting and retaining the right talent with the right skills. Good leadership is therefore crucial for Lantmännen’s future development. Our responsibility from field to fork and our good reputation with customers and consumers are important factors for developing our businesses. Equity ratio A number of non-financial key performance indicators are Lantmännen’s target is an equity ratio of 40 percent which is included in the benchmarking process alongside the traditional based on Lantmännen’s desired financial risk profile and reflects financial benchmarking, with key figures also produced for custhe Board’s view of long-term financial stability.

The equity ratio has improved from 32.5 percent to 41.5 percent since 2008, partly as a result of extensive work on capital efficiency.

At the same time, the ongoing recession and financial crisis are steering short-term priorities.

The process of protecting the plants goes hand in hand with a better and safer working environment. Starting in 2011, the process has also systematically included risks in the working environment that are not directly related to the plants themselves. Active preventive measures resulted in the number of reported incidents increasing from 915 in 2011 to 1,555 in 2012, which is a positive contribution to the work on preventing accidents. Environmental and supply chain risks are now also gradually being introduced into the surveys which gives us an effective comprehensive assessment. Lantmännen risk management is responsible for Lantmännen’s global insurance portfolio for property, product liability, general liability and shipping, among other things. Any damage is analyzed and preventive measures are proposed in close cooperation with insurance companies.

Private brands are increasing their market share and this difficult situation means that competition is intensifying even more. Commodity prices rose during the year, which led to price increases. Other trends and added value, such as health, quality, environment and sustainability, are also influencing market development. Continuing operational efficiency In response to the tough competitive situation in the market, we are continuing our efforts to improve operational efficiency. Costs must be constantly reduced in order to ensure competitiveness. We continue to invest in our production structure in order to increase efficiency. One such example is the efficient new production line for croissants now in place at one of our bakeries in Belgium. At the same time, we are making necessary cut-backs. We closed Lantmännen Unibake’s bakery in the German city of Verden during the year, while Lantmännen Cerealia’s unit in Lunderskov in Denmark was closed and its operations were transferred to the Vejle plant. We are also streamlining operations by adapting our organization and our working practices. Lantmännen Cerealia’s new organization was presented during the year. The changes will bring cost savings and increased efficiency. We also made changes to the organization and working practices in other business areas during the year.
