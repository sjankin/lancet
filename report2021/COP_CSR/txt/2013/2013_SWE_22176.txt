In round figures, this corresponds to two full SL buses a day. This high level of migration can also be seen in the increased figures for travel by public transport in our county. Never before have SL services had as many daily passengers as they did in 2012. On a typical weekday in winter, around 2.7 million journeys were made using general public transport, i.e. by Metro, commuter rail, light rail or bus. In addition to this, special transport services acc­oun­ ted for almost 8 200 journeys per day. This is essentially a positive trend, but subsequently results in significant requirements. As more people travel, the pressure on existing infrastructure increases. Trains and buses become more crowded, and there is need for new lines and more efficient purchasing organisation. The The year also featured preparations frequent services.

Through SL Access, we have modernised our ticketing system and made it more accessible for passengers. I intend to continue working to expand and modernise our public transport. At the same time, it is equally important to develop ideas with regard to with how both rail transport and bus and boat transport can continue to be strengthened in order to meet the needs of a growing Stockholm County.
