Business conditions and profitability on global market were strongly effected during the crisis lasting now for several years, which forced the most of companies on significant reduction of costs and previously defined plans. Anyway, our business approach and practice were not changed in times of crises, but our opinion is that in difficult times everyone should even stronger apply fairness and other right principles in own business environment. We believe that a business is successful only if the profit is gain from socially responsible business activities, not to be sacrificed for (usually short-term) financial goals only. That is why our company adhered to its principles, and the principles of Global Compact. We continuously work on improving of our market position and achieve the best possible results, but also we are aiming to be involved in improving the business environment, by conducting our business in such a manner as to respect human rights, protect our environment and respect all of the principles comprehensively summarized by Global Compact into the ten most important principles of responsible business conduct. On behalf of SOTT BADER d.o.o. I hereby state that we continue with our full support to Global Compact, making efforts towards promoting the concept of socially responsible business conduct and every single principle of Global Compact. March 2013 Chairman of the Management Board Andrej Potežica 3/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Profile 2 – Organizational profile Social Responsibility in Business Performance Social responsibility is one of the founding principles of our Company, as a general idea representing the commitment of SCOTT BADER d.o.o. to perform its activities in a fair, responsible manner and with consideration towards its business partners, employees and owners. This is also the founding principle of the founder of Scott Bader, expressed through the Commonwealth organization (employee unity), based on the decisions and acts of Ernest Bader, the founder and owner of Scott Bader in England, which today is a large international company and has companies on four continents. The founding of the SCOTT BADER Company and Group Scott Bader Company Limited was established in 1923. Ernest Bader was a Swiss emigrant who set up a merchandising venture in London in 1920 with the sole agency for Swiss celluloid in the UK. By 1932 Scott Bader had moved into manufacturing in the East End of London and in wartime 1940 evacuated to Wollaston. The factory built at Wollaston was to manufacture phenolic pastes, reclaim rubber emulsions and produce resins for paints. In 1946 Scott Bader became the first unsaturated polyester resin manufacturer in Europe with licences from America. The Commonwealth The Founders, having experienced industrial strikes and two world wars wanted to create better and peaceful human relationships by moving forward from the usual shareholder/capitalist structures in industry. So in 1951 all the share capital and therefore the ownership of the Company was transferred, free of charge, to Scott Bader Commonwealth Limited, an organisation created for that purpose with charitable status. This highly generous and imaginative act established a common trusteeship business. This means that we have no external Shareholders. All the shares are held in trust and this makes us totally independent. 4/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence The intention of the Founders was to create a radical company, its well-being entrusted to those who work in it with democratic involvement. As a result the employees enjoy many of the benefits (and responsibilities) of ownership without the right to sell the business. The responsibilities, however, is key in that each generation of employees must ensure the ongoing success of the organisation so that future generations can benefit from its continued existence. In April 2011 Scott Bader Group celebrated important jubilee – 60 years of Commonwealth, i.e. 60 years since the former Ernest Bader gave his company to employees for common management and trusteeship. Where does Scott Bader operate today? When Scott Bader became a Common Trusteeship Company it operated only in the UK. Over the last 50 years the company has expanded geographically and today has manufacturing companies not only in United Kingdom, but also in France, South Africa, Emirates and Croatia. It also has distribution companies or research centres in the Ireland, Czech Republic, France, Spain, USA, and China. It employs approximately 600 people worldwide. What is expected of Scott Bader people? The international business structure brings with it distinct challenges in operating as a common-trusteeship. All Scott Bader companies wherever their location must work to a common set of principles: Care Equality (of opportunity) Ethics Involvement No discrimination Respect (human dignity) Service 5/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Following development, organisation and very dynamic changes in business and global world in general, Scott Bader Group continuously monitor and review own policies, not moving further from main principles, those are universal and with no time limits. During year 2011, after large consultation and opinions collected all around the Group, it was agreed existing principles, respecting the past and shaping the future, to cumulate into four main values, those define all principles we apply in achieving our goals, as well as values that should be applied in the activity of each of us in the Group. Those values are (each equally important, no matter of its place when written): Commitment Responsibility Team working Fairness We believe that these principles and values would enable that in the future we also stay Partner for Excellence and Successful, Profitable and Sustainable Organisation. Commitment Team working We’re committed to the We work principles of common co-operatively and in trusteeship and making collaboration with Scott Bader a successful colleagues, customers and sustainable and suppliers to deliver organisation. excellence. Responsibility Fairness We each take personal We are fair, honest and responsibility in how we ethical in how we work with work to do the best for others and how we are Scott Bader. treated at Scott Bader. 6/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence The arrival of SCOTT BADER to Croatia Our company, named Chromos Tvornica Smola stock company at the time, started cooperating closely with the Scott Bader Group in 1999, when Scott Bader invested its financial resources through a loan as well as its own guarantees into helping the company recover and return onto the international market. It was at that time during our highly intensive cooperation that Scott Bader recognized the possibility of a complete and successful integration of the Croatian company into the Group and gained full ownership over Chromos Tvornica Smola shareholding company in 2006. With certainty and belief in the sustainability of production in Zagreb, during the same year employees were given the opportunity to apply to become members of the Commonwealth, along with the possibility of having full reports on all issues of relevance for the Group, of participating in decisions regarding profit and its distribution, electing their own Local council and including their representatives into the activities of the Commonwealth Assembly.

In the event of a downturn in trade we will consider whether circumstance make it desirable or practical to share all remaining work rather than expect any of our fellow members to be deprived of employment, even if this requires a reduction in earnings. ii. However should a study of our business reveal that it would be in its best interest to reduce or eliminate certain jobs, we will do this in the fairest and most objective way. In particular we will wherever possible offer alternative work. H We have agreed not to hold second jobs without having first sought the approval from the company. I The foundation/creation of our Commonwealth abolished the existence of Scott Bader share holders and with it the power of share ownership. For this reason we will not acquire other companies, without offering their staff Commonwealth membership as quickly as possible. J We have a responsibility to the society in which we live and believe that should we have a special talent or interest, it would be right to offer this to the wider community. Members are encouraged to engage in some to form of social or public service, however small. K Our social responsibility also extends to 1. Limiting the use of our products to applications beneficial to the community, in particular excluding specific applications used in manufacturing weapons of war 2. Reducing any harmful effects our work has on the natural environment, e.g. by rigorously avoiding the negligent discharge of pollutants 3. Constantly working towards reducing activities that waste the earth’s natural resources L As members of the Commonwealth we support and commit to the principles of the Commonwealth and will do our best to live these out in both our working and private lives 25/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence THE FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF GLOBAL COMPACT 26/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence The founding principles of Global Compact The principles which we accept in full and act in accordance with: Human Rights Principle 1: Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Scott Bader d.o.o. operates on international market, cooperates with business partners for which we believe that within their business activities in no manner participate in violating human rights or contribute to minimizing them in any of their other activities in a broader community. In the event that we discovered otherwise, our company would terminate its business relationship with such a company. Principle 2: Ensure that the company itself is not complicit in human rights abuses The founding principles of the Scott Bader Group include an explicit principle of respecting human rights, without which the Companies of the Group would not fulfil the most important precondition of their existence. Our Company has internal acts which were enacted in accordance with legal provisions and with the consent of its employees through their Council. A person has been authorised to which all remarks regarding any form of human rights violation, dignity or the endangerment of an employee. We are a small company in which most of our employees have been working for us for many years now and thereby fostering a mutual respect represents a foundation for good cooperation among employees and for including new employees into our labour processes. Labour Standards Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Every employee of Scott Bader d.o.o. has the opportunity to exercise their right to freedom of association. 64% of employees are members of the Trade Union of Chemical Industry Workers and 100% are members of the Commonwealth, a union of employees within the Group, through which they exercise their right to participate in reaching decisions regarding the most important issues related to the Company's business and other issues related to the Statute of the Company. 27/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence The Local Council of Employees, members of the Commonwealth, is based on the same foundations and, alongside with Trade Union representatives, represents an additional form of representing employees and exercising their rights. Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Scott Bader opposes any form of forced and compulsory labour which is contrary to the principles of conducting business. The same is requested from all business partners and members of the greater community to which it belongs. The choice and change of one's job position is a basic human right. Each new employee is fully informed of his/her rights and obligations through all internal acts of the Company, and is enabled to and expected to be an equal member of the team which he/she joins, because this is the only manner in which a company can function well. Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labour Scott Bader d.o.o. fully supports the abolition of child labour which is not a humane or permissible way of making a profit but rather an activity with long-term consequences in the future. The principle is clearly stated in our internal acts.

No discrimination may be applied related to sex, race, religion, political affiliation or nationality, family status or personal beliefs. The same criterion is applied to the salaries of our employees. Our internal acts include a description of a mechanism which is at the disposal of our employees for protection from any form of discrimination, as well as procedures set and persons responsible for resolving any situation in which an employee might feel discriminated in any way. Environment Principle 7: Scott Bader d.o.o., being a responsible company operating in the field of the chemical industry, pays special attention to environmental protection. In conformance with its own principles of sustainable development and business operations and guided by the principles of the Group's operations, including explicitly high standards in environmental protection measures, employee health care and improving work conditions in general, the Company meets and increases the high standards in these fields of industry. Being a member of the Scott Bader Group, Scott Bader d.o.o. is further obliged to fulfil all the necessary conditions of operations and activities that lead towards the protection of the environment. Monitoring the performance in the field on a regular basis ensures that all employees, as well as interested partners, are well informed about this segment of our operations and, even more importantly, sets new goals for improvement on the basis of former experiences. Basic issues of environmental protection and business operations are regulated by the Company's internal acts with the purpose of eliminating any adverse impact to environment: Rules on waste management from the technological process of wastewater treatment; Rules on operation and pre-treatment of waste and sewage water; an Operating plan of activities in case of sudden pollution; a Waste management plan; an Operating plan of activities in environmental protection; Rules on the disposal of waste oils; Fire safety rules. By fulfilling legal obligations in enacting the required rules and plans, the Company utilizes such a manner of defining the obligations as an additional opportunity for an on-going review of its achievements in the field. The Company makes continuous investments in the protection of the environment, the improvement of production conditions, safety at work, and improving working conditions in the Company in general. 29/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Here are some of the large-scale interventions and investments made during the course in 2010 and 2011: technological improvement of the production process by introducing Molten PA charging system reconstruction and implementation, by which the production process was made shorter, safety was improved, working conditions were made significantly easier and safety in the protection of the ecological system was improved. improvement in the sewage system of the entire site. This large-scale intervention is carried out over a three-year period and it was completed 2011. It includes a complete reconstruction of the technological water sewage system and the reconstruction of the catchments, precipitation and waste water system, all in compliance with a project approved by Hrvatske vode (Croatian Waters). reconstruction of the flooring in production plants. Its aim is to match the latest environmental and production standards. Reconstruction of the pools in which hazardous substances are stored new pumps and pipes (to prevent leakage) old level indicators on all monomer underground tanks was replaced with new ones new waterproof floor in peroxide warehouse replacement of insulation system (sheet and wool) on all tanks and Pfthalic Anhydride storage tank Continuous care and improvements in waste management (use / separation / disposal). Among others, a press for pressing paper and plastic waste was purchased. an improvement in the power efficiency of storing warm resins into tanks – a closed system of heating tanks using steam was constructed and installed With the aim to improve safety at work, fire protection and environment protection, in 2011 we started to apply Safety opportunity award system. Every month we reward the best suggestion regarding safety at work, fire protection and environment protection. The section Environmental impacts contains indicators of the application of this principle in more detail. Because of our legal obligations to get environmental licence (IPPC directive) most of our investments in 2012 was related with ecological and energy savings improvement: nitrogen in house production. Nitrogen generator was installed and now we are producing nitrogen from compressed air. steam heating of buildings with new more efficient central hot water heating system (steam losses are reduced) 30/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence 150 meter of old underground water pipelines was replaced with new one (water losses are reduced) investment in central dust collector system (dust emissions are reduced to minimum) two new underground double walls tanks for solvent and monomer storage was bought and old single walls tanks are replaced new watertight floor in monomer warehouse Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Being a producer of chemical products, our environmental responsibility is exceptionally important in our everyday activities. We support any action which leads towards improving environmental protection, and to that end undertake all measures available within our Company. Through cooperation with our business partners, and primarily our customers, we strive to share all of our knowledge regarding the proper application of our products, which we achieve by providing high-quality comprehensive documentation on our products, obtaining all required certificates, subcontracting transport companies with a high quality of service, providing instructions pertaining to managing packaging, packaging disposal etc. Large-scale changes are being introduced to the chemical industry with the implementation of the REACH regulation. We have been participating in the activities related to implementing the regulation from the very beginning and we try to set an example in the fulfilment of all of the REACH requirements in order to help and motivate others to do the same. 31/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence STATEMENT REGARDING REACH Scott Bader d.o.o., as a responsible company, and in an effort to prevent any surprises regarding the REACH Regulation 1907/2006, since Croatia is yet to accede to the EU, has named Scott Bader Co. Ltd. as its sole representative in the EU, and has pre-registered all substances and all substances used in preparations acquired from the EU market and from non-EU markets. Although confirmations have been received from almost all suppliers that they started the pre-registration process, this alone still provides no guarantee regarding the completion of the registration process. Scott Bader d.o.o. has therefore adopted the so-called safety net approach, in accordance with the recommendations given by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and preregistered all identified substances which are used as monomers or additives. Scott Bader d.o.o. produces polymers dissolved in a certain solvent or monomer, i.e. preparations that are not subject to registration as such; however, as further users need to ensure that only registered substances are procured for production, or, in the event where there are no registered suppliers, need to register the substances themselves for export into EU. Through the pre-registration procedure, and the further registration procedures (>1000 t/year by 30 November 2010, 100-1000 t/year by 31 May 2013, and 10-100 t/year by 31 May 2018) we ensure registered raw materials from our suppliers. From the communication with our suppliers it was confirmed that all supplied raw materials and for those traded products those had to be registered by end of November 2010 are registered and all SDS required are issued, with the date of the registration according to REACH regulations. Also, it is confirmed that the register of substances to be registered by 2013 or by 2018 is also completed. For substances now purchased, suppliers are obligated to issue new SDS, with visible ECHA registration number. When imported, only substances with completed documentation could be accepted. In accordance with Directive 1272/2008 (CLP) SCOTT BDER d.o.o. encourage our RM suppliers and customer in EU that all substances placed on the market will be notified to the Classification and Labelling Inventory. Our SDS are adjusted to this regulation for our products. In accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 453/2010 all SDS for our products (mixtures) comply with Annex I (Annex II) to this Regulation after 1 December 2012. 32/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Scott Bader d.o.o, as well as the sector for development of the Scott Bader Group, works intensively on the development of products, developed and enhanced in a manner in which by no means endanger the environment. It is our goal to place an increasing number of resins on the market with a lower content of volatile compounds, solvents and styrene. To that end we developed a new generation of alkyd “high solid” resins with a drastically reduced content of solvents. Furthermore, a solvent-less resin was developed, which represents the latest generation of environmentally acceptable alkyd resins on a global level. Polyester resins with a low content and low emission of styrene are also being developed along those lines. Furthermore, new acrylic resins with environmentally acceptable solvents (butyl acetate instead of toluene etc.) are also being developed. In alkyd emulsion project we intend to leave solvent based alkyd resins, now we pass lab and pilot plant step. Next phase will be verification of paint formulations and after that scale-up to Plant. Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery Scott Bader d.o.o. decidedly condemns acts of corruption, extortion or bribery committed in order to achieve business goals. We have never been, nor shall we ever let ourselves become involved in a situation that may lead towards any corruptive activity. We shall improve our business operations on both the international market and our local market and achieve our results only by operating in a competitive and fair manner. 33/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence ECONOMIC DIMENSION 34/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence EC1 SCOTT BADER d.o.o. is the only producer of composite resins and specialty polymers in Croatia, recognizable on its regional market as well as, together with other producers of the Scott Bader Group, on the European and the World's market. SCOTT BADER d.o.o. enhanced its years-long tradition of supplying high-quality products to its customers, who are industrial processors as well, by introducing product brand and rating of SCOTT BADER. The future of our Company and the Group, as well as any other company that strives to succeed in chemical industry, depends on investments into product development and new technologies as well as the ability to continually monitor and use the developments achieved by our customers and suppliers, in order to respond in a fast and proper manner to all quality requirements in all business segments. SCOTT BADER d.o.o., being mostly an exporter and also a producer of chemical products, is exposed to large-scale oscillations on both the raw-materials market and on the final products market. We operate on a very complex market, subject to extremely swift changes. The Company therefore tries and succeeds in utilising its capacities to a maximum level through continual improvements in its organization, technology, quality and cost management. SCOTT BADER is an important exporter, and with a large share of its product range it is an important regional producer. In the last several years export presents 85% of total sales. In 2012 our company continued with sales increase and business improvements. Volume of our product sold was 16.203 t, comparing to previous year 15.300 tonnes and 2010 with 15.273 and 2009 with 12.694 tonnes. Also, product mix is further improved, with larger sales of better value added products. The market we operate on is still very diffciult, manufacturers are exposed to continuous increase of raw material prices, those are still increasing althogh market activity after the main crisis is not recovered in full. Following that, there is a significant presure on the market by the competition too, that is also trying to regain own market position, partly by decreasing own earnings to a minimum. That resulted with margins lower than expected, but our presence on the market is still strong. After partly recovery of markets in 2011, in 2012 we managed to stabilise market position of our sales, with no debts in risk or looses of collections. Unfortuatately, local and regional market is still slowely recovering, but we are keeping a quarter of our total sales on domestic market and strenthening our position in the region. In the year 2012 we have achieved 196 mil HRK of sales and total income of 197,91 mil HRK, that resulted with profit of 171 th HRK. 35/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Trade profit structure Trade profit structure 2009 % 2010. % 2011. % 2012. % HRK 000s Domestic sales 20.925 17,8 23.338 15,74 26.601 14,69 29.867 15,24 Export sales 96.636 82,2 124.975 84,26 154.505 85,31 166.118 84,76 TOTAL 117.561 148.313 181.106 195.985 We deliver our products on a wide market range from the UK to Spain, from Italy to Russia and from Poland to Greece.

Trade income means income from sales of our products on domestic and foreign markets and a small share of income from selling services and merchandise. Other income means income from interest and selling fixed and other long-term assets. The largest share of business expenditures comprises raw-material costs for the production and they define the increase in all expenditures, following the increase in sales / production and the changes in the prices on the world raw-material market. Furthermore, there are also freight, power and other expenses related to production and production plant maintenance. Other business expenditures include licence expenses, mediator fees and sales expenses on foreign markets, the expenses of property and employee protection, insurance expenses etc. Employees' salaries and benefits include salaries and fees for the employees as well as paid benefits (bonuses, jubilee awards, Christmas bonuses), transportation costs, aid to employees and similar. Paid interest includes the interest paid for a loan granted by Scott Bader Group companies. The intercompany credit decreases the Company's exposure towards third parties and enables a more favourable financial arrangement than it would have been should a loan be granted by a third party (e.g. domestic banks). A nominally paid interest amount is decreased and does not represent a significant financial burden to the Company. Payments to the State include all mandatory payments regarding taxes and other payments. * Investments into the Community: this segment shows the specific characteristics of the organization and functioning of the basic principles in the Scott Bader Group and the existence of Commonwealth. The Group is expressively turned towards its local and wider community, and its financial participation is performed through donations, voted 37/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence on by all members of the Commonwealth and paid from a joint fund at the Group level. Therefore the amount of donations is not shown in the table above, as there was no expense at the level of local company, although the donations were made to Croatian charities, following the proposal of Zagreb's SCOTT BADER d.o.o. employees and from the fund provided for by the Zagreb-based company. Donations Scott Bader Commonwealth Limited now for year gives donation to chosen donation organisations in Croatia. Every year the amount for donation is voted. Donation amount depents on employee number in the local company. SCOTT BADER d.o.o. has been proposing over the years to the joint fund the charities that the donations might be granted to, mostly those providing aid for children, young and ill people. In 2012 SCOTT BADER d.o.o. has got from Scott Bader Commonwealth Limited amounts of 7.300 GBP to be donated. Those funds were donated to charity organisation we knew for years and we recognized their need for addition financial help. We wanted to keep continuity and of several years and give some kind of additional security to those organisation that, if they fullfil known conditions from Commonwealth, they could count on help form SCOTT BADER for some time.

Our main achievement consists in reduction of invalidity degree in our members who are cerebral palsy sufferers, submitted to integral neuro-rehabilitation program. The progress is documented by video footage “before and after” as well as with GMFM 66 and 88 questionnaire scoring. 38/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Project ” INTEGRAL NEUROREHABILITATION OF CEREBRAL PALSY” is based on new ideas in neuroscience which claim regenerative capacity of injured brain based on ideas of neuroplasticity ( www.dr-roje.com).Thus previously hopeless patients( invalids) with cerebral palsy( especially children) have new hope for their recovery. So far results of project are excellent. SOS Children Village SOS Children's Villages look after children without parents or parental care, regardless of their race, nationality or faith, providing them with love and security in the family environment, as well as a permanent home and education needed for happy and peaceful childhood. Children who arrive to SOS Children’s Village Croatia (SOS CVC) sometimes need special expert assistance that cannot be provided by SOS CVC staff. One of those special needs refers to the special learning/speaking/reading impediments and SOS CVC has to engage external experts. Costs of such expert assistance per one village for the first two most critical months of the school year amounts to 13.560 Kuna, or approximately £1,500.00 (on March 21st, 2012, rate at the Croatian National Bank was 1GBP = 9,04). In 2010 we have begun working with one particularly disadvantaged group of children between ages 5 and 8. During past two years significant number of them significantly improved their speech capacity and are no longer in the program. However, a few of them are still involved in speech therapy and require more work for another year. In addition, some new children that are entrusted to our care require intensive work with them in order to better integrate them into regular schooling to the best of their capacity. The funds we donated to SOS village will be used for expert assistance at the beginning of the school year 2012/2013. 39/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Udruga Krijesnica (Firefly) Firefly is a humanitarian association for helping children and families facing malignant diseases. It is operating in Zagreb but supports families from whole Croatia as well as families from neighboring countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia, Slovenia). Regular activities:  Providing psychosocial support to children and families facing malignant diseases  Educating children and families on topics related to malignant disease and treatments  Organizing and implementing rehabilitation programs for young cancer survivors  Activities on advocacy for health and social care rights of sick children and their families  Public awareness raising activities for increasing sensibility in society on issues of children facing cancer  Provision of accommodation for families who come to Zagreb for medical treatments Key achievements: Work of Centre for psychosocial rehabilitation as a focal point for information, advice and support for all families whose children are in treatment of malignant diseases in Zagreb Provision of free accommodation for families coming outside of Zagreb in the vicinity of hospital where their children are receiving treatments Counseling and technical support to parents in all procedures necessary to be done in case of child passing away Work of grief support groups facilitated by professionals for all who have lost someone due to cancer Rehabilitation summer camps for children who have gone through difficult treatment of malignant disease Equipping children's oncology departments in Croatia with necessary medical equipment and other non-medical devices that make life easier in the hospital Publishing educational brochures and books for children and parents Production and copying of educational documentaries and cartoons that help children in coping with cancer and treatments Many awareness raising campaigns about cancer related issues 40/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Croatian Association of the blind Donated money in 2009 was of great help in publishing the bigger numbers of tactile atlases. In year 2010 donated money was spent for making more detailed map of Croatia. In year 2011 we supported project „All equall, all different“. Funds were used fot printing the brochure „Rights and Opportunities for the Blind, maintaining website www.savez-slijepih.hr and procurement of equipment Jaws for Windows. The project “Employment Crown of Integration of the Blind Persons” started in July 2011 with the following goals: 1. Raising public awareness of the capabilities and potentials of blind people as a work force 2. Increasing personal potential of unemployed blind people, especially young 3. Informing employers and relevant institutions on the possibility of blind people therefore increasing propensity to employ blind workers 4. Providing technical assistance to employed blind persons and their employers In 2012 we were supporting project “Employment Crown of Integration of the Blind Persons” started in July 2011 with the following goals: 1. Raising public awareness of the capabilities and potentials of blind people as a work force 2. Increasing personal potential of unemployed blind people, especially young 3. Informing employers and relevant institutions on the possibility of blind people therefore increasing propensity to employ blind workers 4. Providing technical assistance to employed blind persons and their employers PUŽ (SNAIL) Put u Život (A Way into Life) – Association of parents of children with special needs was founded to improve the quality of life, medical and social protection of children with special developmental needs and their families through education, various therapeutic treatments etc. 41/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence The money donated in year 2010, as well as in 2009, the Oganisation used for computer workshop, where help to children with special developmental needs was organised, so they could develop their computer skills. In 2011 donated money also went to computer work-shop. The computer workshops are for children with disabilities in order to raise level of computer skills, make them easier processes of reading and writing education communication and socialization. Direct users were/are 20 children with serious physical disabilities (cerebral palsy, dystrophy and similar). For most children with disabilities computer is and will be basic tool for communication. In 2012 donations was for implementing Sensory Integration therapy for users in order to improve their functioning in daily life. 42/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence SOCIAL DIMENSION 43/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence SOCIAL DIMENSION Aspect: Community SO1. Nature, range and efficiency of a program or general practice by which the impact of business activities on community is assessed and managed, including the stages of input, activity and output. 1. Importance SCOTT BADER d.o.o., being a participant in a social community, both local and wider, by its sheer existence, through employing people and the level of respecting labour relations, has a social impact. Furthermore, as a producer in chemical industry it is highly interested in performing its business activities without having an adverse effect on the environment in which it exists, and that through its financial activities and timely payment of all its duties towards the state and local community contributes to its development and respect all the principles of proper business performance. The Company operates within the industry for half a century, at the same location, so in that sense its involvement with the community is not expressed, but rather it is a continuous adjustment of operations in the community and continual improvement in conduct standards (business and social conduct) in all conditions. We have not encountered corruption and we do not believe that there is a high corruption risk. We are not in any way involved in public politics and we do not use any type of lobbying. We have also never had, neither we ever shall make a donation to or support any political party or a similar institution. No proceedings were ever launched against us regarding a (dis)respect of free competition. In our recent history we were never fined or financially sanctioned for not respecting law and regulations. 2. Compiling data There were no specific programs related only to monitoring social impact, but the basic principles of the functioning of SCOTT BADER and documents related to the system of values in business activities show the goal that the Company wishes to achieve. 44/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence 3. Definitions Individual activities, internal acts and indicators are presented in other sections of this Report. 4. Documentation All feedback that the Company gets from its stakeholders is used as documentation of its social impact: customer satisfaction information; information obtained from other business partners, e.g. suppliers; certificates and permissions from the Company's owner; approvals by the Trade Union and Local Council of decisions reached, documents related to participation in business associations (Croatian Employers Association, Croatian Exporters Association and the like); participation in business polls with the purpose of gathering complete information that shall help improving business environment and labour terms; reports presented by charities regarding the utilization of donations. 45/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence ENVIRONMENTAL DIMENSION 46/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Environmental dimension We systematically monitor the impact of our activities and products on the environment and take preventive measures to prevent and reduce unwanted effects. We have a certified environmental management system according to ISO 14001, which ensures that all issues of environmental management are under constant supervision. Taking care about effects on environments is visible through energy utilisation and emission to air and water, as well as cumulating dangerous and non-dangerous waste. There is a continuous request from all responsible sectors (R&D, manufacturing, maintenance) to decrease energy consumption at total, but also per product item. Emission to air is measured on 19 locations in the plan and laboratories and all results are below defined minimal values, that put request to repeat our check every five years. Emission in the air from burnings in our own hot oil boiler is measured, according to the law, every two years. Every year we submit requested reports on emission in the air to the Register ROO. We have renewed Water licence, that regulates emissions to water, in the year 2008, and it is valued till 2013. SCOTT BADER is one of the 250 company in Croatia which are obligated to have Environmental Permit according to IPPC regulation. Analysis of the installation is accepted by Ministry of enironmental protection and Application for the establishment of integrated environmental requirements is already sent to Ministry. Surveillances made each year by inspections of different area (fire protection, health and safety, sanitary, vessel under pressure...) showed that in our company there is a high compliance with law regulations, that secures minimal effects on environment and people's health, as well as enable to prevent and avoid any accidents with risk for people and environment. Great attention is paid to the organization and regulation of the workplace both in indoor and in outdoor areas of our company. With good organization and clarity we ensure there are no incidents which could lead to environmental pollution and injury at work. 47/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence EN3 Direct power consumption Our plants use earth gas for the production of power (hot oil furnace for heating reactors).

Problems in gas supply results in investment in gas burner with possibility to use gas and diesel fuel. In 2010 we have made the reconstruction of the gas burner, which we further reduce gas consumption in 2011. As we in 11.2012 replaced steam heating of buildings (production plant, production offices and oil warehouse) with hot water central heating (heat is produced by our natural gas fired Heater) we had some increase of natural gas consumption per tonne of production in 2012 comparing 2011.

The improvements in technological procedures and investments into maintenance and renewal of equipment result in a continuous decrease in the consumption of electric power per product unit. From 6.2012 we installed our nitrogen generator and we produce nitrogen from compressed air. We have bigger consumption of electricity but we reduced nitrogen expenses 50%. Steam consumption is mostly related to heating the plants, working premises and offices and depends on weather conditions. There is a plan for a project of replacing steam with a more favourable power source, or of reconstructing the existing power utilisation form. In 2010 we further reduce the consumption of steam temperature control in heated buildings. In 2011 we made new insulation on inside storage tanks for final products (14 pcs) heated with steam and with that investment we manage reduce steam losses in 2012. New insulation on inside storage tanks 50/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence At the end of 2012 we finished replacing steam heating of buildings with new more efficient central hot water heating system and we will have bigger savings in 2013. EN8 and EN10 Water All water is obtained from local water supply system which is subject to strict control. For a number of years the meter is checked on a daily basis, with the purpose of providing a timely reaction in case of a leakage or an error in production process. A separate cooling water system with two cooling towers has been in use since 1972, and only the amount lost through evaporation on cooling towers is replaced. We also have new vacuum pumps system implemented in 2010, with sealling water closed loop, that additional decreased water consumption. Previously system used sealing water only in one direction, not in circulation. To prevent the accumulation of sediments on cooling planes, till 2012 the water was chemically treated, thus ensuring maximum cooling effect at minimum power consumption. In 2012 we made water treatment reconstruction. Instead of using chemicals, we use ion exchanging treatment. Benefits are that we using less chemicals and water treatment is more efficient. In august 2012 we changed 150 meter of old underground water pipelines with new one and we will decrease water consumption in 2013 for more than 30 %. The reconstruction of water supply system and regular control of water consumption, water losses, and hence consumption has been continuously decreasing.

The decrease in disposed waters is connected with strict technological discipline and regular daily monitoring of consumption, followed by a swift reaction to possible variations. With the purpose of reducing disposal, a new closed cooling system was installed in the Laboratory as a replacement for the continuous flow system, which used water supply cooling water a single flow. A new positive step forward is seen when the closed gasket water system is installed in the new vacuum station.

With better sorting for non dangerous waste we have more useful waste for collection and for recycle, and less waste ends up in communal waste. For this reason, we have increasing quantity of non-hazardous waste. Quantity of hazard waste is higher past two years because our obligation according to IPPC regulation (reference documents for polymer production) is to send our reaction waste water to thermal treatment (waste incinerators). Dangerous waste, because of its specifics, may currently only be disposed by thermal processing. Only waste oils are recycled in Croatia, while all other dangerous waste is exported by authorised companies to waste incinerators. In recent years, we continuously working to reduce the quantity of hazardous waste generated in production: we use liquid instead of solid raw materials wherever we can, thus reducing the amount of hazardous waste packaging new pumps and pipes are installed to prevent leakage of raw materials and finished products waste resin are sort in order to be re-used in finished products etc. Total waste Not dangerous waste, kg Dangerous waste, kg 2009 21669 46256 2010 48047 61876 2011 36649 121607 2012 41100 101386 Waste per ton of products Not dangerous waste, kg/t Dangerous waste, kg/t 2009 1,71 3,64 2010 3,07 3,89 2011 2,46 8,16 2012 2,50 6,16 54/55 Global Compact Report 2012 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence EN26 Initiatives for reducing the impact on environment According to positive legal regulations, a producer is obliged, at his expense and at the request of customers, dispose of dangerous substances packaging. A very efficient system has been introduced 4 years ago in SCOTT BADER, by which the packaging from our customers is disposed of in Croatia. The amount of packaging collected and disposed of is related to the sales on the domestic market, so in the year 2007, in the light of record sales on the domestic market, the quantity of disposed packaging was the highest ever. All regular requests made by the customers for the return of packaging were met.
