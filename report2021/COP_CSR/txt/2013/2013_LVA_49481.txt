MANAGEMENT OF COMPANY ENCOURAGEMENT OF COMPANY GMH DECLARES COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES AND THEIR RESULTS PERSONNEL TO DEMONSTRATE IN ITS WITH ALL APPLICABLE LEGAL THAT CAN HAVE AN DAILY ACTIVITIES PROFESSIONALISM REQUIREMENTS ON SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON AND RESPONSIBILITY TO ENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION OF ENVIRONMENT Supporting a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Introducing the precautionary approach, means that “where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation”. Precaution involves the systematic application of risk assessment (hazard identification, hazard characterization, appraisal of exposure and risk characterization), risk management and risk communication. When there is reasonable suspicion of harm and decision-makers need to apply precaution, they have to consider the degree of uncertainty that appears from scientific evaluation. Deciding on the acceptable level of risk involves not only scientifictechnological evaluation and economic cost-benefit analysis, but also political considerations such as acceptability to the public. From a public policy view, precaution is applied as long as scientific information is incomplete or inconclusive and the associated risk is still considered too high to be imposed on society. The level of risk considered typically relates to standards of environment, health and safety.

In other words, it is more cost-effective to take early action to ensure that irreversible environmental damage does not occur. Under that we consider the following:  Whereas it is true that preventing environmental damage demands both opportunity — and implementation — costs, remediation environmental harm after it has occurred can cost much more, e.g. for treatment costs, or in terms of company’s image.  Investing in production methods that are not sustainable (i.e. those deplete resources and degrade the environment) has a lower, long-term return than investing in sustainable operations. In turn, improving environmental performance means less financial risk, an important consideration for insurers.  Research and development related to more environmentally friendly products can have significant long-term benefits Undertaking initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. We have the responsibility to ensure that activities on our own backyard should not cause harm to the environment of our neighbours. Society also expects us to be good neighbours. We gain its legitimacy through meeting the needs of society, and increasingly society is expressing a clear need for more environmentally sustainable practices. Encouraging the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Environmentally sound technologies should protect the environment, are less polluting, use all resources in a more sustainable manner recycle more of wastes and products and handle left over wastes in a more acceptable manner than the technologies for which they were substitutes. Those include a variety of cleaner production process and pollution prevention technologies as well as end-of-pipe and monitoring technologies. RESPONSIBILITY The company determines the activities and their results that can have a significant impact on environment and established objectives in order to be in compliance with the ecology norms. 1. Improvement of working environment and care for environment protection  Monitoring and endeavour to establish measurement system of key environmental factors (pollutions, gas emissions, noise, fuel and chemical liquids emissions). 2. Compliance with applicable legal requirements  Available sources for to-date information about changes in government regulations on environment protection. 3.

Steps that the company is taking to promote environmental responsibility as the following: • Re-define company’s vision, policies and strategies to include the 'triple bottom line' of sustainable development — economic prosperity, environmental quality and social impartiality. • Develop sustainability targets and indicators (economic, environmental, and social). • Work with suppliers to improve environmental performance, extending responsibility up the service provided chain and down the supply chain. • Adopt voluntary charters, codes of conduct or practice internally as well as through industrial and international initiatives to confirm acceptable behaviour and performance. • Measure, track and communicate progress in incorporating sustainability principles into business practices, including reporting against global operating standards. • Ensure transparency and fair dialogue with stakeholders. In doing the above, the existence of appropriate management systems is crucial in helping the company to meet the organizational challenge. Key mechanisms or tools for the company to use should be: (a) assessment or audit tools (such as environmental impact assessment, environmental risk assessment, technology assessment, life cycle assessment); (b) management tools (such as environmental management systems and ‘eco-design’) and (c) communication and reporting tools (such as corporate environmental reporting and sustainability reporting). The expected key benefits of environmentally friendly technologies are the following: • Implementing environmentally friendly technologies helps a company reduce the use of raw materials leading to increased efficiency. • Technology innovation creates new business opportunities and helps increase the overall competitiveness of the company.

Strategic level approaches to be incorporated to improving technology include the following: • Establishing a corporate or individual company policy on the use of environmentally sound technologies. • Making information available to stakeholders that illustrates the environmental performance and benefits of using such technologies. • Examining investment criteria and the sourcing policy for suppliers and contractors to ensure that tenders stipulate minimum environmental criteria. • Co-operating with industry partners to ensure that ‘best available technology’ is available to other organizations. • Measurement of outcomes ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS Environmental impact activities for improvement:  Reduced emissions  Non-organized dissolver chemical liquids emissions in accordance with restrictions  The mixing of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes is prohibited As per the legal requirements on hazardous chemical substances – GMH is a ‘consumer in the chain’ and as such the obligations are: to demand and register safety data sheets from the manufacturers and the importers of the chemicals, and all employees working with the respective chemicals should be instructed.

Conversely a company which takes a firm and principled stand against all forms of corruption will become known for this and the risk of its employees being exposed to demands will lessen.  'The one who cheats will be cheated against' If a company engages in or tolerates corrupt practice, it will soon be widely known, both internally and externally. Unethical behaviour corrodes staff loyalty to the company and it can be difficult for staff to see why high standards should be applied within a company when it does not apply in the company's external relations. Internal trust and confidence is then eroded. • Implementation Fighting corruption and implementing the 10th principle.  Internal: As a first and basic step, introduce anti-corruption policies and programs within company and our business operations;  External: Report on the work against corruption in the annual Communication on Progress; and share experiences and best practices through the submission of examples and case stories;  Collective: Join forces with industry peers and with other stakeholders • Measurement of outcomes GMH is pleased to report that there have been no incidents of corruption alleged at the company from either internal or external agencies. Due to the company’s zero-tolerance policy, it is obvious that there is a great deal of social and legal pressure not to participate in such acts. JOINT EFFORTS GMH coordinates its efforts on prevention and fight against corruption as it interacts with organizations. GMH management takes part in key meetings, conferences and other publicly important events. GM HELICOPTERS LTD. “M Sola”, Dzelmes, Jumprava Parish, Lielvarde Local Municipality, LV-5022, Latvia; Reg.
