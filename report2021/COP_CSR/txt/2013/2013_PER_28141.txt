It has the following environmental certifications. Message from the Management This year we present our ninth consecutive Sustainability Report, covering our performance in 2012. We subscribe to the United Nations Global Compact since 2004, reporting our compliance with the 10 principles of human rights, employment standards, the environment and anticorruption. In order to improve understanding of our economic, social and environmental performance, in 2007 we undertook the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) version G3.1 methodology, the principal international standard for drafting sustainability reports. This year we are proud to submit our first sustainability report with an application level A, which reflects the continuing improvement of our management. We believe that the road to sustainability goes hand in hand with our stakeholders, so this report seeks transparency and feedback, and to share with employees, clients, suppliers and the community, our goals, challenges and achievements during 2012. The main event in this fiscal year was the merger of Cementos Lima and Cemento Andino to form UNACEM, providing important synergies and operational improvements. This has enabled us to integrate processes and save in production costs and transport, thus offering more competitive prices to our customers. Furthermore, our combined strengths have increased our cement production capacity to 5.35 million tons during the year, a 13.2% increase since 2011. This figure is sufficient to supply the whole of the domestic demand for cement, in line with the country’s growth and the construction sector dynamism. As far as our clients are concerned, the merger gave us a greater geographic scope, enabling us to meet present and future needs throughout Peru. Thus, in addition to our contribution to the development of Peru and future generations, we are consolidating the competitiveness and profitability of our company, increasing its value in the Peruvian market and that of Latin America. Furthermore, in our proactive role as the leading company in the cement sector, we are committed to the mitigation of climate change and promoting good environmental practices among all of our interest groups. Aware of the environmental impacts arising from the sector’s operations, we are PAGE 13 | 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT determined to continue as a leading promoter of environmental culture, among our employees and neighboring communities. For the second year in a row we received the Socially Responsible Company award from the Centro Mexicano para la Filantropía; which has encouraged us to further implement our initiatives throughout the supply chain. Our success is due to the commitment of our professional team, whose motivation and good performance, based on corporate values, has given us 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT a secure operation that complies with the highest standards of safety. 2012 was a key period for UNACEM, during this time we prepared ourselves with enthusiasm and dedication to new opportunities and challenges. Opportunities and challenges that will encourage the development of local communities, strengthen the cohesion of our great team of collaborators, drive our efforts to protect the environment and strengthen us as agents of change. We are prepared to address future challenges by developing skills and strengthening the corporate sustainability of our different departments and companies. This will enable us to align, implement and integrate the | practices necessary to achieve higher performance.

Our organization The talent behind each achievement. “At UNACEM we take advantage of internal synergies to reinforce our commitment to a solid and sustainable construction industry that respects the environment and contributes to the sustainable development of the country”. PAGE 17 | 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 1. Our Unión Andina de Cementos –UNACEM– has been supplying the construction industry for more than 60 years and has become the leading cement organization producer in Peru, offering quality products and contributing to the development of the country’s infrastructure. This prestige is based on our corporate values and a team that is committed to the company and to society. UNACEM was created in 2012 as a result of the merger between Cementos Lima and Cemento Andino, present in the market since 1916. The principal aim of the synergy was to make use of the strengths and positions of both companies to achieve improvements in operations, sales and marketing, extend our scope and take part in new realities. This merger of skills is a challenge that we have addressed, backed by confidence in our experience and knowledge of the sector, which will enable us to meet demands and a constantly changing market, and always remain in the vanguard of sector requirements. We thus offer our clients high quality products, made to international standards, and always seek to be a solid and sustainable industry making use of technological innovation. In 2003 we consolidated our model of sustainable management and created Asociación Atocongo (now Asociación UNACEM), a non-profit organization with the mission of implementing the company’s Social Responsibility Policy in relation to its different stakeholders. UNACEM Cement Plants 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Atocongo Plant Production capacity: 4.5 million tons of cement milling capacity and 3.6 million tons of clinker.

Aware of this fact, at UNACEM we have adopted a business strategy to accompany and encourage this development. The leadership obtained during this period enables us to meet the present and future needs of construction companies, industry professionals, jobbing builders, self-builders and society in general. We are thus profiled as facilitators and strategic partners, generating opportunities for achievements both within the country and outside it. That is why today we are the leading producer and trader of cement; clinker, an essential raw material for cement manufacture; and similar products necessary for the construction industry. We have a wide range of products that are well positioned in the market, and are preferred by the construction industry. These products are divided into bagged and bulk cement. Our bagged products include the following brands: Cemento Andino (Portland type I). Cemento Sol (Portland type I), our flagship product. Cemento Andino type IP (Portland type IP). Cemento Andino type IPM (Portland type IPM). Cemento Andino type V (Portland type V). Cemento Atlas (Portland type IP). We also provide solutions to the construction industry, guaranteeing the accessibility and affordability of our products. In order to increase the distribution channels for our principal product, bagged cement, and 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT making use of the strategic role of traditional hardware stores, in 2008 we created the Progre-Sol network, aimed at sectors with fewer resources. Its purpose is to increase the availability of our products, strengthen the position of hardware entrepreneurs and increase their sales and profitability. At present we have more than 270 points of sale in the hardware store network, which in turn serve more than 6,500 independent hardware stores in UNACEM’s areas of influence. Furthermore, in line with our commitment to promote development, in | PAGE 25 2010 we created the HatunSol micro finance system with the mission of providing self-builders with financing for materials, labor and transport, as well as free specialist advice.

Stakeholders In 2006, we carried out a survey of our stakeholders, taking into account the impacts and expectations generated by them in the company and vice versa. Interest Groups 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Community Employees Suppliers | Future Shareholders PAGE 27 generations Environment Government Clients The institution responsible for maintaining the relationships with our stakeholders is Asociación UNACEM. One of its responsibilities is to keep them informed through virtual channels and the written media, among others. In our relationship with the community we take a participatory approach and generate formal spaces for dialogue in order to discover their perceptions and needs. As far as our other stakeholders are concerned, we have other channels through which we provide information about the company’s management. We also use satisfaction surveys to collect feedback from our employees and customers, which we use to draw up plans for continual improvement. As a result of this dialogue, we have identified subjects such as the basic needs of the community, mitigation of environmental impacts, suppliers human and employment rights, and the safety and health of our workforce.

Generating value Because our work promotes development. “We contribute to the economic growth of the country by connecting cities, providing more people with development opportunities for infrastructure to improve their quality of life, and generating value for society”. 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | PAGE 37 Through UNICON we provided 94,000 m3 of concrete for the construction of the Real Plaza Salaverry shopping center. San Isidro, Lima. Customer: HV Contratistas S.A. Generating Peru’s economic growth in 2012 was driven principally by the construction sector, due to increased investment in housing, mines, factories, shopping value and business centers, among others. This growth is directly associated with the increase in domestic cement consumption, which rose 15.8% in 2012. In addition to this favorable economic context, our cement production capacity has increased thanks to the merger between Cemento Andino and Cementos Lima, now trading as UNACEM. During the year we produced 5.35 million tons of cement, some 13.2% more than in 2011. Similarly, our dispatch volume increased by 12.9%, compared with the previous year, to 5.31 million tons of cement throughout Peru, nearly the same quantity as that produced by our plants. This production increase enabled us to cover the whole of the rising domestic demand and to position ourselves as the principal cement producer in Peru. 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | PAGE 39 Through UNICON we provided 56,000 m3 of concrete for the construction of the “Villa Bonita” condominium development.

We have an Annual Training Plan, with the objective of developing technical skills to improve the technical and professional profiles of our employees. These training needs are established on the basis of the results of performance evaluations, which are carried out annually on 100% of our employees. These provide an opportunity for feedback between manager and employee, in which not only the scope of the objectives are evaluated, but also performance, in order to establish personal goals, resolve doubts and, above all, motivate employees and involve them in the company’s objectives. If a supervisor finds that an employee has greater development potential he is included in a leadership, supervision and management program, and thus the supervisor becomes the mentor and main support for the employee’s development.

This event is currently under investigation by the Ministry of Employment to determine whether it was in | fact a work accident. The analysis has not identified any causes attributable to the company, but we have taken action to strengthen our training system, and PAGE 57 safety awareness to prevent future events. For accidents we have procedures that include an investigation of the immediate causes (actions and substandard conditions), basic causes (personal and labour factors) or faults in the management system that may have produced the accident. These analyses are reviewed and approved by the Central Safety Committee, which decides on corrective action to be taken immediately and in the medium term. We also monitor the medical condition of the victim, to ensure a satisfactory recovery.Preparación de respuesta ante emergencias Emergency Response Preparation In line with our culture of prevention, we have an Emergency Response Brigade, consisting of a total of 30 Atocongo employees. This team is trained and certified and take part in different drills and exercises for different types of emergency, motivating them and creating a commitment to safety within UNACEM. This same plant also has a brigade consisting of 25 contract employees. 3.4 Occupational In order to preserve the health and welfare of our employees, we carry out preventive action every year, medical examinations before an employee Health starts work, annual checks and an examination when he leaves the company. This enables us to identify possible health risks early on, and to monitor them to ensure that employees remain in good health. It also provides us with up to date health indicators, which we use to make improvements to the programs. Main occupational hazards 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Severe hearing damage: caused by exposure to noise.

This program seeks to provide new methodologies for teachers that will facilitate and motivate pupils to learn mathematics. To date we have invested 176,000 soles, trained | 123 teachers and benefitted 2,500 students from 36 schools in the districts of Palca and La PAGE 71 Unión – Tarma. In addition, to help improve the students’ performance, we provide books for teachers to reinforce the mathematics lessons. 4.2 Social We seek to become part of important infrastructure projects that provide safe conditions for the community and a better quality of life. In 2012 we invested infrastructure more than 2 million soles, benefitting 143 thousand people in our primary and peripheral zones of influence. These projects included: community halls, sewers, new sidewalks and parks, among others.

In this sphere, we concentrate on those living closest to our operations. We have entered into agreements with local organizations, such as in Condorcocha where we provide electricity to locals free of charge, to improve the quality of their lives; this year we delivered 7,182 GJ to the population. Furthermore, we have taken action to provide local communities with medical facilities and encourage socially responsible environmental management in southern Lima. At UNACEM we are pioneers in the creation of an environmental culture, in which appreciation and preservation of the environment is encouraged in all programs implemented in our areas of influence, as is the case with our Community Environment Programs and Environmental Education Programs. In response to the needs of our stakeholders, we have installed dust monitoring equipment in homes near to the Atocongo plant.

Managing the Supply Chain Because every step is essential. “We build confidence-based relationships with our goods and services suppliers, in line with our ethical values, transparency and compliance with our commitments”. PAGE 89 | 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Managing the Our management approach aims to favor and improve the performance of both our current and future suppliers. Our main management tool is Supply Chain Procedure PG-GA-003, which establishes guidelines for selecting, evaluating and re-evaluating suppliers; we also have a Local Supplier Contracting Policy that sets out the contracting requirements. We determine our needs on the 2012 Key Figures: basis of technical criteria, then we identify and contract suppliers of goods, 950 million soles in critical and non-critical products, and services.

At UNACEM we have 1,601 suppliers, of which 1,257 are Peruvian and 253 foreign, who provide the bags used to pack our cement, transport and materials for the maintenance of our machinery. We are particularly concerned about the 91 suppliers in the zones adjacent to our operations. Diversifying our suppliers 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 15.81% International suppliers 5.68% Local suppliers 78.51% Domestic suppliers | PAGE 91 In accordance with the requirements of our Integrated Management System, our health, safety and environmental requirements apply from the delivery of the products until entry by suppliers to our Atocongo and Condorcocha plants. With this in mind, our Health, Occupational Health and Environmental aspects for suppliers brochure is made available and is updated regularly to meet new Peruvian and international legislation, as well as UNACEM’s own initiatives. We also provide our suppliers with technical advice and have developed a general induction program covering aspects such as first aid, fire fighting, care for the environment, industrial health and safety and human rights. As a form of recognition, after successfully completing an evaluation, our suppliers receive an induction certificate, which we renew every year in order to ensure that their objectives are being met. Payments to suppliers In 2012 we spent more than 964,116,000 million soles on payments to suppliers, both Peruvian and international. Purchases from national and international suppliers Total national purchases 12.75% Total foreign purchases* 87.25% * In 2012 we had a larger number than ever of international suppliers, because of the expansion of our operations that required the acquisition of machinery and equipment provided mainly by foreign companies. Challenges facing the sector Reduce vulnerability to fluctuations in the prices of key raw materials for the sector. Promote systems for evaluating human rights compliance by the supply chain. Develop the skills of local suppliers, to enable them to supply small 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT businesses. | PAGE 93 7. Commitment to the environment Growing today, always thinking about tomorrow. “At UNACEM we apply international standards and use raw materials and natural resources efficiently, in order to help preserve biodiversity and the environment throughout the chain”. PAGE 95 | 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Commitment We accept that one of the main challenges of the cement sector is to minimize Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG), given that cement production uses to the considerably more energy than other industries. For this reason, at UNACEM environment we employ high quality standards and international certification to ensure that our management is sustainable and make every effort to implement clean technologies and greater process efficiency. Our Atocongo and Condorcocha 2012 Key Figures: plants are ISO 9001 certified (Quality Assurance System), and Condorcocha is 32 million soles in environmental ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System) certified, thus ratifying our investment. management standards. 14.5% of this investment was used for the management of We use our Integrated Management System as a commitment to identify environmental environmental opportunities and risks in our activities.

PAGE 97 | 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 7.1 Quarries At UNACEM we give equal emphasis to environmental impacts and safety in our quarries. We use the Environmental Management Plans of our operating and cement units to reduce the risk of rock falls, by maintaining the stability of quarry manufacturing faces and roads. Though we do not generate tailings, the rubble from five of our operations amounts to 7 million tons and our challenge is to restore disturbed areas through the activities included in our Mine Closure Plans (MCP). 100% of our quarries have a closure plan approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mines. Proper management of our operations requires an understanding of the stages extracting the raw material, and the manufacture of clinker and cement at our Atocongo and Condorcocha plants. 2 11 6 7 6 7 1 8 3 12 4 5 9 10 The cement manufacturing process 1 Extraction of raw materials: The process starts with the extraction of limestone, gypsum and pozzolan, from our quarries in Lima, Ica and Junín (Tarma). 2 Primary crusher: The limestone is taken to the primary crusher, which reduces it to pieces no larger than 18 cm. 3 Secondary crusher: The material is then reduced to less than 8 cm. 4 Pre homogenization: At our Atocongo Plant the material is pre-homogenized to reduce the standard deviation of the chemical composition of the crushed limestone. 5 Milling and homogenization: Roller presses and mills are used to mix the materials and to produce a chemically balanced material 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT with adequate particle size, referred to as “crude”. This is then stored and homogenized before being fed into the kilns. 6 Production of clinker* (intermediate product in the manufacture of cement): The crude is fed into the pre-heaters, precalcinators and then into the rotary kilns in which the temperature reaches about 1450ºC, where it undergoes physical and chemical changes to produce clinker. 7 Cooling and storage of clinker: To achieve better chemical stability and hydraulic properties for our cement, the clinker is cooled rapidly using air at ambient temperature. It is then taken to a storage area where cooling is completed. 8 Cement mill: The clinker, gypsum, pozzolan and limestone is sent to the feed hoppers. The four materials are mixed in the cement mills in different proportions depending on the type of cement being produced (type I, IP, IPM and V). | 9 Packing and dispatch: We use automatic packing lines with weighing machines to control filling and ensure an exact weight of 42.5 PAGE 99 kg for bagged cement. Bulk cement is dispatched in tankers or in big bags (1.5 t) that are sealed before leaving the plant to ensure that the product is not handled before it reaches its destination. 10 Distribution: Look for our cement in more than 270 hardware stores of the Progre-Sol network and our authorized distributors outside Lima. 11 Export: We export our cement through our own port facility located 24.5 km south of Lima (Conchán Pier). Cement and materials are transported from the Atocongo Plant to the pier and vice versa using a tubular conveyor belt 8 km long. 12 Quality control: Throughout the cement production process we control and monitor the different materials and inputs, to ensure the quality of our products. For this process we employ highly specialized staff and modern equipment. We also carry out strength, curing and durability tests on our cement and strength tests on the bags used, as well as other physical and chemical tests. In addition, we are testing new products (types of cement) and are involved in a number of research projects. * Limestone is added only to cement type I produced in the Atocongo plant, Lima. The following is a list of the materials used in the cement production process: Materials used in 2012 Atocongo Plant Material Quantity Raw Limestone, materials pozzolan, gypsum, 4,829,950 mt silica & iron Coal 3,253,324 MMBtu 25,711 Fuels Oil MMBtu Natural gas 5,511,953 MMBtu Semi-finished Clinker 3,367,533 mt Products Paper bags 59,552,340 Packaging Big bag 11,183 Condorcocha Plant Material Quantity Raw Limestone, materials pozzolan, gypsum, 1,756,701 mt silica & iron Coal 5,197,800.9 MMBtu 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 238,200.1 Fuels Oil MMBtu Ash 52,101 mt Semi-finished Clinker 509,040 mt Products Packaging Paper bags 33,676,469 | PAGE 101 Our clinker and cement manufacturing processes have been subject to environmental impact studies, in which we identify, evaluate and put forward improvements in significant environmental aspects such as dust emissions from our processes. In order to reduce them, we have implemented modern particle capture systems such as sleeve filters and electro filters. . We also seek better alternatives in cement manufacture, which will make us more efficient users of resources and raw materials. For that purpose we have reduced the percentage of clinker in the composition of cement, replacing it with limestone and pozzolan; this type of cement is known as additive-based cement. This has enabled us to extend the life of our quarries and reduce GHG emissions, since limestone and pozzolan, being raw materials, do not require heat treatment like clinker does.

In the field of materials management, replacement of clinker by pozzolan enables us to offer pozzolanic cement (type IP and IPM), which makes efficient use of raw materials and energy, as well as reducing GHG emissions. *This figure does not include clinker from Condorcocha. 7.2 Responsible We know that water is a valuable and an essential resource and for that reason our water management is focused on optimizing the resource both in water our manufacturing operations and offices. management Water consumption in 2012: Condorcocha Plant: 195,523 m3 Atocongo Plant: 640,764 m3 2012 Water consumption Domestic use 350,000.00 343,520.40 Atocongo (groundwater) 300,000.00 250,000.00 157,680 200,000.00 Condorcocha m³ (springs & creek) 150,000.00 100000.00 50,000.00 0.00 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 Water consumption Mining and industrial use 350,000.00 285,243.60 300,000.00 Atocongo (groundwater) 250,000.00 200,000.00 m³ | 150,000.00 PAGE 105 100000.00 37,843.20 Condorcocha 50,000.00 (springs & creek) 0.00 Because of the geographical location of our operations, we mainly use ground water and springs, which in some cases we share with local communities. Responsible water management initiatives Initiative Description and achievements Its objective is to create a culture of the The “Make a correct use of natural resources. As far as Difference” our employees are concerned, we give program training and run campaigns encouraging optimum use and stopping waste. This study has enabled us to reduce the volume of effluent discharged into the public Water balance sewers. Reductions: 63% (1999), 43% (2001), study 35% (2008) to 0% (2012), the latter being due to the commissioning or the waste water treatment plant. (WWTP). Water is used for cooling motors and System for reusing bearings, among other items, to enable the industrial water at kilns, presses and mills to operate normally. Atocongo and This water is diverted to a closed cooling Condorcocha circuit. Achievements in 2012: at Atocongo and Condorcocha we now recycle 100% of the industrial process water. Waste Water Treatment Plant We reuse 100% of our waste water. (WWTP) Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) The opening of the WWTP demonstrates our commitment to preserve water by reuse.We reuse 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 100% of the effluent generated by the plants, offices and camp to irrigate parks and gardens and to supply the fire-fighting system. In 2012 at the Atocongo plant we reduced underground water extraction by more than 10 thousand m3 a month, which represents 25% of total underground water used. Similarly, at our Condorcocha plant a new oxidation lagoon reduced ground water use by more than 9 thousand m3 a month, which represents | 34.5% of maximum ground water use. PAGE 107 Furthermore, we propose to introduce improvements to the treatment of water for human consumption including physical, chemical and biological processes to generate better quality water, acceptable by the World Health Organization standards. 7.3 Emissions The phenomenon of climate change is an incentive to seek environmentally management and efficient alternatives that enable us to reduce the main cause of emissions into the atmosphere. As a company we are determined to reduce emissions of Climate Change particulate material and GHG emissions for each ton of cement produced. We have adopted specific guidelines to address climate change: 1.Fuel consumption Use of natural gas: reduction of more than 120 tons of CO2 equivalent. Alternative fuels: co-processing (co-incineration of waste): we are evaluating the feasibility of implementing this, as we are a waste management alternative for the community. 2.Electricity consumption Clean energy: El Platanal, Carpapata 1 and 2 hydroelectric power stations, with Carpapata 3 under construction. Co-generation of energy. 3.Industrial processes for cement manufacture Additive-based cements: use of additives to reduce GHG emissions, such as pozzolan (30,3 tons of CO2 at Condorcocha) in our cements. The use of fly ash and blast furnace slag are under evaluation. Modernization of the plant: The implementation process will be completed during the first half of 2013 and will result in heat and electricity savings and lower GHG emissions. 4.Transport of materials (supplies and materials) Testing and maintenance of vehicles. Watering of internal roads in raw material storage areas and quarries, as well as other roads. Atocongo-Conchán conveyor belt: an underground conveyor approximately 8 km long, which has eliminated major spillages, reduced noise and environmental and safety risks to the community. Since 2009 the Atocongo plant has produced no CO2 emissions from transport of materials. We have invested more than 108 million soles in initiatives to improve the conveyor zone, reduce GHG emissions and built new roads. 5.-The “Make A Difference” program 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Efficient and responsible use of water. The “Plant a Tree, Start a Life” campaign. Earth hour. Environment week. With regard to the minimizing of indirect GHG emissions, we have made every effort to standardize the maintenance of our vehicles and offer transport | facilities to our employees. PAGE 109 Carbon credits We implemented a Clean Development Mechanism project in adherence to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Through this mechanism we are committed to replace most of our fossil fuel use with natural gas in the cement manufacturing process. In order to evaluate our achievements, we perform continual monitoring and at the end of 2011 we passed our third periodic verification of GHG emissions reductions. 7.4 Energy The cement manufacturing process requires high levels of energy use and for that reason we seek to satisfy our energy needs from renewable sources, thus efficiency reducing our environmental impact. Our plants are supplied with energy from our Carpapata and Platanal (Celepsa) hydroelectric power stations, in which we are the major shareholder. Furthermore, we have a thermal power station called Generación Eléctrica de Atocongo (GEA), which provides energy at peak times and when energy demand is at its highest.We also save on energy use by modernizing our equipment, particularly the kilns, through the maintenance of machinery and through the use of timers. 2012 Direct energy consumption 2012 Indirect energy consumption (in GJ) (in GJ) 2,200 1,653,870 357,335 975,683 Electricity Hydroelectric In-house Carpapata hydroelectric energy generation station 138,675 Thermal energy generation Atocongo Carpapata hydroelectric power stations – Condorcocha plant 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT The first hydroelectric power station at Carpapata opened in 1958 and the transmission lines supply our operations and the neighboring community with clean energy. Commissioning of Carpapata 2 considerably increased the generating capacity and enabled us to meet the energy requirements of cement manufacture. In order to continue expanding its capacity, | in 2010 we connected it to the National Grid PAGE 111 System. Our goal in 2013 is to commission the Carpapata 3 power station, in order to help preserve the environment by using more renewable energy. 7.5 Integrated waste We manage the waste generated throughout our production chain, identifying management the best ways to reduce, reuse and recycle, in order to diminish waste. Hazardous and non-hazardous waste at our Atocongo plant amounted to 6,124 metric tons in 2012 and at Condorcocha the figure was 854.7 metric tons. Atocongo plant Condorcocha plant 2012 Waste 2012 Waste (in mt) (in mt) 6,036 88 799.4 55.3 Non-hazardous Hazardous Non-hazardous Hazardous waste waste waste waste We use solid waste service companies (EPS-RS) to handle final disposal of waste, and we recycle hazardous waste. As far as Atocongo is concerned, in 2012 we recycled 61.8% of its non-hazardous waste through sales and donations of paper to the “Las Palmeras” recyclers association. At Condorcocha we reused 100% of the glass and tiles generated in the cement production process and recycled 100% of the oil used in the production process. In 2012, 5 tons of glass were used in the production process. We also have a composting plan for garden waste and make use of the sweepings from the plants. 7.6 Managing Our quarrying activities have an effect on the soil, flora and fauna, so we biodiversity develop and encourage research projects leading to the rehabilitation and restoration of the affected areas. Soil rehabilitation and restoration: we have helped clean the drains from our Las Dunas mining unit in the Department of Ica, in order to optimize the water use in agriculture. Research into seasonal flora for planting in the areas affected by our 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT activities and reintroduce native fauna. Biological monitoring of the direct area of influence of our quarrying activities, aimed at understanding the seasonal behavior of local flora and fauna as we develop the quarries. Maintenance of parks and gardens: we have more than 30 hectares of parks and gardens, provided with efficient irrigation systems that reuse | treated waste water from the waste water treatment plant. PAGE 113 Atocongo Zoological Garden: we have 24 species, including ostriches, deer, parrots, coatíes, coastal foxes and other animals, living in appropriate conditions. They receive balanced feed to ensure that they thrive and reproduce, and are cared for by dedicated staff and veterinarians. It is worth mentioning the importance of mine closure plans, given that they are a determining aspect of the duration of quarrying activities. These plans are concerned with the future management of the area, particularly land use in terms of diversity. Black-necked Stilt “Himantopus Mexicanus” on the “Las Hienas” concession.

Third party check global reporting initiative (GRI) declaration of control indicator contents index PAGE 121 | 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Third party verification Lima 15th April 2013 Messrs. UNACEM Dear Sirs, A Level A Third Party Checked examination of the 2012 Sustainability Report by UNACEM, required by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) was carried out in the following manner: The 2012 Sustainability Report was read and analyzed in detail, using the GRI Sustainability Report Drafting Guide – G3.1 as the basis. Comments and observations were made on the report. The final version of the report was subject to a second review and analysis. The following aspects were taken into account in the analysis: Application of the GRI principles in defining the content of the sustainability report.  pplication of the GRI principles on the quality of the sustainability report. A Compliance with the minimum aspects and indicators that must be reported to achieve GRI Level A. Recommendations for future sustainability reports. The following is a brief description of the aspects covered by the analysis: Principles for defining the contents and quality of the sustainability report The 2012 Sustainability Report by UNACEM adheres to the GRI principles for drafting sustainability reports, as far as both content and quality are concerned. The principle of materiality should continue to prevail, not only in order to find and report relevant content, but also in the presentation of such content. The report not only covers the principal aspects and indicators, it also reports on the mining and metal supplementary indicators, enabling it to establish significant impacts for the company and its interest groups. As far as participation by interest groups is concerned, it takes a participatory approach and creates space for formal dialog aimed at discovering their perceptions and needs. The tools employed include working meetings, workshops and satisfaction surveys, among others. In the context of sustainability, the report describes policies that are aligned to the company’s Code of Social Responsibility and also demonstrates a long-term commitment to sustainable development through its recent adhesion to the Global Compact. As far as exhaustiveness is concerned, the report describes the company’s economic, social and environmental management and its practices at its two plants: Atocongo and Condorcocha. Practices and performance indicators are developed in accordance with the degree of progress at each plant. With regard to balance, we would emphasize the commitment shown by UNACEM to information transparency, as it includes not only positive aspects but also situations in which its management can be improved. 2012 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Report indicators The report covers 67 indicators: 54 main indicators, 13 additional indicators and 11 supplementary indicators concerning mining and metals. Recommendations The analysis gave rise to the following suggested improvements: Having been aligned since 2007 with the directives of the GRI Guide, we recommend that future reports should include a comparison with management results from previous years. Presentation of the information in the report is relevant and should be given the necessary space and detail in the body of the report rather than the index. It should not be forgotten | that the report seeks to inform and communicate the company’s economic, social and environmental performance clearly to its interest groups. PAGE 123 A table of improvement to which the company is committed should be drawn up to enable interest groups to visualize and understand compliance with the company’s social responsibility strategy. The goals established in the report should be prioritized and followed up. Bearing in mind that one of the environmental impacts relevant to the sector is total direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, we recommend including further information on these measurements, commitments and actions being taken in this regard. Those indicates that are included with a commitment to implementation should be prioritized so that they can be reported in their entirety in the future. For the reasons described above, we confirm that the 2012 Sustainability Report by UNACEM meets the conditions for the following level: A: Third Party Checked Yours faithfully, Henri Le Bienvenu Mercado General Manager Peru 2021 Statement GRI Application Level Check Statement GRI Application Level Check GRI hereby states that Union Andina de Cementos S.A.A has presented its report “UNACEM Sustainability Report 2012” to GRI’s Report Services which have concluded that the report fulfills the requirement of Application Level A.
