He has worked in a variety of operational roles and was appointed Country Manager of Hungary in 2008. Our Hungarian business delivered a very strong performance. Profit in 2012 was £10.1 million, which reflects underlying profit growth of £3.7 million partially offset by a £1.9 million adverse impact from weaker FX rates. Key to this result are the excellent employee engagement levels in our Hungarian business and we are very proud that it was awarded the best workplace in Hungary and, subsequently, the sixth best workplace across Central and Eastern Europe. This high level of employee engagement is the foundation of the very strong 2012 performance which delivered good growth in customers and credit issued together with excellent credit quality. ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ 2012 2011 ฀ ฀ business continued to make good progress towards its £M % % ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ 268 244 24 ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ our customer base together with issuing larger loans ฀ 114.2 ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ 76.6 ฀ 18.8 ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ 78.2 4.0 (11.9) ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ 66.3 1.1 12.8 ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ (8.7) ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ (13.4) ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ Other costs (34.1) ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ Profit before taxation 10.1 1.8 ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ increased in line with the growth of the business. ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 25 Romania Ivo Kalik Country Manager, Romania Ivo joined the business in 1997 and was appointed Country Manager of Romania in 2012. He was previously Regional Managing Director of our Mexican operation. Our business in Romania had a difficult year, set against a backdrop of continued challenging macroeconomic conditions, political instability and austerity measures that reduced household income and consumer confidence. Lower than expected growth, together with higher than anticipated impairment and increased costs arising from infrastructure investment to support our growth plans, resulted in a £1.9 million reduction in profit to £2.2 million. Our performance in Q1 2012 was impacted significantly by higher impairment and all of the reduction in profit is attributable to this period. ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ 2012 2011 ฀ ฀ customer growth of 8%.

He was appointed Country Manager of Mexico in 2012. The key objectives for the Mexican business in 2012 were to build on the improved operational performance delivered in 2011 and to increase revenue per customer by issuing larger loans to creditworthy customers; this is a key building block in our aim of delivering a profit of £33 per customer by 2015. The business performed well against these objectives in 2012, delivering strong growth in credit issued together with lower impairment through good operational management. This resulted in the Mexican business delivering a record profit of £4.9 million, an increase of £3.4 million compared to 2011, and this equates to a profit per customer of £7. ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ 2012 2011 ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ £M % % ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ 21 683 ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ 148.9 124.4 ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ 78.7 11.0 ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ 114.1 11.2 ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ (32.3) ฀ 81.8 10.0 ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ (9.3) ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ (14.0) ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ Other costs (53.6) ฀ a lower yield.

As we expand our footprint and develop new products and channels, we need to ensure our people operate within an effective governance framework where decisions are made at the appropriate levels; where accountability is clear; and where our actions are mindful of the interests of all our stakeholders – whether they are shareholders, customers, suppliers or the communities in which we work. As we enter new countries we will be welcoming new stakeholders to our business. We will look to embed high standards of governance into our new operations from the outset. In addition, we are adapting the way we operate as the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Governance Code’) itself develops. The latest version of the Governance Code was published in September 2012 and although this applies to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2012, we are already responding to the Governance Code’s changing requirements. Finally, I am pleased to report once again that the Company has complied with the 2010 Governance Christopher Rodrigues Code throughout 2012 and details of how we have Chairman done this and applied the principles of the Governance Code are set out in the Corporate Governance Statement which follows. The Board is committed to ensuring that the Group continues to operate, maintain and develop effective systems of governance both in the UK and overseas. As we move forward with the implementation of our strategy for growth, it is more important than ever Christopher Rodrigues that we promote effective governance at all levels Chairman throughout the organisation. 38 International Personal Finance plc This constitutes the Company’s Corporate Governance Statement and explains how the Company applied the main principles set out in Sections A-E of the Governance Code published by the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) and dated June 2010 in the financial year ended 31 December 2012. The Governance Code (June 2010) is available on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk. Statement of compliance with the Governance Code The Board is of the opinion that the Company complied with all the provisions of the 2010 Governance Code throughout 2012.

He became Chief Executive Officer following John Harnett leaving the Board on 31 March 2012. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 39 Corporate Governance Statement continued Matters reserved to the Board The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved specifically to it for decision. Group strategy and risk appetite; approval of results; approval of budgets; approval of dividends; approval of major transactions; treasury policies; approval and amendment of a prospectus and approval and issuance of bonds and notes; Board appointments and appointments to Board Committees; health and safety and environmental policy; corporate governance; annual review of the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control; approval of directors’ conflicts of interest; and certain credit policies; namely policies in respect of repeat lending, provisioning, write-off and material changes to product structure and pricing. The Board has approved a statement of the division of responsibilities between the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Independent Director. The Chairman is responsible for chairing board meetings and monitoring their effectiveness, and chairing the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) and Nomination Committee. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for developing and implementing the strategy agreed by the Board and for all executive matters (apart from those reserved to the Board and the Board Committees) and will delegate accordingly. The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they have concerns which contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Finance Director has failed to address or for whom such contact is inappropriate. There are five principal Board Committees. Their written terms of reference are available on the Company’s website (www.ipfin.co.uk) and from the Company Secretary. Chairman The Chairman is also Chairman of VisitBritain and a non-executive director of Ladbrokes plc. There were no changes to his significant commitments in 2012. Non-executive directors The independent non-executive directors have been appointed for a fixed period of three years, subject to re-election by shareholders. The initial period may be extended for a further period. Their letters of appointment may be inspected at the Company’s registered office and are available from the Company Secretary. Each of the non-executive directors, with the exception of Charles Gregson up until the end of his final term of office in May 2012, has been formally determined by the Board to be independent for the purposes of the Code. Re-election of directors Under the Company’s Articles of Association, each director must offer himself/herself for re-election every three years. After nine years a director, other than an executive director, must offer himself/herself for re-election annually. A director who is initially appointed by the Board is subject to election at the next AGM. The Company has decided that in accordance with best corporate governance practice all directors, other than those who are leaving, will offer themselves for re-election again this year. Details of the directors, including the reasons for proposing their election/re-election, are contained in the Chairman’s letter to shareholders which will accompany the Notice of AGM. 40 International Personal Finance plc Terms of non-executive directors The outstanding terms of office of the non-executive directors are shown below: 2013 2014 2015 2016 May June July February John Tony Richard Edyta Directors’ Report: Governance Lorimer Hales Moat Kurek Nicholas Page First Second First Second term ends term ends term ends term ends Policy on other Board appointments The Board has approved a policy on other directorships; any request for an exception to this is considered on its merits. An executive director will be permitted to hold one non-executive directorship (and to retain the fees from that appointment) provided that the Board considers this will not adversely affect his/her executive responsibilities. The Company’s policy is that the Chairman and the non-executive directors should have sufficient time to fulfil their duties, including chairing a Board Committee as appropriate. A non-executive director should not hold more than four other material non-executive directorships. If he/she holds an executive role in another FTSE 350 company, he/she should not hold more than two other material non-executive directorships. Company Secretary and independent advice All directors are able to consult with the Company Secretary. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board. The Company Secretary is secretary to the Board Committees (other than the Disclosure Committee of which the Assistant Company Secretary is Secretary). There is a formal procedure by which any director may take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense relating to the performance of his/her duties. Meetings Eight board meetings and a strategy retreat are scheduled for 2013. A detailed agenda and a pack of board papers are made available electronically to each director a week before each meeting so he/she has sufficient time to review them. Additional meetings are convened if required and there is contact between meetings where necessary. The Chairman has held a number of sessions with the non-executive directors without executive directors present, and the non-executive directors have met without the Chairman. Board performance evaluation As part of its best practice approach to corporate governance the Board carried out board performance evaluation for 2012 with members of the Board completing an internal questionnaire, the results of which were collated by the Company Secretary. The Board formally considered diversity as part of this evaluation. Board performance evaluation then formed part of the agenda for the January 2013 board meeting and this will be followed by a further facilitated session to agree action points to improve further the efficiency of board meetings. As short-term market volatility has eased, the Board has agreed to spend more time on strategic direction designed to build long-term competitive advantage addressing new channels and product innovation. The board also recognises that diversity in its widest sense is desirable. Under the 2012 Governance Code, evaluation should be externally facilitated at least every three years. External evaluation was undertaken for 2010 by Professor Stuart Timperley, who carried out further follow-up meetings for 2011. The Company is, therefore, in compliance with the revised Code in this respect. Professor Timperley has no other connection with the Company. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 41 Corporate Governance Statement continued Training The Company’s policy is to provide appropriate training to directors, with their training and development needs regularly reviewed and agreed with the Chairman. Training takes into account each individual’s qualifications and experience and includes environmental, social and governance training as appropriate. Training also covers generic and specific business topics and in 2012 included presentations for the Board on subjects such as legislative changes. The Board also collectively visited Mexico and Poland to enhance understanding of local operations and, in addition to regular executive director visits, individual non-executive directors visited other markets during the year including Poland and the Czech Republic. The Company Secretary maintains a register of training for each director which is reviewed by the Board. A comprehensive individually tailored induction plan is prepared for new directors. Relations with shareholders The executive directors meet with institutional shareholders on a regular basis. The Chairman and Senior Independent Director also meet with shareholders from time to time. The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that appropriate channels of communication are established between the executive directors and shareholders and for ensuring that the views of shareholders are made known to the entire Board. The Board receives regular updates on investor relations. The Board seeks to present the Company’s position and prospects clearly. The Annual Report and Financial Statements, circulars and announcements made by the Company to the London Stock Exchange are posted on the Company’s website (www.ipfin.co.uk). Shareholders, whatever the size of their shareholding, are able to express their views via email or telephone with the Investor Relations Manager. The Company gives at least 20 working days’ notice of the AGM. Its policy is that the Chairman of each of the Board Committees will be available to answer questions from shareholders and there is an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions on each resolution proposed. Details of proxy votes are made available to shareholders and other interested parties by means of an announcement to the London Stock Exchange and on the Company’s website.

This included agreement of the candidate specification, the appointment of search consultants, consideration of candidates and recommendation of the favoured candidate to the Board.

It has introduced a new policy whereby search consultants are requested, where practical and appropriate, to ensure that at least 50% of the long list of candidates is female.

The Committee also meets from time to time with the internal audit firm and the external auditor without an executive director or member of the Company’s senior management being present. The Head of Compliance and Risk reports directly to the Chairman of the Committee, which ensures that his independence from the management and operation of the business is maintained. The Chairman of the Committee, Nicholas Page, has a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics and is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The Chairman is regarded as having relevant and recent experience for the purposes of the Governance Code. Further details of the members, including their qualifications, are set out in the section ‘Our Board and Committees’.

These now include the duty, where requested by the Board, to provide advice on whether the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. The Board did not request this advice for 2012 but the Committee now has the authority to provide this in the future. Overview of the year In 2012, the Committee focused its oversight on the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control and the identification, evaluation and management of the principal risks and uncertainties it faces. The Committee invited the Board as a whole to attend meetings focused on risk and provided open, honest and effective challenge to executive management to ensure, for example, that the Group’s approach to risk was appropriate and an effective control environment was in place. 44 International Personal Finance plc Further development of the Group’s overall governance framework continued in 2012, and activities carried out as part of the 2012 audit plan reviewed the effectiveness of this groundwork and reviewed the effectiveness of the overall system of internal controls as well as looking at key areas of interest to the Group, including sustainability, data protection, responsible lending and regulatory compliance with findings reported back to, and discussed with, the Committee. Directors’ Report: Governance Members of the Committee ensured they were well-versed in key areas of the business and representatives from both the UK and overseas were invited to attend and present at a number of the Committee’s meetings. Presentations covered collections and debt recovery, reputational research and the results of PricewaterhouseCoopers (‘PwC’) audit report on sustainability. Work in 2012 Each year two of the meetings are focused solely on risk. These are normally attended by the Chairman and the executive directors. The remaining meetings cover audit-related matters and the other areas within the remit of the Committee. There is a co-sourced internal audit function operating under the direction of the Head of Compliance and Risk. Internal audit functions exist in all the businesses with the focus of their work being centred on the assessment of core controls in both the field operations and the head office environments along with a number of thematic audits covering areas of special interest. The key area of work of the in-house internal audit function related to reviewing the existence, effectiveness and operation of the core controls across the business as well as performing thematic work of special interest. In addition, PwC performs internal audits where specialist knowledge is required. During 2012 the following reviews were carried out by the co-sourced internal audit function: Internal Audits ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ lending practices; and operational management turnover; ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ compliance; ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ During 2012 the Committee also: ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ a number of reports from the internal audit functions on specific areas of the business; ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ in the half-year report (July); ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ reviews in each of the countries, together with the key corporate functions in the UK (December); ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ risks and uncertainties facing the Group, which are shown on pages 32 to 35, and plans and measures to mitigate the impact of these risks; ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ development and strengthening of the Group’s overall governance framework and refresh of its corporate policies, Group corporate affairs, collections and arrears management, non-financial data assurance, and information security; and ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ Independence of auditors The Committee ensures that the external auditor is, and is perceived to be, independent and has taken various steps to seek to ensure that this is, and remains, the case. The Committee considers a statement of independence from the external auditor once each year. The Committee has adopted a policy on the appointment of employees from the auditor to positions within the various Group finance departments. This regulates the employment of key members of the audit engagement team as Finance Director or in certain other senior Group finance roles. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 45 Corporate Governance Statement continued The Committee has adopted a policy on the use of the external auditor for non-audit work: ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ an independent audit and is perceived to be independent by the Group’s shareholders and stakeholders; ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ of Compliance and Risk and such work is awarded only when, by virtue of knowledge, skills or experience, the auditor is clearly to be preferred over alternative suppliers; ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ awarded to the auditor without the prior approval of the Chairman of the Committee, such approval to be given only in exceptional circumstances; ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ an aggregate cost of £30,000 or more; ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ Standards for Auditors; and ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ auditor in 2012 are set out in note 4 of the notes to the Financial Statements. The non-audit services carried out by Deloitte in 2012 were as follows: Work carried out Fee £000 Taxation compliance services 12 Other assurance services 57 Total 69 Appointment of auditors It is the Company’s policy at least once every ten years, or more often at the discretion of the Committee, to undertake a formal tendering exercise of the audit contract. The purpose of the tender is to benchmark the quality and effectiveness of the services provided by the incumbent auditor against those offered by other firms, with the aim of obtaining the best quality and most effective external audit. The last tender concluded in mid-March 2011 and Deloitte was appointed auditor with effect from 11 May 2011. There were no contractual obligations that restricted the Committee’s choice of auditor. At its February 2013 meeting, the Committee recommended the reappointment of Deloitte to the Board. A resolution to reappoint Deloitte as auditor will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM. Internal control and risk management Risk management process Whilst the Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control, it has delegated to the Audit Committee the review of the controls and their effectiveness. Any system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board has approved a Risk Appetite Statement. This sets out Group risks, the Group’s risk appetite and the principal actions undertaken to mitigate the impact of each risk. More recently the Board has approved an updated statement of principal risks and uncertainties. The Board approves a detailed budget each year (usually in December) for the year ahead. It also approves outline projections for the subsequent four years. Actual performance against budget is monitored in detail regularly and reported monthly for review by the directors. The Board requires its subsidiaries to operate in accordance with corporate policies. The Risk Advisory Group, which consists of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Finance Director, Group Legal Director and Head of Compliance and Risk, meets four times a year. It reports to the Audit and Risk Committee and considers the risk assessments and risk registers produced in each country and updates the Group risk register and principal risks and uncertainties. It considers areas of specific risk and particular issues. The Audit and Risk Committee considers the Group risk register and the nature and extent of the risks facing the Group. It reviews the principal risks and uncertainties and the framework to manage and mitigate such risks and reports to the Board on a regular basis. 46 International Personal Finance plc The Audit and Risk Committee keeps under review the adequacy of internal financial controls in conjunction with the Head of Compliance and Risk and the internal audit firm and reports to the Board regularly. The operation of internal financial controls is further monitored, including a procedure by which operating companies certify compliance quarterly. The Consolidated Financial Statements for the Group are prepared by aggregating submissions from each Directors’ Report: Governance statutory entity. Prior to submission to the Group reporting team, the individual country submissions are reviewed and approved by the Finance Director of the relevant country. Once the submissions have been aggregated and consolidation adjustments made to remove intercompany transactions, the consolidated result is reviewed by the Finance Director. The results are compared to the budget and prior year figures and any significant variances are clarified. Checklists are completed by each statutory entity and by the Group reporting team to confirm that all required controls, such as key reconciliations, have been performed and reviewed. The Financial Statements, which are agreed directly to the consolidation of the Group results, are prepared by the Group reporting team and reviewed by the Finance Director. The supporting notes to the Financial Statements, which cannot all be agreed directly to the consolidation, are prepared by aggregating submission templates from each market and combining this with central information where applicable. The Financial Statements and all supporting notes are reviewed and approved by the Group Head of Finance and the Finance Director; these are signed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Finance Director. Review of effectiveness In accordance with the Guidance on Audit Committees issued by the FRC and last updated in September 2012, the Committee on behalf of the Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s framework of internal controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems during 2012. The process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group was in place throughout 2012 and up to 6 March 2013. The Board also, where appropriate, ensures that necessary actions have been or are being taken to remedy significant failings or weaknesses identified from the review of the effectiveness of internal control. The Committee has also undertaken a review of its own effectiveness and concluded that it is effective. Report on environmental, social and governance (‘ESG’) matters During the year, the Company and its subsidiaries made donations of £94,000 for (UK) charitable purposes. Community investment across the Group totalled £891,000 in cash, employee time, management costs and in-kind contributions to charitable and community investment organisations. A further £74,000 was raised through leverage (including fundraising and matched funding). The Group’s community data is reported in line with the London Benchmarking Group methodology and is independently assured by the Corporate Citizenship Company. No political donations were made. The Board takes regular account of the significance of ESG matters to the Group and has identified and assessed the significance of ESG risks to the Company’s short and long-term value as part of the risk management process. It recognises that a proactive programme of reputation management through a range of progressive, responsible business initiatives adds to the sustainable long-term value of the Company. Responsibility for this area rests with the Chief Executive Officer, who chairs the Reputational Management Committee which sets guidance, provides direction and oversees policies and progress to ensure that the Company is a leader in its approach to ESG matters. Key ESG issues for the business that impact upon its stakeholders are: public perception and ensuring work with communities is relevant; social and financial exclusion; health and safety; business ethics in emerging markets; and attracting and retaining skilled and well-motivated labour. Adequate information is received by the Board to make an assessment of key ESG issues. Corporate affairs activity, health and safety and people management issues were all discussed at board meetings in 2012. The Board formally reviews a sustainability report at least once a year. Details of training for directors are set out in the training section of this Corporate Governance Statement. The Board is committed to diversity both at Board level and throughout the organisation. This commitment is to diversity in its broadest sense rather than simply in the context of gender. Given that the corporate office is in the UK but the businesses are across Central Europe and Mexico, diversity of nationality is regarded as an important factor. The Board remains committed to ensuring it has a diverse composition. However, it is not considered appropriate to set formal targets in respect of gender. The Company collects data in respect of the number of women at different levels and thus will be able to keep the position under review. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 47 Corporate Governance Statement continued There is a range of appropriate corporate standards, policies and governance structures covering all operations. In terms of employment, the Group is an equal opportunity employer and it is the Group’s policy that no job applicant, member of staff or agent will receive less favourable treatment because of race, colour, nationality, ethnic or other national origin, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, age, disability or religion. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that individuals are selected, promoted and treated on the basis of their relevant merits and abilities. As at 31 December 2012 the percentage of women employees at different levels within the Group was as follows: Level % of women Group Board 13 Level immediately below the Group Board 8 Senior management level 27 Middle management level 30 Junior management level 37 Group as a whole 50 Note: Agents in Hungary (who are employees, unlike the position in the other markets) have been excluded. The Group attaches great importance to the health and safety of its employees, agents and other people who may be affected by its activities. The Board has approved a policy and a framework for health and safety and introduced the international health and safety standard OHSAS 18001 across all businesses with the aim of full accreditation by the end of 2013. It has established a Group Safety Committee and a Group Loss Prevention Committee. These Committees report annually to the Board by means of a written report. Each subsidiary board is responsible for the issue and implementation of its own health and safety policy as it affects the subsidiary company’s day-to-day responsibility for health and safety. Health and safety is considered regularly at board meetings within the Group. Community investment and environmental data are verified externally. The environmental management system is also subject to an annual independent internal audit against the requirements of ISO 14001. The Remuneration Committee is able to consider performance on ESG issues when setting the remuneration of executive directors and, where relevant, ESG matters are incorporated into the performance management systems and remuneration incentives of local business management. When setting incentives, the Remuneration Committee takes account of all implications, including the need to avoid inadvertently motivating inappropriate behaviour, and the Head of Compliance and Risk reviews incentives from a risk perspective. In 2012, the executive directors were given specific objectives relating to ESG issues for the purposes of the annual bonus scheme. Details of the bonus scheme are set out in the bonus section of the statement of the Company’s policy on directors’ remuneration in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. Full information on specific ESG matters, and how these are managed, can be found in the Sustainability section of the Company’s website (www.ipfin.co.uk). Share capital information On 31 December 2012, there were 249,425,087 ordinary shares of 10 pence each in issue. No shares were issued during the year. 7,792,801 ordinary shares, with a nominal value of £779,280 representing 3.03% of the Company’s called up share capital, were bought back and cancelled during 2012. The total consideration paid under the buyback programme, excluding costs, was £24,826,100. The ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange and can be held in certificated or uncertificated form. The full rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, in addition to those conferred on their holders by law, are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, a copy of which can be viewed on the Company’s website or obtained by writing to the Company Secretary or from Companies House in the UK. A summary of those rights and obligations can be found below. The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s Annual Report and Financial Statements, to attend and speak at general meetings of the Company, to appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights. 48 International Personal Finance plc The directors are responsible for the management of the Company and may exercise all the powers of the Company, subject to the provisions of the relevant statutes and the Company’s Articles of Association. For example, the Articles of Association contain specific provisions and restrictions regarding the Company’s powers to borrow money; provisions relating to the appointment of directors, subject to subsequent shareholder approval; delegation of powers to a director or committees; and, subject to certain exceptions, a director shall not vote on or be counted in a quorum in relation to any resolution of the Board in respect of any contract in Directors’ Report: Governance which he/she has an interest which he/she knows is material. Changes to the Articles of Association must be approved by the shareholders in accordance with the legislation in force from time to time. There are no restrictions on voting rights except as set out in the Articles of Association (in circumstances where the shareholder has not complied with a statutory notice or paid up what is due on the shares). There are no restrictions on the transfer (including requirements for prior approval of any transfers) or limitations on the holding of ordinary shares subject to the fact that the Board may refuse to register the transfer of: ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ authority. There are no known arrangements under which financial rights are held by a person other than the holder of the shares. Shares to be acquired through the Company’s share plans rank pari passu with the shares in issue and have no special rights. The Company operates an employee trust with an independent trustee, Appleby Trust (Jersey) Limited, to hold shares pending employees becoming entitled to them under the Company’s share incentive plans. On 31 December 2012, the trustee held 3,244,706 shares in the Company. The trust waives its dividend entitlement and abstains from voting the shares at general meetings. Agreements on change of control The Company does not have any agreements with any director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover. The Company is not party to any significant agreements that would take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control following a takeover bid, apart from: ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ and the ability of a lender to cancel its commitment and for outstanding amounts to become due and payable; ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ redeem such holder’s Notes if there is a change of control of the Company and, following such change of control, the Notes are downgraded; ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ such holder’s Notes if there is a change of control of the Company and following such change of control the Euro Medium Term Notes are then downgraded (or if no such Notes are then outstanding, in certain other circumstances); and ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ to vest on a takeover. ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ issued in August 2010 with a five-year term and an 11.5% coupon; Romanian lei 36.5 million issued in February 2011 with a three-year term and a 12.0% coupon; Czech crown 100 million issued in July 2012 with a four-year term and a 9.0% coupon; Czech crown 280 million issued in July 2012 with a three-year term and an 8.5% coupon; and, subsequent to the 2012 year end, Hungarian forint 4 billion issued in January 2013 with a five-year term and an 11.0% coupon. ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ they mature on 30 June 2015 and the coupon is a floating rate of six-month WIBOR plus a margin of 750 basis points.

The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Approved by the Board on 6 March 2013. Ben Murphy Company Secretary 6 March 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 53 A statement to shareholders from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2012, which has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board. The main work of the Committee this year has involved a review of incentives for executive directors and senior executives, focusing in particular on the long-term elements. The objective has been to put in place a remuneration framework that will focus the key executives on driving the Company strategy over the short, medium and long-term which in turn will drive performance for shareholders. Following a review of existing arrangements, which included feedback from senior executives, it was felt that the absolute total shareholder return (‘TSR’) measure in the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) and Deferred Share Plan (‘DSP’) matching shares should be complemented with the key drivers of TSR to provide a more motivational incentive for executives whilst maintaining shareholder alignment. The Committee believes a sensible balance is for one third of long-term incentive awards to vest on each of three measures; TSR, earnings per share (‘EPS’) and growth in revenue net of impairment. To reflect the Committee’s desire to ensure that executive directors are incentivised sufficiently to deliver long-term, sustainable growth and that the balance between fixed and variable elements of remuneration is Tony Hales at the right level, the normal maximum award size under Chairman of the Remuneration Committee the PSP will be increased to 125% (from 100%).

This is the Directors’ Remuneration Report of International Personal Finance plc (‘the Company’) which has been prepared pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 420 of the Companies Act 2006 (‘the Companies Act’) and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. In accordance with Section 439 of the Companies Act, an advisory resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the annual general meeting (‘AGM’) of the Company to be held on 25 April 2013. The detail in this report sets out how the remuneration principles have been applied in 2012. We support fully the focus on transparency in the new disclosure regulations for UK listed companies proposed by BIS, which are due to take effect from October 2013. The Company has, therefore, decided to structure the 2012 report to incorporate voluntarily as many of the proposed features as practicable this year. Policy section Key principles of the remuneration policy The Committee is committed to establishing an appropriate, open and transparent remuneration policy, as this is key to driving business performance and aligning the interests of senior management and shareholders. The policy applied by the Committee reflects the need to attract, motivate and retain talent via remuneration Directors’ Remuneration Report at appropriate market levels, and recognises the need for prudence and effective risk management in its reward structures. In setting the policy and making remuneration decisions, the Committee takes into account pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group as well as shareholder views. The remuneration policy is founded on the following principles: ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ to an assessment of comparable positions from a cross-section of companies drawn from a combination of relevant broad equity index, similar market capitalisation and broadly comparable sector profile; ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ median will be appropriate to retain key talent; ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ be no minimum bonus guarantees; ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ to ensure clear links to long-term performance, with suitably demanding targets aligned with the objective of creating sustainable shareholder value.

There are no provisions for compensation payable on early termination. Executive directors Gerard Ryan has a service agreement dated 17 January 2012, when he became CEO (Designate). He became CEO following John Harnett leaving the Board on 31 March 2012. David Broadbent has a service agreement dated 21 June 2007, as varied on 11 December 2009 and in December 2010. Each of these service agreements is terminable upon one year’s notice from the relevant director or the Company. The Company may terminate employment by making a payment in lieu of notice equivalent to the value of base salary and contractual benefits in respect of the notice period. There are no provisions giving the director a right to specified compensation payable on early termination. However, in the event that a director is not re-elected at an AGM of the Company, the agreement is automatically terminated and this is treated as a breach by the Company. John Harnett was CEO until 31 March 2012. Up to that point, he had a service agreement dated 19 June 2007, as varied on 22 October 2008 and 11 December 2009. Non-executive directors A non-executive director is appointed for three years, subject to re-election by shareholders. The initial threeyear period may be extended. The Company can terminate the appointment on three months’ notice. Charles Gregson had a letter of appointment dated 12 June 2007 (as amended by letters dated 12 May 2010 and 11 May 2011) and was appointed until 9 May 2012. He stood down at the 2012 AGM. Tony Hales and Nicholas Page each has a letter of appointment dated 12 June 2007 (as amended by a letter dated 12 May 2010) and have been appointed until 30 June 2013. Edyta Kurek has a letter of appointment dated 15 February 2010 (as amended by a letter dated 28 February 2013) and has been appointed until 28 February 2016. John Lorimer has a letter of appointment dated 12 May 2010 and has been appointed until 31 May 2013. Richard Moat has a letter of appointment dated 25 June 2012 and has been appointed until 30 June 2015. Election of directors At the AGM, Richard Moat will be standing for election and all the remaining directors, with the exception of John Lorimer who is leaving the Board, will be offering themselves for re-election. Termination payments The Company’s policy is to limit severance payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements. In the event that the employment of an executive director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined having regard to the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans. Under normal circumstances, good leavers who do not serve notice are eligible to receive termination payments in lieu of notice based on base salary and contractual benefits. The notice period for both executive directors is one year. The Company normally expects executive directors upon departure to mitigate their loss. In any specific case that may arise, the Committee will consider carefully any compensatory payments having regard to performance, age, service, health or other circumstances that may be relevant. In the event an executive leaves for reasons of death, injury, disability, change of control of the Company, or any other reason which the Committee in its absolute discretion permits, any outstanding DSP matching shares and PSP awards will normally be pro-rated for time and performance. At the AGM, the Committee will be asking shareholders to approve an amendment to the rules to allow discretion to permit early vesting/ exercising of awards in certain circumstances. For all other leavers, outstanding PSP awards and DSP matching shares will lapse. The Committee retains discretion to alter these provisions (as permitted by the relevant Plan Rules) on a case-by-case basis following a review of circumstances and to ensure fairness for both shareholders and participants. 58 International Personal Finance plc Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis The following charts show the potential split between the different elements of the executive directors’ remuneration under three different performance scenarios: ‘Fixed’, ‘On target’ and ‘Maximum’.

While the Company does not consult directly with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay, the Committee does receive and take account of employee engagement results as part of their overall assessment of executive performance. The Company regards its measure of engagement an effective barometer of employee opinion and in the most recent survey an improvement in overall engagement was recorded, with Hungary in particular reporting world class levels of engagement, (using Gallup Q12®). Considerations of shareholder views When determining remuneration, the Committee also takes into account the guidelines of investor bodies and shareholder views. The Committee considers these to be of great importance. In late 2012, the Company consulted a number of its major shareholders and shareholder representative bodies in order to discuss proposed changes to its long-term incentive arrangements. We received valuable feedback from a number of key shareholders and took this into account in finalising the proposals. As outlined in the Implementation Report below, the Company received strong support from its shareholders with a 98.84% vote in favour of last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report. The Committee continues to be mindful of shareholder views when determining ongoing remuneration strategy, and commits to undergoing shareholder consultation in advance of any significant changes to remuneration policy. Implementation Report Audited information The following sections of this Implementation Report contain audited information in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006: total remuneration; pensions and exit payments made in year.

The Committee met nine times. The CEO normally attends and speaks at meetings of the Committee (other than when his own remuneration or any matter relating to him is being considered). No director is involved in determining his/her own remuneration. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee and attended the meetings of the Committee in 2012. The Human Resources Director also attended the meetings of the Committee and provides advice to the Committee. Adviser to the Committee Kepler Associates (‘Kepler’) is the remuneration adviser to the Committee. During the year, Kepler provided independent advice on remuneration matters including incentive design, current market practice, targetsetting and monitoring of total shareholder return. Kepler is independent and does not provide any other services to the Group. The fees paid to Kepler in respect of work carried out in 2012 (based on time and materials) totalled £48,234 (excl. VAT). 60 International Personal Finance plc Total remuneration To aid transparency to our shareholders, the table below sets out the total remuneration received by each director for the year to 31 December 2012.

The base salaries per annum during 2012 were: Gerard Ryan: £450,000 David Broadbent: £310,000 John Harnett: £480,000 In February 2013, the Committee reviewed the salaries of the executive directors and determined their new salaries with effect from 1 April 2013 will be as follows: Gerard Ryan: £463,500 David Broadbent: £319,300 Pensions The Company has two pension schemes, the International Personal Finance plc Pension Scheme (‘the Pension Scheme’) and the International Personal Finance Stakeholder Pension Scheme (‘the Stakeholder Scheme’). New employees are eligible to join the Stakeholder Scheme. The rate of company pension contribution for any executive director is 20% of basic salary. At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, part may be paid as a cash allowance. Executive directors are entitled currently to receive a contribution of 20% of basic salary to their pension arrangements. John Harnett, the previous CEO, was entitled to receive a contribution of 25% of his basic salary into his pension arrangements. The Company’s contributions in respect of Gerard Ryan during 2012 amounted to £86,310, all which was paid into pension arrangements. The Company’s contributions in respect of John Harnett during 2012 amounted to £27,878, of which £12,500 was paid into pension arrangements and £15,378 was paid as a cash allowance. David Broadbent was a member of the final salary section of the Pension Scheme until 1 April 2006 when he began to accrue benefits as a member of the cash balance section. He ceased to be a member of the cash balance section on 31 July 2008 and became a deferred member of the Pension Scheme. David Broadbent is now entitled to receive a contribution of 20% of his basic salary to his pension arrangements. The Company’s contributions in respect of David Broadbent during 2012 amounted to £60,545, of which £50,000 was paid into pension arrangements and £10,545 was paid as a cash allowance. 62 International Personal Finance plc Details of David Broadbent’s entitlements under both sections of the pension scheme are as follows: Final salary £ Accrued pension at 31 December 2012 14,108 Accrued pension at 31 December 2011 (restated) 13,411 Increase in accrued pension during the year (net of inflation) – Transfer value of net increase in accrual over period – Transfer value of accrued pension at 31 December 2012 165,062 Transfer value of accrued pension at 31 December 2011 (restated) 163,120 Total change in transfer value during the period (net of director’s contributions) 1,942 Director’s contributions in 2012 – Cash balance £ Accrued cash balance lump sum at 31 December 2012 100,573 Accrued cash balance lump sum at 31 December 2011 (restated) 95,602 Increase in cash balance lump sum during the year (net of inflation) – Transfer value of net increase in accrual over period – Transfer value at 31 December 2012 47,045 Directors’ Remuneration Report Transfer value at 31 December 2011 (restated) 44,291 Total change in transfer value during the period (net of director’s contributions) 2,754 Director’s contributions in 2012 – David Broadbent was age 44 at the end of the year. He became a deferred member of the pension scheme on 1 August 2008. The figures as at 31 December 2011 have been restated to reflect advice received about which measure of price inflation to use in the calculation of benefits. Annual bonus The maximum award for both the CEO and Finance Director in 2012 was 100% of salary (80% of salary for on target performance). During 2012, a balanced scorecard approach was used for the annual bonus whereby 50% of the bonus was calculated on pre-tax profit and, subject always to a minimum profit threshold, the remaining 50% calculated against stretching performance objectives based on the following areas: growth and development; culture and leadership; operational effectiveness; people; customer experience; and brand and reputation. The award for achievement of performance objectives is expressed as a percentage of the award for profit, and so scaled up or down (from 0x to 1x) according to the profit achievement. Over the period, profit before tax and exceptional items was £95.1 million, which was between target and maximum. The Committee also reviewed the performance of the CEO and Finance Director against their agreed personal objectives for 2012. After consideration, the Committee awarded bonuses to the executive directors in the amounts shown below for the year ended 31 December 2012: Financial Individual Cash and DSP objectives – objectives – shares award – as achievement as achievement as DSP – face value Total value of a percentage of a percentage of a percentage of Cash bonus – of shares due to 2012 annual maximum bonus Executive base salary base salary £000 vest in 2016 bonus – £000 available Gerard Ryan 40% 40% 115 231 346 80% David Broadbent 40% 40% 83 166 249 80% The Committee did not apply any discretion in relation to the bonus awards. The bonus was payable one third in cash, and two thirds in deferred shares which will vest at the end of a three-year period, subject to the director not being dismissed for misconduct. There are also provisions for clawback during the vesting period in the event of a restatement of the Company’s Financial Statements or material misjudgment of performance. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 63 Directors’ Remuneration Report continued PSP Awards made during the year Executive directors and senior management all participate in this plan. Awards are generally made as nil-cost options over a specific number of shares, and vest after a three-year performance period with vesting determined by performance targets and employment conditions. 50% of vested awards will be released after the end of the performance period, with 50% deferred for an additional 12 months. Awards made up to the end of 2012 vest based on absolute TSR performance. In addition to meeting the TSR target, for any shares to vest the Committee will need to satisfy itself that the absolute TSR performance is a fair reflection of performance, specifically with regard to the Company’s TSR relative to the median TSR of the FTSE 250. Type of award Performance share award Basis of award CEO: 150% of salary (reflecting his appointment during the year); Finance Director: 100% of salary Face value of award CEO: £675,000 Finance Director: £310,000 Performance period 3 years from the date of grant Performance conditions Absolute TSR growth Threshold 30% TSR over 3 years 33% vests Maximum 60% TSR over 3 years 100% vests Awards vesting during the year 2012 was not the last year of any PSP performance period for any of the executive directors who served in the year. No award under the PSP is due to vest for any executive director until 2013 (subject to performance). DSP Awards made during the year Awards are granted in respect of the deferred element of the annual bonus. The award shares are eligible for a match. The match is one-for-one for executive directors and one-for-three for other members of the Senior Management Group. There are no performance conditions in respect of deferred shares granted in respect of the deferred element of the 2011 bonus scheme. The corresponding matching awards will vest only to the extent that the performance condition is satisfied, namely absolute growth in TSR on the same basis as for the PSP as set out in the section above. Type of award Deferred share award Face value of deferred and CEO: n/a as was appointed during the year matching awards granted in 2012 Finance Director: deferred: £143,034; matching: £143,034 Performance period (matching only) 3 years from the date of grant Performance conditions (matching only) Absolute TSR growth Threshold 30% TSR over 3 years 33% vests Maximum 60% TSR over 3 years 100% vests Awards vesting during the year 2012 was not the last year of any DSP performance period for any of the executive directors who served in the year. No award under the DSP is due to vest for any executive director until 2014 (subject to performance). 64 International Personal Finance plc Other share schemes The CSOP The CSOP is an HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme. The use of these options may enable part of a UK-based executive or senior manager’s rewards from share plans to be received with relief from income tax and national insurance contributions within the thresholds permitted by HM Revenue & Customs, which allows options over shares with a value of £30,000 at the time of option grant to be held by an individual under the CSOP at any time. Where an individual who receives CSOP share options also participates in an award made under the PSP, the award under the PSP is scaled back appropriately to reflect the grant of CSOP share options, and grants made under both plans have the same performance conditions for vesting. The SAYE Scheme The executive directors (together with other UK Group employees) with six months service or more may participate in the SAYE Scheme, which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs. Participants save a fixed sum each month for three or five years and may use these funds to purchase shares after three, five or seven years. The exercise price is fixed at up to 20% below the market value of the shares at the date directors and employees are invited to participate in the scheme. Up to £250 can be saved each month. This scheme does not contain performance conditions as it is an HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme open to employees at all levels. Exit payments made in year Directors’ Remuneration Report John Harnett ceased to be a director on 31 March 2012. Pursuant to a compromise agreement made on 17 January 2012, by March 2013 he will have received £626,770 which represents 12 months’ pay in lieu of notice (salary and contractual benefits) paid monthly in instalments. This was subject to a pound for pound offset if alternative employment (excluding non-executive directorships) was secured during that period. He was also eligible for a tailored incentive of up to 20% of basic salary linked to specific objectives during the period up to 31 March 2012, payment of which was at the discretion of the Committee. The Committee agreed that John Harnett met the full conditions required for the payment of this incentive and authorised full payment thereof amounting to £96,000. In addition, the Committee exercised its discretion to permit John Harnett to retain the award over 14,416 shares granted to him under the CSOP in July 2010, the award over 212,843 shares granted to him under the PSP in July 2010 and the award over 149,626 shares granted to him under the PSP in July 2011. The performance condition will be applied in the usual way at the end of the three-year performance period, but the number of shares which vest will be reduced by being time prorated based on the number of complete months from the date of grant of each award to 31 March 2013 or, had John Harnett secured alternative employment, the date of notification. Half of the award under the CSOP may be exercised within a year of the performance condition being satisfied, with the other half exercisable within a year from the first anniversary of the date the award became exercisable. Half of the award under the PSP may be exercised within a year of the performance condition being satisfied, with the other half exercisable within a year of the anniversary of the end of the relevant performance condition. The Committee considers that the compensation represented a fair settlement of the Company’s contractual and statutory obligations and took account of the director’s duty to mitigate.

The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2012 but do not have any impact on the Group: ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ The following standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group: ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ instruments: recognition and measurement’. IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and is likely to affect the Group’s accounting for its financial assets. The standard is not applicable until 1 January 2015 and has not yet been endorsed by the European Union. The Group is in the process of assessing IFRS 9’s full impact; ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ Accounting convention The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments at fair value. The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, are set out in the following paragraphs. Going concern The directors have, at the time of approving the Financial Statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in the Financial Statements. Further detail is contained in the directors’ statement on page 31. Consolidation These Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial results of all companies which are controlled by the Group. Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. All companies are 100% owned by IPF plc Group companies. A list of the principal subsidiaries in the Group is included in note 12. Finance costs Finance costs comprise the interest on external borrowings which are recognised on an effective interest rate (‘EIR’) basis, and gains or losses on derivative contracts taken to the income statement. 76 International Personal Finance plc Segment reporting The Group’s operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of operating segments, has been identified as the Board. This information is geographical. A geographical segment is a component of the Group that operates within a particular economic environment and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of components operating in other economic environments. Revenue Revenue, which excludes value added tax and intra-Group transactions, comprises revenue earned on amounts receivable from customers. Revenue on customer receivables is calculated using an EIR. The EIR is calculated using estimated cash flows, being contractual payments adjusted for the impact of customers paying early but excluding the anticipated impact of customers paying late or not paying at all. Directly attributable issue costs are also taken into account in calculating the EIR. Interest income continues to be accrued on impaired receivables using the original EIR applied to the loan’s carrying value. The accounting for amounts receivable from customers is considered further below. Leases The leases entered into by the Group are solely operating leases. Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases are classified as operating leases whenever the terms of the lease do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. Other operating costs Other operating costs include agent commission, marketing costs and foreign exchange gains and losses. All other costs are included in administrative expenses. Share-based payments The cost of providing share-based payments to employees is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the award. The corresponding credit is made to retained earnings. The cost is based on the fair value of awards granted, determined using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model. Financial Statements At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves. In the Parent Company Financial Statements, in accordance with IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions’, the fair value of providing share-based payments to employees of subsidiary companies is treated as an increase in the investment in subsidiaries. Exceptional items The Group classifies as exceptional those significant items that are one-off in nature and do not reflect the underlying performance of the Group. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 77 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments Amounts receivable from customers All customer receivables are initially recognised at the amount loaned to the customer plus directly attributable incremental issue costs. After initial recognition, customer receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Amortised cost is the amount of the customer receivable at initial recognition less customer repayments, plus revenue earned calculated using the EIR, less any deduction for impairment. Customer receivables are classified as loans and receivables in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: recognition and measurement’. All customer receivables are assessed for impairment each week. Customer accounts that are in arrears (those that have missed any portion of a contractual payment) are deemed to have demonstrated evidence of impairment and are subject to an impairment review. Impairment is calculated using actuarial models which use historical payment performance to generate the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows from each arrears stage. These estimated future cash flows are discounted to a present value using the original EIR and this figure is compared with the balance sheet value. The unwinding of the discounted value used to compute the impairment is reflected in the interest charged on the impaired loan. Impairment charges in respect of customer receivables are charged to the income statement. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand. Cash also includes those balances held by agents for operational purposes. Bank overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances. Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts, to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s underlying business operations. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken. All derivative financial instruments are assessed against the hedge accounting criteria set out in IAS 39. The majority of the Group’s derivatives are cash flow hedges of highly probable forecast transactions and meet the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. Derivatives are initially recognised at the fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at each reporting date at their fair value. The Group also uses some foreign currency contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting as they do not hedge a specific future transaction. These contracts are used to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the reported results. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, movements in their fair value are recognised immediately within the income statement. The Group discontinued its policy of hedging foreign currency profits from 2013. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges and where the hedge accounting criteria are met, the effective portion of changes in the fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement as part of finance costs. Amounts accumulated in equity are recognised in the income statement when the income or expense on the hedged item is recognised in the income statement. The Group discontinues hedge accounting when: ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of any transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the expected life of the borrowings using the EIR. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 78 International Personal Finance plc Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise computer software. Computer software is capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire or develop the specific software and bring it into use. All intangible assets are internally generated. Computer software is amortised (within administrative expenses) on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life which is generally estimated to be five years. The residual values and economic lives are reviewed by management at each balance sheet date. Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, where cost is equal to the fair value of the consideration used to acquire the asset. Investments are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the investment carrying value exceeds the higher of the asset’s value in use or its fair value less costs to sell. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment. Cost represents invoiced cost plus any other costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated to write down assets to their estimated realisable value over their useful economic lives. The following are the principal bases used: Category Depreciation rate Method Fixtures and fittings 10% Straight-line Equipment (including computer hardware) 20% to 33.3% Straight-line Motor vehicles 25% Reducing balance The residual value and useful economic life of all assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. All items of property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised through the income statement for the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds the higher of the asset’s value in use or its fair value less costs to sell. Financial Statements Share capital IPF plc has only ordinary share capital. These shares, with a nominal value of 10 pence per share, are classified as equity. Shares held by employee trust The net amount paid by the employee trust to acquire shares is held in a separate reserve and shown as a reduction in equity. Foreign currency translation Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates (‘the functional currency’). The Group’s financial information is presented in sterling. Transactions that are not denominated in a subsidiary’s functional currency are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Differences arising on translation are charged or credited to the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges. The income statements of the Group subsidiaries (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from sterling are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate and the balance sheets are translated at the exchange rates ruling at each balance sheet date. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 79 Accounting policies continued Upon consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of current and deferred tax. Current tax is calculated based on taxable profit for the year using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the future. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Employee benefits Defined benefit pension plan The charge or credit in the income statement in respect of the defined benefit pension plan comprises the actuarially assessed current service cost of working employees together with the interest charge on pension liabilities offset by the expected return on pension scheme assets. All charges or credits are allocated to administrative expenses. The asset or obligation recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension plan is the fair value of the plan’s assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. Cumulative actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (‘the vesting period’). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Parent Company share of the defined benefit retirement obligation is based on the proportion of total Group contributions made by the Parent Company. Defined contribution plans Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement on an accruals basis. 80 International Personal Finance plc Key assumptions and estimates In applying the accounting policies set out above, the Group makes significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as follows: Amounts receivable from customers The Group reviews its portfolio of customer loans and receivables for impairment every week. The Group makes judgments to determine whether there is objective evidence which indicates that there has been an adverse effect on expected future cash flows. For the purposes of assessing the impairment of customer loans and receivables, customers are categorised into arrears stages as this is considered to be the most reliable predictor of future payment performance. The level of impairment is calculated using actuarial models which use historical payment performance to generate the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows from each arrears stage of each product. The impairment models are reviewed regularly to take account of the current economic environment and recent customer payment performance. However, on the basis that the payment performance of customers could be different from the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows, an adjustment to the carrying value of amounts receivable from customers may be required. To the extent that the net present value of estimated cash flows differs by +/– 5%, it is estimated that amounts receivable from customers would be £32.5 million higher/lower (2011: £28.0 million). IAS 39 requires that all of the cash flows directly associated with financial instruments held at amortised cost must be recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method. When this approach is applied to a customer loan portfolio, judgments must be made to estimate the average life of that portfolio. These judgments are applied, taking into account factors including the terms of the particular products and historical repayment data. These estimates are considered and updated as required in each reporting period to reflect the customer loan portfolio’s expected performance. Retirement benefit asset or obligation A number of judgments and estimates are made in assessing the amount of the retirement benefit asset or obligation at each balance sheet date, the key ones being discount rate, mortality rates, investment returns, salary inflation and the rate of pension increases. These judgments and estimates are derived after taking into account the requirements of IAS 19 ‘Retirement benefit obligations’ and after taking the advice of the Group’s actuaries. Financial Statements Further details on the key assumptions used are set out in note 24. Tax The Group is subject to tax in a number of international jurisdictions as well as the UK. In some cases, due to the unusual features of home credit, the tax treatment of certain items cannot be determined with certainty until the operation has been subject to a tax audit. In some instances, this can be some years after the item has first been reflected in the Financial Statements. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit and enquiry issues based on an assessment of whether such liabilities are likely to fall due. If the outcome of such audits is that the final liability is different to the amount originally estimated, such differences will be recognised in the period in which the audit or enquiry is determined. Any differences may necessitate a material adjustment to the level of tax balances held in the balance sheet. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 81 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.

All revenue comprises amounts earned on amounts receivable from customers. The Group is domiciled in the UK, no revenue is generated in the UK. Total revenue from external customers is £651.7 million (2011: £649.5 million) and the breakdown by geographical area is disclosed above. The total of non-current assets other than financial instruments and deferred tax assets located in the UK is £16.6 million (2011: £17.0 million), and the total of non-current assets located in other countries is £14.9 million (2011: £17.2 million). There is no single external customer from which significant revenue is generated. Expenditure on intangible assets of £1.5 million (2011: £0.5 million) and amortisation of £1.9 million (2011: £3.7 million) all relates to the UK.

The differences are explained as follows: 2012 2011 Group £M £M Profit before taxation 90.3 100.5 Profit before taxation multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 24.5% (2011: 26.5%) 22.1 26.6 Effects of: – adjustment in respect of prior years (7.9) (0.7) – adjustment in respect of foreign tax rates (0.9) (4.2) – expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1.9 5.9 – impact of rate change on deferred tax asset 1.0 (3.6) Total tax expense 16.2 24.0 In 2012 the adjustment in respect of prior years of £7.9 million includes a credit of £8.4 million resulting from a reduction in provisions for uncertain tax positions. This arises as a result of the Group refining its method to reflect the latest best estimate of probable future outflows of economic benefits. Excluding this credit and the credit of £1.1 million on the exceptional item, the total tax expense for 2012 is £25.7 million which represents an effective tax rate on pre-exceptional profit of 27.0%. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 83 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 6. Earnings per share Basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) from continuing operations is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to shareholders of £74.1 million (2011: £76.5 million) by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period of 251.9 million (2011: 253.6 million) which has been adjusted to exclude the weighted average number of shares held by the employee trust. For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of IPF plc ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary share options relating to employees of the Group. The weighted average number of shares used in the basic and diluted EPS calculations can be reconciled as follows: 2012 2011 Group M M Used in basic EPS calculation 251.9 253.6 Dilutive effect of awards 6.9 5.1 Used in diluted EPS calculation 258.8 258.7 Basic and diluted EPS are presented below: 2012 2011 Group pence pence Basic EPS 29.42 30.17 Dilutive effect of awards (0.79) (0.60) Diluted EPS 28.63 29.57 The adjusted earnings per share of 27.6 pence, shown in the financial review, has been presented at a constant 27.0% tax rate and before exceptional items in 2012 in order to better present the performance of the Group. As explained in note 5, the effective tax rate in 2012 was impacted by a one-off adjustment to the tax charge arising from refining the method for providing for uncertain tax provisions and the underlying rate was 27.0%. 7.

The fair value of the consideration issued in exchange for the investment in these international businesses was £663.6 million and this amount was therefore capitalised as a cost of investment. £3.5 million (2011: £2.1 million) has been added to the cost of investment representing the fair value of the share-based payment awards over IPF plc shares made to employees of subsidiary companies of IPF plc. The corresponding credit has been taken to reserves.

All amounts receivable from customers are at fixed interest rates. The average period to maturity of the amounts receivable from customers is 5.4 months (2011: 4.9 months). The Group has one class of loan receivable and no collateral is held in respect of any customer receivables. The Group does not use an impairment provision account for recording impairment losses and, therefore, no analysis of gross customer receivables less provision for impairment is presented. Revenue recognised on amounts receivable from customers which have been impaired was £370.1 million (2011: £378.0 million). The Company has no amounts receivable from customers. 16.

Risks arising from financial instruments Risk management Treasury related risks The Board approves treasury policies and the treasury function manages the day-to-day operations. The Board delegates certain responsibilities to the Treasury Committee. The Treasury Committee, which is chaired by the Finance Director, is empowered to take decisions within that delegated authority. Treasury activities and compliance with the treasury policies are reported to the Board on a regular basis and are subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external. Treasury policies are designed to manage the main financial risks faced by the Group in relation to funding and liquidity risk; interest rate risk; currency risk; and counterparty risk. This is to ensure that the Group is properly funded; that interest rate and currency risk is managed within set limits; and that financial counterparties are of appropriate credit quality. Policies also set out the specific instruments that can be used for risk management. The treasury function enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward currency contracts. The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s underlying business operations. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken and written options may only be used when matched by purchased options. Liquidity risk The Group is subject to the risk that it will not have sufficient borrowing facilities to fund its existing business and its future plans for growth. The short-term nature of the Group’s business means that the majority of amounts receivable from customers are receivable within 12 months with an average period to maturity of less than six months. The risk of not having sufficient liquid resources is therefore low. The treasury policy adopted by the Group serves to reduce this risk further by setting a specific policy parameter that there are sufficient committed debt facilities to cover forecast borrowings plus operational headroom plus appropriate stress-testing for the next 18 months on a rolling basis. Further, the aim is to ensure that there is a balanced refinancing profile with phased maturity dates; that there is diversification of debt funding sources; that there is no over-reliance on a single or small group of lenders; and that the debt facilities are sufficient for the currency requirements of each country. At 31 December 2012, the Group’s bonds and committed borrowing facilities had an average period to maturity of 2.2 years (2011: 2.8 years). As shown in note 19, total undrawn facilities as at 31 December 2012 were £159.5 million (2011: £171.4 million). A maturity analysis of gross borrowings included in the balance sheet is presented in note 19. A maturity analysis of bonds, bank borrowings and overdrafts outstanding at the balance sheet date by non-discounted contractual cash flow, including expected interest payments, is shown below: Group Company Financial Statements 2012 2011 2012 2011 £M £M £M £M Not later than six months 16.1 5.0 11.6 1.2 Later than six months and not later than one year 35.6 33.5 16.9 25.5 Later than one year and not later than two years 42.7 70.0 29.1 42.3 Later than two years and not later than five years 299.8 285.1 215.0 238.5 394.2 393.6 272.6 307.5 The analysis above includes the contractual cash flow for borrowings and the total amount of interest payable over the life of the loan. Where borrowings are subject to a floating interest rate, an estimate of interest payable is taken. The rate is derived from interest rate yield curves at the balance sheet date.

Amounts receivable from customers Risk management policies in respect of amounts receivable from customers are discussed in the credit risk section within this note. Interest rate risk The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates in each of its countries of operation and, therefore, seeks to limit this net exposure. This is achieved by the use of techniques to fix interest costs, including fixed rate funding, (predominantly longer-term bond funding); forward currency contracts used for non-functional currency funding; bank borrowing loan draw-down periods; and interest rate hedging instruments. These techniques are used to hedge the interest costs on a proportion of borrowings over a certain period of time, up to five years, although most hedging is for up to two years. 92 International Personal Finance plc 20. Risks arising from financial instruments continued Interest costs are a relatively low proportion of the Group’s revenue (6.4% in 2012; 6.6% in 2011) and therefore the risk of a material variance arising from a change in interest rates is low. If interest rates across all markets increased by 200 basis points this would have the following impact: 2012 2011 Group £M £M Increase in fair value of derivatives taken to equity 1.7 1.2 Reduction in profit before taxation 0.8 0.4 This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ financial instruments; ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ it is assumed that there is no impact from a change in interest rates; and ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ Currency risk The Group is subject to three types of currency risk: net asset exposure; cash flow exposure; and income statement exposure. Net asset exposure The majority of the Group’s net assets are denominated in currencies other than sterling. The balance sheet is reported in sterling and this means that there is a risk that a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates will have a material impact on the net assets of the Group. The impact in 2012 is an increase in net assets of £11.7 million (2011: reduction of £40.2 million). The Group aims to minimise the value of net assets denominated in each foreign currency by funding overseas receivables with borrowings in local currency, where possible. Cash flow exposure The Group is subject to currency risk in respect of future cash flows which are denominated in foreign currency. The policy of the Group is to hedge a large proportion of this currency risk in respect of cash flows which are expected to arise in the following 12 months. Where forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into, they are designated as cash flow hedges on specific future transactions. Income statement exposure Financial Statements As with net assets, the majority of the Group’s profit is denominated in currencies other than sterling but translated into sterling for reporting purposes. The result for the period is translated into sterling at the average exchange rate. A risk therefore arises that a fluctuation in the exchange rates in the countries in which the Group operates will have a material impact on the consolidated result for the period. The following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the impact on equity of a 5% strengthening or weakening of sterling against all exchange rates for the countries in which the Group operates: 2012 2011 Group £M £M Change in reserves 0.8 1.4 Change in profit before taxation 0.9 1.5 This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ Czech crown, euro (Slovakia), Hungarian forint, Mexican peso and Romanian leu); and ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ (where the currency asset is exactly equal to the currency liability). Counterparty risk The Group is subject to counterparty risk in respect of the cash and cash equivalents held on deposit with banks; and foreign currency and derivative financial instruments. The Group only deposits cash, and only undertakes currency and derivative transactions, generally with highly rated banks and sets strict limits in respect of the amount of exposure to any one institution. Institutions with lower credit ratings can only be used with Board approval. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 93 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 20. Risks arising from financial instruments continued No collateral or credit enhancements are held in respect of any financial assets. The maximum exposure to counterparty risk is as follows: 2012 2011 Group £M £M Cash and cash equivalents 24.2 17.9 Derivative financial assets – 10.0 Total 24.2 27.9 The above table represents a worst case scenario of the counterparty risk that the Group is exposed to at the year end. An analysis of the cash and cash equivalents by geographical segment is presented in note 16. Cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments are neither past due nor impaired. Credit quality of these assets is good and the cash and cash equivalents are spread over a number of banks, each of which meets the criteria set out in our treasury policies, to ensure the risk of loss is minimised. Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk in respect of amounts receivable from customers. Amounts receivable from customers The Group lends small amounts over short-term periods to a large and diverse group of customers across the countries in which it operates. Nevertheless, the Group is subject to a risk of material unexpected credit losses in respect of amounts receivable from customers. This risk is minimised by the use of credit scoring techniques which are designed to ensure the Group only lends to those customers who we believe can afford the repayments. The amount lent to each customer and the repayment period agreed are dependent upon the risk category the customer is assigned to as part of the credit scoring process. The level of expected future losses is generated on a weekly basis by geographical segment. These outputs are reviewed by management to ensure that appropriate action can be taken if results differ from management expectations. 2012 2011 Group £M £M Amounts receivable from customers 650.3 560.4 The table above represents a worst case scenario of the credit risk that the Group is exposed to at the year end. An analysis of the amounts receivable from customers by geographical segment is presented in note 15. Amounts receivable from customers are stated at amortised cost and calculated in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Those amounts receivable from customers that are neither past due nor impaired represent loans where no customer payments have been missed and there is, therefore, no evidence to suggest that the credit quality is anything other than adequate. The Group’s accounting policy in respect of amounts receivable from customers requires that as soon as a customer misses any portion of a contractual payment the account is reviewed for impairment and the amount receivable is reduced to reflect the revised expected future cash flows. The result of this is that any loan which is past due (where any portion of a payment has been missed) will attract a deduction for impairment. Therefore, amounts receivable from customers include no amounts that are past due but not impaired. 94 International Personal Finance plc 20. Risks arising from financial instruments continued An analysis of the amounts receivable from customers that are individually determined to be impaired is set out by geographical segment below: Not impaired Impaired 2012 2011 2012 2011 Group £M £M £M £M Poland 71.4 61.3 192.6 161.0 Czech-Slovakia 48.2 45.8 106.4 104.9 Hungary 36.7 27.9 52.4 40.2 Mexico 19.9 16.0 67.2 50.2 Romania 20.1 20.6 35.4 32.5 196.3 171.6 454.0 388.8 This analysis includes all loans that have been subject to impairment. The impairment charge is based on the average expected loss for each arrears stage of customer receivables and this average expected loss is applied to the entire arrears stage. This results in a significant proportion of the amounts receivable from customers attracting an impairment charge. For each market the amount by which an asset is impaired depends on the type of product, the recent payment performance and the number of weeks since the loan was issued. There will, therefore, be a large amount of receivables which are classed as impaired but where the carrying value is still a large proportion of the contractual amount recoverable. Annualised impairment as a percentage of revenue for each geographical segment is shown below: 2012 2011 Group % % Poland 29.6 30.5 Czech-Slovakia 25.6 20.9 Hungary 15.2 12.1 Mexico 28.3 30.2 Romania 32.0 26.1 The carrying value of amounts receivable from customers that would have been impaired had their terms not been renegotiated is £nil (2011: £nil). Capital risk The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the business. Financial Statements The Group is not required to hold regulatory capital. The Group aims to maintain appropriate capital to ensure that it has a strong balance sheet but at the same time is providing a good return on equity to its shareholders. The Group’s long-term aim is to ensure that the capital structure results in an optimal ratio of debt and equity finance. Capital is monitored by considering the ratio of equity to receivables and the gearing ratio. The equity of the Group and these ratios are shown below: 2012 2011 Group £M £M Receivables 650.3 560.4 Borrowings (310.8) (276.5) Other net assets 36.3 43.8 Equity 375.8 327.7 Equity as % of receivables 57.8% 58.5% Gearing 0.8 0.8 Equity as a percentage of receivables was above the internal minimum requirement set by the Group. Gearing, which is equal to borrowings divided by equity, at a ratio of 0.8 times (2011: 0.8 times), is well within covenant limits of 3.75 times.

Derivative financial instruments Fair value estimation IFRS 7 requires disclosure of fair value measurements of derivative financial instruments by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2); and ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ The fair value of other Group assets and liabilities is included in note 23. All of the Group’s financial instruments fall into hierarchy level 2. The Group’s derivative assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value at 31 December are as follows: 2012 2011 Group £M £M Assets Foreign currency contracts – 10.0 Total – 10.0 2012 2011 Group £M £M Liabilities Interest rate swaps 0.8 0.3 Foreign currency contracts 0.6 – Total 1.4 0.3 The fair value of derivative financial instruments has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using interest rate yield curves and forward foreign exchange rates prevailing at 31 December. The Company has no derivative financial instruments. Cash flow hedges The Group uses foreign currency contracts (‘cash flow hedges’) to hedge those foreign currency cash flows that are highly probable to occur within 12 months of the balance sheet date and interest rate swaps (‘cash flow hedges’) to hedge those interest cash flows that are expected to occur within two years of the balance sheet date. The effect on the income statement will also be within these periods. An amount of £2.1 million has been credited to equity for the Group in the period in respect of cash flow hedges (2011: credit of £0.4 million), Company: £nil (2011: £nil). Foreign currency contracts The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts that the Group is committed to at 31 December 2012 is £229.9 million (2011: £270.2 million). These comprise: ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ £222.1 million (2011: £266.0 million). These contracts have various maturity dates up to January 2015 (2011: November 2013). These contracts have been designated and are effective as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity; ฀฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ ฀ These contracts have various maturity dates up to December 2013 (2011: November 2012).

These contracts have been designated and are effective as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts that the Company is committed to at 31 December 2012 is £4.7 million (2011: £3.2 million). All of these contracts are held with external providers to buy and sell currency and all have equal and offsetting contracts with other Group companies to buy and sell the same amounts of currency. This leaves the Company with no residual risk and ensures the relevant subsidiary company has an effective foreign currency contract in its books. 96 International Personal Finance plc 21. Derivative financial instruments continued In 2012 the Group also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge against forecast profits denominated in foreign currency. These foreign exchange contracts do not hedge against a specific future cash flow so do not qualify for hedge accounting; changes in their fair value are, therefore, taken to the income statement. None of these contracts were outstanding at the balance sheet date. The Group discontinued its policy of hedging foreign currency profits from 2013. Interest rate swaps The total notional principal of outstanding interest rate swaps that the Group is committed to is £130.9 million (2011: £86.4 million). In 2012, these interest rate swaps cover a proportion of current borrowings relating to the floating rate Polish bond and a proportion of floating rate bank borrowings. Interest rate swaps in place at the balance sheet date are designated, and are effective under IAS 39, as cash flow hedges, and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity within the hedging reserve. A charge of £nil (2011: £nil) has been made to the income statement in the year representing the movement in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps and the income statement charge relating to the closure of interest rate swaps. The weighted average interest rate and period to maturity of the Group interest rate swaps were as follows: 2012 2011 Weighted Weighted Weighted Range of average Weighted Range of average average interest period to average interest period to interest rate rates maturity interest rate rates maturity Group % % Years % % Years Polish zloty 4.9 3.9-5.8 0.8 5.3 4.7-5.8 0.7 Mexican peso 5.4 5.0-5.9 1.0 5.9 5.9 1.0 The Company did not hold any interest rate swaps at 31 December 2012 (31 December 2011: £nil). 22.

The carrying value of bank borrowings is deemed to be a good approximation of their fair value. Bank borrowings can be repaid within six months if the Group decides not to roll over for further periods up to the contractual repayment date. The impact of discounting would therefore be negligible. The fair value of the bonds has been calculated by reference to their market value. Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value which is equal to the expected future cash flows arising as a result of the derivative transaction. For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature, the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of the fair value. 98 International Personal Finance plc 24. Retirement benefit obligations Pension schemes – defined benefit With effect from 1 March 2010, the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme was closed to further accrual of defined benefit obligations, with all members being offered the opportunity to join a money purchase scheme. Scheme assets are stated at fair value at 31 December 2012. The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2012 2011 Group and Company % % Price inflation (‘CPI’) 2.4 2.5 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.9 3.0 Discount rate 4.5 4.7 Long-term rate of return: – equities n/a 6.6 – bonds n/a 4.7 – index-linked gilts n/a 3.1 – overall (weighted average) n/a 5.3 The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy. Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date. Expected returns on equity investments reflect long-term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets. The expected return on assets for 2012 has been derived using the long-term rate of return from 2011 in the table above. Upon transitioning to IAS 19 (revised) ‘Employee benefits’ (effective 1 January 2013), the income statement charge does not make any allowance for the expected return on assets, and instead uses the discount rate. Therefore, the long-term rate of return as at 31 December 2012 will not have any impact on the income statement. The mortality assumptions are based on standard tables which allow for future mortality improvements. Different assumptions are used for different groups of members. Most members have not yet retired. On average, we expect a male retiring in the future at age 65 to live for a further 28 years. On average, we expect a female retiring in the future at age 65 to live for a further 29 years. If life expectancies had been assumed to be one year greater for all members, the charge to the income statement would have increased by £nil and the present value of defined benefit obligations would have increased by approximately £0.9 million.

Pension schemes – defined contribution The defined benefit pension scheme is no longer open to further accrual. All eligible UK employees are invited to join stakeholder pension plans into which the Group contributes between 8% and 20% of members’ pensionable earnings, provided the employee contributes a minimum of 5%. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group. The pension charge in the income statement represents contributions payable by the Group in respect of the plan and amounted to £0.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 (2011: £0.8 million). £nil of contributions were payable to the plan at the year end (2011: £nil). In addition, an amount of £0.1 million (2011: £0.1 million) has been charged to the income statement in respect of contributions into personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees. 25. Share-based payments The Group currently operates four categories of share schemes: The International Personal Finance plc Performance Financial Statements Share Plan (‘the Performance Share Plan’); The International Personal Finance plc Approved Company Share Option Plan (‘the CSOP’); The International Personal Finance plc Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (‘the SAYE scheme’); and The International Personal Finance plc Deferred Share Plan (‘the Deferred Share Plan’). A number of awards have been granted under these schemes during the period under review. The income statement charge in respect of the Performance Share Plan and the CSOP has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model as these schemes are subject to a total shareholder return (‘TSR’) performance target. The income statement charge in respect of the SAYE scheme is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model, however no TSR targets are assigned. As there are no additional performance criteria attaching to the Deferred Share Plan the income statement charge is calculated using the actual share price at the date the award is granted. The total income statement charge in respect of these share-based payments is £2.0 million (2011: £1.9 million).

This happens when the registration details of different transactions are not identical. If a shareholder believes that more than one account exists in his/her name, he/she may contact the registrar to request that the accounts be combined. There is no charge for doing this. Electronic communication The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Company to use electronic communication when sending information to shareholders. Using electronic communication helps the Company to reduce the environmental impact of the business by limiting the amount of paper used and to manage costs. From time to time the Company consults with shareholders to check how they wish to receive information from the Company; if a response is not received a shareholder is deemed to have consented to receive information by notice that it is available on the Company’s website. Shareholders who receive such a notification are entitled to request a hard copy of the document at any time and may also change the way they receive communications at any time by contacting the registrar. The Company last wrote to shareholders on communication method in May 2011.
