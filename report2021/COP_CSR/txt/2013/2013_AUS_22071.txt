The Company is experiencing unprecedented foundations, continuously growth and change due to an expanding drilling and exploration programme and improving performance and our involvement in the PNG LNG Project, which comes on line in 2014. managing risk. Over the past two years we have been preparing for this growth phase by putting a robust framework around Oil Search’s sustainability commitment and formalising and consolidating the Company’s sustainability direction, systems and controls. Taking a more strategic approach supports better prioritisation, measurement, implementation and communication of our sustainability objectives and outcomes. By the end of 2011, Oil Search had established a new corporate sustainability function, a formalised governance structure, a formal Sustainability Strategy and a Health Foundation. Throughout 2012 these foundations were strengthened and our forward momentum continued. The year began with Board approval of the Sustainability Policy. Since then the Company has been working to align and integrate sustainability considerations more effectively into every aspect of the business, with the goal of embedding sustainability into day to day business activities across the organisation. 2 || OIL SEARCH 2012 Sustainability REPORT Continuing to build foundations and an expanded PNG safety team.

The aim is to find a balance between the higher short-term costs associated with supporting local business when compared to cheaper overseas alternatives and the benefits of having a thriving and sustainable local economy. The PNG Landowner success of Landowner Companies (Lancos), in particular, is not only important for Company spending ensuring an adequate supply of goods and services and generating an income for local Increased by 43% to $81M in 2012 community shareholders, but for mitigating any landowner-related problems in their areas. Supporting the growth of Lancos is therefore an ongoing priority for Oil Search, and in 2012 our Lanco spending increased by 43% to $81 million. 81.3 Improving governance by creating an umbrella Lanco During the year Oil Search assisted with the establishment of a new umbrella Lanco, KutMor Limited, which represents landowners in and around the Kutubu and Moran licence areas. The use of an umbrella structure creates a broader based ownership 57 model than many existing Lancos and improves the opportunity to apply good governance and management practices. KutMor Limited will have a more diversified 47.9 business model and will operate in different market segments. This will improve the likelihood of long term business stability and therefore that shareholders will receive regular dividends from its activities; it is also intended to reduce Oil Search’s supplier administration costs. KutMor Limited is contracted by Oil Search for labour supply and vehicle hire and will expand into other service activities once a landowner share subscription exercise is completed in early 2013. 10 11 12 Total paid to PNG landowner companies (US$ MILLION) Kutubu Catering Limited, Iagifu Ridge Camp, Kutubu Improving local content Assisting local enterprises, business and communities to benefit from the oil projects is a priority for Oil Search. While contributing to a positive social and economic legacy for communities, this commitment is important to Oil Search to ensure access to a skilled workforce and a reliable supply chain, as well as supporting stable local economies. Our approach includes the following elements and will be developed further in 2013: Employment, development and diversity.

For example, Oil Search is collaborating with stakeholder groups to protect the biodiversity of the Lake Kutubu Catchment and ensure the community is well equipped to manage the lake in the long term. In late 2012, Oil Search began developing a Memorandum of Understanding with Esso Highlands Limited (EHL) that will confirm a collaborative approach to building governance capacity within local communities. The objective of the collaboration is to build the capacity of the local community to effectively manage the lake, with the focus of enhancing the ability of the Wildlife Management Area (WMA) Committee (a group of Lake Kutubu community leader representatives) to preserve Oil Search’s Kumul loading biodiversity in the area.

Under an agreement with Morobe Mining Joint Venture (MMJV), a 50-50 joint venture between Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited of South Africa and Newcrest Mining Limited, we are expanding the MSK programme into communities around a mining project area in Morobe Province. MMJV will fund the implementation, representing a new model for cooperation between resource development companies in addressing community health issues. Preparatory work is underway for roll out in early 2013. In addition to expanding the reach of the MSK programme, the Foundation’s Malaria team is focussed on upgrading the programme package. The improved package, MS3T, allows MSKs to also sell non-prescription medicines and health and hygiene products to supplement their income and widen community access to these products. This is particularly important to the on-going viability of each MSK’s business, in a period of declining local malaria rates.

The Foundation is involved in a major strategy to help address the underlying issues by delivering a new training model. In September 2012, the Foundation entered a five-year public private partnership with the National Department of Health to create a PNG Reproductive Health Training Unit (RHTU) using a grant from AusAID of just under $10 million. The RHTU is focused on improving the competency of front-line provincial health educators and selected health care workers. It will provide in-service training in essential obstetric care, emergency obstetric care and family planning. The RHTU will work with relevant stakeholders to develop the curriculum and set up a database of reproductive health training in PNG. The database will help the PNG Government to improve service delivery at provincial and district level. The programme commenced in the Western Highlands with the delivery of a five-day emergency obstetric care training course and there are plans to scale up the training rapidly. To monitor and evaluate the programme’s effectiveness, the Foundation has partnered with the World Health Organisation Collaborative Centre for Nursing Midwifery and Health Development at the University of Technology, Sydney. This will enable the RHTU to develop a robust monitoring and evaluation framework. 30 || OIL SEARCH 2012 Sustainability REPORT 7,214 266 42.8 264 16.2 5,135 169 21.8 4,335 10 11 12 10 11 12 10 11 12 slides and rapid Number of people Total number of diagnostic tests who received an births attended found positive HIV test in the past by skilled health (%) 12 months and who workers know their results Malaria incidence in the Kutubu A 40% increase in HIV testing was Elections in PNG during the year area has been steadily declining seen in 2012.

These will expand when the PNG LNG Project commences. Beneficiaries receive direct cash benefits such as royalties that are paid by Oil Search and the Company’s joint venture partners. They also receive significant amounts of money from the national government under various benefits sharing agreements so they can develop local economic and social infrastructure. Ensuring all the benefits sharing agreements translate into noticeably improved living standards for local communities is a priority for Oil Search. As well as achieving sustainable development objectives, the aim is to mitigate risk. 2012 was a year of political uncertainty in PNG due to mid-year national elections. Oil Search’s efforts to enact change on key aspects such as increasing the capacity of the Department of Petroleum and Energy (DPE) and developing effective project benefits delivery (as previously reported) slowed down during the election period. However, the elections delivered stable political leadership and in the last quarter of 2012 Oil Search was able to renew efforts. In the new environment, stakeholder coordination improved and a consistent view was achieved among all stakeholders regarding an effective project delivery framework. Helping to draft provincial development plans The PNG national government has recently entrusted Infrastructure Development Grant funds to the respective provincial governments so they can identify and implement projects. Oil Search is working with the provincial governments, providing local knowledge as well as project management expertise to help develop coordinated development plans, prioritise projects and adopt expenditure planning, while also working with the national government to put in place an effective project delivery framework. Developing a shared responsibility model In 2011 Oil Search reviewed the size or dollar value of the respective benefits streams and the weaknesses of the government’s project management systems. In 2012 we worked jointly with the relevant stakeholders, the PNG Government, and the beneficiary group leadership on developing alternative benefits management and project delivery frameworks to put to government for consideration. Together, we developed a shared responsibility model that allows Oil Search to apply project management skills to the delivery of carefully selected infrastructure projects. Preparing for PNG LNG project cash benefit streams In anticipation of the first LNG shipments in 2014 and the consequential flow of PNG LNG Project benefits, Oil Search is supporting the DPE and PNG LNG Project operator Esso Highlands Limited to update and validate the beneficiary list and adopt a sound and transparent method of benefits distribution. Planning activities began at the end of 2012 and preparation will be a major focus in 2013.
