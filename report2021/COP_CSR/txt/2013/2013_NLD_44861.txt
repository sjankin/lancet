Good results in Parcels and International offset the underperformance of Mail in the Netherlands. Mail in the Netherlands underperformed Mail in the Netherlands did not perform as expected. We experienced a 9% volume decline. This was mainly due to substitution by electronic media. Severe quality issues while at the same time not realising the necessary efficiency improvements also meant we had to stop implementing part of our reorganisation in April 2012. In the months May through December we worked hard to restore quality, and identify alternative saving options. Fortunately, by October quality was back up at levels exceeding 95% next-day delivery, our minimum quality requirement. We also used this period to test alternatives to the original rollout plan. These alternatives were evaluated against three criteria: their contribution to the savings target, the impact on quality for our customers, and impact on our employees. Today, we communicate our adjusted rollout plan, which meets these three Dear reader, criteria. 2012 was PostNL’s first full year as an independent stock-listed company.

Herna Verhagen 25 February 2013 Disappointing developments around TNT Express On 14 January 2013, we heard the disappointing news that UPS will not pursue its takeover of TNT Express. We had hoped to use the proceeds from the sale of our stake in TNT Express to reduce our debt, restore cash dividend, invest in growth and de-risk our pension situation.

Customers are key We are a quality-driven company and delighting our customers is our top priority. Consumers increasingly want bespoke products and services. We are therefore continuously adapting and widening our range of products and services to tailor them to the wishes of our customers. We are also working on digital communication channels and order-handling processes for our customers, for instance through the portals MijnPost and MijnPakket. Already, more than 60% of revenue is delivered digitally through MijnPost, which proves the ease of the process for both our customers and for PostNL. 2013 and beyond: Managing for cash profitability This year and in the years to come, we will fully focus on managing for cash in order to get back to a situation where we can restore cash dividend in the medium term.

Under IAS 10, the withdrawal of the offer by UPS, which resulted in a significant decline in the TNT Express share price, qualifies as a nonadjusting event considering that any uncertainties were reflected in the 31 December 2012 share price of TNT Express. The closing share price of TNT Express on 22 February 2013 was €5.56. Continuation of this level will have a significant negative impact on the consolidated result and equity of PostNL. We expect that our stake in TNT Express will be monetised in the medium term to create better value for the shareholders, after stability has returned to TNT Express. Accordingly, the stake in TNT Express will no longer meet the criteria under IFRS 5 to be classified as asset held for sale and will therefore, as of the following reporting period, be accounted for as investments in associates using the equity method. Collective labour agreement for Mail Netherlands On 29 January 2013, the labour unions approved the collective labour agreement in principle for Mail Netherlands. The collective labour agreement applies from 1 January 2012 to 31 March 2013. The Social Plan will be extended by one year from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013. The main features of the new agreement are a 1.7% salary increase, and additionally 0.4% after the definitive approval of the new pension arrangement on which PostNL and the labour unions are jointly in talks with the pension fund. The material financial effects of the new collective labour agreement on 2012 have been included in the consolidated financial statements. No appeal to verdict of disputes committee on top up payments On 15 February 2013, PostNL announced it will not appeal the verdict of the disputes committee about the necessity of top up payments to supplement the coverage deficit of the pension funds. This was decided upon partly because PostNL aims to come to a sustainable solution for the pensions in dialogue with the main pension fund. This is in the interest of all parties involved. PostNL expects to pay the remaining invoiced top up payments of €64 million in Q1 2013.

Quality was back at the target of at least 20 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Report of the Board of Management | Chapter 4 | Mail in the Netherlands 95% in October and we had a solid Christmas period, despite a full-year quality score below the target of 95%. As an alternative to the central preparation sites, we successfully tested the integration of five former distribution offices in one large location in the area of Alkmaar. This test was successful in terms of quality, cost savings and employee motivation. As of 2013, we will adopt a step-wise approach to the reorganisation of the preparation and distribution of mail by centralising mail preparation to around 125 locations. This will enable us to ensure that our quality stays at the required level. It will also help us to limit the number of forced redundancies. The implication of this choice is that cost savings will be delayed in operations. We will compensate this to a large extent by additional cost savings in support staff, management, sales and head office. Increased cost savings from €330 to €400 million Limited additional expenses Cost savings (in € millions) 2001 ... 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 ~565 ~330 330 + 70 110 290 40 60 ¾ ~230 – 250 ¼ (in € millions) Previous outlook Realised New outlook 2011 – 2017 2011 – 2012 2011 – 2017 Restructuring cash out 325 – 375 137 ~325 – 375 Implementation costs 175 – 225 132 ~225 – 275 Capex 130 95 ~130 Transition to a new labour force Smooth transition from the current operational labour force to a new, sustainable labour force structure remains crucial to the success of the new operational model. In 2012, we made further progress in moving from a mainly full-time organisation towards a part-time operational organisation. With the help of the Mobility organisation, around 1,200 people found a new future outside PostNL in 2012. The Mobility organisation has helped more than 7,000 former employees in total since 2006. Our new labour force in Operations has fundamentally changed. Coming from a traditionally mainly full-time organisation, we employed over 33,000 part-timers in our mail delivery operations in 2012. Part-timers represent 92% of our delivery staff, equivalent to 72% FTE in delivery.

Mail in the Netherlands experienced a continued decline in addressed mail volumes in 2012. This was primarily due to a decline in single items and reduced demand for bulk mail as a result of cost-saving programmes initiated by some of PostNL’s key customers, as well as to continued substitution by electronic media. In 2012, loss of volumes to competition was limited. In total, the number of addressed mail items in the Netherlands decreased by 9.0%. The volume of unaddressed mail items increased by 3.3%, mainly due to increased market share. Besides volume development, prices are a key factor in PostNL’s financial performance. With respect to rates and conditions, OPTA has to set rates for the universal postal services every four years, which shall not lead to a return on sales (RoS) that exceeds the cap of 10%. Following each OPTA rate setting, PostNL is allowed to set rates and increased tariffs as of 1 January 2012 and 1 January 2013. The adjustments to the rates have been reviewed by OPTA and are within the tariff development limits. 22 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Report of the Board of Management | Chapter 5 5 Parcels PostNL’s Parcels segment operates parcels businesses and logistics services in the Netherlands and in Belgium.

Parcels continued to improve its revenue and volumes in 2012. Revenues increased by €122 million (20.1%) compared to 2011. Acquisitions in 2012 had a net positive effect of €30 million (4.9%) on operating revenues. Adjusted for the shift of registered mail from Mail in the Netherlands to Parcels (€29 million), an increase in subcontractor work for Mail in the Netherlands (€35 million) and growth in other internal revenues (€9 million), organic growth amounted to €19 million (3.6%). This was mainly realised within the Netherlands through volume growth, partly offset by lower average prices, and within Belgium, through Cargo, Extra@Home and Mikropakket. Volume growth of Parcels within the Netherlands benefited from the e-commerce trend, resulting in 13.2% overall growth in volumes. Excluding the internal transfer of the sorting and distribution of registered mail items, underlying volume growth within the Netherlands amounted to 5.6%. Volume growth was especially visible during the summer period and the fourth quarter of 2012. The overall trend in average revenue per parcel continued to be less favourable, mainly due to competition between service providers within the bulk segment and increased customer focus on delivery costs. Price pressure had a negative impact of 2% on revenues. The negative goodwill of €15 million arising from the 2012 acquisition of trans-o-flex has been recognised as a gain in other income. Parcels envisages that the negative goodwill will more than compensate the operational losses and restructuring costs of trans-o-flex.

Diversity & inclusion Multicultural organisation Employees are a mirror of the environment PostNL operates in, particularly in operations and also increasingly in our head office. As PostNL’s workforce is multicultural, we place strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Our operational managers are trained to work with and connect to staff from other cultural backgrounds through a multicultural masterclass, and we actively look for talented managers from all cultural backgrounds. Female talent PostNL welcomes talented women to higher positions, and actively seeks to promote and sponsor female talent. Our Young Executive Programme attracts about the same number of female and male candidates each year. Yet, in higher management positions, men are still over represented. In 2012, 23% of our management was female, compared to 44% of the total workforce. In 2012, Management Development and the PostNL Women’s Inclusion Network (WIN) investigated why female high potentials are less represented in higher management positions. Several talented women were mentored by a director (male or female) to help them reach their career goals. Participants in this mentoring programme have said it delivers an important contribution to reaching their goals. Next to mentoring, the WIN network organises workshops and feedback sessions around specific issues, such as self promotion and work-life balance. Connection and pride Everyone who qualifies for a job at PostNL should feel welcome and respected, regardless of their ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. PostNL believes people can only function optimally if they can be who they really are on the work floor and not have to hide their private interests and preferences. PostNL actively promotes respect and pride in the workplace and visibly sponsors activities through the PostNL Pride employee network for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders, for example by participating with a company boat in the annual Gay Pride Canal Parade in Amsterdam and at the ‘Coming Out day’. 34 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Report of the Board of Management | Chapter 9 9 Corporate responsibility, strategy and performance summary PostNL has been delivering mail and parcels for the past 200 years, and during that period corporate responsibility (CR) has increasingly become a way of life within the company, embedded at every level, and central to interactions with internal and external stakeholders.

Net costs of the universal service obligations The EU Postal Directive as well as the Dutch Postal Act 2009 both United Kingdom provide net cost regulation. The Dutch approach is based upon PostNL subsidiary TNT Post UK Ltd initiated a procedure in March the financial deficit of the universal postal services, while the 2006 regarding the VAT exemption of Royal Mail in the United Postal Directive approach is based upon a comparison between Kingdom.

A year-on-year ongoing measures. In particular, PostNL is subject to the competition rules series of legal procedures makes competition difficult and keeps contained in articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty and to the market share of competition on a stable 10%. preventative control of mergers and acquisitions as regulated in the EC Merger Control Regulation. Deutsche Post appealed against the decision of the competent court (“Oberverwaltungsgericht”) in the First Mail case and is PostNL is also subject to the competition rules laid down in the challenging the fact that regional price differences are seen as Agreement of the European Economic Area (EEA), which abuse of its dominant position.

Italy In 2009, PostNL filed complaints with the Italian national competition authority (AGCM) against Poste Italiane concerning abuse of its dominant position. The AGCM sustained PostNL’s claims on 15 December 2011, and imposed a fine of €39.4 million on Poste Italiane. Poste Italiane appealed the decision and the court ruled it null and void. The AGCM and TNT Post Italia are both appealing the court’s decision. An additional problem in the Italian postal market is the universal postal services perimeter resulting in distortive effects of the universal postal services-related VAT exemption, plus the government subsidy as a compensation for the universal postal services obligation. Considering its nature, domestic bulk letters (representing about 50% of the overall volume of the universal postal services) should be excluded from the universal postal services perimeter. As long as this is not the case, it seems to result in possible misuse of a dominant market position within the 40 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Report of the Board of Management | Chapter 11 11 Risks Implementing PostNL’s business and financial strategies is not without risk.

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of PostNL N.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries (hereafter referred to as ‘PostNL’, ‘Group’ or ‘the company’). Following the demerger of Express in 2011, PostNL holds a share of 29.8% in TNT Express N.V. (‘TNT Express’). Both PostNL and TNT Express are listed on NYSE Euronext in Amsterdam. PostNL provides businesses and consumers in the Benelux, the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy with an extensive range of services for their mail needs. PostNL’s services involve collecting, sorting, transporting and delivering of letters and parcels for the company’s customers within specific timeframes. The company also provides services in the area of data and document management, direct marketing and fulfilment. The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by PostNL’s Board of Management and Supervisory Board on 25 February 2013 and are subject to adoption at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 16 April 2013. Shareholding in TNT Express On 19 March 2012, United Parcel Service, Inc. (‘UPS’) and TNT Express announced their agreement on a recommended public offer of €9.50 per ordinary share to be made by UPS for TNT Express. PostNL signed an irrevocable undertaking with UPS to tender all TNT Express shares held by it under the offer of UPS subject to customary undertakings and conditions. As a result of the UPS offer and PostNL’s irrevocable undertaking, the stake in TNT Express was transferred at the end of March 2012 from investments in associates to assets held for sale. IFRS 5 ‘Assets held for sale’ requires assets to be valued at the lower of their fair value less cost to sell and their carrying value. Before the transfer, PostNL’s share in net earnings and direct equity movements of TNT Express was included in the consolidated income statement using the equity method, taking into account additional depreciation and amortisation (‘purchase price adjustments’). Fair value less cost to sell is based on PostNL’s share interest in TNT Express’ market value, represented by the number of shares held multiplied by the TNT Express share list price. As a result of the UPS offer, the share price of TNT Express increased from €5.77 on 30 December 2011 to €9.26 on 30 March 2012. This increase resulted in a partial reversal of the 2011 impairment charge on the stake in TNT Express of €570 million and increased its carrying value to €1,502 million as at 31 March 2012. Since its classification as asset held for sale, the share price of TNT Express declined from €9.26 to €8.43 on 31 December 2012, resulting in an impairment of €135 million and reducing the value of the stake in TNT Express to its market value of €1,367 million as at 31 December 2012. The fair (market) value has been determined by multiplying the closing share price at 31 December 2012 of €8.43 by the total number of issued ordinary shares held by PostNL of 162,130,035. For detail on the subsequent events in relation to PostNL’s shareholding in TNT Express, refer to note 34 to the consolidated financial statements. Summary of significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless stated otherwise. All amounts included in the financial statements are presented in euros, unless stated otherwise. Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of PostNL have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU). IFRS includes the application of International Financial Reporting Standards including International Accounting Standards (IAS), related Interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and Interpretations of the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for financial instruments. The preparation of financial statements in accordancey with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying PostNL’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in ‘Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying PostNL’s accounting policies’. PostNL Annual Report 2012 75 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Going concern In 2012, PostNL’s consolidated equity increased from €414 million as at 31 December 2011 to €1,080 million as at 31 December 2012. This was partially due to the net increase in the book value of the stake in TNT Express. Corporate equity increased from €1,918 million as at 31 December 2011 to €2,306 million as at 31 December 2012. In 2013, the impact of the revised IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ and the reduction in value of the stake in TNT Express, resulting from the prohibition of the acquisition by the European Commission followed by the cancellation of the bid by UPS, will lead to negative consolidated equity. Corporate equity will remain positive. Furthermore, not receiving the cash proceeds from the anticipated sale of the stake in TNT Express impacts the company’s liquidity and delays the anticipated reduction of debt. If the coverage ratio of PostNL’s main pension fund remains below the minimum required level, top up payments may put further pressure on the company’s liquidity. In the light of measures already taken or planned, management is confident it will be able to sufficiently strengthen liquidity and shareholders’ equity and return to positive equity. Measures aimed at improving the company’s liquidity and solvency include additional cost savings to cover the volume declines within Mail in the Netherlands by further enhancing operational synergies through a successful restart of the implementation of the remaining part of the Master Plans, overhead reduction and potential increases in sales prices. The company will limit and control capital expenditures and refrain from major acquisitions. The company will also refrain from (cash) dividend distributions in the near future. These actions will contribute to positive cash flows and recovery towards a positive equity balance. The negative consolidated equity does not impact the company’s operations, the timing of debt reductions, access to the available credit facility or the stock exchange listing. As at 31 December 2012, the balance of cash and cash equivalents amounted to €391 million and the company has an undrawn multi-currency revolving credit facility of €570 million. Its financing arrangements do not include financial covenants and the first bond repayments are not due until 2015. The company has an investment in TNT Express which can be monetised over time, and although the company remains vulnerable to interest rate changes in relation to its pension obligations, it can also benefit from an environment of increasing interest rates. Based on the cash flow-generating capability of the company, the current finance structure and the company’s ability to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, PostNL’s financial statements have been prepared under the assumption of going concern. Changes in accounting policies and disclosures The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has issued certain International Financial Reporting Standards or amendments thereof, and the IFRIC has issued certain interpretations. The impact of changes, when adopted by the EU, on PostNL’s consolidated financial statements, has been assessed. a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group: There are no IFRS standards or IFRIC interpretations taking effect for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2012 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group. b) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2012 and not adopted early by the Group: A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2012, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below: • Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Financial statement presentation’ regarding other comprehensive income. The main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to group items presented in ‘other comprehensive income’ (OCI) on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently (reclassification adjustments). The amendments do not address which items are presented in OCI. The Group intends to adopt IAS 1 no later than the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2013 and expects no material impact on the Group from its adoption. 76 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements • In 2011, the IASB issued the revised IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. The revised IAS 19 was endorsed by the European Union on 5 June 2012 and will take effect on 1 January 2013. The impact of the revised IAS 19 on the 2013 consolidated financial position and consolidated income statement of PostNL will be significant. The main change in the revised IAS 19 is the requirement to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately. As at 31 December 2012, the consolidated net pension asset amounted to €1,294 million (1 January 2012: 998). This includes net actuarial losses totalling €1,829 million (1 January 2012: 922). If these net actuarial losses as per 31 December 2012 had been recognised immediately, this would have negatively affected consolidated equity of PostNL by a net amount of around €1,370 million (1 January 2012: around 690). As future actuarial results also have to be recognised immediately and are heavily dependent on interest rate movements, consolidated equity will show fluctuations when actual developments differ from expected developments. The impact of the revised IAS 19 on the consolidated income statement resulting from the replacement of the expected return on plan assets by the lower discount rate and the cancellation of the amortisation of the unrecognised losses, would have affected the 2012 consolidated income statement by an estimated increase in pension expenses of around €20 million (based on the parameters as at 1 January 2012). • IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The Group has yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 9 no later than the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2015. The Group will also consider the impact of the remaining phases of IFRS 9 when completed. • IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess. The Group has yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 10 and intends to adopt IFRS 10 no later than the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2014. • IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ and IAS 28 ‘Associates and joint ventures’ will take effect on 1 January 2014. IFRS 11 puts more focus on the rights and obligations of the arrangement than on its legal form. There are two types of joint arrangement: joint operations and joint ventures. Joint operations arise where a joint operator has rights to the assets and obligations relating to the arrangement and hence accounts for its interest in assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Joint ventures arise where the joint operator has rights to the net assets of the arrangement and hence equity accounts for its interest. Proportional consolidation of joint ventures will no longer be allowed. IAS 28 includes the requirements for associates and joint ventures that have to be equity-accounted following the adoption of IFRS 11. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 11 and IAS 28 and intends to adopt IFRS 11 and IAS 28 no later than the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2014. • IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off-balance sheet vehicles. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 12 and intends to adopt IFRS 12 no later than the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2014. • IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs. The requirements do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRS. The Group intends to adopt IFRS 13 no later than the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2013 and expects no material impact on the Group from its adoption. There are no other IFRS standards or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group. PostNL Annual Report 2012 77 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial numbers of PostNL N.V. and its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. All significant intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. A complete list of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures included in PostNL’s consolidated financial statements is filed for public review at the Chamber of Commerce in The Hague. This list has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of article 379 (1) and article 414 of book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity controlled directly or indirectly by PostNL N.V. Control is defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether PostNL controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to PostNL and are de-consolidated from the date on which control ceases. PostNL uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The consideration of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. The consideration transferred includes also the fair value arising from contingent consideration arrangements. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values on the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of PostNL’s share of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of PostNL’s share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recycled to profit or loss. The non-controlling interest is initially measured at the proportion of the non-controlling interest in the recognised net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of the noncontrolling interest in the subsidiary’s equity are allocated against PostNL’s interests, except to the extent that the noncontrolling interest has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses. Associates An associate is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such as a partnership, that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture and over whose commercial and financial policy decisions PostNL has the power to exert significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity. PostNL’s share in the results of associates is included in the consolidated income statement using the equity method. The carrying value of PostNL’s share in associates includes goodwill on acquisition and includes changes to reflect PostNL’s share in net earnings of the respective companies, reduced by dividends received. When PostNL’s share of accumulated losses in an associate exceeds its interest in the associate, the book value of the investment is reduced to zero and PostNL does not recognise further losses unless PostNL is bound by guarantees or other undertakings in relation to the associate. Joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby PostNL and one or more parties (together with PostNL ‘the ventures’) undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control. A joint venture often involves the establishment of a legal entity. The ventures share the full economic ownership and are entitled to a share of the financial result of the activities of the joint venture rather than individual assets or obligations for expenses of the venture. Joint ventures in which PostNL participates with another party/other parties are consolidated proportionately. In applying the proportionate consolidation 78 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements method, PostNL’s percentage share of the balance sheet and income statement items is included in PostNL’s consolidated financial statements. Functional currency and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is PostNL’s functional and presentation currency. Foreign currency transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency using yearend exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and balances and from the translation at year-end exchange rates are recognised in the income statement except for qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges that are directly recognised in other comprehensive income. Foreign operations The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: • assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates, • income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates, and • the resulting exchange rate differences based on the different ways of translating between the balance sheet and the income statement are recognised as a separate component of equity (translation reserve). Foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to the translation reserve. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recycled in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on the sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing exchange rate. Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of PostNL’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired and is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and joint ventures is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in investments in associates and is not separately recognised or tested for impairment. Gains and losses on disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Separately-recognised goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to an annual impairment review. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Other intangible assets Costs related to the development and installation of software for internal use are capitalised at historical cost and amortised over the estimated useful life. Apart from software, other intangible assets mainly include customer lists, assets under development, licences and concessions. Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. An asset under construction is transferred to its respective intangible asset category at the moment it is ready for use and is amortised using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. Other intangible assets are valued at the lower of historical cost less amortisation and impairment. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is valued at historical cost using a component approach, less depreciation and impairment losses. In addition to costs of acquisition, the company also includes costs of bringing the asset to working condition, handling and installation costs and non-refundable purchase taxes. Under the component approach, each component of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item shall be depreciated separately. PostNL Annual Report 2012 79 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life, taking into account any residual value. The asset’s residual value and useful life is reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Land is not depreciated. System software is capitalised and amortised as a part of the tangible fixed asset for which it was acquired to operate, because the estimated useful life is inextricably linked with the estimated useful life of the associated asset. Leases of property, plant and equipment are classified as finance leases if the company has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in long-term debt. Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. Impairment of goodwill, investments in associates, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment Goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset might be impaired. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels at which there are separately identifiable cash flows, being the cash-generating units where a cash-generating unit is not at a higher level than an operating segment. If the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the cashgenerating unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the asset-specific risks. For the purpose of assessing impairment, corporate assets are allocated to specific cash-generating units before impairment testing. The allocation of the corporate assets is based on the contribution of those assets to the future cash flows of the cash-generating unit under review. For impairment testing of goodwill, the cash-generating unit is defined as the lowest level where goodwill is monitored for internal purposes. This level may be higher than the level used for testing other assets, but is not at a higher level than an operating segment. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in a subsequent period. Investment in associates PostNL will assess on each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that the investment in associates may need to be impaired. If the recoverable value of an associate is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the associate is reduced to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the asset-specific risks. The fair value less costs to sell of an associate is reviewed based on observable publicly available market data. A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value is an important quantitative triggering event for impairment of PostNL’s stake in TNT Express. Possible impairment charges may be reversed if there is an indication that the impairment no longer exists or has been reduced. Finite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its finite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is an indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any indication exists, the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. An asset is impaired if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods shall be reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The recoverable amount shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. Financial assets and liabilities PostNL classifies financial assets and liabilities into the following categories: • financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, • loans and receivables, • held-to-maturity investments, • available-for-sale financial assets, and • financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. 80 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial asset or liability was acquired. Management determines the classification of PostNL’s financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition. Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include derivatives and other assets and liabilities that are designated as such upon initial recognition. Measurement at fair value requires disclosure of how this measurement has been determined in relation to the following fair value measurement hierarchy: 1. quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets, 2. inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly (prices) or indirectly (derived from quoted prices), and 3. inputs not based on observable market data. Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and subsequently re-measured at fair value on the balance sheet. PostNL designates certain derivatives as: • hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities of a firm commitment (fair value hedge), • hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge), or • hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge). If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge, changes in its fair value are considered to be effective and recorded in a separate component in equity until the hedged item is recorded in income. Any portion of a change in the fair value of a derivative that is considered to be ineffective, or is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness, is immediately recorded in the income statement. At the inception of the transaction, PostNL documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The company also documents the assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit and loss (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gains or losses existing in equity at that time remain in equity until the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses that were reported in equity are immediately transferred to the income statement. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are directly recorded in the income statement. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and for which PostNL has no intention of trading. Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Loans and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities which PostNL has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories above. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months as from the balance sheet date. Available-for-sale financial assets are carried at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are PostNL Annual Report 2012 81 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements recognised in equity. When available-for-sale financial assets are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement as a gain or a loss. The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted securities), PostNL establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s-length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis refined to reflect the issuer’s specific circumstances. PostNL assesses on each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in determining whether the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement – is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses on equity instruments recognised in the income statement are not reversed through equity. Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the financial liability using the effective interest method. Inventory Inventories of raw materials and finished goods are valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable value. Historical cost is based on weighted average prices. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for impairment. An allowance for impairment of accounts receivable is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement. Any reversal of the loss is included in the income statement on the same line as where the original expense was recorded. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are valued at fair value. Cash and cash equivalents include cash at hand, bank account balances, bills of exchange and cheques (only those which can be cashed in the short term). All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts are not netted off from cash and cash equivalents. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale are no longer amortised or depreciated from the date they are classified as such. Accounting for assets classified as held for sale requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates. In line with IFRS 5, management assessed the compliance with these statements and the assumptions used in the fair value calculations as well as the estimated costs to sell. Equity Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Where any Group company purchases PostNL’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, are included in equity. Provisions for pension liabilities The obligation for all pension and other post-employment plans that qualify as defined benefit plans is determined by calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and deducting the fair value of the plan assets. PostNL uses actuarial calculations (projected unit credit method) to measure the obligations and the costs. For the calculations, actuarial 82 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements assumptions are made about demographic variables (such as employee turnover and mortality) and financial variables (such as the expected long-term return on plan assets). The discount rate is determined by reference to market rates using high-quality corporate bonds. Cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains and losses are included in the balance sheet. The portion of the cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains and losses that exceed the higher of 10% of the obligation or 10% of the fair value of plan assets (corridor approach) is recognised in the income statement over the employee’s expected average remaining service years. Past service costs, if any, are recognised on a straight-line basis over the average vesting period of the amended pension or early retirement benefits. Gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised on the date of the curtailment or settlement. Pension costs for defined contribution plans are expensed in the income statement when incurred or due. Other provisions Provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation on the balance sheet date. The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The gross-up of the provision following the discounting of the provision is recorded in the profit and loss statement as interest expense. Provisions are recorded for employee benefit obligations, restructuring, onerous contracts and other obligations. The provision for employee benefit obligations includes long-service leave or sabbatical leave, jubilee or other long-service benefits, long-term disability benefits and, if they are not payable wholly within 12 months after the end of the period, profitsharing, bonuses and deferred compensation. The expected costs of these benefits are recognised over the period of employment. Actuarial gains and losses and the impact of changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to income in the period such a gain or loss occurs. Related service costs are recognised immediately. The provision recorded for restructuring largely relates to termination benefits. Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. PostNL recognises termination benefits when the company has committed to terminate the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or provides termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are discounted to their present value. Provisions for onerous contracts are recorded when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to arise from that contract, taking into account impairment of fixed assets first. The provision for other obligations mainly concerns provisions for legal and contractual obligations and received claims. Trade accounts payable Trade accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Income taxes The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The amount of income tax included in the income statement is determined in accordance with the rules established by the taxation authorities, based on which income taxes are payable or recoverable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the tax base of assets and liabilities are calculated using the substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply when they are realised or settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised if it is probable that they will be realised. Deferred tax assets PostNL Annual Report 2012 83 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements and liabilities within the same tax group where a legally enforceable right to offset exists are presented net in the balance sheet. Revenue recognition PostNL’s normal business operations consist of the provision of logistics services. Revenues are recognised when services are rendered, goods are delivered or work is completed. Revenue is the gross inflow of economic benefits during the current year that arise from ordinary activities and result in an increase in equity, other than increases relating to contributions from equity participants. Revenues of delivered goods and services are recognised when: • the company has transferred to a buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods, • the company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control of the goods sold, • the amounts of revenue are measured reliably, • it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the company, • the costs to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably, and • the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably. Contracted services that have not yet been rendered by PostNL on the balance sheet date, as well as outstanding customer prepayments for stamps and frankings, are designated as deferred income. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration of received amounts or receivable amounts. Amounts received in advance are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are rendered to customers or goods are delivered. Net sales Net sales represent revenues from the delivery of goods and services to third parties less discounts, credit notes and taxes levied on sales. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts and return shipments. Other operating revenues Other operating revenues relate to the sale of goods and rendering of services not related to PostNL’s normal trading activities and mainly include rental income of temporarily leased-out property and custom clearance income. Other income Other income includes net gains or losses from the sale of property, plant and equipment and book results following the divestment of activities. Profit-sharing and bonus plans The company recognises a liability and an expense for cash-settled bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a calculation that takes into consideration the profit attributable to its shareholders after certain adjustments in accordance with contractual arrangements. Share-based payments Following the cash-settled unwinding of the TNT equity plans in 2011, no ‘legacy plans’ remained after demerger for the company. The Supervisory Board had decided to apply a voluntary one-off investment/matching plan in which the cash proceeds from the unwinding of the former TNT bonus/matching plan, performance share plan and option plan could be invested in PostNL shares. After the demerger of Express, PostNL installed a new bonus/matching plan where the participants can use a percentage of their yearly gross bonus to buy PostNL shares (bonus shares). Participants are granted matching shares and these matching shares are delivered for each bonus share that has been retained for three years and if all other conditions are met. The matching shares are settled in cash. Both the one-off investment/matching plan and the bonus/matching plan are cash-settled share-based compensation plans where at each reporting date the related liability is re-measured resulting in a corresponding impact on the income statement. 84 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Interest income and expense Interest income and expense are recognised on a time-proportionate basis using the effective interest method. Interest income comprises interest income on borrowings, changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, foreign currency gains and gains on hedged items. Interest expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, foreign currency losses and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, except to the extent that they can be capitalised as cost of a qualifying asset. Government grants Government grants are recognised initially as income when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and PostNL has complied with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate PostNL for expenses incurred are recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same period in which the expenses are recognised. Grants that compensate PostNL for the cost of an asset are deducted from the historical value of the asset and recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset. Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement as incurred during the period of the lease. Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to PostNL’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the year in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders. If PostNL offers its shareholders dividends or the choice of dividends in additional shares, the additionally issued shares are recognised at their nominal amount. Consolidated statement of cash flows The consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated at average exchange rates. Exchange rate differences affecting cash items are shown separately in the statement of cash flows. Receipts and payments with respect to taxation on profits are included in the cash flow from operating activities. Interest payments are included in cash flows from operating activities while interest receipts are included in cash flows from investing activities. The cost of acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and investments, insofar as it was paid for in cash, is included in cash flows from investing activities. Acquisitions of subsidiaries are presented net of cash balances acquired. Cash flows from derivatives are recognised in the statement of cash flows in the same category as those of the hedged item. Operating segment information PostNL reports three operating segments: Mail in the Netherlands, Parcels and International. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-makers. These chief operating decision-makers, who are responsible for allocating resources and assessing the performance of the operating segments, have been identified as the Board of Management of PostNL that makes strategic decisions. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying PostNL’s accounting policies The preparation of PostNL’s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of PostNL’s financial statements. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. PostNL makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. Valuation investment in TNT Express After the demerger of Express in 2011, PostNL initially held a 29.9% stake in TNT Express which was accounted for using the equity method, taking into account purchase price adjustments. The recoverable value of the investment in TNT Express was assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there was objective evidence that the investment in TNT Express might be impaired. The recoverability of the investment in TNT Express was reviewed based on observable publicly available market data and the share price development of TNT Express. A significant or prolonged decline in the share price of TNT PostNL Annual Report 2012 85 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Express was an important quantitative triggering event for impairment. Judgement was required in order to assess whether a significant or prolonged decline is present. During 2011, the share price of TNT Express was volatile and declined significantly from €9.77, the opening share price on 1 June 2011, to €5.77 on 30 December 2011. This resulted in a net impairment charge of €636 million. Resulting from the UPS offer and PostNL’s irrevocable undertaking, the share price of TNT Express increased from €5.77 on 30 December 2011 to €9.26 on 30 March 2012. This increase resulted in a partial reversal of the 2011 impairment charge on the stake in TNT Express of €570 million and increased its carrying value to €1,502 million as at 30 March 2012. As a result of the UPS offer, the stake in TNT Express was transferred from investments in associates to assets held for sale. IFRS 5 ‘Assets held for sale’ requires assets to be valued at the lower of their fair value less cost to sell and their carrying value. Fair value less cost to sell is based on PostNL’s share interest in TNT Express’ market value, represented by the number of shares held multiplied by the TNT Express share list price. Impairment charges are recognised for any subsequent writedowns of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. Gains on any subsequent increases in fair value less cost to sell are recognised to the extent that they reverse previous impairments, either under IFRS 5 or the previously applicable IAS 36. Since its classification as asset held for sale, the share price of TNT Express declined from €9.26 to €8.43 as at 31 December 2012, resulting in an impairment charge of €135 million and decreasing the value of the stake in TNT Express to its market value of €1,367 million as at 31 December 2012. For details of the subsequent events relating to PostNL’s shareholding in TNT Express, refer to note 34 to the consolidated financial statements. Employee benefits Post-employment benefits represent obligations that will be settled in the future and require assumptions to project benefit obligations. Post-employment benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period, based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. The accounting requires the company to make assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate, the rate of benefit increase, the expected return on assets and future mortality rates. Changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligations, funding requirements and pension cost incurred. For details of the current funded status and a sensitivity analysis with respect to defined benefit plan assumptions, see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Restructuring Restructuring charges mainly result from restructuring operations and/or relocations of operations, changes in PostNL’s strategy or managerial responses to declining demand, increasing costs or other market factors. Restructuring provisions reflect many estimates, including those pertaining to separation costs, reduction of excess facilities, contract settlements and tangible asset impairments. Actual experience has been and may continue to be different from these estimates. In 2010, PostNL announced the further restructuring of its operations in the Netherlands with the Master Plan III programme. The scope and measurement of the related restructuring provision highly depends on the projected cash outflows over the years, which are mainly driven by the estimated number of staff that will either be made redundant or apply for a mobility arrangement. In 2012, PostNL changed the rollout plan of the Master Plan III restructuring programme within operations, expected to result in substantially lower employee redundancies,which resulted in a partial release of the restructuring provision. For details on the current Master Plan III restructuring provision, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Impairment of assets In determining impairments of intangible assets including goodwill, tangible fixed assets and financial fixed assets, management must make significant judgements and estimates to determine whether the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the asset-specific risks. Determining cash flows requires the use of judgements and estimates that have been included in PostNL’s strategic plans and long-term forecasts. The data necessary for the execution of the impairment tests are based on management estimates of future cash flows, which make it necessary to estimate revenue growth rates and profit margins. Depreciation and amortisation of tangible and intangible fixed assets Tangible and intangible fixed assets, except for goodwill, are depreciated or amortised using a straight-line method based on the estimated useful life, taking into account any residual value. The asset’s residual value and useful life are based on PostNL’s best estimates and are reviewed, and adjusted if required, at each balance sheet date. 86 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Impairment of receivables The risk of uncollectability of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with, and the past due status of, doubtful debtors, while large accounts are assessed individually based on factors that include ability to pay, bankruptcy and payment history. In addition, debtors in certain countries are subject to a higher collectability risk, which is taken into account when assessing the overall risk of uncollectability. The assumptions and estimates used to determine the valuation allowance are reviewed periodically. Deferred revenues from stamps PostNL has to estimate the deferred revenues from stamps sold but not yet used by its customers. The company uses a seasonal model based on historical figures in order to account for the seasonal effects on sales from stamps (for example, stamp sales for Christmas greetings in November and December). Income taxes The company is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision and liability for income taxes. PostNL recognises liabilities for tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due, based on its best interpretation of the relevant tax laws and rules. In cases where the tax determination is uncertain, the company assesses the potential consequences based on its own internal analyses, supported by external advice, and either accrues the liability or discloses a contingent liability in its financial statements, depending on the strength of the company’s position and the resulting risk of loss. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such a determination is made. PostNL recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. This is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which deferred tax assets are recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, and depending on the tax strategies that the company may be able to implement, changes to the recognition of deferred tax assets could be required, which could impact PostNL’s financial position and net profit. Contingent liabilities Legal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending against the company in various jurisdictions. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such matters, it is often difficult to predict the final outcome. The cases and claims against the company often raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues that are subject to many uncertainties and complexities, including but not limited to the facts and circumstances of each particular case and claim, the jurisdiction and the differences in applicable law. In the normal course of business, PostNL consults with legal counsel and certain other experts on matters related to litigation. PostNL recognises a liability when it is determined that an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event an adverse outcome is possible or an estimate is not determinable, the matter is disclosed.

Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) and tested for impairment. The CGUs correspond to an operation in a particular country or region and the nature of the services provided. Compared to 2011, the CGU structure has slightly changed. In 2012, management decided to organise the activities of Data and Document Management services as part of Mail in the Netherlands. As a result, the goodwill allocated to CGU Data and Document Management services was transferred to CGU Mail in the Netherlands. The total goodwill balance at 31 December 2012 amounted to €111 million (2011: 121), of which PostNL has allocated €57 million (2011: 67) to CGU Mail in the Netherlands , €3 million (2011: 3) to CGU Parcels and €51 million (2011: 51) to International CGUs (€18 million to CGU United Kingdom, €31 million to CGUs Germany and €2 million to CGU Italy). In 2012, the additions to goodwill amounted to €1 million arising from the acquisition of Marvia B.V. within Mail in the Netherlands. Goodwill totalling €11 million relating to customer contact services within Mail in the Netherlands was transferred to assets held for sale. In 2012, no goodwill impairment charges were recorded (2011: 0). Based on 2012 financial performance, a detailed review has been performed of the recoverable value of each CGU. The recoverable value is the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Fair value less costs to sell represents the best estimate of the amount PostNL would receive if it sold the CGU. The value in use has been estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows. For both mature markets and non-mature markets, the estimated future net cash flows are based on a nine-year forecast and business plan, as management considers these forecasts reliable based on past experience. 88 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position For markets considered non-mature, no steady state has been achieved to date. The applied growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the related operation and market. The cash flow projections based on financial budgets have been approved by management. PostNL determined the budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations for market development. The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. The discount rate used in the CGU valuations varies between 10% and 13% (pre-tax). Key assumptions used to determine the recoverable values for each individual CGU are the following: • maturity of the underlying market, market share and volume development in order to determine the revenue mix and growth rate, • level of capital expenditure in network-related assets, • level of operating income largely impacted by revenue and cost development, taking into account the nature of the underlying costs and potential economies of scale, and • discount rate to be applied following the nature of the underlying cash flows and foreign currency and inflation-related risks. Management has carried out an impairment test for each individual CGU and concluded that the recoverable amount of the individual CGUs is higher than the carrying amount. Due to current market circumstances and related uncertainty, a sensitivity analysis has been applied for the CGU United Kingdom. This sensitivity analysis included the individual impact of the following items which are considered to be most critical when determining the recoverable value: • an increase in the discount rate of 1% and 2%, and • a decrease in operating income of 5% per year. The sensitivity analyses showed there is limited headroom present for the CGU United Kingdom, which covers goodwill totalling €18 million as at 31 December 2012. The future profitability of the current business is under pressure. Management intensively reviewed the strategic business forecasts, resulting in a reduced forecast for the CGU United Kingdom for the period 2013 – 2021. Centralisation and further optimisation of operational and administrative processes are key areas of attention. As at 31 December 2012 and based on the latest strategic business forecast with a forecast period of nine years, the goodwill of the CGU United Kingdom is recoverable with the recoverable value exceeding the carrying amount by around €6 million. The key parameter in the sensitivity analyses is the applied discount rate and the development of operating income. If the discount rate were to increase by 1%, the headroom would be around -€4 million (+2%: -€13 million). If operating income were to decline by 5% per year, the headroom would be around nil. Software As at 31 December 2012, the software balance of €44 million (2011: 30) included internally-generated software with a book value of €33 million (2011: 23). The additions to software of €12 million related to self-produced software of €7 million and purchased software of €5 million. They mainly concerned IT investments in the new logistical infrastructure within Parcels and software licences for Microsoft and SAP applications. The reclassification of €27 million from other intangibles was due to finalised IT projects. Other intangibles As at 31 December 2012, the other intangible assets of €13 million (2011: 25) related to customer lists of €4 million (2011: 5) and software under construction of €9 million (2011: 20). The estimated amortisation expenses for software and other intangible assets for the next five years are: • 2013: €27 million, • 2014: €17 million, • 2015: €10 million, • 2016: €1 million, • 2017: €1 million, and • thereafter: €1 million. PostNL does not conduct significant research and development activities and therefore does not incur research and development costs.

The investments mainly concerned buildings and equipment related to the Master Plans, vehicle replacements and land, buildings and sorting machinery for the new logistical infrastructure (NLI) within Parcels. Higher investments related to the Master Plans and NLI explain the higher capital expenditures compared to 2011. (De)consolidation of €3 million mainly related to assets acquired with the acquisition of the Belgian activities of trans-o-flex. The disposals of €8 million mainly related to the sale of real estate in the Netherlands. In 2011, the disposals of €22 milion mainly related to the sale of furnishings of the head office building and related equipment to TNT Express. The internal transfers and reclassifications of €161 million from construction in progress to land and buildings, plant and equipment and other were caused by the finalisation of central preparation locations, NLI depots within Parcels and sorting machinery. In 2012, depreciation costs amounted to €77 million and were in line with 2011 (€76 million). In 2012, impairment charges amounted to €2 million (2011: 12) and related to real estate in the Netherlands which is part of the reportable segment Mail in the Netherlands. Given the current overall downward pressure on real estate, management reviewed the recoverability of the real estate portfolio and concluded that some individual buildings should be impaired. The recoverable value of the buildings was based on the fair value less costs to sell, supported by valuations from external professional valuators. 90 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position In 2012, the transfers to assets held for sale related to buildings in the Netherlands totalling €4 million and to equipment relating to customer contact services totalling €2 million. In 2011, the transfers to assets held for sale related to buildings within Mail in the Netherlands totalling €37 million and in PostNL Other totalling €6 million. Finance leases included in the property, plant and equipment balance as at 31 December 2012, amounted to €13 million (2011: 17), of which €13 million (2011: 13) concerns land and buildings and €0 million (2011: 4) concerns plant and equipment. The minimum lease payments to be paid under these contracts represent the discounted value. Included in land and buildings under financial leases are leasehold rights and ground rent. The book value of the leasehold rights and ground rent is €13 million (2011: 13), comprising a historical cost of €19 million (2011: 18) with accumulated depreciation of €6 million (2011: 5). Leasehold rights and ground rents expiring: • between 1 and 5 years amount to €0 million (2011: 0), • between 5 and 20 years amount to €5 million (2011: 4), and • between 20 and 40 years amount to €8 million (2011: 9). There are no leasehold and ground rent contracts with indefinite terms. The leasehold rights and ground rent contracts related to land and buildings in the Netherlands. There is no material temporarily idle property, plant or equipment as at 31 December 2012 (2011: 0). 3 Investments in associates Investments in associates: 6 million (2011: 940) Stake TNT Express With a 29.9% shareholding in TNT Express as per 1 June 2011, PostNL obtained significant influence in TNT Express and classified the stake in TNT Express initially as an investment in associates, accounted for based on the equity method. Following the UPS offer, effective 31 March 2012, the stake in TNT Express was transferred from investments in associates to assets held for sale. The following table presents the movement in the carrying value of the stake in TNT Express since its initial valuation. Stake TNT Express 2012 2011 Initial recognition at 1 June 2011 1,583 Balance at 1 January 936 Share in net result 5 (16) Purchase price adjustments (4) (9) Share in direct equity movements (5) 20 Dividend received (6) Reversal impairments 570 (636) Transfer to assets held for sale (1,502) Balance at 31 December 0 936 (in € millions) The initial value of the stake in TNT Express was based on the fair value of TNT Express at 9:00 CET on 1 June 2011 of €5,296 million, based on a share price of €9.77, and amounted to €1,583 million. During 2011, due to a decline in share prices, impairment charges were recorded of €636 million, reducing the value of the stake in TNT Express on 31 December 2011 to €936 million based on a share price of €5.77. The share in the net result and direct equity movements of TNT Express, respectively €5 and -€5 million (2011: -16 and 20), are derived from the first-quarter 2012 report of TNT Express, as published on 2 May 2012. The purchase price adjustments of -€4 million (2011: -9) include the net amortisation charge of the identified intangibles for the first quarter of 2012. As a result of the UPS offer, the share price of TNT Express increased to €9.26 as at 30 March 2012, resulting in a partial reversal of the impairment charges in 2011 of €570 million. Following the UPS offer, effective 31 March 2012, the stake in TNT Express amounting to €1,502 million was transferred from investments in associates to assets held for sale. PostNL Annual Report 2012 91 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position Other investments in associates As at 31 December 2012, all other investments in associates amounted to €6 million (2011: 4) and included €3 million of goodwill (2011: 3). These investments mainly related to a 40% share in Scoupy B.V. (€1 million) within the segment Mail in the Netherlands and to minority shareholdings in Germany (€5 million) within the segment International. They included total assets of €26 million (2011: 21), revenues of €94 million (2011: 74) and net profit of €3 million (2011: 1). 4 Inventory Inventory: 9 million (2011: 9) Inventory At 31 December 2012 2011 Raw materials and supplies 2 2 Finished goods 7 7 Total 9 9 (in € millions) Total inventory of €9 million (2011: 9) is valued at historical cost at a total of €11 million (2011: 11) and is stated net of provisions for obsolete items of €2 million (2011: 2). No inventories are pledged as security for liabilities as at 31 December 2012 (2011: 0). In 2012 and 2011, no material write-offs relating to inventories occurred. The balance of inventories expected to be recovered after 12 months is €0 million (2011: 0). 5 (Trade) accounts receivable (Trade) accounts receivable: 482 million (2011: 458) (Trade) accounts receivable At 31 December 2012 2011 Trade accounts receivable total 445 430 Allowance for doubtful debt (13) (13) Trade accounts receivable 432 417 VAT receivable 36 24 Other accounts receivable 14 17 Accounts receivable 50 41 Total (trade) accounts receivable 482 458 (in € millions) As at 31 December 2012, the trade accounts receivable amounted to €445 million (2011: 430), of which €182 million (2011: 171) was past due but not individually impaired. The average payment term within PostNL is around 25 days. The total allowance for doubtful debt amounted to €13 million (2011: 13). The main part of the allowance related to a collective loss component established for groups of similar trade accounts receivable balances. This collective loss component is largely based on the ageing of the trade accounts receivable and is reviewed periodically. The credit quality of trade accounts receivable that are neither past due nor individually impaired is in general considered to be good. The total amount of writeoffs is in general limited and totalled €4 million in 2012 (2011: 5). Major customers are financial institutions, publishers, large retailers and the government. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivables mentioned above. PostNL did not pledge the outstanding balances as collateral. The concentration of the trade accounts receivable per customer is limited. The top 10 trade accounts receivable account for 9% of the outstanding balance as at 31 December 2012 (2011: 7%). The concentration of the trade accounts receivable portfolio over the different regions can be summarised as follows: the Netherlands €221 million (2011: 242), United Kingdom, Germany and Italy €192 million (2011: 163) and the rest of the world €19 million (2011: 12). For the non-trade accounts receivable, no allowance for doubtful debt was required. The fair value of the total (trade) accounts receivable approximated its carrying value. The balance of the total (trade) accounts receivable that is expected to be recovered after 12 months is €1 million (2011: 6). 92 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position The ageing analysis of the trade accounts receivable past due but not individually impaired is presented below.

As at 31 December 2012, prepayments amounted to €26 million (2011: 21) and accrued income to €90 million (2011: 100). The balance of prepayments and accrued income that is expected to be recovered after 12 months is €0 million (2011: 0). 7 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents: 391 million (2011: 668) As at 31 December 2012, cash and cash equivalents comprised cash at bank and in hand of €96 million (2011: 95), short-term bank deposits of €75 million (2011: 573), cash placed into money market funds of €120 million (2011: 0) and cash placed on an on-call deposit account of €100 million (2011: 0) . During 2012: • The effective interest rate on the short-term bank deposits was 0.14% (2011: 0.75%) and the average outstanding amount was €61 million (2011: 426). The individual deposits had an average maturity of 1.4 days (2011: 1.4). • The effective interest rate on the money market funds was 0.14% and the average outstanding amount was €148 million (2011: 0). • The effective interest rate on the on-call deposit account was 0.35% and the average outstanding amount was €100 million (2011: 0). As at 31 December 2012, included in cash and cash equivalents was €25 million (2011: 39) of restricted cash. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximated the carrying value. 8 Assets classified as held for sale Assets classified as held for sale: 1,430 million (2011: 52) and liabilities related to assets classified as held for sale: 11 million (2011: 0) As at 31 December 2012, assets classified as held for sale amounted to €1,430 million (2011: 52). The stake in TNT Express accounted for €1,367 million. The other assets classified as held for sale of €63 million (2011: 52) related for €51 million (2011: 52) to buildings held for sale in the Netherlands and for €12 million to customer contact services. The liabilities related to assets classified as held for sale of €11 million related to customer contact services. In 2012, an impairment of €9 million related to customer contact services was recorded to align the carrying value to fair value less cost to sell. PostNL Annual Report 2012 93 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position Stake TNT Express In 2012, the transfers from investments in associates as at 31 March 2012 of €1,502 million related to PostNL’s stake in TNT Express, following the UPS offer in March 2012 (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). IFRS 5 ‘Assets held for sale’ requires assets to be valued at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and their carrying value. As from 31 March 2012, the share price of TNT Express decreased from €9.26 to €8.43 as at 31 December 2012 resulting in an impairment charge of €135 million and reducing the value of the stake in TNT Express to its market value of €1,367 million as at 31 December 2012. The impairment charge has been reported within ‘Depreciation, amortisation and impairments’. The fair (market) value has been determined by multiplying the closing share price at 31 December 2012 of €8.43 by the total number of issued ordinary shares held by PostNL of 162,130,035. The following table presents summarised financial information of TNT Express, as reported by TNT Express N.V. in its 2012 Annual Report, published on 18 February 2013.

The book value of the buildings sold in 2012 amounted to €5 million, which wholly related to the sale of buildings in the Netherlands. 9 Equity Equity: 1,080 million (2011: 414) The consolidated statement of changes in equity can be found on page 74. Consolidated equity consisted of equity attributable to the equity holders of PostNL of €1,069 million (2011: 400) and non-controlling interests of €11 million (2011: 14). Equity attributable to the equity holders of PostNL consisted of the following items: Authorised share capital As of 4 August 2011, the company’s authorised share capital amounted to €120 million, divided into 750,000,000 ordinary shares and 750,000,000 preference shares B, both of €0.08 nominal value each. Form of shares The ordinary shares are in bearer or in registered form. Ordinary shares in bearer form are represented by a global note held by the Dutch clearing system Euroclear Netherlands (formerly known as NECIGEF) and are transferable through Euroclear Netherlands’ book entry system. ADRs represent ordinary shares in bearer form represented by the note held by Euroclear Netherlands. Ordinary shares in registered form are transferred by means of a deed of transfer and PostNL’s written acknowledgement of the transfer. PostNL does not have share certiﬁcates for ordinary shares represented by the global note. The preference shares B are in registered form. Issued share capital As at 31 December 2012, the issued share capital amounted to €35 million (2011: 31). The increase in issued share capital of €4 million related to stock dividend resulting from the issuance of 21,791,073 shares following the final 2011 stock dividend, and of 25,880,782 shares following the 2012 interim dividend. 94 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position The number of authorised, issued and outstanding shares by class of share is as follows: Shares Before proposed appropriation of profit 2012 2011 Authorised by class Ordinary shares 750,000,000 750,000,000 Preference shares B 750,000,000 750,000,000 Total authorised 1,500,000,000 1,500,000,000 Issued and outstanding Per 1 January of the reported year 392,301,442 376,339,096 Issued for stock dividend 47,671,855 15,962,346 Per 31 December of the reported year 439,973,297 392,301,442 Issued and outstanding per 31 December by class Ordinary shares 439,973,297 392,301,442 of which held by the company to cover share plans 0 62,114 of which the company only holds the legal title 773,765 488,559 Preference shares B 0 0 Repurchase of shares to cover share plans In 2012, the company purchased no ordinary shares (2011: 0) to cover its obligations under the existing management share grants. As at 31 December 2012, the total number of shares held for this purpose was nil (2011: 62,114). PostNL shares held by the company are not entitled to receive dividends and have no voting rights. The company held no ordinary shares for cancellation as at 31 December 2012 (2011: 0). Incentive scheme For administration and compliance purposes, PostNL currently has an omnibus securities account with UBS Bank, Geneva, Switzerland, holding the shares belonging to its employees under its incentive schemes. PostNL legally owns the shares while the beneficial ownership of the shares is vested in the employees, who are also entitled to dividend received by PostNL on their behalf. As at 31 December 2012, the number of PostNL shares involved amounted to 773,765 shares with a nominal value of €0.08 per share, which have no voting rights. Foundation Continuity PostNL and preference shares B ‘Stichting Continuiteit PostNL’ (‘Foundation Continuity PostNL’ or ‘The Foundation’) was formed to safeguard PostNL’s interests and the enterprises connected with PostNL and all interested parties, by, among other things, preventing as far as possible any inﬂuences that would threaten PostNL’s continuity, independence and identity contrary to such interests. Foundation Continuity PostNL is an independent legal entity and is not owned or controlled by any other legal person. PostNL’s articles of association provide for protective preference shares B that can be issued to Foundation Continuity PostNL to serve these interests. The preference shares B have a nominal value of €0.08 and have the same voting rights as PostNL’s ordinary shares. PostNL and Foundation Continuity PostNL have entered into a call option agreement, which enables Foundation Continuity PostNL to acquire a number of preference shares B not exceeding the total issued amount of shares minus one and minus any shares already issued to Foundation Continuity PostNL. The call option agreement is meant as a preventive countermeasure against influences that might threaten the continuity, independence and identity contrary to such interest. Preference shares B will be outstanding no longer than is strictly necessary. There are currently no preference shares B issued. The exercise price with respect to the call option is the nominal value of €0.08 per preference share B, although upon exercise only €0.02 per preference share B is required to be paid. The additional €0.06 per preference share B is due at such time as PostNL makes a call for payment by resolution of its Board of Management, and is subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board. Foundation Continuity PostNL has credit facilities in place to enable it to pay the exercise price. Six months after the issuance of preference shares B, Foundation Continuity PostNL may require PostNL to convene a General Meeting of Shareholders to discuss cancellation of these shares. However, if within these six months Foundation Continuity PostNL should receive a demand for repayment under the credit facilities referred to above, it may also require PostNL to convene a General Meeting of Shareholders. In accordance with PostNL’s current articles of association, a General Meeting of Shareholders must ultimately be convened 12 months after the first date of issuance of any preference shares B to Foundation Continuity PostNL for the ﬁrst time. The agenda for that meeting shall include a resolution relating to the repurchase and/or cancellation of the preference shares B. PostNL Annual Report 2012 95 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position PostNL has granted to Foundation Continuity PostNL the right to file an application for an inquiry into the policy and conduct of PostNL’s business with the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal (Ondernemingskamer) whereby the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal may determine immediate provisions, should these be necessary. The members of the board of the Foundation are R. Pieterse (chairman), J.H.M. Lindenbergh, W. van Vonno and M.P. Nieuwe Weme. All members of the board of the Foundation are independent from PostNL. This means that the Foundation is an independent legal entity as referred to in section 5:71 paragraph 1 sub c of the Netherlands Financial Markets Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht). Additional paid-in capital As at 31 December 2012, additional paid-in capital of €147 million (2011: 151) is fully exempt for Dutch tax purposes to the extent that this has been paid in by shareholders of the company. The decrease in additional paid-in capital of €4 million related to the issuance of stock dividend, which increased the issued share capital by the same amount. Translation reserve As at 31 December 2012, the translation reserve amounted to €9 million (2011: 8), reflecting the movement in exchange rate differences on converting subsidiaries in the United Kingdom within the International segment into euros. Hedge reserve As at 31 December 2012, the hedge reserve amounted to -€13 million (2011: -12) and consisted of the fair value timing difference of -€9 million (2011: -6) on the £450/€568 million and £13/€16 million cross-currency swaps and the fair value timing difference of -€4 million (2011: -€6) on the forward starting swaps, unwound in 2008, to be recycled in the income statement until 2015 (net of taxes). The £450/€568 million cross-currency swap has been entered into to hedge foreign currency exposure on the £450 million eurobonds that were issued in 2008. The £13/€16 million cross-currency swap has been entered into to mitigate the interest exposure on the £13 million loan provided to a group company in 2012. Movements in the hedge reserve during 2012 amounted to €1 million, of which €3 million related to the £450/€568 million cross-currency swap and -€2 million related to the forward starting swaps that were recycled from the hedge reserve to the income statement. The 2012 tax impact on the cashflow hedges is €4 million (2011: 4). For more information on the cross-currency swaps, refer to note 29 to the consolidated financial statements. Other reserves As at 31 December 2012, the other reserves amounted to -€395 million (2011: -1,478). In 2012, the other reserves increased by €1,083 million. This increase was mainly due to the appropriation of net income from 2011 of €1,091 million, the share in other comprehensive income of TNT Express of -€5 million, an amount of -€2 million related to the buy-out of minority interests in subsidiaries of TNT Post UK and -€1 million related to various other items. Retained earnings As at 31 December 2012, retained earnings amounted to €1,286 million (2011: 1,700). In 2012, retained earnings decreased by €414 million. This decrease was due to the appropriation of the net income from 2011 of €1,091 million, partly offset by the total comprehensive income of €677 million in 2012. The Board of Management has proposed to add €389 million (2011: 1,091) to the other reserves. Refer to ‘Other information’ on page 148 for more details on this proposal. 96 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position 10 Pension assets / Provisions for pension liabilities Pension assets: 1,487 million (2011: 1,217) and provisions for pension liabilities: 193 million (2011: 219) PostNL operates a number of post-employment benefit plans in Europe. Most of PostNL’s non-Dutch post-employment benefit plans are defined contribution plans. The majority of the Dutch post-employment benefit plans are defined benefit pension plans and consist of a main plan, transitional plans and other pension plans. PostNL’s main Dutch pension plan (main plan), which is externally funded in ‘Stichting Pensioenfonds PostNL’ (main fund), covers the employees who are subject to PostNL’s collective labour agreement and staff with a personal labour agreement arranged as from 2007 in the Netherlands. The majority of all PostNL’s Dutch employees are subject to the collective labour agreement. The plan covers around 89,000 PostNL participants, including around 20,000 pensioners and around 39,000 former employees. By Dutch law, the plan is managed by an independent legal entity, Stichting Pensioenfonds PostNL, which is not owned or controlled by any other legal entity and which falls under the supervision of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) and the Autoriteit Financiële Markten (AFM). As required by Dutch law, PostNL and its pension funds have agreed on an execution agreement mainly stipulating the financial terms and conditions relevant for the execution of the pension plan. These terms and conditions include the financial consequences of a coverage ratio below the minimum funding requirement. Currently, such a funding shortage has to be solved within a maximum of 12 quarters (three years), whereby PostNL has an obligation for unlimited top up payments. The actual development of the coverage ratio is included in the decision and calculation of the invoicing top up payments. The transitional plans consist of an early retirement scheme and additional arrangements that were agreed between the company and employees following a revision of fiscal regulations applying to Dutch pension plans in 2006. Further details of the main plan In the main plan, both the employer and staff with a personal labour agreement arranged as from 2007 contribute to the pension fund (staff as of February 2012). The contributions are based on actuarial calculations per active participant. The total employer contribution to the main fund amounted to €212 million (2011: 129), including top up payments of €81 million as a result of the coverage deficit (2011: 0). By the end of 2012, the coverage ratio of the main fund increased to 102.5% (2011: 99.8%), including the outstanding top up payments considered receivable from PostNL. The increased coverage ratio was mainly due to a positive contribution from the return on plan assets, partly offset by a decrease in the long-term interest rate and increased longevity outlook. The fund’s coverage ratio as at 31 December 2012 includes the latest longevity outlook, based on recent statistical studies performed by the Dutch Actuarial Association (‘Actuarieel Genootschap’). During 2012, the coverage ratio of the main fund remained below the minimum funding requirement of 104.1%. As at 31 December 2012, PostNL had been invoiced top up payments of around €147 million in total (including €2 million interest), of which around €2 million is paid by the joint venture partner of Postkantoren B.V. PostNL disputed the necessity of the top up payments. In 2012, PostNL and the main fund installed a disputes committee to resolve the dispute. In December 2012, the verdict of the disputes committee ruled that top up payments were already necessary, regardless of the question of whether the main fund can also recover in time without top up payments. As the disputes committee ruled in favour of the main fund, the verdict entailed payment of the top up invoices up to 30 June 2012 by PostNL. The verdict left PostNL with the possibility to appeal the payment of all additional invoices as of 30 June 2012. In February 2013, PostNL decided that it would not appeal the verdict. PostNL expects to pay the remaining invoiced top up payments of €64 million in Q1 2013. At the coverage ratio of 102.5% as at 31 December 2012, around €94 million of the coverage deficit of the main pension fund is allocated to PostNL. If the coverage ratio is still below the minimum funding requirement by the end of Q1 2013, PostNL will be invoiced an additional top up payment of around €13 million. In 2012, PostNL and the trade unions reached an agreement on the collective labour agreement for Mail Netherlands. The following agreements were reached with regard to the main Dutch pension plan. PostNL Annual Report 2012 97 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position • Parties have submitted a joint proposal to the main fund for a sustainable pension arrangement acceptable to both employer and employees. The changes to the arrangement will have to result in a reduction in pension (cash) costs and reduce the risk of top up payments. The implementation and feasibility will be tested by the main fund in the coming months, after which the unions will present the proposal to their members for approval. • As of 1 January 2013, a pension contribution of 6% is introduced for new employees; employees already employed on 31 December 2012 pay a pension contribution of 2% as of 1 January 2013. • PostNL refrains from proportionally curtailing the transitional arrangements for employees that start working part-time. The unions refrain from further litigation. In exchange, the unions accepted a reduction of the transitional arrangements in line with the original intentions in 2006. As at 31 December 2012, the weight of equity and equity derivatives investments amounted to 17%, the weight of fixed interest investments amounted to 61%, the weight of real estate and alternative investments amounted to 15% and the weight of swaps and swaptions investments amounted to 7%. The plan assets may from time to time include investments in PostNL’s own financial instruments through indirect holdings by mutual funds. Until 2011, the main fund reported its investment mix and results on the basis of exposure. As of 2012, the main fund reports these on the basis of the actual characteristics of the investments. Consequently, the reporting classification of the bond investments accompanying the equity derivative strategy changed from Equity and equity derivatives (including the accompanying bonds) to Fixed interest and inflation-linked bonds . Although reported differently, the main fund’s overall investment strategy and exposure has not materially changed. It includes equity derivatives to preserve part of the upward potential on equity and at the same time be protected against substantial decreases in equity valuations. In addition, the main fund uses interest rate derivatives to reduce the net interest exposure on its assets and liabilities. Asset mix / returns of main pension plan At 31 December Actual mix 2012 Strategix mix 2012 Return 2012 Equities and equity derivatives 17% 17% 25.1% Fixed interest and inflation linked bonds 61% 68%1 9.4% Real estate and alternative investment 15% 15% 2.1% Swaps and swaptions / Contribution to the return 7% 1.3% Total / total weighted average 100% 100% 10.9% 1 Including the 7% actual 2012 investment in swaps and swaptions. In 2012, the return on the plan assets was 10.9% (2011: 6.6%), comprising 1.3% direct return of swaps and swaptions and 9.6% weighted average return of the other asset classes. As at 31 December 2012, the average return on the plan assets since inception of the plan was 7.6%, which is based on the actual return of the investments in combination with their relative weight per year. This weight can vary based on the actual mix. Coverage ratio and top up payments related to ‘Stichting Ondernemingspensioenfonds TNT’ PostNL is also the sponsoring employer of the pension plan covering the staff members in the Netherlands who have a personal labour agreement before 2007, which is externally funded in ‘Stichting Ondernemingspensioenfonds TNT’. During 2012, this fund recovered from a coverage deficit on 31 December 2011 to a coverage ratio above the minimum funding requirement on 31 December 2012. The verdict of the disputes committee also holds for this fund. In December 2012, PostNL paid €2 million of top up invoices. Defined benefit pension costs recognised in the income statement The valuation of PostNL’s pension obligation and the determination of its pension cost are based on key assumptions that include employee turnover, mortality rates and retirement ages, discount rates, expected long-term returns on plan assets, pension increases and future wage increases, which are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each financial year. Actual circumstances may vary from these assumptions, giving rise to a different pension liability at year-end. The differences between the projected pension liability based on the assumptions and the actual pension liability at year-end are reflected in the balance sheet as part of the unrecognised actuarial gains and losses. Until 2012, if the cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains and losses exceed the corridor, the excess will be amortised over the employee’s expected average remaining service years and reflected as an additional profit or expense. As per 1 January 2013, in accordance with the revised IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, these unrecognised actuarial gains and losses have to be recognised immediately. If the net actuarial losses as per 31 December 2012 had been recognised immediately, this would have affected consolidated equity negatively by a net amount of around €1,370 million. As future actuarial results also have to be recognised immediately and are heavily dependent on interest rate movements, consolidated equity will show fluctuations when actual developments differ from assumptions. 98 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position In accordance with IAS 19.34a, PostNL, as the sponsoring employer for two Dutch pension plans, recognises in its corporate financial statements the contributions received from the relevant Group companies as a benefit that offsets the defined benefit pension expense. The relevant Group companies recognise in their financial statements the costs equal to the contribution payable for the period. In 2012, PostNL’s expense for defined benefit post-employment plans was €47 million (2011: 117), including a net curtailment gain of €11 million (2011: 0). The expenses for defined contribution plans were €5 million (2011: 5). Including these charges for defined contribution plans, PostNL’s total expense for post-employment benefit plans amounted to €52 million (2011: 122). The total expense of €52 million is included in ‘Salaries, pensions and social security contributions’ in the income statement (refer to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). In 2012, total employer cash contributions for defined benefit post-employment plans amounted to €343 million (2011: 260), including top up payments of €83 million as a result of the coverage deficit (2011: 0). As of February 2012, the Board of Management and staff with a personal labour agreement started paying employee contributions. Including the cash outflow for defined defined contribution plans, PostNL’s total cash contributions amounted to €348 million (2011: 265).

The following table reconciles the opening and closing balances of the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, the funded status and the employer pension expenses of PostNL’s defined benefit postemployment plans.

Management reviews these and other assumptions every year. The measurement date for PostNL’s post-employment benefits is 31 December. Changes in assumptions may occur as a result of economic and market conditions. The impact of changes on the annual pension expense can be found in the table ‘sensitivity employer pension expenses’ below. If actual results differ from those assumed, this will result in actuarial gains or losses. Until 2012, these were amortised over the employee’s expected average remaining service years if they exceed the corridor. As from 2013, actuarial results have to be recognised immediately. The discount rate is based on the long-term yield on high-quality (AA) corporate bonds, taking into account the duration of the projected pension liabilities of around 19 years. In 2012, management improved the discount rate setting methodology. The high quality (AA-rated) corporate bond yield information is sourced from Bloomberg instead of iBoxx, taking into account a minimum outstanding amount and other defined selection criteria. By applying curve fitting procedures, a yield curve is generated. Using the full yield curve, the discounted value of the expected future benefit payments is matched with the comparable present value when using a single discount rate. The resulting discount rate is around 0.3% higher than 100 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position based on the previous methodology. The positive impact of this on the benefit obligation as at 31 December 2012 is estimated at around €335 million. Management considers various factors to determine the expected return on plan assets. The expected return is based on the current long-term rates of return on bonds and a suitable risk premium for the different asset components is applied to these rates. The premium is based on the plan’s asset mix, historical market returns and current market expectations. Returns are linked to the strategic investment policy of Stichting Pensioenfonds PostNL, as annually reported in the Asset Liability Management study of the main fund. They are calculated as the long-term geometric mean from 2,000 future scenarios that take into account the relevant standard deviations of, and correlations between, the various asset categories, as derived from historical evidence. The main fund controls around 95% of the PostNL Group plan assets. Ultimately, the long-term objective is to protect the assets from erosion of purchase power, and to provide long-term growth of capital without excessive exposure to risk. The duration of the plan liabilities determines the investment strategy. The assets are managed by external investment managers. The main fund establishes the investment policy and strategy, including the selection of investment managers, setting long-term strategic targets and monitoring. The strategic asset mix is a target and not a limitation. The fund may approve components of the asset mix above or below the targeted range. The fund may decide to rebalance or change the asset mix periodically. As at 31 December 2012, the strategic asset mix for 2013 is not expected to be materially different to 2012. Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on advice, published statistics and experience per country. The majority of the defined benefit obligation relates to participants in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, the average prospective life expectancy of men after retiring at the age of 65 is 21.8 years (2011: 21.4). The equivalent expectancy for women is 23.5 years (2011: 23.2). The 2011 comparatives are adjusted to include prospective longevity outlook. The applied mortality rates are derived from the mortality table ‘GBM/GBV 2012 – 2062 + CVS experience rates, starting rates 2013 and age corrections 0/0 (male/female)’, as applied by the main fund. The actuarial loss of €1,156 million in the change of the defined benefit obligation during 2012 is mainly the result of a decrease in the assumed discount rate and an increase in the assumed longevity outlook. The net curtailment gain of €11 million includes a curtailment loss resulting from the change in the rollout plan of the Master Plan III restructuring programme within operations with substantially lower expected employee redundancies, more than offset by a curtailment gain resulting from the agreement on the collective labour agreement for Mail Netherlands. The main pension adjustment within the collective labour agreement affecting the 2012 benefit obligations is the alignment of the transitional arrangements with their original intentions. Funded status defined benefit plans The table below reconciles the opening and closing balances of the present value of the defined benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets with the provision for post-employment benefit plans. Included in the provision for pension liabilities are the unfunded defined benefit Trattamento di Fine Rapporto (‘TFR’) in Italy of €7 million (2011: 7). The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: Details balances defined benefit plans At 31 December 2012 2011 Present value of funded benefit obligations (6,331) (5,023) Fair value of plan assets 6,222 5,569 Funded status of funded benefit obligations (109) 546 Present value of unfunded benefit obligations (419) (463) Unrecognised liability 1,829 922 Other employee benefit plans (7) (7) Netted pension asset/(liability) 1,294 998 of which included in pension assets 1,487 1,217 of which included in provisions for pension liabilities (193) (219) (in € millions) The table below shows the sensitivity of the employer pension income of 2012 to deviations in assumptions (applied in the year-end 2011 valuations). The absolute impact of an upward or downward adjustment of the same assumption may substantially deviate due to its impact on the amount of unrecognised losses and the amortisation costs thereof in the employer pension expense.

Restructuring As at 31 December 2012, the provision for restructuring programmes amounted to €147 million (2011: 273). The provision related mainly to the Master Plan III restructuring programme for a total of €134 million, restructuring within the joint venture Postkantoren B.V. for €7 million and other smaller restructuring programmes for a total of €6 million. The additions of €21 million related mainly to the Master Plan III restructuring programme (€17 million) and to a restructuring within Data & Document Management (€3 million). The main part of the additions to the Master Plan III provision relates to the restructuring of the overhead and head office departments (in total €14 million). The remaining additions to the Master Plan III provision of €3 million resulted from the periodical reassessment of the projected cash costs during 2012. The Master Plan III provision for the restructuring of the overhead and head office departments commenced in 2012. This programme relates to a number of different departments. As some departments have not yet finalised their preparations, the current provision only relates to part of the overall overhead programme. The provision recorded as at 31 December 2012 is expected to relate to 66 employees. The restructuring provision within Data & Document Management resulted from the announcement to restructure part of its activities, where cost savings are needed to adjust to the adverse developments in market conditions (price pressure and strong competition). The restructuring is expected to affect 48 employees. The withdrawals of €102 million concerned severance payments for 1,340 FTEs under the Master Plan III programme totalling €85 million, settlement payments within Postkantoren B.V. of €11 million, payments for other initiatives within Mail in the Netherlands of €3 million and within other business lines of €3 million. The release of €49 million related for €46 million to the change in the rollout plan of the Master Plan III restructuring programme within operations. Compared to the previous rollout plan, the adjusted plan focuses on a more controlled rollout, resulting in a more phased manner of the centralisation of preparation locations. As the organisational model will remain more locally-organised for a longer period, management expects a substantially lower number of redundancies (around 720 FTE fewer). The restructuring provisions are discounted against an average discount rate of 1.8% (2011: 2.6%) as they are expected to be utilised mainly during the period 2013 – 2016. The related interest charges of €4 million have been recorded as part of financial expenses. In 2012, the settlements withdrawn from the restructuring provision related to a total of 1,529 FTEs (2011: 1,075). Claims and indemnities The provision for claims and indemnities includes provisions for claims from third parties with respect to PostNL’s ordinary business activities, as well as indemnities and disputes related to the sale of PostNL’s discontinued operations. More detailed information relating to these provisions is not provided as such information could prejudice the company’s position with respect to these claims and indemnities. Other Other provisions consist of anticipated contributions to the postal fund for unemployment, onerous contracts, dilapidation cost in relation to restructurings and guarantees provided to third parties. The additions of €6 million related to the sector’s unemployment fund (€3 million) and to onerous contracts (€3 million).

The carrying amounts of the current portion of long-term debt approximated their fair value. The long-term eurobonds with a carrying amount of €1,575 million include a £450 million bond. The related foreign exchange risk is covered by a cross-currency swap. The derivatives of €29 million consist of the fair value valuations of the £450/€568 million and the £13/€16 million cross-currency swaps.

PostNL Annual Report 2012 105 Performance statements | Chapter 17 Notes to the consolidated income statement 15 Net sales Net sales: 4,317 million (2011: 4,283) The net sales of PostNL arose from rendering postal and related services to businesses and consumers in the Benelux, United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. Net sales is allocated by the nature of the services provided and geographical area in which the entity records sales and is detailed in note 33 to the consolidated financial statements. 16 Other operating revenues Other operating revenues: 13 million (2011: 14) Other operating revenues covers the sale of goods and rendering of services not related to PostNL’s regular business activities. In 2012, these revenues mainly related to customs and administration revenue for €5 million (2011: 3), rental income on temporarily leased-out property for €2 million (2011: 3) and IT advisory revenue for €2 million (2011: 1). 17 Other income Other income: 32 million (2011: 53) Other income in 2012 mainly included book profits from the sale of property, plant and equipment (mostly within Mail in the Netherlands) for a net amount of €14 million (2011: 17) and negative goodwill arising from the 2012 acquisition of trans-oflex (within Parcels) for an amount of €15 million (2011: 33, related to the book profit from the sale of international business within PostNL Other). Other income in 2012 also included the received dividend from TNT Express of €1 million. 18 Salaries, pensions and social security contributions Salaries, pensions and social security contributions: 1,293 million (2011: 1,429) Salaries, pensions and social security contributions Year ended at 31 December 2012 2011 Salaries 1,080 1,144 Defined benefit plans 47 117 Defined contribution plans 5 5 Pension charges 52 122 Share-based payments 0 9 Social security charges 161 154 Total 1,293 1,429 (in € millions) In 2012, salaries of €1,080 million decreased by €64 million from €1,144 million in 2011, which is mainly due to the impact of the net release of provisions of €23 million in 2012 compared to a net addition of €10 million in 2011. The pension expenses in 2012 included a net curtailment gain of €11 million related to the Master Plan III restructuring and the agreement of the collective labour agreement of Mail Netherlands. In 2012, the social security charges increased by €7 million compared to 2011, mainly due to higher contributions to the sector’s unemployment fund.

During 2012, the total headcount of PostNL increased by 903 employees compared to 31 December 2011. This mainly related to an increase within Parcels of 603 employees (mainly due to the acquisition of trans-o-flex) and within International of 497 employees (mainly due to the end-to-end pilot in the United Kingdom for 401 employees and an increase in Germany of 99 employees), partly offset by the reduction within Mail in the Netherlands of 252 employees (due to the implementation of the Master Plans). At the end of 2012, there were 2,527 people (2011: 2,996) employed by joint ventures, of whom 535 employees (2011: 860) were on the payroll of Dutch companies, primarily within Postkantoren B.V., and 1,992 employees (2011: 2,136) were on the payroll of HIM Holtzbrinck in Germany. Apart from the headcount of employees, the labour force is also measured in FTEs based on the hours worked divided by the local standard. In 2012, the average number of FTEs decreased by 543 FTEs compared to 2011. In the segment Mail in the Netherlands, the reduction in FTEs is higher than the reduction in headcount, which is mainly caused by the substitution of full-time employees by part-time employees. Remuneration of members of the Supervisory Board For the year 2012, the remuneration cost of the current and former members of the Supervisory Board amounted to €411,333 (2011: 441,331) as shown in the below table.

Base salary As presented at the 2011 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 25 May 2011, the 2012 annual base salaries for members of the Board of Management were set at €700,000 for Mr Koorstra, CEO, €425,000 for Mr Bos, CFO, €450,000 for Ms Verhagen and €350,000 for Mr Aben. 108 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated income statement At the 2012 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 24 April 2012, the chairman of the Supervisory Board announced the appointment of Ms Verhagen to the position of CEO after the decision by Mr Koorstra to leave the company. In November 2012, the Supervisory Board approved a new base salary for Ms Verhagen as of her appointment date. The base salary has been adjusted retrospectively to a new base salary of €625,000 as of 24 April 2012. The new base salary is in line with the current remuneration policy and the proposed remuneration policy 2013 and represents a base salary that is below the 2012 base salary of the former CEO. Accrued for short-term incentive PostNL accounts for bonus payments on the basis of the accrued bonuses for the performance of the year reported. At the 2012 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, Ms Verhagen clarified the decision of the Board of Management to waive its variable remuneration opportunity for 2012. Therefore no variable remuneration has been awarded to the members of the Board of Management for 2012. In 2012, an amount of €1,071,366 relating to the 2011 performance bonus was paid to members of the Board of Management. Of this, 50% was paid in shares and 50% in cash, except for Mr Koorstra who received 100% of the 2011 performance bonus in cash. On behalf of the Board of Management the company purchased shares on the basis of the NYSE Euronext Amsterdam share price of PostNL on the date prevailing at the time of the allotment. In compliance with the Dutch corporate governance code, the current and former members of the Board of Management may not sell their PostNL shares before the earlier of five years from the date of purchase or the end of their employment, although any sale of shares for the purpose of using the proceeds to pay for the tax relating to the purchase of these shares is exempted. For compliance reasons a sale of shares may not occur earlier than six months after termination of the employment agreement. Accrued for long-term incentive The total share-based payment costs for the members of the Board of Management amounted to €3,218 (2011: 1,634,437) and related for 2012 to the one-off Investment/Matching plan as shown below for Mr J.P.P. Bos. The 2011 total share-based payments costs included costs related to the unwinding of the 2009 and 2010 Performance Share plans of the various members of the Board of Management amounting to €1,242,504.

In 2011, the Supervisory Board decided to apply a voluntary one-off Investment/Matching plan in which the cash proceeds from the unwinding of the TNT Bonus/Matching plan, Performance Share plan and Option plan could be invested in PostNL shares. The participants could elect to invest from their net unwinding cash compensation an amount equal to 25% or 50% of their total gross unwinding-related sum (but not more than the net proceeds thereof) in PostNL shares. On the same date these shares were purchased, the participant received, free of charge, a matching right in shares, representing the value in cash of half of the number of investment shares (matching on a 1: 0.5 basis). This matching right will vest and the cash value of the shares comprising the matching right will be paid after three years, provided that the participant has remained an employee throughout and still owns at least 50% of his/her investment shares. If, prior to vesting, the participant sold more than half of his/her investment shares, the matching right will forfeit in full. If the participant sold 50% or fewer of his/her investment shares, the number of shares comprising the matching right will be reduced proportionally. The cash sum of the matching rights will be subject to any applicable payroll withholding taxes. The fair value of the one-off Investment/Matching plan grants based on the NYSE Euronext Amsterdam share price of PostNL on the reporting date amounted to €2.92 (2011: 2.46). The liabilities arising from the share-based payment transaction, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted and the extent to which the employee had rendered service, amounted to €4,103 as at 31 December 2012 (2011: 885). Other periodic compensation Other periodic compensation included company costs related to tax and social security, company car and other costs. It also included a total of €441,706 crisis tax ( crisisheffing ) charged on salaries above €150,000 in 2012 for all current and former members of theBoard of Management.Other periodic compensation to Mr Koorstra included a salary allowance of €196,205 to compensate for his changed pension scheme as from 2006 onwards and €167,264 as cash compensation for his accumulated vacation days over the past years. PostNL Annual Report 2012 109 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated income statement Pension costs The pension costs consist of the service costs for the reported year, net of employee contributions. All members of the Board of Management are participants in a career average defined benefit scheme. The pensionable age of all members of the Board of Management is 65 years. Loans, advance payments or guarantees No loans, advance payments or guarantees were granted to members of the Board of Management in 2012 (2011: nil). Remuneration of senior management Bonus/Matching share plan As of 2011, all senior management may, on a voluntary basis, participate in a new Bonus/Matching plan. In such a case, they are paid 100% of their bonus in cash and can convert 25% as a grant of PostNL shares with an associated matching right if at least 50% of the shares are kept for three years. The company sees the bonus/matching plan as part of the remuneration package for the members of its senior management, and it is particularly aimed at further aligning their interests with the interests of the shareholders. Based on the discretion of the Supervisory Board, grants are made on an annual basis in accordance with the Bonus/Matching plan, which has been approved by the Supervisory Board. The significant aspects of the plan are: • bonus shares are purchased from the participant’s net income using 25% of the gross bonus amount and bonus shares are delivered upon the grant of the right on matching shares, • the number of bonus shares is calculated by dividing 25% of an individual’s gross annual bonus relating to the preceding financial year by the share price on the NYSE Euronext Amsterdam on the date the grant is made (2012: €3.34 per share; 2011: €6.76 per share), • the rights on matching shares are granted free of charge and the number of shares is equal to the number of bonus shares (job level A) or twice the number of bonus shares (job level B and above), • the matching rights vest three years after the delivery of the bonus shares. The cash value of the shares comprising the matching rights will be paid out for each bonus share that has been retained for three years, • for each bonus share that is sold within three years, the associated right to one matching share lapses. If more than 50% of the bonus shares are sold within three years, the entire right to matching shares lapses with immediate effect, • where a participant leaves the company for certain reasons (retirement, certain reorganisations, disability or death), the right to matching shares will vest immediately and he/she can exercise his/her right pro rata, and • a participant loses the right to exercise his/her right on matching shares when he/she leaves the company for reasons other than those mentioned. The exercise of the rights on matching shares is subject to the PostNL rules concerning the prevention of use of inside information. All awards under this plan are cash-settled. The table below summarises the status of the number of outstanding rights on the Bonus/Matching plan (and the limited amount of rights on the one-off Investment/Matching plan) granted to senior managers in the PostNL Group. Bonus/Matching plan senior management PostNL 2012 Year Number outstanding Granted during Settled during Forfeited during Number outstanding 1 Jan 2012 2012 2012 2012 31 Dec 2012 Matching rights 2011 200,507 (5,623) (1,965) 192,919 2012 351,786 351,786 Total 200,507 351,786 (5,623) (1,965) 544,705 The fair value of the Bonus/Matching plan rights based on the NYSE Euronext Amsterdam share price of PostNL on the reporting date amounted to €2.92 (2011: 2.46). The liabilities arising from the share-based payment transactions, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted and the extent to which the employees had rendered service, amounted to €260,357 (2011: 96,663) for the 2011 Bonus/Matching plan and €193,896 (2011: 0) for the 2012 Bonus/Matching plan as at 31 December 2012. Fair value assumptions and hedging PostNL operates a number of cash-settled share-based compensation plans. They involve a cash payment to employees for amounts that are based on the price of PostNL’s shares and which is equal to the gain that would have been made by exercising the notional options and immediately selling the shares in the market. The corresponding liability for the cashsettled plans is measured, initially and at each reporting date until settled, at the fair value of the rights, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted and the extent to which the employees have rendered service to date. Any changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement. Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of rights that are expected to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each 110 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated income statement reporting period, PostNL revises its estimates of the number of rights that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to liabilities. As all awards under the one-off Investment/Matching plan for the Board of Management and senior management and the Bonus/Matching plan for senior management are cash-settled, the company no longer needs to manage the risk in connection with the obligations the company had under the former equity-settled plans by purchasing shares on the market. As a result, the company did not purchase any additional shares in 2012 to cover its obligations under the existing cash-settled plans. 19 Depreciation, amortisation and impairments Depreciation, amortisation and impairments: 250 million (2011: 112) Depreciation, amortisation and impairments Year ended at 31 December 2012 2011 Amortisation of intangible assets 27 23 Depreciation property, plant and equipment 77 76 Impairment of intangible assets 1 Impairment of property, plant and equipment 2 12 Value adjustment of assets held for sale 144 Total 250 112 (in € millions) In 2012, the amortisation of intangible assets of €27 million (2011: 23) related to software for €25 million (2011: 21) and other intangibles for €2 million (2011: 2).

The 2012 value adjustment of assets held for sale of €144 million related to the stake in TNT Express for €135 million and to an impairment of the customer contact services within Mail in the Netherlands for €9 million (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). 20 Other operating expenses Other operating expenses: 201 million (2011: 260) The other operating expenses consist of IT communication, office, travel, consulting and training expenses and other shared services costs. In 2012, total PwC fees amounted to €2.7 million (2011: 3.5). The table below presents the total PostNL Group incurred fees, which can be divided into the following categories: Audit fees Year ended at 31 December 2012 2011 Audit fees 2.4 2.9 Audit related fees 0.3 0.5 Tax advisory fees 0.0 0.0 Other fees 0.0 0.1 Total 2.7 3.5 (in € millions) Audit fees include fees from the audit of the financial statements, the corporate responsibility reports and the regulatory audit. Audit-related services include specific audit procedures for employee benefit plan audits, due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions and consultation concerning financial accounting and reporting matters not classified as audit. Fees for tax services include tax compliance and tax advice, including all services performed by the auditor’s professional staff in its tax division, except those rendered in connection with the audit.

PostNL Annual Report 2012 111 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated income statement In accordance with the Dutch legislation, article 2:382a, the total audit and audit-related fees charged by the auditor PwC. based in the Netherlands amounted to €2.5 million (2011: 3.4). 21 Net financial expenses Net financial expenses: 104 million (2011: 101) Net financial expenses Year ended at 31 December 2012 2011 Interest expenses (107) (119) Hedge reserve recycled to profit and loss (2) (2) Net foreign exchange gains (1) 0 Interest and similar expenses (110) (121) Interest and similar income 6 20 Net financial expenses (104) (101) (in € millions) Interest and similar expenses: 110 million (2011: 121) In 2012, the interest and similar expenses of €110 million (2011: 121) mainly consisted of interest expenses of €107 million (2011: 119). This amount mainly consisted of external interest expenses of €105 million (2011: 111) related to interest expenses on long-term borrowings of €98 million (2011: 97), interest expenses on provisions of €4 million (2011: 8), interest expenses on bank overdrafts and bank loans of €2 million (2011: 4), attributable to a gross-up of interest on notional cash pools, and interest on taxes of €1 million (2011: 2). Interest expenses further included bank charges of €2 million (2011: 3). In 2011, interest expenses included €5 million interest expenses paid to Express in the first five months of 2011. Interest and similar income: 6 million (2011: 20) In 2012, the interest and similar income amounted to €6 million (2011: 20). This amount included interest income on banks, loans and deposits of €3 million (2011: 8), of which €2 million (2011: 4) related to a gross-up of interest on notional cash pools, and interest on taxes of €0 million (2011: 5). In 2012, similar income of €3 million (2011: 0) represented the change in the value of fair-value hedges. In 2011, the interest income included €7 million interest income received from TNT Express in the first 5 months of 2011. In accordance with IFRS, the 2012 interest income on cash pools of €2 million (2011: 4) and interest expense on cash pools for the same amounts are reported on a gross basis. 22 Income taxes Income taxes: 80 million (2011: 78) In 2012, income taxes amounted to €80 million (2011: 78), or 10.6% (2011: -22.6%) of the profit before income taxes of €758 million (2011: -345). Effective income tax rate Year ended at 31 December 2012 2011 Dutch statutory income tax rate 25.0 25.0 Adjustment regarding effective income tax rates other countries 0.6 0.9 Weighted average statutory tax rate 25.6 25.9 Permanent differences: Non and partly deductible costs 0.6 1.0 Non and partly deductible impairments 0.7 Exempt income (3.0) Other (2.0) 0.8 Effective income tax rate before impact stake Express 24.9 24.7 Impact stake Express (14.3) (47.3) Effective income tax rate 10.6 (22.6) (in percentages) Income taxes differ from the amount calculated by multiplying the Dutch statutory corporate income tax rate with the profit before income taxes. The effective income tax rate was 10.6% (2011: -22.6%). The statutory income tax rate in the Netherlands is 25.0% (2011: 25.0%). The effective income tax rate was significantly impacted by the stake in TNT Express (2012: €437 million; 2011: -661). Excluding the impact of the stake in TNT Express, the profit before tax would have been €321 million in 2012 (2011: 316) with a corresponding effective income tax rate of 24.9% (2011: 24.7%). 112 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated income statement The effective income tax rate before the impact of the stake in TNT Express of 24.9% was mainly caused by the positive balance of differences between Dutch and local tax rates in other countries (0.6%), non and partly deductible costs (0.6%), a non deductible impairment on assets classified as held for sale relating to customer contact services (0.7%), and certain items included in the line ‘Other’ (-2.0%). The line ‘Other’ consists the combined impact of the non-taxable negative goodwill relating to the acquisition of the trans-o-flex activities (-1.2%), irrecoverable tax losses for which no deferred tax assets could be recognised (1.1%), reassessed tax losses and credits for which deferred tax assets have been recognised (-0.8%), and several prior year adjustments that positively impacted the effective income tax rate (-1.1%). Income tax expense consists of the following: Income taxes Year ended at 31 December 2012 2011 Current tax expense (27) 59 Changes in deferred taxes 107 19 Total income taxes 80 78 (in € millions) The current tax expense amounts to -€27 million (2011: 59). The difference between the total income taxes in the income statement and the current tax expense is due to timing differences. These differences are recognised as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. At 31 December 2012, the income tax receivable amounted to €4 million (2011: 3) and the income tax payable amounted to €28 million (2011: 94). In 2012, PostNL paid income taxes for a total amount of €40 million (2011: 98); see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements. The following table shows the movements in deferred tax assets in 2012: Statement of changes deferred income tax assets Property, plant and Losses carried Provisions equipment forward Other Total Deferred tax assets at 31 December 2010 2 6 13 21 Changes charged directly to equity (14) (14) Changes via income statement (1) 6 8 13 Deferred tax assets at 31 December 2011 0 1 12 7 20 Changes via income statement 1 (2) 4 3 Deferred tax assets at 31 December 2012 1 1 10 11 23 (in € millions) Of the deferred tax assets as at 31 December 2012 an amount of €6 million (2011: 5) is to be recovered within 12 months and an amount of €17 million (2011: 15) after 12 months. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented net in the balance sheet if PostNL has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxation authority. The total accumulated losses available to carry forward at 31 December 2012 amount to €144 million (2011: 129). With these losses carried forward, future tax benefits of €42 million could be recognised (2011: 39). Tax deductible losses give rise to deferred tax assets at the statutory tax rate in the relevant country. Deferred tax assets are recognised if it is probable that they will be realised. The probability of the realisation is impacted by uncertainties regarding the realisation of such benefits, for example as a result of the expiration of tax losses carried forward and projected future taxable income. As a result PostNL has not recognised €32 million (2011: 27) of the potential future tax benefits and has recorded deferred tax assets of €10 million at the end of 2012 (2011: 12). PostNL Annual Report 2012 113 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated income statement The expiration of total accumulated losses is presented in the table below: Expiration of accumulated losses for carry forward arrangements income tax 2013 2 2014 0 2015 3 2016 0 2017 and thereafter 38 Indefinite 101 Total 144 (in € millions) The following table shows the movements in deferred tax liabilities in 2012: Statement of changes deferred income tax liabilities Property, plant and Provisions equipment Other Total Deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2010 281 45 1 327 Changes via income statement 21 9 2 32 (De)consolidation/demerger (18) (18) Deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2011 284 54 3 341 Changes via income statement 100 6 4 110 Deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2012 384 60 7 451 (in € millions) Of the deferred tax liabilities as at 31 December 2012 an amount of €6 million (2011: -13) is to be settled within 12 months and an amount of €445 million (2011: 354) after 12 months. The increase of the deferred tax liabilities mainly relates to the pensions and Master Plan provisions. 114 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 Notes to the consolidated statement of cash flows 23 Net cash (used in)/from operating activities Net cash (used in)/from operating activities: -56 million (2011: 122) Net cash from operating activities decreased by €178 million from €122 million in 2011 to -€56 million in 2012. The non-cash transactions in the statement of cash flows relate to depreciation, amortisation and impairments, share-based payments, investment income and changes in provisions. Cash generated from operations The cash generated from operations decreased from €321 million in 2011 to €83 million in 2012. The decrease of €238 million was mainly explained by: • profit before income tax adjusted for the non-cash impact of depreciation, amortisation and impairments and the impairments and results of investments in associates of €9 million, • change in pension liabilities of -€153 million, • change in other provisions of -€68 million, and • change in working capital of -€40 million. The proﬁt before income taxes of €758 million (2011: -345) adjusted for the non-cash impact of depreciation, amortisation and impairments of €250 million (2011: 112) and the impairments and results of investments in associates of -€571 million (2011: 661) amounted to €437 million and is €9 million higher compared to 2011 (€428 million). The change in pension liabilities decreased by €153 million from -€143 million in 2011 to -€296 million in 2012 and reflects the difference between the total non-cash employer pension expense for the post-employment defined benefit plans of €47 million (2011: 117) and the comparable total cash contributions for a total amount of €343 million (2011: 260). In 2012, the cash contributions include top up payments of €83 million in total. The change in other provisions decreased by €68 million from -€64 million in 2011 to -€132 million in 2012 and reflects the difference between the recorded costs for provisions (net amount of additions and releases) of -€21 million (2011: 14) and the withdrawals of €111 million (2011: 78). These withdrawals related mainly to restructuring settlements for Master Plan III and several other smaller restructuring programmes. The change in working capital decreased by €40 million from €40 million in 2011 to €0 million in 2012. In 2012, the total working capital remained constant compared to year-end 2011 due to a continued focus on payment behaviour of customers and on payment terms of suppliers. Interest paid The total cash out for interest paid in 2012 amounted to €99 million (2011: 101). In 2012, interest paid mainly included interest on PostNL’s long-term borrowings of €92 million (2011: 93), interest related to income taxes of €3 million (2011: 2) and other bank charges of €2 million (2011: 2). In addition, interest payments of €2 million (2011: 4) were included for shortterm debt (which mainly related to a gross-up on notional cash pools, which was offset in the interest received). In accordance with IFRS, the interest paid and received on notional cash pools is reported on a gross basis. Income taxes paid PostNL paid income taxes for a total amount of €40 million (2011: 98), which includes payments relating to prior years of €13 million (2011: 43). 24 Net cash (used in)/from investing activities Net cash (used in)/from investing activities: -156 million (2011: 47) Interest received In 2012, interest received amounted to €11 million (2011: 7) and mainly included interest received on income taxes of €7 million (2011: 0) and interest received on short-term bank balances and deposits of €4 million (2011: 7), of which €2 million (2011: 4) related to a gross-up on notional cash pools, which is offset in the interest paid. Dividend received In 2012, the cash inflow for dividend of €2 million (2011: 7) mainly related to dividend received from the stake in TNT Express and from minority shareholdings in Germany. PostNL Annual Report 2012 115 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the consolidated statement of cash flows Acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures (net of cash) In 2012, the total cash inflow net of cash for acquisitions of Group companies amounted to €15 million (2011: -2) and mainly related to the acquisition of trans-o-flex. Disposal of subsidiaries and joint ventures In 2012, the net proceeds from the disposal of subsidiaries and joint ventures amounted to €0 million (2011: 110). In 2011, PostNL disposed of De Belgische Distributiedienst, Lifecycle Marketing, RSM Italy S.rl., Telepost SpA Italy and the international activities in Eastern Europe for a total amount of €110 million. Investments in associates In 2012, the investments in associates of €1 million (2011: 0) mainly related to the acquisition of a 40% share in Scoupy B.V. Capital expenditure on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment In 2012, capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment amounted to €175 million (2011: 104) and mainly related to the new logistical infrastructure within Parcels, Master Plan-related projects and replacements. The capital expenditures on other intangible assets of €29 million (2011: 33) mostly related to software. Capital expenditures are funded primarily by cash generated from operations and are part of strict cash control and review. Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment In 2012, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment amounted to €27 million (2011: 62), which mainly related to the sale of several buildings from PostNL Real Estate B.V. and PostNL Real Estate Development B.V. (totalling €26 million, 2011: 57). In 2011, an amount of €35 million was included related to the sale of head office investments and a building in Belgium to Express prior to the demerger. Other changes in (financial) fixed assets In 2012, the other changes in (financial) fixed assets of -€2 million (2011: 1) mainly related to the non-consolidated part of a new loan to the joint venture in HIM Holtzbrinck. Changes in non-controlling interests In 2012, the changes in non-controlling interests of -€4 million (2011: -1) related to a repayment of capital of €3 million to TNT Post GmbH & Co. KG, a 71% investment of PostNL, and the buy-out of minority interests in subsidiaries of TNT Post UK of €1 million. 25 Net cash (used in)/from financing activities Net cash (used in)/from financing activities: -66 million (2011: 432) Cash settlement share-based payments In 2012, share-based payments amounted to €2 million (2011: 6) and related to the buy-out of minority interests in subsidiaries of TNT Post UK (2011: 2). Proceeds from and repayments of long-term borrowings In 2012, the total net proceeds from and repayments of long-term borrowings amounted to €4 million (2011: -1) and mainly related to some small loans in International. Proceeds from and repayments of short-term borrowings In 2012, the total net proceeds from and repayments of short-term borrowings amounted to -€67 million (2011: 25) and mainly related to a repayment of €30 million of the short-term part of a long-term loan and to the net of increases and decreases on outstanding local short-term debt, of which -€31 million was in the United Kingdom (2011: proceeds of 29). Repayments of finance leases In 2012, the total repayments related to redemptions on finance lease contracts amounted to €1 million (2011: 4). Dividends paid In 2012, no dividend was paid in cash (2011: 80). Financing related to discontinued business In 2011, the cash inflow from financing related to discontinued business amounted to €498 million. This mainly consisted of final settlements of intercompany balances between PostNL and the discontinued Express activities over the first five months of 2011. 116 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 Additional notes 26 Business combinations (No corresponding ﬁnancial statement number) In 2012, PostNL acquired 100% of shares in the Dutch and Belgian activities of trans-o-flex. Both entities operate in the business-to-business market for parcels and pallets with strong presence in the Pharmaceutical and Consumer Electronics verticals. The negative goodwill arising from the trans-o-flex acquisitions amounted to €15 million, which represents the excess of the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses over the total purchase consideration. The gain has been recognised in ’other income’. For the short term PostNL envisages operational losses and restructuring costs of the Dutch and Belgian activities. PostNL will adjust the provisional amounts, which have been recognised as part of the trans-of-flex acquisition, if required by new facts and circumstances noted during the measurement period. In 2012, PostNL also acquired 100% of the shares of Marvia B.V. and Marvia IE B.V. (‘Marvia’). Marvia provides self-service desktop publishing software as a service, targeting the franchise and retail market. The goodwill arising from the Marvia acquisition amounted to €1 million. The impact of the Marvia acquistion and other smaller acquisitions on the pro forma results of PostNL is not material. Acquiree’s results In 2012, the acquiree’s total net income attributable to shareholders accounted within PostNL, since acquisition date, amounted to -€5 million. Pro forma results The pro forma revenues of PostNL for 2012, as if the trans-o-flex acquisitions had taken place on 1 January 2012, would have increased to €4,350 million and the pro forma results would have decreased to €674 million. Pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the future performance of PostNL. Pro forma results business combinations Year ended at 31 December Pro forma results (unaudited) 2012 As reported 2012 Total revenues 4,350 4,330 Profit for the year from continuing operations 675 678 Profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent 674 677 Earnings per ordinary share (in € cents)1 153.2 153.9 (in € millions, unless otherwise indicated) 1 Earnings per ordinary share are based on an average of 439,973,297 outstanding ordinary shares. 27 Commitments and contingencies (No corresponding ﬁnancial statement number) Off-balance sheet commitments At 31 December 2012 2011 Rent and operating lease 301 288 Capital expenditure 44 57 Purchase commitments 30 42 Pension top up invoices 64 (in € millions) As at 31 December 2012, €212 million of the commitments indicated above are of a short-term nature (2011: 169). PostNL Annual Report 2012 117 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes Rent and operational lease contracts In 2012, operational lease expenses (including rental) in the consolidated income statement amounted to €124 million (2011: 123). There were no material individual lease contracts as at 31 December 2012. Future payments on non-cancellable existing lease contracts mainly relating to real estate, computer equipment and other equipment are as follows: Repayment schedule rent/operational leases At 31 December 2012 2011 Less than 1 year 99 90 Between 1 and 2 years 69 68 Between 2 and 3 years 50 45 Between 3 and 4 years 27 29 Between 4 and 5 years 18 16 Thereafter 38 40 Total 301 288 of which guaranteed by a third party/customers 1 1 (in € millions) Capital expenditure As at 31 December 2012, commitments in connection with capital expenditure amounted to €44 million (2011: 57) and related to property, plant and equipment. These commitments primarily relate to projects within the operations of Mail in the Netherlands (sorting machines) and to the new logistical infrastructure of Parcels. Purchase commitments As at 31 December 2012, PostNL had unconditional purchase commitments of €30 million (2011: 42), primarily related to various service and maintenance contracts. These service and maintenance contracts are primarily for information technology, security, salary registration and cleaning. Commitments for pension top up invoices As at 31 December 2012, the coverage ratio of the main pension fund of PostNL was 102.5%, below the minimum requirement of around 104%. The coverage ratio includes top up payments considered receivable from PostNL of €64 million. PostNL expects to pay the remaining invoiced top up payments of €64 million in Q1 2013. As at 31 December 2012, the deficit of the main pension fund allocated to PostNL was around €94 million, resulting in a conditional invoice for a further top up payment from the pension fund of around €13 million, payable in Q2 2013 if the minimum required level of around 104% is not reached on 31 March 2013. Contingent tax liabilities Multinational groups of the size of PostNL are exposed to varying degrees of uncertainty related to tax planning and regulatory reviews and audits. PostNL accounts for its income taxes on the basis of its own internal analyses, supported by external advice. PostNL continually monitors its global tax position, and whenever uncertainties arise, PostNL assesses the potential consequences and either accrues the liability or discloses a contingent liability in its financial statements, depending on the strength of the company’s position and the resulting risk of loss. Guarantees As at 31 December 2012, PostNL, on behalf of its subsidiaries, had various parental and bank guarantees outstanding. However, none (2011: 0) resulted in an off-balance sheet commitment for the Group as the relating obligations to external parties have already been recognised by these subsidiaries following their ordinary course of business. Contingent legal liabilities Ordinary course litigation The company is involved in several legal proceedings relating to the normal conduct of its business, such as claims for loss of goods, delays in delivery, trademark infringements, subcontracting and employment issues, and general liability. The majority of these claims are for amounts below €1 million and are insured and/or provided for. PostNL does not expect any liability arising from any of these legal proceedings to have a material effect on its operational results, liquidity, capital resources or ﬁnancial position. The company believes it has provided for all probable liabilities deriving from the normal course of business. 118 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes 28 Financial risk management (No corresponding financial statement number) PostNL’s activities expose the company to a variety of financial risks, such as market risks (including foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. All of these risks arise in the normal course of business and therefore PostNL uses various techniques and financial derivatives to mitigate these risks. The following analyses provide quantitative information regarding PostNL’s exposure to the financial risks described above. There are certain limitations and simplifications inherent in the analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that rates change in a parallel fashion and instantaneously, while at the same time, for example, the impact of changes in interest on foreign exchange exposures and vice-versa is ignored. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that would normally arise from the market shifts assumed. PostNL uses derivative financial instruments solely for the purpose of hedging currency and interest exposures. The company enters into contracts related to derivative financial instruments for periods commensurate with its underlying exposures and does not take positions independent of these exposures. None of these financial instruments are leveraged or used for trading purposes or to take speculative positions. Financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Management. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risk in close cooperation with operating units. The Board of Management provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Periodic reporting on financial risks has been embedded in the overall risk framework and has been provided to the Board of Management in a structural way. Interest rate risk PostNL identifies interest rate risk associated with its financial assets and borrowings; for the financial effects from movements in interest rates on the company’s pension obligations, reference is made to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. A minor part of PostNL’s borrowings is against floating interest rates. These floating interest rates may fluctuate substantially and could have an adverse effect on PostNL’s financial results in any given reporting period. Due to the minor size of floating interest borrowings in the total structure of PostNL’s borrowings, such effect is considered virtually negligible. Borrowings that are issued at floating interest rates expose the company to the risk of increasing interest costs (cash flow interest risk). Borrowings that are issued at fixed rates expose the company to risk of incurring high interest costs should interest rates fall in future (fair value interest risk). PostNL’s financial assets are on average of such short-term nature that they bear no significant fair value interest risk, but do cause cash flow interest rate risks. Group policy is to significantly limit the impact of interest fluctuations over a term of seven years as a percentage of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. As at 31 December 2012, PostNL’s gross interest-bearing borrowings, including ﬁnance lease obligations, totalled €1,618 million (2011: 1,670), of which €1,615 million (2011: 1,639) was at ﬁxed interest rates. Although PostNL generally enters into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivatives in order to attempt to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations, these measures may be inadequate or may subject the company to increased operating or financing costs. At the end of 2012 PostNL did not have any interest rate swaps open. At 31 December 2012, if interest rates on borrowings and financial assets had been 1% higher with other variables held constant, the profit before income tax would have been €4 million higher (2011: 6). As virtually all debts are at fixed rates, the increase in the rate will not affect the cost base. The potential profit increase is entirely contributable to interest income on the cash and cash equivalents. Equity would be impacted by €0 million (2011: 0), due to the change in the interest curve projection applied for the calculation of the fair value of the £450/€568 million cross-currency swap, as well as the €4 million (2011: 6) impact on profit before income taxes (see also note 29 to the consolidated financial statements). Foreign currency exchange risk PostNL does have international operations that generate foreign currency exchange risks arising from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities, investments and divestments in foreign currencies other than functional currencies of the respective business units of PostNL, irrespective of whether it is the euro (PostNL’s functional and reporting currency) or another functional currency. Group Treasury matches and manages the intragroup and external financial exposures. Although the company generally enters into hedging arrangements and other contracts to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations, these measures may be inadequate or may subject the company to increased operating or financing costs. PostNL Annual Report 2012 119 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes The main currencies of PostNL’s external hedges are the British pound and US dollar, of which the 2012 exchange rates to euro are shown below: Exchange rates main foreign currency Year opening1 Year end closing2 Annual Average3 British pound 0.83514 0.81610 0.81098 US dollar 1.29350 1.31940 1.28828 (in €) 1 Source: European Central Bank, reference rate on the first day of the year. 2 Source: European Central Bank, reference rate on the last day of the year. 3 The annual average is calculated as the 12-months’ average of the month-end-closing rates of the European Central Bank. Management has set up a policy requiring Group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against the functional currency. Group companies are required to hedge material balance sheet exposures via the use of foreign exchange derivatives with Group Treasury, whereby a financing company operated by Group Treasury trades these foreign exchange derivatives with external banks. As at 31 December 2012, PostNL had no net investment hedges outstanding. Significant acquisitions and local debt are usually funded in the currency of the underlying assets. As as 31 December 2012, if the euro had weakened 10% against both the British pound and the US dollar with all other variables held constant, the profit before income taxes on the foreign exchange exposure on financial instruments would have been €0 million lower (2011: 0). In 2012, the net income sensitivity to movements in euro/pound sterling and euro/US dollar exchange rates compared to 2011 did not change. Equity would have been impacted by €0 million (2011: 0). Credit risk Credit risk represents the losses that the company would incur if counterparties with whom PostNL enters into financial transactions are unable to fulfil the terms of those agreements. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivatives and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as credit exposures relating to customers. The company attempts to minimise, within its approved investment framework, its credit risk exposure by only transacting with financial institutions, ensuring established credit guidelines are met and by managing its customer portfolio. In the current economic environment, PostNL emphasises proactive management of credit risk relevant to both customers and financial institutions. Several initiatives have been put forward by Group Treasury to widen the range of instruments and to minimise the exposure to individual financial institutions and commercial organisations. As at the reporting date, there has been no significant concentration of credit risk across the customer portfolio. The top 10 PostNL customers accounted for 9% of the outstanding trade receivables as at 31 December 2012. Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, PostNL attempts to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available. A downgrade in PostNL’s credit rating may negatively affect its ability to obtain funds from financial institutions and banks and increase its financing costs by increasing the interest rates of its outstanding debt or the interest rates at which the company is able to refinance existing debt or incur new debt. Furthermore, other non-PostNL specific adverse market conditions could also turn out to have a material adverse effect on the company’s funding ability. The PostNL Group has the following undrawn committed facilities with end term 1 June 2016: Undrawn committed credit facilities At 31 December 2012 2011 Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facilities 570 570 (in € millions) The following table analyses PostNL’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period on the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date. The outgoing flows disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows that contain the redemptions and interest payments. 120 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes Maturity liquidity risks Less than 1 Between 1 Between 3 At 31 December year and 3 years and 5 years Thereafter Book value Outgoing flows based on the financial liabilities 2012 Eurobonds 91 573 787 573 1,575 Other loans 1 10 11 Financial leases 2 1 3 Interest rate and cross-currency swaps outgoing 40 96 80 579 29 Foreign exchange contracts outgoing 8 0 Trade accounts payable 233 233 Other current liabilities 79 79 Total outgoing flows 454 680 867 1,152 1,930 Mitigation incoming flows based on the financial liabilities 2012 Interest rate and cross-currency swaps incoming 40 96 80 579 Foreign exchange contracts incoming 8 Total liquidity risk 2012 406 584 787 573 1,930 Outgoing flows based on the financial liablities 2011 Eurobonds 90 181 565 1,294 1,557 Other loans 31 7 38 Financial leases 2 2 4 Interest rate and cross-currency swaps outgoing 71 81 81 690 40 Foreign exchange contracts outgoing 31 0 Short-term bank debt 31 31 Trade accounts payable 219 219 Other current liabilities 79 79 Total outgoing flows 554 271 646 1,984 1,968 Mitigation incoming flows based on the financial liabilities 2011 Interest rate and cross-currency swaps incoming 70 81 81 690 Foreign exchange contracts incoming 34 Total liquidity risk 2011 450 190 565 1,294 1,968 (in € millions) Capital structure management PostNL’s capital structure is managed along the following components: (I) an investment grade credit rating targeted at BBB+/Baa1; (2) an availability of €570 million of undrawn committed facilities; (3) structured funding through a combination of public and bank debt, with a risk-weighted mix of fixed and floating interest; (4) cash-pooling systems facilitating optimised cash requirements for the Group and (5) a tax-optimal internal and external funding focused at optimising the cost of capital for the Group, within long-term sustainable boundaries. A downgrade in PostNL’s credit rating may negatively affect its ability to obtain funds from financial institutions, retain investors and banks and increase its financing costs by increasing the interest rates of its outstanding debt or the interest rates at which the company is able to refinance existing debt or incur new debt. This could affect PostNL’s returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The terms and conditions of PostNL’s material long-term and short-term debts, as well as its material drawn or undrawn committed credit facilities do not include any financial covenants. There are also no opportunities to accelerate these material debts and committed facilities in the event of a credit rating downgrade. The debt and credit facility instruments vary on a case-by-case basis and mostly contain customary clauses as are generally observed in the market, such as negative pledge conditions, restrictions on the sale/the use of the proceeds of the sale of assets or businesses and in most cases change of control clauses. PostNL Annual Report 2012 121 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes 29 Financial instruments (No corresponding financial statement number) Summary financial instruments In line with IAS 39, the following categories of financial assets and financial liabilities can be distinguished. Financial instruments assets Loans and Financial assets at fair value Held to maturity Available for At 31 December Note receivables through profit and loss investments sale Total Assets as per balance sheet 2012 Other loans receivable 4 4 Accounts receivable 5 482 482 Prepayments and accrued income 6 116 116 Cash and cash equivalents 7 391 391 Total 993 0 0 0 993 Assets as per balance sheet 2011 Other loans receivable 2 2 Other financial fixed assets 1 1 Accounts receivable 5 458 458 Prepayments and accrued income 6 121 121 Cash and cash equivalents 7 668 668 Total 1,250 0 0 0 1,250 (in € millions) Financial instruments liabilities Financial liabilities measured Derivatives used Other financial At 31 December Note at amortised costs for hedging liabilities Total Liabilities as per balance sheet 2012 Long-term debt 12 1,586 29 1,615 Trade accounts payable 233 233 Other current liabilities 13 82 82 Total 1,901 29 0 1,930 Liabilities as per balance sheet 2011 Long-term debt 12 1,567 40 1,607 Trade accounts payable 219 219 Other current liabilities 13 142 142 Total 1,928 40 0 1,968 (in € millions) The fair value of financial instruments is based on foreign exchange and interest rate market prices. PostNL uses commonlypractised fair value valuation methods for its derivatives. The valuations represent a best approximation of the trading value of these derivatives at their valuation moment. The derivatives within the financial instruments are thereby grouped within level two of the fair value measurement hierarchy. Eurobonds As at 31 December 2012, the eurobonds of €1,040 million (2011: 1,040) and the pound sterling bond of £450 million (2011: £450) are measured at amortised cost of €1,575 million (2011: 1,557). This represents the nominal value corrected for the costs and issuance under par (‘at a discount’) that are still to be amortised. The book value is equal to the amortised cost value. The foreign exchange exposure on the £450 million eurobond is hedged via the £450/€568 million cross-currency swap (see ‘Foreign currrency exchange contracts’). 122 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes For the outstanding eurobonds, see the table below: Outstanding eurobonds Costs/discount to At 31 December Nominal value be amortised Hedge accounting Carrying value Fair value 3.875% eurobond 2015 400 10 No 390 423 5.375% eurobond 2017 640 3 No 637 726 7.500% eurobond 2018 (£450 million) 568 3 Yes 548 668 Total outstanding eurobonds 2012 1,608 16 1,575 1,817 3.875% eurobond 2015 400 13 No 387 406 5.375% eurobond 2017 640 3 No 637 645 7.500% eurobond 2018 (£450 million) 568 3 Yes 533 617 Total outstanding eurobonds 2011 1,608 19 1,557 1,668 (in € millions) Financial leases Total debt on financial leases mainly consists of financial lease contracts on plant and equipment. For the total outstanding financial leases, see the following table: Outstanding financial leases Fixed/floating At 31 December Nominal value interest Hedge accounting Carrying value Fair value Other leases 3 fixed No 3 3 Total outstanding financial leases 2012 3 3 3 Other leases 4 fixed No 4 4 Total outstanding financial leases 2011 4 4 4 (in € millions) Derivatives Cross-currency swaps In 2012, PostNL had a £450/€568 million cross-currency swap outstanding to hedge foreign exchange exposure on the £450 million eurobond and a £13/€16 million cross-currency swap to hedge foreign exchange exposure on the £13 million loan provided to a Group company. These swaps act as the hedge on the cash flow currency risk on these loans. Since all prior forward starting swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges, the market value movements of the effective portion of the hedges were included in equity at the moment these swaps were unwound. These market value movements will remain in the hedge reserve and will be straight-line amortised to the income statement until 2015. In 2012, net financial expense included an amortisation of €2 million from the hedge reserve. In 2012, the total ineffective portion recognised in the income statement that arises from the usage of fair value hedges amounted to €0 million (2011: 0). The total ineffective portion recognised in the income statement that arises from the usage of cash flow hedges amounted to €0 million (2011: 0). For the outstanding interest rate and cross-currency swaps, see the table below: Outstanding swaps Nominal Forward At 31 december value Starting Currency Outstanding Pay Receive Hedge Fair value Cross-currency swaps 20121 584 No GBP/EUR Yes float fixed cash flow 29 Total swaps 2012 584 29 Interest rate swaps 2011 30 No EUR Yes fixed float cash flow Cross-currency swaps 20111 568 No GBP/EUR Yes float fixed cash flow 40 Total swaps 2011 598 40 (in € millions) 1 Refer to separate disclosure on foreign exchange contracts. The fair value of the outstanding long-term cross-currency swaps is recorded as a long-term asset in ‘financial fixed assets’ or as a liability in ‘long-term debt’. The value of the pound sterling/euro cross-currency swap mainly relates to movements in the pound sterling/euro exchange rate and offsets the movement in the carrying value of the £450 million eurobond. PostNL Annual Report 2012 123 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes Foreign currency exchange contracts PostNL has entered into short-term foreign exchange derivatives to hedge foreign exchange fair value and cash flow risks. The fair value of these outstanding foreign exchange hedges is recorded as a current asset in ‘prepayments and accrued income’ or as a current liability in ‘total current borrowings’. The foreign exchange result on the outstanding fair value hedges is recorded in the income statement and mitigates the foreign exchange exposure and results on the underlying balance sheet items. For the outstanding foreign exchange contracts, see the table below: Outstanding foreign exchange contracts Amount in At 31 december Note Carrying value Fair value Nominal value Hedge equity Foreign exchange contracts 2012 Asset 6 0 0 8 fair value No Liability 14 0 0 8 fair value No Foreign exchange contracts 2011 Asset 6 0 0 34 fair value No Liability 14 0 0 31 fair value No (in € millions) The cash flow hedges on highly probable transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next 12 months. Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve within equity on the effective portion of the forward exchange contracts as at 31 December 2012 amounted to €0 (2011: 0). These reserves are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the income statement. 30 Earnings per share To calculate basic earnings per share, an average of 439,973,297 ordinary shares is taken into account. For calculation purposes, the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent of €677 million (2011: 1,736) has been applied. The diluted number of ordinary shares is nil as PostNL’s share-based payments have a cash-settled nature. Based on IAS 33, the 2011 weighted average number of shares outstanding was retrospectively increased from 383,374,983 to 431,046,838 to reflect the stock dividends issued in 2012 (refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). Accordingly, the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share has been adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented. The following table summarises the outstanding shares for PostNL’s computation related to earnings per share: (Average) number of outstanding ordinary shares Year averages and numbers at 31 December 2012 2011 Number of issued and outstanding ordinary shares 439,973,297 392,301,442 Shares held by the company to cover share plans 0 62,114 Average number of ordinary shares per year 439,973,297 431,046,838 Diluted number of ordinary shares per year 0 0 Average number of ordinary shares per year on fully diluted basis in the year 439,973,297 431,046,838 (in shares) 31 Joint ventures (No corresponding ﬁnancial statement number) The company accounts for joint ventures in which PostNL and another party have equal control according to the proportionate consolidation method. PostNL’s most signiﬁcant joint venture as at 31 December 2012, is the 50% interest in Postkantoren B.V. with ING Bank N.V., to operate post offices in the Netherlands. In addition, PostNL holds a 50% interest in HIM Holtzbrinck joint ventures. The company’s share in the joint ventures’ off-balance sheet commitments amounted to €40 million and mainly related to rent and operating lease contracts of € 29 million, purchase commitments of €4 million and guarantees issued of €2 million. Key pro rata information regarding all joint ventures in which PostNL has joint decisive inﬂuence over operations is presented in the following table and includes balances at 50%. 124 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes Key pro rata data joint ventures Year ended at 31 December 2012 2011 Non-current assets 14 13 Current assets 58 71 Total assets 72 84 Equity 28 31 Non-current liabilities 9 12 Current liabilities 35 41 Total equity and liabilities 72 84 Net sales 158 180 Operating income (1) 7 Profit attributable to the shareholders (2) 4 Net cash used in operating activities (13) (28) Net cash (used in)/from investing activities (6) 1 Net cash from financing activities 10 14 Changes in cash and cash equivalents (9) (13) (in € millions) 32 Related party transactions and balances (No corresponding financial statement number) The PostNL Group companies have trading relationships with a number of joint ventures as well as with unconsolidated companies in which PostNL holds minority shares. In some cases, there are contractual arrangements in place under which PostNL companies source supplies from such undertakings, or such undertakings source supplies from PostNL. During 2012, purchases of PostNL from its joint ventures amounted to €22 million (2011: 43). No sales were made by PostNL companies to its joint ventures (2011: 0). The net amounts due to the joint venture entities amounted to €14 million (2011: 32). As at 31 December 2012, no material amounts were payable by PostNL to associated companies. Related party transactions with PostNL’s pension fund are presented in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. PostNL considers the members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board as key management personnel as defined by IAS 24. For disclosure on related party transactions with the Board of Management and Supervisory Board, refer to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Relationship agreement PostNL and TNT Express Following the demerger of Express, PostNL and TNT Express entered into a relationship agreement and a separation agreement. The relationship agreement provides for the terms and conditions on lock-up and orderly market arrangements, subject to which PostNL may reduce its shareholding in TNT Express over time. In addition, the relationship agreement contains certain arrangements with respect to corporate governance of TNT Express. The separation agreement creates certain rights and obligations for both PostNL and TNT Express after the demerger. These relate to, among other things: (i) the unwinding of financial relationships, such as cash pools, guarantees, existing financing relationships with third parties, rights and obligations resulting in joint liabilities and other intercompany arrangements, (ii) their employees, such as allocation, works councils, collective labour agreements, share-based schemes and pensions, (iii) tax, such as the cut-off of the existing fiscal unity, profit and loss pooling arrangements, (iv) accounting and treasury, such as changes in interim period, opening balance related matters and credit rating, and (v) litigation, such as claim and litigation handling, non-allocated and non-anticipated claims and release of provisions. Pursuant to the pension arrangements concluded between PostNL, TNT Express and the pension funds, PostNL has provided a subsidiary guarantee for TNT Express in the event of violation of contractual terms, irregularity of payments and bankruptcy. This subsidiary guarantee only relates to pension benefits accrued under the existing pension plans (up to the date of the demerger) and will comprise a liability that gradually decreases over time. Furthermore, PostNL has provided a guarantee for futureTNT Express pension payments, barring certain unforeseen circumstances. The guarantees of PostNL will only exist as long as the coverage ratio of the funds are below a certain level. If the coverage ratio rises above that level and remains above that level for three consecutive quarters, the guarantees lapse. PostNL Annual Report 2012 125 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes As at 31 December 2012, no events had occurred that triggered disclosure of a significant contingent asset or liability following the aforementioned agreements with TNT Express. 33 Segment information (No corresponding financial statement number) PostNL identifies the following reportable segments: • Mail in the Netherlands, which provides mail services in the Netherlands, including the provision of the universal service and data and electronic communications activities, • Parcels, which provides standard parcel services in the Netherlands and Belgium for both domestic and cross-border parcel distribution, and • International, which provides addressed and unaddressed mail activities outside the Netherlands, in particular the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. The measure of profit and loss and assets and liabilities is based on the PostNL Group Accounting Policies, which are compliant with IFRS. The pricing of intercompany sales is done at arm’s length.

As a result, this information is not presented as part of the reportable segments. The key financial performance indicator for management of the reportable segments is underlying cash operating income. The underlying cash operating performance focuses on the underlying cash earnings performance, which is the basis for the dividend policy. In the analysis of the underlying cash operating performance, adjustments are made for non-recurring and exceptional items as well as adjustments for non-cash costs for pensions and provisions. For pensions, the IFRS-based defined benefit plan pension expenses are replaced by the non-IFRS measure of the actual cash contributions for such plans. For the other provisions, the IFRS-based net charges are replaced by the related cash outflows. Underlying cash operating income is reported on a monthly basis to the chief operating decision makers. 126 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes In 2012, the material items of income and expense as included in operating income were: • rebranding costs of €12 million, reported in Mail in the Netherlands for €5 million and in PostNL Other for €7 million, • restructuring-related charges of -€26 million in total, comprising of -€35 million in Mail in the Netherlands (mainly a result of the release related to Master Plan III provisions) and €8 million in PostNL Other, and resizing costs of €1 million in International, • value adjustments of the stake in TNT Express of -€135 million reported in PostNL Other, • an impairment of assets held for sale relating to customer contact services of €9 million reported in Mail in the Netherlands, • pension top up payments, reflecting cash payments to the Dutch pension funds, reported as expenses in Mail in the Netherlands for €78 million and in Parcels for €4 million with a corresponding income of €82 million in PostNL Other, and • a pension curtailment gain of €11 million, reported in Mail in the Netherlands for €8 million, in Parcels for €4 million and in PostNL Other for -€1 million. In 2012, total operating income for PostNL Other amounted to €82 million, which mainly related to pension income of €211 million partly offset by the value adjustment of the stake in TNT Express of -€135 million.

In January 2013, the European Commission prohibited the proposed acquisition of TNT Express by UPS, which was followed by the withdrawal of the offer by UPS. Under IAS 10, the withdrawal of the offer by UPS, which resulted in a significant decline in the TNT Express share price, qualifies as a non-adjusting event considering that any uncertainties were reflected in the 31 128 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes December 2012 share price of TNT Express. The closing share price of TNT Express on 22 February 2013 was €5.56. Continuation of this level will have a significant negative impact on the consolidated result and equity of PostNL. Management expects the stake in TNT Express will be monetised in the medium term to create better value for the shareholders, after stability has returned to TNT Express. Accordingly, the stake in TNT Express will no longer meet the criteria under IFRS 5 to be classified as asset held for sale and will therefore, as of the following reporting period, be accounted for as investments in associates using the equity method. Collective labour agreement for Mail Netherlands On 29 January 2013, the trade unions approved the collective labour agreement in principle for Mail Netherlands. The collective labour agreement applies from 1 January 2012 to 31 March 2013. The Social Plan will be extended by one year from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013. The main features of the new agreement are a 1.7% salary increase, and additionally 0.4% after the definitive approval of the new pension arrangement, on which PostNL and the trade unions are jointly in talks with the pension fund. The financial effects of the new collective labour agreement on 2012 have been included in the consolidated financial statements (refer to notes 10 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements). No appeal to verdict of disputes committee on top up payments On 15 February 2013, PostNL announced it will not appeal the verdict of the disputes committee about the necessity of top up payments to supplement the coverage deficit of the pension funds. This was decided upon partly because PostNL aims to come to a sustainable solution for pensions in dialogue with the main pension fund. This is in the interest of all parties involved. PostNL expects to pay the remaining invoiced top up payments of €64 million in Q1 2013. 35 Postal regulation and concession Postal regulation in the Netherlands Since 1 April 2009, the key legislation regulating PostNL’s activities, both mail and parcels, is the Dutch Postal Act 2009. This act requires a designated postal provider to perform the universal postal services in the Netherlands. By separate decree, Koninklijke PostNL BV ( Koninklijke PostNL ) has been designated as provider of the universal postal services. The Dutch Postal Act 2009 sets the requirements for the universal postal services. Based on the Postal Act 2009, the Dutch Postal Regulation 2009 specifies regulation on tariffs of the universal postal services and the transparency of the financial accounting of these services according to the EU Postal Directive. It also contains obligations to provide a report on accessibility and quality of domestic universal postal services and on costs and revenues of the universal postal services. The Dutch Postal Act 2009 also includes obligations for other postal operators, as well as obligations for postal operators in relation to each other. In practice, these latter obligations, such as accessibility of P.O. boxes and postal codes, set requirements for PostNL only. OPTA, the Independent Post and Telecommunications Authority for the Netherlands, established by the government, supervises the postal market and Koninklijke PostNL’s performance of the universal postal services. OPTA is expected to merge with the Consumer Authority (CA) and the Dutch Competition Authority (NMa) to become the Consumer & Market Authority (ACM). The responsibility for postal policy remains under the authority of the Minister of Economic Affairs. The universal postal services Scope The domestic universal postal services consist of the conveyance against payment of standard single rates of: • all items of correspondence with a maximum individual weight of two kilogrammes, • postal parcels with a maximum individual weight of 10 kilogrammes, and • registered, registered insured and registered value declared items. The Dutch Postal Act 2009 does not require Koninklijke PostNL to offer domestic services for the delivery of bulk parcels, bulk mail or unaddressed mail items. On the other hand, international outbound bulk mail and parcels are also part of the universal postal services. For international inbound and outbound mail the rules of the UPU apply to Koninklijke PostNL. Regulatory conditions for the provision of universal postal services With respect to service levels, the Dutch Postal Act 2009 requires Koninklijke PostNL to provide nationwide services and to perform a delivery round every day, delivering on average not less than 95% of all standard single rated domestic letters posted the day before, except on Sundays and public holidays. Koninklijke PostNL is required to maintain a network of service points (letter boxes, postal outlets) for the general public to access the universal postal services. The Postal Regulation 2009 mainly deals with detailed tariff regulation, cost and revenue accounting, financial administration and reporting. Other than the universal postal services, none of PostNL’s postal services are subject to specific government control. In October 2012, parliament voted in favour of amending the Dutch Postal Act 2009 to increase the supervisory tools of OPTA with regards to gathering information and its ability to issue fines for USO service levels. PostNL Annual Report 2012 129 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes Tariff regulation With respect to rates and conditions, OPTA has to set rates for the universal postal services every four years, which shall not lead to a return on sales (RoS) that exceeds the cap of 10%. This cap applies both to parcels and letters separately. Following each OPTA rate setting, Koninklijke PostNL is allowed to set rates. The price cap system limits tariff developments for letters and parcels separately to the development of the general Consumer Price Index. Koninklijke PostNL increased tariffs for both consumer mail and small business mail as of 1 January 2012 and 1 January 2013. The adjustments to the rates have been reviewed by OPTA and are within the tariff development limits. None of the components of tariff regulation implies a correction for the decrease of mail volume. Accounting and other financial obligations Koninklijke PostNL’s obligations on reporting include a system for allocating costs and revenues to the universal postal services, divided into parcels and mail. Based on this system, a financial report on the performance of the universal postal services has to be submitted to OPTA every year, accompanied by an independent auditor’s opinion, designated by OPTA, to certify that its financial accounting system complies with these obligations and is adjusted well. Net costs of the universal service obligations The EU Postal Directive as well as the Dutch Postal Act 2009 both provide net cost regulation. The Dutch approach is based upon the financial deficit of the universal postal services, while the Postal Directive approach is based upon a comparison between the costs of a postal provider with a universal postal service obligation and the costs of that postal provider without a universal postal service obligation. On 28 June 2012, Koninklijke PostNL submitted an application to OPTA for compensation of €107 million net costs for 2011. OPTA intends to apply the Dutch approach, and is currently reviewing the PostNL application. Evaluation of universal postal services obligations and preparing a new long-term policy On 20 November 2012, the Minister of Economic Affairs announced his intention to ask parliament to reduce the six-day delivery to five days in spring 2013. Furthermore, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is evaluating the main issues of the Postal Regulation 2009, i.e. cost allocation and tariff regulation of the universal postal services. Significant Market Power The Minister of Economic Affairs sent parliament a proposal on 12 December 2012 that aimsto stimulate competition and protect consumers in the postal sector. The intention is to introduce additional tools for the supervisory authority, giving it the means to regulate private operators with significant market power. PostNL formally disagrees with the need for further regulation because PostNL considers the present regulation to be sufficient. Value-added tax on postal services At present, Koninklijke PostNL is not allowed to charge value added tax (VAT) on postal items forming part of the universal postal services. Consequently, Koninklijke PostNL cannot deduct the VAT amounts paid on its purchases of services and goods related to the universal postal services. For all other postal services, Koninklijke PostNL is required to charge VAT, similar to its competitors, thus resulting in a level playing field. Competitors and their labour conditions Based on the current Order in Council (AMvB), every postal operator has to work on the basis of 100% employment agreements, unless it has joined a collective labour agreement that leads to at least 80% employment agreements. The current Order in Council will be replaced by a new one, which will also contain the new development path mentioned in the collective labour agreement of new postal operators: 10% per 31 December 2011, 25% per 30 June 2012, 40% per 31 December 2012, 60% per 30 June 2013 and 80% per 30 September 2013. All PostNL’s postal deliverers have employment agreements and therefore PostNL is exempted. 130 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 Corporate statement of financial position At 31 December Before proposed appropriation of profit Notes 2012 2011 ASSETS Non-current assets Investments in Mail 2,442 2,442 Investments in associates 860 Total financial fixed assets 36 2,442 3,302 Pension assets 37 1,454 1,200 Total non-current assets 3,896 4,502 Current assets Accounts receivable from Group companies 1 Other current assets 3 4 Total current assets 4 4 Assets classified as held for sale 38 860 Total assets 4,760 4,506 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Equity Issued share capital 35 31 Additional paid-in capital 147 151 Hedge reserves (13) (12) Revaluation reserve investments in Mail 1,549 1,549 Other reserves 199 (892) Unappropriated profit 389 1,091 Total shareholders’ equity 39 2,306 1,918 Non-current liabilities Deferred tax liabilities 47 362 299 Eurobonds 40 1,575 1,557 Other long-term liabilities 15 8 Total non-current liabilities 1,952 1,864 Current liabilities Accounts payable to Group companies 41 443 576 Other current liabilities 59 148 Total current liabilities 502 724 Total liabilities and equity 4,760 4,506 (in € millions) Corporate statement of income and comprehensive income Year ended at 31 December Notes 2012 2011 Dividend income 42 275 525 Depreciation, amortisation and impairments 43 (1,033) Salaries, pensions and social security contributions 44 250 117 Other operating expenses 45 3 (17) Total operating expenses 253 (933) Operating income 528 (408) Interest and similar income 3 10 Interest and similar expenses (104) (119) Net ﬁnancial expense 46 (101) (109) Proﬁt/(loss) before income taxes 427 (517) Income taxes 47 (38) 2 Proﬁt/(loss) for the year from continuing operations 389 (515) Proﬁt/(loss) from investments in discontinued operations 1,642 Proﬁt for the year attributable to shareholders 389 1,127 Comprehensive income for the year 389 1,127 Gains/(losses) on cashflow hedges, net of tax (1) 9 Other comprehensive income for the year (1) 9 Total comprehensive income for the year 388 1,136 (in € millions) The accompanying notes form an integral part of the financial statements.

(hereafter referred to as ‘the company’) is a public limited liability company with its registered seat and head office at Prinses Beatrixlaan 23, 2595 AK, ’s-Gravenhage, the Netherlands. The company’s principal activity is acting as a holding company for the Group companies of the PostNL Group (‘the Group’) that provide businesses and consumers in the Benelux, the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy with an extensive range of services for their mail needs. The company is the ultimate parent company of the Group. The corporate financial statements have been authorised for issue by PostNL’s Board of Management and Supervisory Board on 25 February 2013 and are subject to adoption at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 16 April 2013. Summary of significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these corporate financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. All amounts included in the financial statements are presented in euros, unless stated otherwise. Basis of preparation The corporate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU). IFRS-EU includes the application of International Accounting Standards (IAS), related Interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and Interpretations of the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC), issued and effective, or issued and adopted early, as at 31 December 2012. Basis of measurement In the corporate financial statements, the same accounting principles have been applied as set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, except for the valuation of the investments as presented under financial fixed assets in the corporate financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented. In 2011, the company did not make use of the optional exemptions and certain mandatory exemptions for first-time IFRS adopters in the conversion from Dutch GAAP to IFRS-EU. As the Group had already adopted IFRS-EU for the consolidated financial statements, the company based its measurements in 2011 on those that the Group used, except for the valuation of the investments in the corporate financial statements. In the corporate financial statements, these investments are recorded at cost less impairments, whereas for the PostNL investments the deemed cost approach under IFRS 1 has been applied. In the corporate statement of income, dividend received from investments is recorded as dividend income. Due to this application, the corporate equity and net result are not equal to the consolidated equity and net result. A reconciliation for total shareholders’ equity and total comprehensive income is presented in note 39 to the corporate financial statements. Changes in accounting policies and disclosures a) New and amended standards adopted by the company: There are no IFRS standards or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2012 that would be expected to have a material impact on the company. b) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2012 and not adopted early by the company: A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2012, and have not been applied in preparing these corporate financial statements. We refer to the descriptions included in the ‘Summary of significant accounting policies’ in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The company has assessed the impact on the corporate financial statements. Except for the impact of the revised IAS 19, none of these is expected to have a significant effect on the corporate financial statements. PostNL Annual Report 2012 133 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate financial statements • In 2011, the IASB issued the revised IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. The revised IAS 19 was endorsed by the European Union on 5 June 2012 and will be effective as from 1 January 2013. The impact of the revised IAS 19 on the 2013 corporate financial position and corporate income statement will be significant. The main change in the revised IAS 19 is the requirement to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately. As at 31 December 2012, the corporate pension asset amounted to €1,454 million (1 January 2012: 1,200). This includes net actuarial losses totalling €1,558 million (1 January 2012: 654). If these net actuarial losses as per 31 December 2012 had been recognised immediately, this would have affected corporate equity of the company negatively by a net amount of around €1,170 million (1 January 2012: around 490). As future actuarial results also have to be recognised immediately and are heavily dependent on interest rate movements, corporate equity will show fluctuations when actual developments differ from expected developments. The impact of IAS 19 revised on the corporate income statement, resulting from the replacement of the expected return on plan assets by the lower discount rate and the cancellation of the amortisation of the unrecognised losses, would have affected the 2012 corporate income statement by an estimated increase in pension expenses of around €80 million (based on the parameters at 1 January 2012). The impact of the revised IAS 19 ’Employee Benefits’ on the corporate financial statements differs from the impact on the consolidated financial statements due to local plans. There are no other IFRS standards or IFRIC interpretations not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the company. Functional and presentation currency The corporate financial statements are presented in euros, the company’s functional currency. All information presented in euros has been rounded to the nearest million. Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of the corporate financial statements in conformity with IFRS-EU requires management to exercise its judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the company’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the corporate financial statements are disclosed in the note ‘Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying PostNL’s accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements’. Key accounting estimates and judgements affecting the assessment and measurement of impairment are included in note 36 to the corporate financial statements. Investments in subsidiaries and associated companies Investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are stated at cost, less impairment. Dividend income from the company’s subsidiaries and associated companies is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. Impairment of investments in subsidiaries and associated companies At each balance sheet date, the company reviews whether there is an indication that its investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are impaired. An indication for impairment of the investments in subsidiaries and associated companies may include, respectively, management’s downward adjustment of the strategic plan or a significant decrease in the share price of the associated company TNT Express N.V. (‘TNT Express’). Further indications for impairments of its investments may include other areas where observable data indicates that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows. These determinations require significant judgement. In making this judgement, management evaluates, among other factors, the financial performance of and business outlook for its investments, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow. 134 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate financial statements If any indication for impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the investments is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. An investment is impaired if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an investment’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The investments’ fair value less costs to sell represents the best estimate of the amount the company would receive if it sold its investments. The fair value of each investment has been estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows, taking into account costs to sell, except for the investment in associates for which the estimated fair value has been based on external market information. The determination of the investment’s value in use is based on calculations using pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a nine-year period. Cash flows beyond the nine-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates. If the recoverable amount of an investment is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to its recoverable amount. Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of income. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods shall be reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates or external market information used to determine the investment’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The recoverable amount shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the corporate financial statements, in the period in which the dividends are approved by the company’s shareholders. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale are no longer amortised or depreciated from the time they are classified as such. Accounting for assets classified as held for sale, representing the stake in TNT Express, requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates. In line with IFRS 5, management assessed the compliance with these statements and the assumptions used in the fair value calculations as well as the estimated costs to sell. Taxation The company is tax resident in the Netherlands. The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the statement of income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The amount of income tax included in the statement of income is determined in accordance with the rules established by the tax authorities in the Netherlands, based on which income taxes are payable or recoverable. Deferred tax assets and/or liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the tax base of assets and liabilities, are calculated using the substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply when they are realised or settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised if it is probable that they will be realised. PostNL Annual Report 2012 135 Performance statements | Chapter 17 Notes to the corporate statement of financial position 36 Total financial fixed assets Total financial fixed assets: 2,442 million (2011: 3,302) The movement in investments is as follows: Statement of changes corporate financial fixed assets Investments in Mail Investments in associates Total Balance at 1 January 2011 3,617 0 3,617 Changes in 2011 Initial value stake in TNT Express 860 860 Acquisitions/additions to capital 12 12 Capital reductions (154) (154) Impairments (1,033) (1,033) Total changes (1,175) 860 (315) Balance at 31 December 2011 2,442 860 3,302 Changes in 2012 Transfer to asset held for sale (860) (860) Total changes 0 (860) (860) Balance at 31 December 2012 2,442 0 2,442 (in € millions) Investments in Mail The subsidiary undertakings of the company as at 31 December 2012, and the company’s percentage interest, are set out below. Breakdown corporate investments Name of direct subsidiairy Country of incorporation Ownership % PostNL Holdco B.V. Netherlands 100% PostNL Holding B.V. Netherlands 100% A complete list of investments in subsidiaries, associated companies and jointly-controlled entities will be attached to the company’s annual report made available to the Chamber of Commerce. Based on the 2012 financial performance, a detailed review has been performed of the recoverability of the Mail investments. The recoverable value of each investment has been estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows. For all investments, the estimated future cash flows are based on a nine-year forecast and business plans, as management considers these forecasts reliable based on past experience. Uncertainties relating to efficiency measures are taken into account. The estimated future cash flows are derived from the most recent strategic planning approved by management. The applied growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rates on the related operation and market. The company has determined the budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations for market development. The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. The discount rates in the investments’ valuations vary from 10% to 13% (pre-tax). Key assumptions used to determine the recoverable values for the investments of the company are the following: • maturity of the underlying market, market share and volume development in order to determine the revenue mix and growth rate, • level of capital expenditure in network-related assets, which may affect the further rollout of the network, • level of operating income largely affected by revenue and cost development, taking into account the nature of the underlying costs and potential economies of scale, and • the discount rate to be applied following the nature of the underlying cash flows and foreign currency and inflationrelated risks. Management has carried out an impairment test for each individual investment. Based on the recoverable value derived from the 2012 strategic planning, taking into account uncertainties relating to efficiency measures, management concluded that there are no indications for impairment of the Mail investments in 2012 (2011: 1,033). As the recoverable value did not 136 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate statement of financial position materially differ from the carrying amount, management also concluded that no reversal of the impairment in 2011 was present and that no reasonable possible change in key assumptions could cause a (reversal of) impairment. In 2011, the impairment charge of €1,033 million followed from reduced business plans compared to early 2010, on average a higher discount rate reflecting the specific risks of the company, and higher estimated pension cash-out. Within equity, the revaluation reserve associated with the initial revaluation of the Mail investments has been reduced by the impairment amount. In 2011, the additions to capital of €12 million represented the company’s compensation for equity-settled share-based payments to the investments’ employees. As the company granted its shares directly to its investments’ employees without charging its investments, the company recognised, in line with IFRS, the increase in the investments as a capital contribution. In 2011, capital reductions of -€154 million represented capital reductions of the investment in Koninklijke PostNL B.V. Investments in associates Following the demerger of the Express activities in 2011, the stake in TNT Express was classified as investments in associates measured at cost of €860 million as at 31 December 2011. On 19 March 2012, United Parcel Service (UPS) and TNT Express announced their agreement on a recommended public offer of €9.50 per ordinary share to be made by UPS for TNT Express. The company signed an irrevocable undertaking with UPS to tender all TNT Express shares held by it under the offer of UPS subject to customary undertakings and conditions. Following the UPS offer, the stake in TNT Express amounting to €860 million was transferred from investments in associates to assets held for sale effectively 30 March 2012 (see note 38 to the corporate financial statements). 37 Pension assets Pension assets: 1,454 million (2011: 1,200) The company is the sponsoring employer of two Dutch pension plans, which are externally funded in two separate pension funds and cover the majority of PostNL’s employees in the Netherlands. The difference of €33 million with the consolidated amount of defined benefit pension assets (€1,487 million) is due to local plans. In accordance with IAS 19.34a, the net defined benefit cost is recognised in the corporate financial statements of the company. The other Group companies recognise the costs, equal to the contributions payable for the period, in their financial statements. For the company, the contributions received from the other Group companies more than offset the pension expense. The impact of the contributions is represented as participant contributions in the following table. As a result, the corporate financial statements record a defined benefit pension income of €254 million (2011: 124), whereas the consolidated financial statements record defined benefit pension expenses of €47 million (2011: 117). As per 1 January 2013, in accordance with the revised IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, the cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains and losses have to be recognised immediately. If the net actuarial losses as per 31 December 2012 had been recognised immediately, this would have affected corporate equity negatively by a net amount of around €1,170 million. As future actuarial results also have to be recognised immediately and are heavily dependent on interest rate movements, corporate equity will show fluctuations when actual developments differ from assumptions. The following table reconciles the opening and closing balances of the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, the funded status and the employer pension income for the sponsored pension plans of the company.

IFRS 5 ‘Assets held for sale’ requires assets to be valued at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and their carrying value. Management assessed the recoverability of the investment. As PostNL’s share in the market value of TNT Express amounted to €1,367 million as at 31 December 2012 (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements), management concluded that no impairment is present in the corporate financial statements. 39 Equity Equity: 2,306 million (2011: 1,918) Equity consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of the company of €2,306 million (2011: 1,918). For the disclosure on issued share capital, additional paid-in capital and the hedge reserve, reference is made to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. The 2012 tax impact on the cash flow hedges is €4 million (2011: 4). The hedge reserve is a legal reserve and is restricted for distribution. As at 31 December 2012, the revaluation reserve of €1,549 million (2011: 1,549) related to the applied deemed cost approach for the investments in Mail as of 1 January 2010, partly offset by the recorded impairment charges of €1,033 138 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate statement of financial position million in 2011 (see note 36 to the corporate financial statements). The revaluation reserve is a legal reserve and is restricted for distribution. As at 31 December 2012, additional paid-in capital of €147 million (2011: 151) is fully exempt for Dutch tax purposes to the extent that this has been paid in by shareholders of the company. As at 31 December 2012, the other reserves increased to €199 million from -€892 million, fully due to the appropriation of net income of €1,091 million over 2011. As at 31 December 2012, the unappropriated profit amounted to €389 million (2011: 1,091). The differences between total shareholders’ equity and total comprehensive income according to the IFRS-EU consolidated financial statements and the corporate financial statements under IFRS-EU as at and for the year ended 31 December 2012 is as follows: Consolidated to corporate equity 2012 2011 Year ended at 31 December Equity Income Equity Income Consolidated Equity and total comprehensive income attributable to the equity holders of the parent 1,069 672 400 1,838 Reconciliation items Revaluations 1,306 (435) 1,741 (841) Results from investments 111 147 (36) 232 Other comprehensive income (CTA/hedges/associates) (187) 4 (191) (93) Other direct equity movements 7 4 Corporate Shareholders’ equity and total comprehensive income attributable to the equity holders of the parent 2,306 388 1,918 1,136 (in € millions) The reconciling items for equity and income are further detailed below. Reconciliation item – Revaluations Reconciling items relating to differences due to revaluations are as follows: Specification revaluations 2012 2011 Year ended at 31 December Equity Income Equity Income Revaluation reserve investment in Mail 2,582 2,582 Impairment investments in Mail (1,033) (1,033) (1,033) Impairment investment in TNT Express 66 (570) 636 636 Difference in demerger gain Express (444) (444) (444) Value adjustments of assets held for sale 135 135 Total 1,306 (435) 1,741 (841) (in € millions) The initial revaluation of the investments in Mail as at 1 January 2010 amounted to €2,582 million and remains applicable. For details of the impairment of the investments in Mail recognised in the 2011 corporate financial statements, reference is made to note 36 to the corporate financial statements. For details of the impact of the revaluations of the investment in TNT Express recognised in the 2011 and 2012 consolidated financial statements, reference is made to notes 3 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The differences in the impairment of the investments in Mail in 2011 and in the demerger gain in 2011 are still applicable as part of the difference in equity of 2012. Reconciliation item Results from investments The 2012 results from investments are €147 million higher in the corporate financial statements as dividend income for 2012 was €274 million (excluding €1 million dividend TNT Express), whereas the result in the consolidated financial statements was €127 million. The €1 million dividend received from TNT Express did not cause a difference because it was reported in both the corporate and the consolidated income statement (under ‘Other income’, refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements). The result from investments of €127 million can be calculated from the result from the consolidated PostNL Annual Report 2012 139 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Notes to the corporate statement of financial position income statement of €677 million, minus the revaluations from TNT Express of €435 million, minus the result from the corporate income statement of €389 excluding the dividend income of €274 million. The 2011 results from investments were €232 million higher in the corporate financial statements as dividend income for 2011 was €525 million, whereas the result in the consolidated financial statement was €293 million. The result from investments of €293 million can be calculated from the result from the consolidated income statement of €1,736 million, plus the impairment of TNT Express of €636 million, minus the difference in demerger gain of €444 million, minus the result from the corporate income statement of €1,127 million excluding the dividend income of €525 million and the impairment of the investments in Mail of €1,033 million. Reconciliation item Other comprehensive income The reconciliation item ‘Other comprehensive income’ represents hedge and currency translation adjustments which were recognised in the consolidated financial statements but not in the corporate financial statements as the investments are stated at cost. Furthermore, it represents other comprehensive income from the investments in associates (stake in TNT Express) over Q1 2012 that was recognised in the consolidated financial statements but not in the corporate financial statements. The 2012 difference in other comprehensive income of €4 million included -€5 million of other comprehensive income related to the stake in TNT Express over Q1 2012 and €1 million of currency translation adjustments related to movements in exchange rate differences on converting foreign subsidiaries. The 2011 difference in other comprehensive income of €93 million included €22 million of other comprehensive income related to the stake in TNT Express, €49 million of currency translation adjustments related to movements in exchange rate differences on converting foreign subsidiaries of Express prior to the demerger, and €22 million of gains on cash flow hedges. Reconciliation item Other direct equity movements In 2012, the additional difference in direct equity movements of €3 million concerned an amount of -€2 million related to the buy-out of minority interests in subsidiaries of TNT Post UK and -€1 million related to various other items. The 2011 difference in other direct equity movements mainly concerned post-demerger direct equity movements in the investments in associates (stake in TNT Express). 40 Eurobonds Eurobonds: 1,575 million (2011: 1,557) For the disclosure on the eurobonds, reference is made to notes 12 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements. 41 Accounts payable to Group companies Accounts payable to Group companies: 443 million (2011: 576) Accounts payable to Group companies include the following balances: Corporate accounts payable to Group companies At 31 december 2012 2011 PostNL Finance B.V. 443 575 PostNL Holding B.V. 1 Total 443 576 (in € millions) The fair value of the accounts payable to Group companies approximated the carrying value, due to the short-term nature.

In 2012, the effective income tax rate was 8.9% (2011: 0.4%). The statutory income tax rate in the Netherlands is 25.0% (2011: 25.0%). In 2012, the effective income tax rate was positively impacted by tax-exempt dividend income from the company’s investments in subsidiaries of -16.1% (2011: 25.4%). Income tax expense consists of the following: Corporate income taxes Year ended at 31 December 2012 2011 Current tax expense (25) (32) Changes in deferred taxes 63 30 Total income taxes 38 (2) (in € millions) In 2012, the current tax expense amounts to -€25 million (2011: -32). The difference between the total income taxes in the income statement and the current tax expense is due to timing differences. These differences are recognised as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. At 31 December 2012, the income tax payable amounted to €11 million (2011: 62). The company paid income taxes for an amount of €26 million (2011: 15); see note 48 to the corporate financial statements.

The change mainly related to the change in cash used in operations. Cash used in operations The cash generated from operations improved from -€31 million in 2011 to -€4 million in 2012, due to cash-out for demerger costs in 2011 (€18 million), lower Board of Management remuneration (€4 million) and a higher change in working capital (€4 million).

Fiscal unity in the Netherlands The company forms a fiscal unity with a majority of its Dutch subsidiaries for corporate income tax and VAT purposes. A company and its subsidiaries that are part of these fiscal unities are jointly and severally liable for the tax payable by these fiscal unities. Pension commitments The company is the sponsoring employer for two Dutch pension plans: the main plan, described in detail in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, and the pension plan covering the staff members in the Netherlands who have a personal labour agreement before 2007 and which is externally funded in ‘Stichting Ondernemingspensioenfonds TNT’. Currently, both pension funds also cover the defined benefit pension plans of the majority of the Dutch employees of the demerged TNT Express. Guarantees The company provided parental support in the form of specific guarantees to various subsidiaries, in addition to the declaration of joint and several liability in compliance with article 403, book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code: €570 million relating to committed revolving credit facilities, €40 million for guarantee facilities to facilitate the issuance of guarantees by various subsidiaries of the Group, €64 million to facilitate the operation of cash pools of PostNL in the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Germany, as well as various guarantees included in International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements with banks for the trading of financial derivatives.

In some cases, there are contractual arrangements in place under which the company sources supplies from such undertakings or such undertakings source supplies from the company. Transactions are in principle carried out at arm’s length. 144 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Additional notes Related corporate party transactions PostNL 2012 2011 Year ended at 31 December Transactions Balances Transactions Balances Dividend income PostNL Group companies 274 519 Dividend income TNT Express stake 1 6 Accounts receivable from PostNL Group companies/interest income 1 5 Accounts receivable from Express Group companies/interest income 1 Accounts payable to PostNL Group companies/interest expense (2) 414 (12) 538 Accounts payable to Express Group companies/interest expense (5) Hedge accounts payable to PostNL Group companies/hedge income/(costs) 3 29 (2) 38 Net financing activities from Group companies (125) (458) Capital reduction Koninklijke PostNL B.V. 154 Income tax received from/(paid to) PostNL Group companies (1) 66 Income tax received from/(paid to) Express Group companies 9 (in € millions) For the compensation of the members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board, reference is made to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Separation agreement TNT Express For details on the separation agreement with TNT Express, reference is made to note 32 to the consolidated financial statements. 55 Subsequent events (No corresponding financial statement number) In the corporate financial statements, the stake in TNT Express accounted for at cost and classified as held for sale under IFRS 5 is valued at around €5.30 per share at 31 December 2012. In January 2013, the European Commission prohibited the proposed acquisition of TNT Express by UPS, which was followed by the withdrawal of the offer by UPS. Under IAS 10, the withdrawal of the offer by UPS, which resulted in a significant decline in the TNT Express share price, qualifies as a nonadjusting event considering that any uncertainties were reflected in the 31 December 2012 share price of TNT Express. The closing share price of TNT Express on 22 February 2013 was €5.56. Continuation of this level will have no significant impact on the corporate result and equity of the company. Management expects that the stake in TNT Express will be monetised in the medium term to create better value for shareholders, after stability has returned to TNT Express. Accordingly, the stake in TNT Express will no longer meet the criteria under IFRS 5 to be classified as asset held for sale and will therefore, as of the following reporting period, be accounted for as investments in associates at cost. For further disclosure on the company’s subsequent events, reference is made to note 34 to the consolidated financial statements.

Report on the financial statemenst We have audited the accompanying financial statements 2012 of PostNL N.V., The Hague as set out on pages 70 to 146. The financial statements comprise the consolidated and corporate statements of financial position as at 31 December 2012, the consolidated and corporate income statements, the statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended and the notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Board of Management’s responsibility The Board of Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and for the preparation of the Report of the Board of Management as set out on pages 6 to 37 and 41 to 53 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor’s responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Board of Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements as set out on pages 70 to 146 give a true and fair view of the financial position of PostNL N.V. as at 31 December 2012, and of its result and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Pursuant to the legal requirement under Section 2: 393 sub 5 at e and f of the Dutch Civil Code, we have no deficiencies to report as a result of our examination whether the Report of the Board of Management as set out on pages 6 to 37 and 41 to 53 , to the extent we can assess, has been prepared in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of this Code, and whether the information as required under Section 2: 392 sub 1 at b-h has been annexed. Further we report that the Report of the Board of Management as set out on pages 6 to 37 and 41 to 53, to the extent we can assess, is consistent with the financial statements as required by Section 2: 391 sub 4 of the Dutch Civil Code Amsterdam, 25 February 2013 PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. Original has been signed by drs. H.C. Wüst RA PostNL Annual Report 2012 147 Performance statements | Chapter 17 | Other information Extract from the articles of association on appropriation of profit Under PostNL’s current articles of association, the dividend speciﬁed in article 31, paragraph 1 will first be paid on the preference shares B if outstanding. Subject to the approval of PostNL’s Supervisory Board, the Board of Management will determine thereafter which part of the proﬁt remaining after payment of dividend on any preference shares B will be appropriated to the reserves (article 31, paragraph 2). The remaining proﬁt after the appropriation to reserves shall be at the disposal of the General Meeting of Shareholders (article 31, paragraph 3). No dividend shall be paid on shares held by PostNL in its own capital (article 31, paragraph 6). Preference shares B were not issued in 2012. Dividend proposal 2012 The Board of Management of PostNL has decided, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to propose to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders the distribution of a 2012 dividend of €0.181 per ordinary share, which has been fully paid in shares as an interim dividend. We will not pass through the €0.03 dividend per ordinary share of TNT Express over 2012 (subject to approval of the Annual General Meeting of TNT Express), as PostNL expects negative distributable corporate equity in April 2013, which restricts the company from paying any dividend. Accordingly, the final dividend will be nil. The interim dividend in shares was paid out of additional paid-in capital as part of the distributable reserves, free of withholding tax in the Netherlands. Appropriation of profit The Board of Management, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, has appropriated an amount of €389 million out of profit to the reserves. Following this appropriation, an amount of €0 million of the profit remains that is at the disposal of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. Subject to the adoption of PostNL’s financial statements by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, the proposed 2012 dividend has been set at €0.181 per ordinary share of €0.08 nominal value. After adjusting for the 2012 interim dividend of €0.181 per ordinary share as fully paid out in shares in August 2012, the final dividend will be €0.00 per ordinary share. The dividend in shares was paid out of additional paid in capital as part of the distributable reserves, free of withholding tax in the Netherlands. Upon approval of this proposal, profit will be appropriated as follows. Appropriation of profit 2012 Profit attributable to the shareholders 389 Appropriation in accordance with the articles of association: Reserves adopted by the Board of Management and approved by the Supervisory Board (article 35, par.2) (389) Dividend on ordinary shares 0 Interim dividend paid in cash 0 Final dividend 0 (in € millions) Group companies of PostNL N.V.

An important part of the subcontractor model is the estimation of fuel costs as a percentage of total costs for delivery by subcontractors. Because the subcontractor model does not measure actual carbon emissions associated with subcontractor activities, there are inherent limitations to the accuracy of the reported figure. The most important ones are listed below: PostNL Annual Report 2012 159 Performance statements | Chapter 18 | Corporate responsibility statements Reasonable assurance report • performing analytical procedures, relation checks and detailed checks; To the Board of Management of PostNL N.V • validating and testing of the model used for estimating the CO2-emissions of subcontractors; Report on the Corporate Responsibility chapters • assessing the application level according to the G3.1 Guidelines of GRI; Engagement and responsibilities • evaluating the overall presentation of the CR chapters, in line In the Annual Report PostNL N.V., the Hague, (hereafter: PostNL) with PostNL’s reporting criteria; reports on its policies, activities, events and performance relating • evaluating the consistency of CR related information in the to Corporate Responsibility (‘CR’) in the reporting period 2012.

Amsterdam, 25 February 2013 Reporting criteria PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. PostNL developed its reporting criteria on the basis of the G3.1 Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). These reporting criteria contain certain inherent limitations which may Original has been signed by drs. H.C. Wüst RA influence the reliability of the information. These inherent limitations stem amongst others from applied definitions and estimations made for indicators where primary data is not available. Detailed information on the reporting criteria and the reporting scope is given in the paragraph ‘Reporting scope, criteria and limitations’ in chapter 18. We consider the reporting criteria to be relevant and appropriate for our examination. For several indicators the CR chapters are not yet based on full coverage as intended by PostNL per its reporting criteria. By including a data clarification table in annex 2, the coverage of the CR chapters is clarified, showing for each indicator the number of FTE’s working in entities that report on that indicator as a percentage of total FTE’s. We believe that this limitation with regard to the completeness of the CR chapters and the reasons for it, are acceptable. Assurance procedures performed We planned and performed our assurance procedures in accordance with Dutch law, including Standard 3410N ‘Assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports’. Our most important assurance procedures were: • performing an analysis of PostNL’s operating context and obtaining insight into the industry, relevant social issues, relevant laws and regulations and the characteristics of the organisation; • assessing the acceptability and consistent application of the reporting policies, including the methods used by management for calculating and estimating results; • assessing and testing the systems and processes used for data gathering, internal controls and the aggregation process of data to the information in the CR chapters; • reconciling reported data to internal and external source documentation ; 160 PostNL Annual Report 2012 Annexes Annex 1: Global Compact and GRI G3.1 index Global Compact As a signatory of the UN Global Compact, PostNL reports on the 10 principles therein.
