We are proud to say that we continue to deploy this and that all our full time staff are well aware of the codes and policies. To continue to ensure that there is no discrimination in the workplace, we have monitored the distribution of our employees and the results are as follows:Communication on Progress 2012 Age Distribution of Employees 2012 7% 4% 21-30 39% 31-40 18% 41-50 51-60 32% >60 From the above chart, it shows that the majority of ORIGIN’s employees fall in the range of 21-30 and 31-40 age group. Due to the strenuous nature of the job, it is critical that the field staff maintains good physical abilities. We now have one employee who has taken up the offer of flexible working arrangements. We still however, are involved with many internships from local polytechnics and universities. Age Distribution of Employees 2011 2% 6% 21-30 14% 31-40 46% 41-50 51-60 32% >60 Compared to previous year, we have increased the number of workers in the 41-50 age group by 4%.

We will continue to provide fair and equal employment for all races. The data below shows the gender distribution for our Executives. Due to the nature of the work, we are not looking at the gender distribution of the field staff as they are all males. The job in itself deals with pests and requires physical strength and stamina, hiring female field staff has always been a challenge. This has been consistent with the Pest Control Industry in Singapore.

This shows that there is no discrimination amongst genders. This figure is computed for executive staff non inclusive of management level staff.
