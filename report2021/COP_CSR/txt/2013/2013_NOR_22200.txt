Change in fair value (fair value risk) is shown in the five first columns, sorted in accordance with maturity of the securities, and is calculated on the change in fair value of interest-bearing instruments if the interest rate had been 1 per cent higher at the end of the period. The column «Change in cash flows» shows the change in cash flows had the interest rate been 1 per cent higher throughout the year being reported on. The total of these reflects the total impact on profits that the scenario of one per cent higher interest rate would have had on the Group during the period being reported on. Fair value risk applies to fixed interest rate securities where the market value of the security fluctuates conversely to the market interest rate. Variable interest rate risk applies to securities at variable interest rates, where the market value remains stable, but where change in the market interest rate is reflected in changed current incomes. Fixed interest securities with the following characteristics and classifications, are covered by this Note; securities at fair value through profit or loss (variable and fixed interest rate terms), investments held to maturity (only those with variable interest rate terms) and loans and receivables (only those with variable interest rate terms). The Group has no fixed interest securities classified as available for sale. Seen overall, the interest rate risk is limited for the Group since a high proportion is invested in long-term bonds (securities classified as held to maturity or loans and receivables) and lending with fixed interest rate at amortized cost. For securities with the characteristics described, change in the market interest rate is not therefore reflected in the income statement. ¹ Equity fund holdings cover that part of the fund that is not shares, but that comprises assets covered by interest rate risk; surplus liquidity in the form of bank accounts and derivatives used for hedging purposes. ² Contingent liabilities in this context is accepted, not paid out lending. 84 A n n u al r e p o r t 2 0 1 2 not es to t h e Accou n ts Grou p 85 Note 12 Currency risk, continued Note 13 Credit risk 31.12.2012 31.12.2011 Financial position NOK millions AAA AA A BBB NR/NIG Total statement items excl.

Sector is based on the sector codes from Statistics Norway. and is used in regard to Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain. The Group has a lending portfolio of high quality, with limited credit risk and historically very low losses. In the main the Group provides loans secured on housing with a mortgage level of less than 80 per cent, loans to local authorities and loans with government (central/local) guarantees. Lending secured Premium receivables and receivables in connection with reinsurance through mortgages on housing amounts to about NOK 10.6 billion.The sector diversification of Group lending is very small, since a very high proportion of the loans are provided for the public sector. However the concentration risk this suggests can hardly be perceived as a real risk since the loans are covered by NOK millions 2012 2011 government (central/local) guarantee, representing an extremely low counterparty risk.

In addition the main group pension/public sector industry is linked to the «Transfer agreement for the public sector». This transfer agreement has a security scheme intended to help to secure pension Total principal after write-downs 0,35 0,20 rights accrued with employers who cease to exist or do not pay premiums when due in accordance with detailed rules.

Write-down on individual loans 01.01 0,83 0,69 The Group reduces its credit risk on reinsurance by using a number of different reinsurers.

Defaulted loans are loans measured at amortized cost. In addition to the write-downs above, one loan, provided to OSEA AS (Omega SmartBuild East Africa AS), has been written off. The total sum for write-down was NOK 3,894 million, of which NOK 3,596 million represents principal, NOK 0.285 million represents interest and NOK 0.013 millioner represents other charges. The actual loss on the business was lower since the loan, which was in USD, was carried at a higher value in NOK than was the actual exchange-rate on the purchase of USD for the business. In addition, on termination of the business, a foreign exchange forward on the entire original OSEA AS loan limit was terminated, and the KLP Group made a gain. The total loss, if this is taken into account, amounts to about NOK 2.8 million. 1 This category covers local authority business operations, as well as enterprises owned by central and local government 2 This category primarily covers private enterprises with limited liability and not-for-profit organisations. 90 A n n u al r e p o r t 2 0 1 2 not es to t h e Accou n ts Grou p 91 Note 15 Investment properties Note 17 Subordinated loan capital and hybrid Tier 1 securities NOK millions 2012 2011 2012 Loan amount Loan amount Book value Net rental income 1 873 1 365 NOK millions currency NOK 31.12.2012 Due date Unrealised gains/losses swaps 271 51 Borrowings ¹ Net financial income/costs 21 16 October 1997 JPY 9 500 554 615 Perpetual Net realized gains/losses 5 49 April 2006 EUR 300 2 372 2 276 Perpetual Total subordinated loan capital 2 926 2 891 Change in fair value including revaluation 36 398 Total net income from investment properties 2 206 1 879 April 2004 JPY 15 000 984 974 Perpetual Total hybrid Tier 1 securities 984 974 NOK millions 2012 2011 Book value 01.01. 28 726 26 105 Total subordin. loan capital and hybrid Tier 1 sec's 3 911 3 865 Additions through purchase 3 945 2 816 Additions as a result of reclassification -2 -73 2011 Loan amount Loan amount Book value Additions through capitalizations 293 211 NOK millions currency NOK 31.12.2011 Due date Change installations under construction moved to investment property -677 -731 Borrowings ¹ Net write-up/down resulting from change in fair value 36 398 October 1997 JPY 9 500 554 742 Perpetual Book value 31.12. 32 322 28 726 April 2006 EUR 300 2 372 2 401 Perpetual Total subordinated loan capital 2 926 3 143 April 2004 JPY 15 000 984 1 145 Perpetual Note 16 Shares in associated companies Total hybrid Tier 1 securities 984 1 145 Ownership Acquisition Book value Additions/ Profit/loss Book value NOK millions Office and business address interest cost 31.12.11 disposals share1 31.12.12 Total subordin. loan capital and hybrid Tier 1 sec’s 3 911 4 288 Norsk Pensjon AS1 Hansteens gate 2 25 % 5,0 2,97 0,0 0,4 3,40 0253 Oslo JPY 9 500: The interest on the loan is fixed at 4.0 per cent p.a.

The following fixed interest securities are covered by this Note; securities at fair value through profit or loss (variable and fixed interest rate terms), 2011 investments held to maturity (only those with variable interest rate terms) and loans and receivables (only those with variable interest rate terms). The NOK millions Group has no fixed interest securities classified as available for sale.

Financial hedging of currency exposure is done through derivatives. In principle all of the Group’s fixed interest investments and property investments in foreign currency are hedged back to NOK with the objective of 100 per cent hedging. For equity investments in foreign currency the objective is a 90 per cent hedging ratio with permitted fluctuations between 80 and 100 per cent. If all currency positions change by 1 per cent at the same time and in the same direction this would affect the result by NOK 29 million. For 2011 the corresponding effect on income was NOK 47.5 million. ¹ The table shows total financial position statement items for each individual currency, divided between short and long-term positions. The net position shows the actual currency risk KLP had at the end of the period in NOK. Other sums are in local currency.

Loans defaulted on are loans at amortized cost. All write-downs relate to housing mortgages. In addition to the above write-downs there is a loan granted to OSEA AS (Omega SmartBuild East Africa AS), written down in its entirety. The amount written down is NOK 3.894 million in total, of which 3.596 is the principal, 0.285 million is interest and 0.013 million is other charges. The actual loss on the transaction is lower since the loan, which was in USD, had a higher value in NOK than the actual rate of exchange of the USD purchased for the transaction. Moreover, at the end of the transaction a foreign exchange future was concluded for the entire original credit facility for OSEA AS, from which KLP received a gain. The total loss amounts to around 2.8 million. ¹ In addition to state and local government-owned enterprises,this category also comprises local government business operation. ² This category mainly comprises private enterprises with limited liability and organisations with no profit targets. 162 A nn u al r e port 2 0 1 2 not e s to th e acco u nts 163 NOK millions Number Market value NOK

The hedging is recognized in accordance with the rules on fair value hedging, which inter alia mean that the hedging is carried out by an external party, that a formal earmarking and documentation of the hedging arrangement is entered into, as well is that it is expected to be very effective The write-down is included as part of insurance-related administration costs in the statement of income. and that this is continuously reviewed, as well as that the recognition is carried out as described below. In practice the hedging involves a swap of currency terms (JPY billion 15 against NOK billion 0.984) and interest terms (fixed interest at 5.07% against NIBOR +2.6475%) on the borrowing and the combined interest and currency swap respectively. The hedging effectiveness is measured by looking at the change in fair value of the hedged object and the hedging instrument. The hedging effectiveness equals 100%. The hedging effect is valued retrospectively each month and is then considered effective if the change in fair value between hedged object and hedging instrument lies within the bracket 80% to 125%. Fair value hedging means that the hedged value development of the hedged object is recognized through profit or loss. Correspondingly the value change on the hedged instrument is taken through profit or loss . The aim of the hedging arrangement above is to hedge the hedged object with a hedging instrument in which the hedging instrument’s terms give negative correlation in relation to the hedged object: this significantly reduces or eliminates the effect on income. If the hedging ratio is 100% the net effect on income of the hedged object and the hedging instrument will be 0. KLP uses hedging widely but the majority of instances are ordinary financial hedging. The above item is the only one in which hedge accounting is used. The aim of financial hedging is the same, i.e. to reduce or eliminate the effect on income the hedged part of the hedging arrangement represents. Since the value change on the hedged object and the hedging instrument are approximately 100% negatively correlated, the profit/loss effect will be approximately nil. See also Note 2 for a detailed description of the hedge accounting in the accounts. 180 A nn u al r e port 2 0 1 2 not e s to th e acco u nts 181 Note 20 Subordinated loan capital and hybrid Tier 1 securities Note 21 Capital control and capital adequacy 2012 NOK millions 31.12.2012 31.12.2011 NOK millions Loan amount Loan amount Book value Owners' equity contributed 6 891 6 217 currency NOK 31.12.2012 Due date Retained earnings 6 499 5 723 Borrowings ¹ Total owners' equity 13 390 11 941 October 1997 JPY 9 500 554 615 Perpetual April 2006 EUR 300 2 372 2 276 Perpetual Hybrid Tier 1 securities 965 984 Total subordinated loan capital 2 926 2 891 Intangible assets -303 -293 Risk equalization fund -490 -431 April 2004 JPY 15 000 984 974 Perpetual Unrealized price changes in the corporate portfolio -61 -133 Total hybrid Tier 1 securities 984 974 Deductions for investments in other financial institutions -3 -3 Total subordinated loan capital and hybrid Tier 1 securities 3 911 3 865 Other owners' equity -217 -217 Surplus fund -3 -19 Core capital 13 277 11 828 2011 NOK millions Loan amount Loan amount Book value Due date Perpetual subordinated loan capital 2 813 3 032 currency NOK 31.12.2011 Deduction Tier 1 and 2 capital in other financial institutions -3 -3 Borrowings ¹ Supplementary capital 2 809 3 028 October 1997 JPY 9 500 554 742 Perpetual April 2006 EUR 300 2 372 2 401 Perpetual Net Tier 1 and 2 capital 16 087 14 857 Total subordinated loan capital 2 926 3 143 Assets and off-financial position statement items by risk weighting 1 Non-weighted sums Weighted sums Non-weighted sums Weighted sums April 2004 JPY 15 000 984 1 145 Perpetual Fixed interest securities 48 626 0% 0 49 884 0% 0 Total hybrid Tier 1 securities 984 1 145 Covered bonds 19 759 10 % 1 976 21 079 10 % 2 108 Total subordinated loan capital and hybrid Tier 1 securities 3 911 4 288 Fixed income securities, lending, bank deposits and fixed income funds 76 562 20 % 15 312 64 271 20 % 12 854 Housing mortgage lending 8 805 35 % 3 082 6 338 35 % 2 218 JPY 9 500 : The interest on the loan is fixed at 4.0% p.a.

In addition the allocations to the risk equalization fund proposed are in accordance with the Norwegian Act on Insurance Activity. In the Joint Pension Scheme for Municipalities and Enterprises (Fellesordningen for kommuner og bedrifter), the Joint Pension Scheme for County Administrations (Fellesordningen for fylkeskommuner), the Joint Pension Scheme for State Health Enterprises (Fellesordningen for statlige helseforetak) and the Pension Scheme for Democratically Elected Representatives (Pensjonsordningen for folkevalgte). KLP has so far used the technical calculation base K2005 with safety margins in accordance with the minimum requirements of the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway (FSA Norway). This calculation base is no longer adequate in light of the observed and expected development in longevity and from 1 January 2014 will be replaced by K2013, a new and stronger base set out by the FSA based on a report by Finance Norway. Escalation of the premium reserves to the new calculation base's level has begun within the limits accepted by the FSA. For disability the applicable calculation base has been in use since 2010. The trend in disability in the local government sector has over the years been generally positive so the margins in the disability PHOTO øyvind garsjø PHOTO kristian kaarød assumptions have been increasing.
