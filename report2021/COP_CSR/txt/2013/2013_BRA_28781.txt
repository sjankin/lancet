The objective of this unique project, developed in partnership with the Government of the state of Rio de Janeiro (GERJ) and local governments is to build a Logistics Complex to provide comprehensive integrated logistics solutions. ConLog will make it possible for this region to enjoy permanent and sustainable economic growth, even after oil exploitation ends in the Campos and Santos Basins. Due to major sports events to be held in 2014 and 2016, Cabo Frio could also become the entry for international flights. Another possibility to be explored when the new passenger terminal is concluded is business-related tourism in the state’s Região dos Lagos lake district and other municipalities. 32 Information Technology Grupo Libra developed an Information Technology Master Plan to guide actions and activities in this field. The Master Plan is aligned with the company’s business strategies. The plan establishes the concept of selecting and implementing market solutions for infrastructure, operating systems and support for the Group’s companies. In addition, it establishes solutions that comply with the laws that are inherent to the company’s line of business and meet commercial relationship needs developed in the company. The objective of projects related to systems implementation is to work with the market’s best process practices to simplify operating and administrative processes. The IT infrastructure project includes an outsourced data center to simplify processes and reduce energy consumption. As its business strategy, IT works together with the Group’s business units to increase the operations’ automation levels and the integration/ interfaces with customer. Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2012 33 Commitment to Sustainability: GRI 4.8 In 2012, the Group undertook four commitments to guide actions and investments in sustainability: • Reduce greenhouse gas emissions (especially diesel oil consumption) • Reduce, treat and dispose waste adequately • Train young people for their first job (surrounding communities) • Improve occupational safety and provide capacity building in sustainability for employees 6.2. Environmental Impacts 6.2.1.Emissions GRI EN16 / EN17 / EN18 The 2012 inventory, prepared according to the GHG Protocol, has shown that the diesel oil used by highway and river fleets, which fuels cargo handling and energy generation equipment, is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions of the group. The scope of the inventory is focused on Libra Terminais, Libra Logística, CNA, Libra Holding, CAL units and, for the first time, Libra Aeroportos. Direct emissions (phase 1), which account for 60% of the Group’s total emissions, Reduction went down by 6% from 2011 to 2012, coming to an accumulated reduction of 9.8% since 2010. This result was achieved through the acquisition of new equipment for the of 6% in the terminals, such as RTGs, which reduce the number of unproductive handlings and the Groups’ direct volume of diesel oil consumption. The other factor that led to this achievement was emissions CNA’s new policy related to expedited cargo, as this policy contemplates a minimum number of barges transported by push tugs, thereby reducing diesel oil consumption. Indirect electric power emissions (phase 2) increased by approximately 160%. This increase is justified by the emission factor variation of the “Sistema Interligado Nacional/SIN” (the National Electric Power Grid), as more fossil-fueled thermoelectric power plants were used to generate electric power. Indirect emissions by third party sources (phase 3) increased by 37%, on account of the acquisition and inclusion of Libra Aeroportos (aviation fuel used by airplanes). As a result, Grupo Libra’s total emissions went up by 7% in comparison to 2011, yet were still lower than in 2010, as illustrated in Table 1 below. 34 Emissions per scope (tCO2e) – Total Grupo Libra Table 1 +7% 2010 2011 2012 61,343 60,821 56,874 -6% 44,519 42,529 40,159 +37% 18,557 15,162 +160% 13,536 1,662 2,105 809 Direct Emissions Indirect Emissions Indirect Emissions Total (phase 1) Electric Power (phase 2) Others (phase 3) Explanatory Note: Emissions from cargo transportation outsourced by Libra Logística Intermodal are reported as being direct emissions as these emissions are inherent to the business. The Group consumed 3% less diesel oil in 2012, in comparison to the year before, although total handling Operations’ higher went up by 6% in the same period. Emissions per handling dropped by 12% (direct phase 1), attesting to the operations’ higher efficiency (see Table 2 below). efficiency Reduction of 12% Libra Logística Campinas has reported, for the first time, the existence of R22 refrigeration gas, which led to an in direct emissions per increase in direct emissions at that unit. movement of cargo Direct emissions (scope 1) per operating unit – Indicator per handling Table 2 Unit Operation 2010 2011 2012 % Libra Libra Terminais Santos Indicator (kgCO2e/conteiner) 18.4 19.4 19.2 -1% Terminais Libra Terminais Rio Indicator (kgCO2e/conteiner) 31.7 25.5 21.1 -17% Libra Logística Campinas Indicator (kgCO2e/m ) 3 1.1 0.1 0.9 596% Libra Libra Logística Cubatão Indicator (kgCO2e/m ) 3 0.9 1.3 0.3 -77% Logística Libra Logística Valongo Indicator (kgCO2e/m3) 0.2 0.3 0.4 38% Libra Logística Intermodal Indicator (kgCO2e/m ) 3 1.1 2.5 2.2 -11% Libra CNA Indicator (kgCO2e/m3) 19.2 18.2 16.6 -9% Participações Libra Cabo Frio Indicator (kgCO2e/t) 11 Aeroportos Total Grupo Libra Indicator (kgCO2e/m3) 1.2 1.1 0.9 -12% Explanatory notes: The number of movements takes into account the movement of incoming and outgoing containers, which was higher than the revenues obtained.

Based on an innovative technology in South America, each Eco-RTG uses the weight of containers to generate and store energy for the next handlings. An ordinary RTG consumes an average of 14 liters of diesel oil per hour. An EcoRTG, on the other hand, consumes 9 liters per hour. The Eco-RTGs have not achieved significant results yet, as their drag reduction systems were only activated at the end of 2012. In addition, the energy saving measure for the Reduce RTG cranes system (RISGA) was installed in 11 RTGs, which reduced fossil fuel consumption by up to 15% when the machines were down. GEE by 50% Despite these investments, equipment operation on smaller time periods and the increase in productivity led to an increase in diesel oil consumption in big port by the Santos unit. However, measures to deal with this issue are being equipment implemented at the Santos and Rio de Janeiro units, such as progressive by 2017 electrification of port equipment and the purchase of new electric RTGs. The expectation is that, by 2017, these measures will have reduced greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) by 50% from big port equipment. 36 6.2.2. Waste GRI EN22 / EN26 The construction to expand and improve the Santos and Rio de Janeiro terminals accounted for most of the non-hazardous waste generated in 2012. This waste, when not recycled at the units and used as foundation for yards, is transported to civil construction recycling treatment stations. The use of waste for recycling, reuse and composting increased at Libra Terminais Rio, and the volume of waste sent to landfills was reduced. Non-hazardous waste at Libra Logística Cubatão increased, especially in recycling, due to improvements in how waste is sorted and where it is discarded. Paper and metal were included in this scope – previously, only plastics and wood were properly discarded.

Recycling of Uniforms, Art and Sustainability The Recycling of Uniforms was a major project developed in 2012 related to waste disposal, which included the community in the vicinity of Libra Terminais Santos. The uniforms were recycled and used to produce handicrafts. Presently, the uniforms discarded by the workers and by the administrative staff are donated as raw material and recycled to create handicrafts, generating work and income for the surrounding community.

Proper disposal of such fuel entails fuel reprocessing for reuse. This was reported separately as it is not part of CNA’s processes. Machine and equipment maintenance and handling of emergencies (spills) are the main source of hazardous wastes. At Libra Terminais Santos, the 31% increase in the volume of hazardous wastes was the direct consequence of the increase in the volume of spills, which went up by 35% in comparison to the year before. Recycling system for oil filters Grupo Libra was the first company in the port sector to install a partial recycling system for oil filters. Oil is used in the equipment. As a result, the generation of hazardous, environmentally damaging wastes was reduced and the generation of recyclable wastes was increased. Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2012 39 6.2.3. Spills GRI EN23 The operating units conduct periodical maintenance on the equipment. Awareness-raising of employees and outsourced parties is also being focused on, with the objective of avoiding spills of contaminating products. In case of an incident, strict containment measures are put in place to minimize the damages. In this respect, the spill of lubricating oils is the largest risk of our activities. Several spill incidents occurred in 2012, but all of them were treated or contained, and did not generate any significant impact. The number of spill-related incidents in 2012 dropped by 20% and the spilled volume dropped by 25%, in comparison to the year before. Libra Terminais Rio was outstanding in this respect, as it reduced the spill volume by 50% and the number of spill incidents by 57%, due to improvements in the technology complex, which reduced leaks and corrective interventions by maintenance.

Integration of the units under Libra Infraestrutura has also contributed to the consolidation of extensive investment plans involving all of the Group’s operations: expansion of the Santos (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) terminals, construction work to modernize the logistics warehouses Investment plans: and improvements and expansion of the airport in Cabo Frio. This confirms the commitment to R$ 2 billion continue investing in the country’s infrastructure, in the next 4 years as attested to by the Group’s plan to invest R$ 2 billion in the next four years. 48 Libra Terminais Expansion of the two terminals will entail investments of approximately R$ 1.2 billion and will double the terminals’ operating capacity, in addition to exponentially increasing productivity. Libra Terminais Santos Libra Terminais Santos Expansion Project (PLTS) is in an advanced stage of technical detailing and discussion as it is a part of a larger restructuring project of the Ponta da Praia de Santos. The project has the support of CODESP (Port of Santos Authority) and the participation of the municipal government, business companies and other sectors of society. It aims to increase the capacity, productivity and cost efficiency of the terminals in the region, while reducing socioenvironmental impacts and harmonizing the Group’s operations with urban centers. Grupo Libra plans to invest approximately R$ 750 million in the near future in this expansion project. We are optimistic about the outcome of discussions on one of Libra’s three leasing agreements in the port of Santos (Terminal 35). Key points are about physical divergences between the terms and conditions of the bidding process and the asset given as collateral for the operation. The Libra-CODESP joint proposal for the solution of pending items is currently under review at the Office of the Attorney General (AGU) and the General Accounting Office (TCU). In Santos (SP), T33 was demolished in 2012 to create a 15 thousand m2 container Double the storage yard. The progress of the first phase of Libra Terminais Santos’ Expansion Project has resulted in the gradual removal of old equipment.

Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2012 75 About the Report GRI 3.1 / 3.2 / 3.5 / 3.6 / 3.7 / 3.9 / 3.13 / 4.14 / 4.15 / 4.16 For the second consecutive year, Grupo Libra is publishing its Annual Sustainability Report based on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, presenting the social, economic and environmental performance of the organization to its stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, government and society in general). This year, the company chose to present this report integrated into Grupo Libra’s management report, increasing its consistency thanks to the inclusion of financial performance information. This report also addresses the Group’s processes, progress and challenges in 2012 and the information comprises the main units of Libra Terminais, Libra Logística and Libra Aeroportos, with CNA being addressed in the environmental area. Content was defined based on the four sustainability commitments assumed by the Group in 2012 and some issues that were included in the Materiality Matrix created in 2011. 76 Materiality GRI 3.4 / 3.8 / 4.17 Grupo Libra did not change its Materiality in 2012; however, this was checked through an analysis of internal documents and publications, such as: Libra’s Relationship Principles, Corporate Governance Guide, Sustainability Vision, Private Social Investment Policy, Supplier Contract Template, Integrated Management System Policy, Quality and Environment Policy, Meeting with the President Communication, Global Compact and Basic Environmental Plan. With the analysis of these documents, a new topic was added to the matrix, “Use of Energy”, which replaced “Compliance with environmental goals (global or national) of reference agencies”. However, this work has not altered the seven most relevant issues for the company, namely: 1. Ethics and transparency in business 2. Management of social and environmental risks 3. Reduced consumption of materials throughout the lifecycle of the product and/or service 4. Commitment to and investment in mitigating carbon emissions; 5. Occupational health and safety 6. Training and education 7. Investment in social and environmental projects (Private Social Investment) The Annual Sustainability Report is also available on the internet at: www.grupolibra.com.br/sustentabilidade.
