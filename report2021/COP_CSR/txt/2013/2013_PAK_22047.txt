COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS OF NEWPORTS INSTITUTE OF COMMUNICATIONS & ECONOMICS BY: BUSHRA RAZA DIRECTOR, QUALITY ASSURANCE 1 Newports Institute of Communications and Economics became the first higher educational institute in Pakistan to sign the UN Global Compact Program in the year 2005. NICE is placed amongst the top ranking institution by Higher Education Commission of Pakistan. It aims to provide highest standards of quality education at the best affordable cost (specially middle & lower middle income groups) in the fields of Business Administration, Computer Science, and Textile & Fashion Design. NICE also serves as a member of Asian Universities Federation, Employers’ Federation of Pakistan and Management association of Pakistan. Moreover, it was also selected amongst 50 Business Schools worldwide to formulate “Principles for Responsible Management Education”. We proudly believe that quality business education should be available to the masses and should not concentrate only on social elites. In a country like Pakistan, where literacy level even in urban populations is very low and poverty levels are increasing day by day, it became imperative for the Institutions to make quality education accessible to the middle & lower income groups, which comprise the masses of our society and need better attention for developing future business leaders. Moreover, future business leaders are groomed to become social welfare agents for their respective communities in whichever organization they work. It was with this background that the Board of Governors of NICE decided to be the first ones to respond to the call of Mr. Kofi Annan by becoming the signatory of UN Global Compact Program. At NICE, we feel it our utmost responsibility to inculcate professional and social values amongst our students, so that they make their most productive contribution to the socio-economic development of our country. We try to make them understand their social obligations so that we produce socially aware as well as intellectually groomed individuals for the corporate world. One major aspect of their social skill development program lies in the Social responsibility project launched by NICE to involve its students in empowering the less privileged class of our society. As part of our commitment, we embrace to adopt the ten principles of United Nations Global Compact in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. The ten principles in these four areas have been incorporated in our company policies and have been practiced within the organization. But more than that, we feel extremely important to take this message across to the incoming business leaders by designing and launching a course of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a mandatory course in all our under graduate and graduate programs in the faculty of business administration and computer science. In order to gain a practical exposure of CSR, students were also introduced a membership of International Association of Lions Clubs to undertake communal based activities. The students are put into an interesting practice of undertaking humanitarian projects related to health, environment, community and other such areas, which help them in realizing the importance of CSR for development of nations. Newports Institute strongly commits to abide by the UNGC Principles to make our communities, societies, nations and world as a whole, a better place to live. 2 STATEMENT Being a good corporate citizen is an ambition enthusiastically embraced at all levels within our company. As a member of the Global Compact, we believe that our business policies incorporate and support the ten principles. Our board fully supports our actions in working towards sustainability goals – in particular those contained in the UN Global Compact. Through our support of the United Nations Global Compact, we also aim to move the agenda forward on performance related to human rights, labour rights, the environment and the fight against bribery and corruption in Pakistan. Here we summarised the progress we have made against these principles and we will continue to follow them up in future. 30/12/2012, Bushra Raza, Director, Qualit Assurance Contact: Bushra Raza Email: bushraf@newports.edu.pk Phone: 0092-21-4541074, 4547417 Fax: 0092-214541089 3 Global Compact Action Taken Principle 1: Businesses should Newports Institute strongly endorses the protection of human rights.
