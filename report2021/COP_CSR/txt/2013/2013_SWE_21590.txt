Operations focus on new ­production of homes in ­attractive ­locations, with the main focus on expanding metropolitan areas and university towns in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Belgium. We are also involved in project ­development of ­commercial premises and ­contract work, primarily in the Greater Stockholm area. JM seeks to promote long-term quality and environmental ­considerations in all its operations. Annual sales total approximately SEK 13 billion, and the company has around 2,300 employees.

Value generation through project development JM creates houses where people feel at home. Our business concept is to create attractive living and working environments that satisfy ­individual needs, both today and in the future. Our goal in terms of share­holders is to give them a higher total return – that is, the sum of dividend and increased value – than shareholders in companies with a similar risk ­profile and business activities. JM resides close to the customer. As a result of our ambition to understand how driving forces such as urbanization and demographics ­influence customers and how they live – and which requirements and needs are important to both current and future customers – we are able to offer our customers environmentally sound residential units in attractive ­locations in selected markets. We create profitability and value for our shareholders through sound risk control and effective capital utilization. Uniform modes of production and more effective logistics also contribute to value generation. Adopting a long-term approach has been a guiding principle for JM from the very start in 1945. A clear strategic focus and a well-balanced ­building rights portfolio, together with a clear sustainability perspective, form the basis for future value generation. Most of the residential units we build are tenant-owned apartments in apartment blocks, but we also build single-family homes. We also have a certain amount of commercial project development in close vicinity to housing in order to create vibrant neighborhoods.

Energy-efficient buildings, installations that conserve water and logical spaces for sorting waste help lower operating costs for households, but they also provide environmental benefits for society as a whole. In Sweden we have introduced weather forecast controls to heat the units. The building heats up before the temperature falls and the heat is reduced before the temperature rises. This means that the system can work more evenly, which subsequently provides savings on purchased energy. To benefit our customers, we also rate all new residential units for energy. Common values The sustainability work is strongly anchored in JM’s management and is an integral part of JM’s strategy. It is also based on our core values: quality, a long-term approach, reliability, commitment and sensitivity. It forms the basis for our approach, both internally and externally, and JM’s ethical guidelines provide support in day-to-day activities. During the year a plan was implemented for the follow-up of compliance with JM’s Code of Conduct for suppliers and subcontractors, for example to ensure that they are not in violation of the UN’s Global Compact. A number of suppliers were audited via surveys about how they fulfill the requirements in the Code of Conduct and onsite audits were held in factories. Follow-up audits are planned and onsite visits will be held at additional suppliers during 2013. Dynamically positioned Structurally, conditions for our business are favorable, including large population increases in the markets where we are active. We have close contact with the end customer and often know what demands and needs are important. We have unique opportunities to steer the product choice since we plan our residential units ourselves.

President and CEO j m A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 2 CUSTOMER NEEDS JM resides close to the customer. We aim to understand how driving forces such as urbanization and demographics influence customers, and which requirements and needs are important to both current and future customers. customer needs BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND MACRO 5 Our customers’ surroundings influence their needs JM is to be the customer’s first choice when buying a new home on our markets. JM focuses on the customer’s needs. Doing so gives JM one of its most important competitive advantages. In order to assume a leading position, we must be quick to recognize and understand how people live and work. From a slightly longer term perspective, the most important societal changes include urbanization, the aging population and a firmer focus on the environment and sustainability. Trends that influence demand: • Demographic changes, an aging population and a large generation of young people entering the housing market • Urbanization is a strong trend. People are seeking freedom JM’s interior designers monitor the trends. of choice and diversity • Urban areas and commuting distances are growing, which makes new housing markets attractive customer and market surveys.

Operations primarily focus on new production of homes, with the main focus on expanding metropolitan areas and university towns in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Belgium. Demand for new residential units in Sweden was cautious during the year, but improved slightly during the last six months of the year. In Norway demand continued to be robust but the weak demand in Denmark persisted. In all, JM started production of 3,163 residential units in 2012, compared with 3,629 residential units the previous year. Sweden had 2,286 housing starts; 95 percent were units in apartment blocks and 5 percent were single-family homes. Norway had a total of 815 housing starts; 89 percent were apartments and 11 percent were single-family homes. Belgium had 26 housing starts, all of which were apartments. In Finland and Denmark, 34 and 2 single-family homes were started, respectively. In Sweden JM is considered to be the market leader, and in Norway we are number 7. Market for new production in 2012 The housing market recovered slightly in 2012. Housing prices in Sweden and Norway increased but they stood still in Denmark, Finland and Belgium. High population growth and low interest rates had a positive impact on prices, which was offset by the crisis in Europe. Sweden The debt crisis in Europe had a major impact on Swedish growth, primarily through lower demand for export goods. In 2011, falling stock market prices affected household finances Sweden’s exports are around 50 percent of GDP, and since negatively, and had a negative impact on housing prices in metSweden exports a large portion of this to Europe, the crisis has ropolitan areas.

Under-the-sink drawers with five-six receptacles make it possible to sort recycling into the same product groups as in the recycling room of the building association or at the municipality’s recycling stations. Good material choices and “JM Original” The importance of choosing material that will last a long time, both in terms of quality and design, is an important part of our work. It is particularly important for the interior design in our JM Original concept. Therefore, the planning of each unit’s interior begins early so there is an interplay between the character of the area and the architecture of the building as well as good function and design. The interior design is an important part of each residential unit. After customers reserve their new homes they receive the Interior Guide, in which we present our carefully planned JM Original standard and our available upgrades. Customers then meet the project’s interior designer and review their choices for their dream home. JM’s interior designers work to create conditions for good material choices and a good basic standard. About 70 percent of JM’s buyers select the interior for their new home within the framework of the JM Original standard. JM meets customers digitally It is important to be where customers are, which is why digital channels are playing an increasingly important role in our communication with customers and other stakeholders. If a potential customer is interested in knowing whether a suitable JM residential unit is for sale, that information should be available regardless of the time and place. Our website is the hub of our digital communication and JM’s interior design blog Hitta hem offers inspiration, tips and trends. works together with all of our digital initiatives and marketing activities.

The majority of visitors say that the visit increased their interest in buying a JM home in the future. j m a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 1 2 14 OUR OFFER new construction – guaranteed advantages five reasons to select a newly built home from jm Choosing a newly built home from JM has several advantages. Our residential units offer well-planned designs and functionality, and modern architecture. And we build where people want to live. With a newly built home, you just move in – without an excessive amount of planning. Everything is ready at occupancy and will last for a very long time to come. JM customers can invest both their time and money in activities other than renovation. We build where people want to live low-energy houses with extra insulation in the windows, walls Customers should not just enjoy living in their new homes. and ceiling, for example.

At the same time, we also want to take responsibility for our children’s future environment. More information about our environmental initiatives is presented on pages 34–43. well-insulated windows Windows are often a major source of heat loss in a building. As a result, all of the windows in our new homes have extra heat insulation with a Uw value of 0.9 W/sqmK. allergies Research has shown that there may be a relationship between problems with allergy in children and PVC. JM’s residential units have PVC-free walls and flooring. The landscaping surrounding JM houses use nontoxic plants and trees that are suitable for people with allergies, such as apple trees and roses. JM avoids dusty shelves in the kitchen by installing cabinets that go up to the ceiling. Energy-efficient appliances Major appliances can account for a fairly large proportion of a household’s electricity consumption, which is why JM equips our housing with energy-efficient appliances. All of our housing that is being planned will be equipped with induction cooktops, which can offer energy savings of up to 20 percent compared to a traditional cooktop. Good electrical installation environment We minimize exposure to electrical and magnetic fields. We always use a five-wire system, which limits the magnetic fields throughout the building, and we avoid locating distribution boxes close to the bedroom. Good sound environment Many people perceive loud sounds and noise as one of the biggest problems in a residential environment. Our residential units are quieter than what Swedish building regulations require. Our extra thick walls and floor structure provide very good insulation between apartments. Our exterior doors are required to have a good sound transmission class, and we avoid mail slots in doors by placing mailboxes in the entry to the stairwells and newspaper delivery boxes by the apartment doors. Possibility to impact energy consumption Since all of our residential units are constructed according to JM’s concept for low-energy houses, residents can achieve low household operating costs and help lower overall energy consumption. In addition, hot water usage is measured individually in each apartment, which helps ­residents understand that using hot water sparingly will also result in a lower cost. Sound materials Wood, rock, tile. We use natural materials to the greatest extent possible. We have been developing an environmental product database since 1990 where we check relevant products. Doing so enables us to build housing that is healthy and helps us avoid using hazardous substances. j m a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 1 2 16 OUR OFFER JM ’ s 10 BIGGEST PROJECTS IN 2012 Liljeholmskajen, Stockholm Development period: 2001–2019 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: Approx. 3,400 – Started: 2,318 – Housing starts in 2012: 183 Apartment sizes: 38–148 m2, 2–5 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: approx. 1,100 Location: Central, 5 km from downtown Stockholm A part of Stockholm’s inner city Kvarnholmen, Nacka Development period: 2010–2022 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: Approx. 1,200 – Started: 198 – Housing starts in 2012: 144 Apartment sizes: 41–156 m2, 1–5 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: approx. 1,020 Location: Central, 6 km from downtown Stockholm Unique location at the entrance to Stockholm’s harbor Järvastaden, Solna and Sundbyberg Development period: 2007–2019 Housing type: Single-family homes/Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: Just over 1,050 – Started: 642, of which 142 single-family homes – Housing starts in 2012: 94 Apartment sizes: 43–116 m2, 2–5 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: approx. 430 Location: Close to nature, 8 km from downtown Stockholm Garden town with an urban feel, close to downtown Dalénum, Lidingö Development period: 2010–2019 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: Just over 750 1) – Started: 137 – Housing starts in 2012: 77 Apartment sizes: 53–135 m2, 1–5 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: just over 625 2) Location: Central, 9 km from downtown Stockholm Land with a tradition on Lidingö Kungsängen, Uppsala Development period: 2002–2020 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: Approx. 1 100 – Started: 592 – Housing starts in 2012: 68 Apartment sizes: 48–115 m2, 2–5 rooms and kitchen Remaining numberof building rights: approx. 500 Location: Close to the city center South of Uppsala’s city center 1) In addition there are 220 building rights for rental units. 2) In addition there are 74 building rights for rental units. j m a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 1 2 OUR OFFER JM ’ s 10 BIGGEST PROJECTS IN 2012 17 Dockan area, Malmö Development period: 2003–2017 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: Approx. 950 – Started: 779 – Housing starts in 2012: 39 Apartment sizes: 64–183 m2, 2–5 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: 175 Location: Close to the city center/by the sea With a view of the Öresund sound Lomma Strandstad, Lomma Development period: 2003–2020 Housing type: Apartment blocks/Single-family homes Number of residential units: – Total: Just over 1,000 – Started: 539 – Housing starts in 2012: 55 Apartment sizes: 39–118 m2, 1–4 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: approx. 500 Location: Close to the sea, 8/10 km to Lund/downtown Small town by the sea Malmö Norra Älvstranden, Gothenburg Development period: 1998–2021 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: Approx. 1,950 – Started: 1,341 – Housing starts in 2012: 66 Apartment sizes: 36–117 m2, 1–4 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: just over 600 Location: Close to water, 5 km to downtown Gothenburg Norra Älvstranden continues to grow Öster Mälarstrand, Västerås Development period: 2008–2021 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: Approx. 250 1) – Started: 219 – Housing starts in 2012: 69 Apartment sizes: 34–109 m2, 1–5 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: approx. 40 1) Location: Central, 2 km from downtown Västerås Front row seat to nature Grefsen Stasjon, Oslo, Norway Development period: 2010–2020 Housing type: Apartment blocks Number of residential units: – Total: Approx. 300 2) – Started: 103 – Housing starts in 2012: 60 Apartment sizes: 38–100 m2, 2–4 rooms and kitchen Remaining number of building rights: approx. 200 2) Location: Central and close to nature, approx. 5 km from New residential area in Oslo downtown Oslo 1) Number on the balance sheet.

JM’s control systems and processes are structured to support and stimulate an optimal cash flow approach in all project phases and thus achieve maximized value development in the Group. Decisions concerning acquisitions and housing starts are crucial business decisions that have a major impact on cash flow, and therefore undergo special scrutiny and evaluation. Finance strategy and policy JM’s finance unit handles the Group’s short and long-term financing, liquidity planning, cash management and financial risk management. The division of responsibility, organization and control of the Group’s overall financing activities are regulated by a finance policy established by the Board. The policy specifies the objectives for finance operations, overall responsibility and specific rules and limits. The objectives for the finance operations are to: • Support operational activities in residential and commercial project development • Optimize use of capital and cash flow management • Control and manage the financial risks to which JM is exposed. JM’s basic finance strategy is to clearly link cash flows from projects in progress and project properties to the Company’s borrowing and interest rate risk management. This strategy provides the best control of financial risks. In order to maintain flexible administration and cost-effective debt management, existing loan agreements are guaranteed by JM’s excellent credit worthiness, which means that no mortgage deeds are provided.

But to ­satisfy others, we have to be satisfied with our jobs too. During the year we focused on ensuring that the large number of new employees who started at JM in 2011 had successfully adapted to their tasks and JM’s culture. At the end of the year, JM had 2,290 employees, of which 1,051 were wage-earners training for CRAFTSMEN and 1,239 were salaried employees. Staff turnover during the year was 6 percent, and the average length of employment was about 7 years.
