Systematic monthly monitoring enables us to, for example, ensure compliance with supplier contracts. We postponed the development of the new procurement ERP system to 2013 in order to integrate it with our ﬁnancial ERP system, which was introduced at the beginning of 2013. BETTER SUPPLIER CO-OPERATION One of our key goals is to improve supplier relationship management. We want to forge long-term partnerships with selected suppliers. We aim to reduce our suppliers to about 5,000 over the coming years. In 2012, we trimmed our network of over 22,000 suppliers by about 5,000. If we reduce the number of suppliers, we will be able to engage in closer co-operation with selected partners. Both parties will then beneﬁt from greater cost-effectiveness and economies of scale. It will also be easier for us to monitor our partners’ performance. When developing our partner network and seeking new suppliers, we analyse not only prices, quality and delivery reliability, but also corporate responsibility aspects. We primarily audit our suppliers when we want to ensure the performance of a potential major supplier, or when we want to identify areas for development with our current suppliers. The standardisation of our audit process is just one of the ways in which we are improving supplier relationship management.

When city planners want to keep urban sprawl in check, one solution is to grow cities vertically. We have decades of experience in this. KESTÄVÄÄ KAUPUNKIKEHITYSTÄ ASIAKKAAN EHDOILLA  Lemminkäinen annual report 2012  27 2 SUSTAINABLE URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN CO-OPERATION WITH CUSTOMERS URBANISATION, CHANGES in population structure, and the general economic climate are the most signiﬁcant factors inﬂuencing the outlook for construction. Population convergence in urban growth centres is a global phenomenon. Almost 65 per cent of Finland’s population lives in towns and cities. That ﬁgure is already 85 per cent in Sweden. Compared to Stockholm and Copenhagen, for example, the Helsinki region is still quite fragmented. The challenge for city planners is to keep urban sprawl in check. CITIES BENEFIT Population convergence in urban growth centres affects the cityscape, services, land use, and traffic arrangements. This trend is creating demand for new construction solutions. As services increase in number and are increasingly concentrated in urban growth centres, their availability must be safeguarded with sustainable traffic solutions. At the same time, towns and cities want to reduce private motoring in urban centres and improve safety for light traffic and bicycling. By expanding above and below existing buildThe Kivisydän parking facility in Oulu, Finland is being built in the centre of Oulu. Blasting expert Matti Palovainio is preparing to blast the next section of the tunnel. ings, surface space can be used with greater versatility to build, for example, new properties, parks and routes for pedestrians and non-motorised traffic. These types of solutions make cities more pleasant and attract new residents and businesses. Major construction projects in urban growth centres often result in a positive impact on both the city’s appeal and the local population. Largescale construction projects also have a signiﬁcant impact on employment. According to The Confederation of Finnish Construction Industries’ (RT) estimates, about 40 per cent of public-sector investments in construction are returned to the community through a variety of taxes and fees. A vibrant and pleasant urban centre with a comprehensive range of services attracts not only new entrepreneurs, but also purchasing power from near and far. EXPANDING CITIES BELOW GROUND City expansion is hindered by a lack of plots. One solution to this is to expand below ground. Parking facilities, warehouses, technical facilities and transportation routes are often the ﬁrst to Businesses in the vicinity of the Kivisydän construction site are kept proactively be moved underground.

Connecting subterranean spaces with roads and shafts can also widen their potential uses. Such connections also improve the accessibility of the city centre in general. The construction of underground shelters has been a signiﬁcant factor in promoting subterranean expansion in Finland. By utilising these spaces, Finland has become a pioneer in northern Europe in the construction of underground parking facilities. There is, however, a need for all major growth centres to utilise their underground spaces. Finland’s stable bedrock paves the way for subterranean construction. We are experienced in excavating and constructing underground rock facilities, and our competent professionals are our strength. We have, for example, implemented numerous underground parking facilities in Finland’s largest city centres. Our way of working is based on solutions that have proved effective over the years. In addition, our equipment uses the latest technology, which Lemminkäinen employees preparing for the next tunnel blast at the Kivisydän construction site. minimises vibration and take the environmental Our equipment considers environmental aspects and minimises vibration. impact into even better consideration.

While constructing the holm’s main railway station, and to deepen its facility, we also built an underground shelter and new maintenance premises for Finlandia Hall. The site is located in a existing cellar. The construction site is located at culturally signiﬁcant, city-centre area of museums and concert halls, which posed an additional challenge. The underground parking facility that we are building in the Tapiola district of Espoo in Finland is scheduled for a transport hub through which 250,000 people completion in spring 2013. As part of this project, we are also renovating the above-ground car park in Tapionaukio Square pass every day. in accordance with architect Aarne Ervi’s original design. Unlike underground parking facilities built into the bedrock, Tapionaukio will be constructed in a blasted and shored open excavation. Similar projects can later be implemented in e.g. the Baltic countries, where the soil does not contain hard rock that would enable excavation of underground rock facilities. EXPANDING CITIES UPWARDS We are currently building Kivisydän, an approximately 900-space parking facility under Oulu city centre. The Cities can grow not only below ground, but also facility will have 16 lifts to city-centre properties, two ramps to the surface, and a population shelter for 3,000 people. upwards.

In Finland, there are an estimated 38,000 buildings of at least Business review  Lemminkäinen annual report 2012  29 2 SUSTAINABLE URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN CO-OPERATION WITH CUSTOMERS three storeys, and about half of these lack lifts. These buildings also have unused building rights. The construction of additional storeys has previously required foundation reinforcement. Thanks to our new technique, foundations for upper ﬂoors can now be built outside existing exterior walls and without the need to remove the existing roof. A lift can be also installed in conjunction with the expansion. No new plots are required, and residents can live in the building throughout the roof-raising. This technique is a signiﬁcantly more affordable option than demolishing an existing building and replacing it with a new one. We employed our roof-raising technique in Tampere city centre, where we built a new Cumulus hotel. In July 2012, six hotel storeys were completed above the old post office’s parking facility. The new building’s frame was built on pillars that passed through the parking facility’s existing structures.

IN THE CENTRE OF STOCKHOLM Stockholm’s central railway station, which was completed in 1871, was built on a former lakebed. Due to a subsequent decline in the groundwater level, the wooden piles and wood lattice used in the foundations have begun to rot, causing the building to subside. Our experience in major public-sector projects in Sweden helped us to obtain a large percentage of the repair and expansion projects being undertaken at the main railway station. In addition to foundation reinforcement, new business premises are being built underground. The project was launched at the beginning of 2011 and is scheduled for completion in summer 2013. The large construction site has not disrupted the lives of the 250,000 people who pass through the station every day. Repairing this complex structure has required specialised expertise and innovative solutions. “In order to maintain tolerable noise and vibration levels, we used diamond wire cutting (DWC) to open up work shafts in the walls. This method of removing boulders is not employed in many places. We even designed customised crawler drills for this project, so that we could transport special loads in the cramped conditions,” says Project Manager Aki Virkki. 30  Lemminkäinen annual report 2012  Business review SUSTAINABLE URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN CO-OPERATION WITH CUSTOMERS 2 PERSONALISED HOMES We build quality homes in good locations in urban growth centres.

This is the largest alliance project ever carried out in Finland. In an alliance, the client, contractor and design engineers work together to deﬁne the project’s targets and come up with innovative solutions. Our goal is to achieve highquality yet cost-effective results in this demanding project. Once an appropriate method of implementation has been found and unanimously approved by the alliance’s executive board, we will move on to the next phase – construction. This phase is expected to begin in summer 2013. We are seeking cost-effectiveness, speed and quality in the three-year partnership agreement we signed with Finavia in spring 2012.

We aim to continually increase its percentage of our production. Recycled asphalt saves mineral aggregates and bitumen. The use of recycled material has no adverse impact on quality. In fact, the quality of the resulting product equals that of new asphalt. In addition to recycled asphalt, we have developed a production method that uses lower temperatures. Lower production temperatures save energy and also improve our employees’ health, as the asphalt mass emits less steam at lower temperatures. We manufacture recycled and low-temperature asphalt in all of our operating countries. The use of recycled asphalt is limited by legislation and hindered by lengthy permit application processes. During 2013, we will be focusing on increasing the production of recycled asphalt in Norway in particular.

CONSISTENT REMUNERATION We want to compensate our personnel for their work consistently, fairly, and with straightforward practices. Remuneration affects personnel motivation and commitment, and it can also be used to develop our employer image. We have developed and standardised our remuneration practices, so that they conform to our values and support the implementation of our strategy. Since 2000, we have been using a remuneration system for salaried employees that utilises competence classiﬁcation. Hay Job Evaluation methodology is being used to classify the tasks of management and senior salaried employees. We evaluated the majority of these tasks during 2012. We also employ competence classiﬁcation in succession planning and to identify wage distortion. Our salary comparison in Finland is based on an annual salary comparison survey that we participate in. All of our salaried personnel in Finland fall within the scope of an annual performance-based incentive scheme or project-speciﬁc incentive scheme. We offer not only monetary remuneration, but also a variety of other beneﬁts relating to, for example, occupational healthcare and exercise.

Our accident frequency for the reporting year was 22.0 (excluding operations in Russia).

CASE Lemminkäinen’s marketing material OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY OBSERVATIONS VIA TEXT MESSAGE We found an additional use for the mobile system that had previously been used by Technical Building Services to send work orders and log hours – risk analysis. “During the reporting year, maintenance personnel sent about 32,000 risk evaluations to the occupational safety organisation via their mobile phones. Of these, 64 per cent proved to be genuine risks that were then taken into consideration before work began. Technical Building Services’ accident frequency fell from 63 to 41 during the reporting year, and in all likelihood at least some of this improvement stems from active use of the mobile system,” says Occupational Safety Manager Tapio Nieminen. In 2013, we will be introducing the text message application in our other business segments as well. Every employee will then be able to send observations on safety deﬁciencies and dangerous places directly from construction sites – complete with photos. Our goal is to lower the threshold for intervening in occupational safety risks. ! $    ###       $   $   #    %!$  #$(  $ $  ' #$  CASE A YEAR WITHOUT ACCIDENTS  ( % $ ## ( %& ! $%   ( %  # &$  IN TAMPERE We have clear targets for occupational safety and we Aleksi Viljanen. “In addition, we have visited other conmonitor the development of safety and the accident frestruction sites across area and company borders together quency rate on every site.

In addition, the goodwill allocated to each business area has been tested separately for each country. Lemminkäinen financial statements 2012  119 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IFRS) In impairment testing the discounted present value of the recoverable cash ﬂows The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), calculated for each individual of each cash-generating unit is compared with the carrying amount of the unit in unit, is used as the discount factor. WACC takes into account the risk-free interquestion. If the present value is lower than the carrying amount, the difference is est rate, the liquidity premium, the expected market rate of return, the industry’s recognised through proﬁt or loss as an expense in the current year. beta value, and the debt interest rate, including the interest rate margin.

The carrying amount of current trade and other receivables is equal to their fair value due to their short maturity. The fair value of the bond included in non-current interest-bearing liabilities is based on the market price, and the fair value of other non-current liabilities is based on future cash ﬂows discounted using a market yield plus appropriate credit spread for the Group at the reporting date. The used discount rates vary between 2.1 and 2.5 per cent (2.5–4.5%). The carrying value of current ﬁnancial liabilities is assumed to be close to their fair value. Fair value hierachy of financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value The Group has categorised ﬁnancial instruments recognised at fair value by using a three-level fair value hierarchy. Financial instruments within Level 1 of the hierarchy are traded in active markets hence prices are obtained directly from the efficient markets. Fair values of instruments within Level 2 are based on observable market inputs and generally accepted valuation methods. Fair values within Level 3 are not based on observable market data but on quotations provided by brokers and market valuation reports.

Since 30 September 2012, 12 new municipalities have brought claims. Therefore, at the end of the year, there were a total of 52 claims for damages brought by municipalities and the Finnish state (Finnish Transport Agency) pending against Lemminkäinen and other asphalt industry companies in the District Court.

The claims presented in the statements of claim differ from each other as regards their amounts and grounds.
