Sustainability: An Evolving Process Our mission of sustainable growth can be traced back to decisions and commitments we began making decades ago. In the 1970s and 1980s our focus was on internal safety and meeting environmental regulations. In the late 1980s and 1990s we added voluntary footprint reductions, going beyond regulatory requirements. We looked to increase shareholder value with a goal of zero safety and environmental incidents as we decreased raw material and energy inputs into our products and reduced emissions at our manufacturing sites. Now we see ourselves in a third phase of sustainable growth, characterized by a holistic approach that is fully integrated into our business models. In this phase, sustainability is broadened to include human safety as well as environmental protection, and it becomes our market-driven business priority throughout the value chain. The transition to products that meet the definition of “sustainable” will take place over time. But the pace will quicken as the synergistic effects of market demand, societal expectations and product innovation create collaborations up and down the value chain.

We’re building a higher value, sustainable growth company focused on providing solutions to large global issues. The people of DuPont continue to advance our sustainability journey as we explore, discover, innovate and deliver solutions to global challenges. We have three strategic priorities: agriculture and nutrition, bio-based industrials, and advanced materials. In each area, DuPont has leading science that is valued by our customers and which enables us to continue to build a distinctive set of higher margin, sustainable growth businesses. More than ever, sustainability is a core component of each of our business strategies. In 2012 we made tremendous progress against our 2015 sustainability goals, achieving most of these goals three years ahead of schedule. Given that accomplishment, we have begun defining our next set of sustainability goals. In this report, we’ve included two areas that are outlined for 2020. One is Energy, which we announced in 2011. The other is a new category in its first year of reporting – Food Security. In the near future we will announce a complete set of 2020 sustainability In 2012 we made tremendous progress goals that will reflect the overall strategic direction of DuPont. against our 2015 sustainability goals… As always, the DuPont Core Values of Safety and Health, Environmental Stewardship, Highest Ethical Behavior and Respect for People serve as the backbone of how we operate as individuals and as a company. They will continue to guide us in our effort to find sustainable, innovative, market-driven solutions that will make lives better, safer and healthier for people everywhere. Consistent with these core values, DuPont is proud to have been one of the first U.S.-based signatories to the United Nations Global Compact in 2001, and we continue to recognize the importance of the 10 Principles of the Global Compact today. With our resources, talent, and science concentrated on clear strategic and operational priorities, we will accelerate progress toward our long term growth targets while delivering near term value to our shareholders. We will continue to challenge ourselves with sustainability goals that create value for all of our stakeholders, and through our product innovation, business strategy, and operations we will meet them. Ellen Kullman Chair of the Board & Chief Executive Officer 5 1.2 Description of key impacts, risks, and opportunities DuPont is a science company generating new products every year from our world class market-driven research and development. With each transformation of our company, we have become even more focused on sustainability issues. When environmental and safety laws and regulations were introduced in the 1970s and 1980s, our commitment focused on meeting those new requirements. In the late 1980s and 1990s, we realized that mere compliance was not sufficient, and that our stakeholders expected more from us. So we went beyond regulatory requirements and made voluntary commitments to reduce the environmental footprint of our facilities. Today, we are striving to integrate a holistic approach to sustainability into our business models. We are working to increase shareholder and societal value while striving for a goal of zero for all injuries, illnesses, incidents, waste and emissions. As a material, technology and knowledge provider, we can have far reaching impact on virtually every major industry in the world – from agriculture to construction, and transportation to communications. Our goal is to put our science to work to help our customers and their customers grow their businesses while contributing to social and environmental progress worldwide. Our 2015 Sustainability goals have focused on how we plan to grow the company by investing our research and development towards products that have a quantifiable environmental benefit for our customers or the final consumer. This approach has helped us reduce the impact of our supply chain in areas like climate change, energy use, water use, generation of pollution and waste, material use, ecosystems, and use of non-depletable resources. This year, we have made such substantial progress toward our 2015 commitments that the time has come for us to look more broadly toward the future. We’re focused now on determining our 2020 sustainability goals, as well as defining the ways in which we can make new leaps and bounds toward our vision of solving the world’s greatest challenges. While we have made tremendous progress, we recognize that much more remains to be done. As a company that has been operating for over 200 years, we also acknowledge our legacy issues. We have established policies and processes around key impact areas such as biotechnology, biodiversity, bio-persistent materials, climate change, and nanotechnology. Our strategic corporate sustainability activities are guided by the Environmental Policy Committee of the Board of Directors, chaired by Bertrand Collomb. This Committee is responsible for reviewing the company's environmental policies and practices. To develop and execute sustainable strategies, Annual Sustainability Reviews are conducted with the leadership of each of DuPont's businesses. These Reviews are structured to assess environmental performance and compliance, assess the business' contribution to corporate sustainability goals, and to discuss business risks and opportunities associated with sustainability, climate change, and energy. It is our practice to identify risks early and manage them proactively through operational processes and line management. In addition to the efforts described above that are focused on sustainability, individual functions and businesses within DuPont engage in processes to identify broader operational risks and opportunities. DuPont aims to meet its responsibilities under our safety, health, and environment (SHE) commitment (The DuPont Commitment), the American Chemistry Council’s Responsible Care® initiative (www.responsiblecare.org) and the International Council of Chemical Association’s (ICCA) voluntary initiative called the Global Product Strategy (GPS) (http://www.icca-chem.org/). DuPont joined the GPS initiative when it was launched in 2006. The goal of the GPS is to ensure that society will continue to enjoy the value and benefits of chemistry, while industry and its partners continuously improve efforts to protect public safety, health, and the environment. As a member of the initiative, DuPont is assessing further the risk 6 of its key chemicals in commerce by 2018. In 2013, DuPont is reporting Product Safety Summaries to provide a general overview of chemical substances as a part of our commitment to GPS. Please see our Product Stewardship Assessment & Summaries page for more information. To deliver on this initiative, DuPont has performed Product Stewardship Assessments to evaluate further the safety of the current uses of its chemicals. As the first step in the assessment process, DuPont analyzed its chemical inventory against the following prioritization criteria: • Business relevance • Hazard characteristics • Exposure potential • Detection in human blood, tissue, or urine • Potential impacts on selected populations and/or endpoints • Stakeholder feedback 2020 Energy Goal DuPont is evaluating the high-priority chemicals using a screening level risk Reducing our energy intensity assessment approach. This approach uses readily available hazard, use, and 2015 Sustainability Goals exposure information to determine the safety of these chemicals for current uses Reducing our Environmental Footprint throughout the chain of commerce.

The goal of the initiative is to improve product stewardship within the chemical industry and with suppliers and customers throughout the chain of commerce. See section 1.2 for more information on GPS. For detailed information on these commitments, please visit our efforts at Sustainability Performance and Reporting webpage. 4.12 Externally developed economic, environmental, and social charters, principles, or other initiatives We believe that working in partnership with others and committing to voluntary initiatives are important in demonstrating leadership. Commitment on UN Global Compact DuPont is committed to aligning our operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. Commitment on Responsible Care  Management System DuPont was one of the first chemical companies to adopt the American Chemical Council’s Responsible Care® Codes of Management Practices, which were initiated in the late 1980s. Since then, DuPont has led efforts to expand Responsible Care® to encompass advances such as security, public reporting of metrics, and management systems certification. Commitment on Climate and Energy We believe the global scientific understanding of climate change is sufficient to compel prompt, effective actions to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. To be successful at the necessary global scale these actions will require concerted engagement by the world’s governments, along with technological innovations by businesses, and individual actions by all citizens. We believe any strategy to address climate change must be both environmentally effective and economically sustainable. Policy solutions must be good for the environment, for business, and for people around the world. The magnitude of innovation and action required to effectively address climate change is unparalleled. DuPont is focused both on reducing our own footprint and on delivering solutions that help our customers conserve and use energy efficiently. We are applying our science to develop technologies and materials that will help enable energy generation, improve efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions across value chains in a wide range of sectors.  DuPont continues to participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project where we publicly report our corporate greenhouse gas emissions data and associated climate risks and opportunities. 20  To encourage environmentally effective and economically sustainable policy actions, DuPont is actively engaging with policymakers and other business and NGO stakeholders from around the world to develop constructive public policies to address global climate change. DuPont’s belief in the importance of taking prompt, coordinated, and strong action to address climate change is why we were a founding member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP), an alliance of major businesses and leading NGOs that came together to call on the U.S. federal government to enact legislation requiring significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. Commitment on Nanotechnology DuPont and Environmental Defense collaborate on a framework for the responsible development, production, use and disposal of nano-scale materials. The intent of this framework is to define a systematic and disciplined process that can be used to identify, manage and reduce potential health, safety and environmental risks of nano-scale materials across all lifecycle stages. These materials hold great promise for new applications in materials, energy, medicine and other fields. Commitment on Biotechnology DuPont is committed to comprehensive stewardship of biotechnology as we leverage it for beneficial use long term. We believe in a prudent approach that includes caution and care that is, we will carefully consider the wishes of society, protection of the environment and need for increased productivity as we develop biotechnology products and/or license our technology. This belief comes from our agricultural and industrial experience over the past 200 years. For detailed information, please refer to our Position Statements (http://www.dupont.com/corporate-functions/news-andevents/insights/articles/position-statements.html). 4.13 Memberships in associations and/or national/international advocacy organizations DuPont participates in many associations at the regional, national, and international level. In addition to 4.12, our other primary memberships include: • American Chemistry Council (ACC) • World Economic Forum • European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) • World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) • Business Roundtable (BRT) • Field to Market, the Keystone Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture • Global Harvest Initiative • CropLife America and CropLife International • Africa Harvest Biotech Foundation International • World Resources Institute • Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) (formerly the Pew Center on Global Climate Change) 4.14 List of stakeholder groups 21 DuPont engages a number of stakeholder groups including the communities in which we operate, customers, suppliers, shareholders and the investment community, employees and retirees, as well as a number of non-profit environmental and advocacy organizations. For example, DuPont establishes Community Advisory Panels at many of our global operating sites to engage our neighbors in discussions about our activities and their concerns and needs. Members of the Panels do not work for the company, but may be regarded as representatives of the neighborhood. 4.15 Basis for identification and selection of stakeholders with whom to engage Stakeholders are identified based on community engagement activities, key customers and suppliers of specific business units, investor relations’ initiatives, and through specific processes to understand societal concerns. 4.16 Approaches to stakeholder engagement Given the diversity of the company and the global locations in which we operate, approaches to and frequency of stakeholder engagements are determined at the corporate and regional level. Some examples include: • Communities Community Advisory Panels are established for nearly every global DuPont operating site. Each site determines the frequency of the interaction that makes the most sense for the community. • Other Stakeholders – Customers, suppliers, investors and shareholders, community leaders and organizations, key customers and trade associations, and retiree and employee groups are tailored to the needs and interests of each. 4.17 Key topics and concerns that have been raised through stakeholder engagement and how the organization has responded Stakeholder engagement is considered a key strategy of DuPont serving our purpose as a science company. Specific examples are listed below.  Based on the ongoing dialogue with the former Health Advisory Board, the Leadership Principles on Biopersistent Materials were developed.  Based on dialogue with the former Biotechnology Advisory Panel, a set of Bioethics Guiding Principles were developed.  Through our partnership with the Environmental Defense to develop standards of care for nanotechnology.  DuPont publishes corporate, regional and operating site reports.  Stakeholder engagement is conducted by Investor Relations.  DuPont actively engages with multiple stakeholders in keeping with our animal testing policy. For example, DuPont has engaged in an ongoing dialogue since 2006 with the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), which involves ongoing discussions about non-animal test methods, animal husbandry approaches, and advocating for appropriate standards and regulations. This interaction has been very useful in helping us continuously evaluate and enhance our practices and to maintain the commitments outlined in our policy. 22 Economic Summary Working in partnership with others, we are building sustainability into our products as well as into the way we make them. Sustainability is central to our total value proposition, impacting not only our business, but every customer and every consumer we touch, everywhere in the world. The Needs of the World Drive Our Science Global population growth and associated growth in the middle class are creating distinct megatrends throughout the world. Global challenges provide DuPont the opportunity to bring our unmatched science to the marketplace, creating game-changing solutions in constant collaboration with customers and key partners. Each megatrend presents opportunities for DuPont collaborative science and solutions. Together, we can feed the world One in seven people on earth goes to bed hungry each night. Ensuring that enough healthy, nutritious food is available for people everywhere is one of the most critical challenges we face. At DuPont, we commit 50% of our research and development dollars to ensuring that the world's growing population has enough food. From advancing the nutritional content of crops, to helping farmers and growers around the world increase their yields, to finding better ways to ensure food safety, we're working every day to get more food to more people. Together, we can decrease dependence on fossil fuels The global supply of fossil fuels is limited. Inefficient use of our remaining fossil fuels can adversely affect our environment. With a growing population, we will need to find new energy sources, and ways to use our existing resources more responsibly. DuPont possesses deep knowledge and experience in microbiology, fermentation, polymer science and electrochemistry, which means we can help the world transition from fossil fuels to more sustainable alternatives. From cutting-edge solar panels to lighter, more fuel-efficient car components, these transitions will fuel new industries and power cleaner economies. Together, we can protect what matters most As our population increases, so do the threats to human safety and the well-being of the planet. One of our greatest challenges in the coming decades will be adequately protecting humanity and the world we share. DuPont is working with companies, governments, academics and scientists to develop a vast range of materials, products and consulting solutions that protect life and our ecosystem. From life-saving body and car armor to cleaner refrigerants, we’re working to keep the most precious things on earth, and the earth itself, safe from harm. 23 Some of Our Key Actions in 2012 In 2013, DuPont announced a new set of sustainability goals focused around global food security, and reported base year progress for 2012. DuPont will commit $10 billion to R&D and introduce 4,000 new products by the end of 2020. The company will facilitate 2 million engagements with young people around the world to transmit knowledge, and will work to improve the livelihoods of at least 3 million farmers and their rural communities through target collaborations and investments that strengthen agricultural systems and make food more available, nutritious and culturally appropriate. In 2012, to increase open access to information about global food security, DuPont commissioned the Global Food Security Index in partnership with the The Economist Intelligence Unit. The Global Food Security Index addresses the underlying factors of food insecurity in 105 countries and points to areas for improvement and reforms. This one-of-a-kind tool gives all players in the food arena a common language to talk about food security. DuPont achieved zero landfill status in its Building Innovations business by reducing, reusing and recycling manufacturing byproducts and waste at manufacturing sites globally. Building Innovations became completely landfill free, reducing its environmental footprint from 81 million pounds of landfill waste annually to zero. DuPont and NexSteppe entered into a collaboration to develop advanced feedstocks for biofuels, biopower and biobased products. The collaboration will focus on the development of new sweet sorghum and high biomass sorghum hybrids which will create additional feedstock options for these rapidly evolving industries. DuPont broke ground on its cellulosic ethanol facility in Nevada, Iowa. Expected to be completed in 2014, the more than $200 million facility will be among the first and largest commercial-scale cellulosic bio refineries in the world. 24 Economic Performance Indicators EC1 Direct economic value generated and distributed, including revenues, operating costs, employee compensation, donations and other community investments, retained earnings, and payments to capital providers and governments 2012 Economic Value Retained (US Dollars in Millions) Revenues 35,310 Operating Costs 23,802 Wages / Benefits 7,925 [Economic value Payments to Providers of Capital 2,058 generated] Payments to Governments 1,167 Community Investments (Philanthropy) 31 [Economic value Economic Value Retained 327 retained] The amounts presented above represent results on a continuing operations basis.

In many cases the costs associated with actions taken to reduce and manage these risks and opportunities are part of broader activities related to our efforts to strategically manage climate change, and it is therefore difficult to estimate the specific cost associated with individual risk or opportunity drivers. Changing consumer behavior: As DuPont analyzes factors shaping the markets that we serve in the years ahead we have identified three megatrends: Improving food productivity, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and protecting people and the environment. As we look at our existing product portfolio and consider new product development, we us these megatrends as one tool to help frame our thinking about expectations for growth and future market demand. Of our $2.1 billion R&D investment in 2012, 82% was associated with developing solutions in those three areas. DuPont is uniquely positioned to address the rising demand for secure, environmentally sustainable and affordable energy sources. With a growing population, we will need to use our existing resources more responsibly and find new and cleaner energy sources. DuPont is applying deep expertise in microbiology, fermentation, polymer science and electrochemistry to help make cars lighter, fuels cleaner, and sustainable energy sources, such as the sun, easier to harness — all contributing to a lower carbon future. To create more of a business focus on product opportunities related to climate change and environmental markets more broadly, DuPont included market-facing goals in our October 2006 launch of our 2015 Sustainability Goals. The market-facing goals are aimed at capturing value in a carbonconstrained world by tying our business growth more directly to the development of products that have environmental benefits and help our customers increase their energy efficiency and/or reduce their greenhouse gas footprint. DuPont reports on progress toward this goal and our other Sustainability Goals in annual progress reports posted on www.sustainability.dupont.com. We anticipate that efforts to limit carbon emissions will drive demand for DuPont products and services that serve a low-carbon economy. Many of DuPont’s existing products provide improved safety, efficiency, and environmental benefit in our homes, offices, and automobiles. Increased climate change mitigation efforts (resulting from voluntary or mandatory greenhouse gas emission reductions) could drive expanded demand in some of DuPont’s major markets, such as automotive materials, building materials, seed products and services, and biofuels. Given the diversity of products and services that DuPont produces for sale in a wide range of global markets, financial opportunities as they specifically relate to climate change are not formally assessed for the company overall. Individual businesses whose portfolios include products that could be particularly impacted by climate policies or a transition to a low-carbon economy take into consideration relevant issues (e.g. potential for increased product demand resulting from policies or other incentives; anticipated growth in certain markets such as alternative fuels; etc.). Expectations for new or expanded markets driven by demand for products that enable climate change mitigation or adaptation and the strategic implications for certain DuPont businesses are discussed during some of the Sustainable Growth Reviews. These reviews are led by DuPont’s Chief Sustainability Officer and conducted with individual DuPont business presidents and their teams. For some of the new and emerging markets that DuPont serves (e.g. renewable / alternative energy) there are industry estimates of anticipated growth, but estimates vary widely and actual market growth will depend in large part on the speed of technological innovation as well as the implementation of policies that will accelerate research, development, demonstration, and deployment of key technologies. 26 EC3 Coverage of the organization’s defined benefit plan obligations. The company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company’s earnings and cash flows. Employees are offered 401(K) plans or defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability and life insurance protection for employees (other long-term employee benefits). Approximately 76 percent of the company’s worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company’s worldwide other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company’s non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits. (See LA3 for more information.) The fair value of assets in all pension plans was $19.4 billion at December 31, 2012, and the related projected benefit obligations were $29.2 billion. In addition, obligations under the company’s unfunded other long-term employee benefit plans were $3.5 billion at December 31, 2012. For further details, please refer to Item 7 (pages 34 and 35) and F-30 through F-38 in the DuPont 2012 Form 10-K. EC4 Significant financial assistance received from government. In the normal course of business, DuPont may seek research and development programs that use government cost share and that are aligned with corporate strategies and polices. EC5 Range of ratios of standard entry level wage compared to local minimum wage at significant locations of operation. DuPont offers competitive compensation packages that are complemented by a comprehensive benefits program. This is a benchmarked process. As part of our Human Rights policy, we pay wages that meet or exceed the legally required wages or, where no wage law exists, the local industry standard. EC7 Procedures for local hiring and proportion of senior management hired from the local community at significant locations of operation. Procedures for local hiring include the following: • All positions are posted online. • All regions are using Taleo as their applicant tracking system. • Centralized recruiting has been implemented in all regions. Recruiters and hiring managers partner to find a diverse set of candidates. • Global employee referral program will be launched in 2014. • In some instances, search firms are contracted to place candidates in ‘hard to fill’ positions. EC8 Development and impact of infrastructure investments and services provided primarily for public benefit through commercial, in-kind, or pro bono engagement. 27 DuPont improves the quality of life and enhances the vitality of the communities in which we operate by supporting community sustainability efforts. Sustainable communities recognize the interdependence of social progress, economic success and environmental excellence. Through financial contributions and the active volunteer participation of employees, DuPont provides support to programs and non-profit organizations that address one or more components of community sustainability. Some of examples of those efforts are: United Way Employee Campaign and Days of Caring in the United States, Canada and Latin America This is significant program that engages our employees, retirees, and the Company working together to commit to making our communities better through funding and Days of Caring Volunteer Programs. Through the employee and company contributions we provide over $7million dollars to United Way at the local levels through site and headquarter campaigns in the US, Canada and Latin America. Annually, thousands of DuPonters are given paid time off to perform volunteer services for local non-profit agencies in our communities. Community services included planting vegetables for food banks and painting the offices of the Boys and Girls Club and the homes of low income families. DuPont Community Fund The DuPont Community Fund was established as another way to help create sustainable communities. The DuPont Community Fund in collaboration with our local sites provides support to numerous programs and organizations annually that address one or more of these three key components in community sustainability specific to the needs of the individual community. In 2013 the Fund awarded over $350,000 to 91 projects at 61 different locations in 21 countries. DuPont Volunteer Program DuPont employees have a long history of involvement in the communities in which they live and work. We volunteer in educational activities (as parents and mentors), health and human service agencies, as well as in arts and environmental groups. Our site communities have long recognized the impact that DuPont volunteers make with their service commitment. It is appropriate and timely that such commitment to our communities is recognized as part of DuPont's core values of caring for society in general and for our communities specifically. Through a DuPont Volunteer website, employees can find local volunteer opportunities. Each year DuPont recognizes about 204 volunteers from 5 regions for their efforts and provides a $1000 grant for the organization. Clear into the Future – A Community Based Conservation Program Clear into the Future® is a corporately sponsored program of DuPont whose vision is to enhance awareness, involvement, and understanding of the ecological and commercial value and history of the Delaware Estuary and associated watershed. Maintaining a healthy, diverse, and vibrant planet is a collective responsibility. That’s why the DuPont Clear into the Future® Initiative is working with the community to preserve and enhance the beauty and integrity of the Delaware Estuary for generations to come. Clear into the Future® provides funding for an environmental education center and a nature center in Delaware, grants, development of educational programs for children and volunteers to the achieve its vision. In the past year DuPont employees volunteered over 800 hours to Clear into the Future®. Because of the success of the program, DuPont is beginning to expand this program across the United States in 2014. DuPont ProBono Project – Stepping up to legal needs of our Community Staff members of the Legal Function have been encouraged to offer their time and talents to their communities in the form of pro bono legal activities. Partnering with local Delaware agencies that provide legal services to the poor such as Delaware Volunteer Legal Services and Office of the Child Advocate, DuPont Legal has begun to represent numerous low income clients in areas such as protective orders from domestic abuse and in representing disabled veterans. It is working to identify additional areas where DuPont Legal can be supportive. Almost 2% of their work time or 40 hours per year are suggested as part of this voluntary program. At least 35% of its staff participates in this program. This program has been recognized by the Delaware Bar Association. 28 StreetLaw Program Started in 2006 DuPont Legal’s Diversity Pipeline Project, done in collaboration with Howard High School in downtown Wilmington DE partners with local law firms to send lawyers, paralegals and legal administrative assistants into the classroom to work with students and sponsor a trial advocacy workshop each December. Students learn about the basics of the law and the administrative skills needed to work in a law firm, law department or other legal related organizations. It focuses on real life issues and challenges. We are also using this program to mentor students to prepare for the college selection and application process. In 2008 along with Widener Law School, DuPont started an SAT training class for these students to further assist them as they pursue higher education. EC9 Understanding and describing significant indirect economic impacts, including the extent of impacts. DuPont does not aggregate the indirect economic impact of our collaborations and contributions. We do have specific programs, in addition to our Community Fund (please refer to EC8), that provide support to our communities. Examples of some programs where we do consider impact are: DuPont Food Security: In the first year since establishing goals towards addressing global hunger, DuPont has already seen strong progress to help ensure sustainable food production to ultimately end world hunger and guarantee food safety. Innovating to Feed the World: DuPont invested $1.2 billion of the $10 billion research and development commitment in 2012 and introduced more than 1000 new products of the 4000 products goal centered on producing more food; enhancing nutrition, food and agriculture sustainability and safety; boosting food availability and shelf life; and reducing waste. Engaging and Educating Youth: The company worked with 360,000 youth globallycontributing to the goal of 2 million youth engagements around the world in education opportunities. Improving Rural Livelihoods: DuPont engaged with more than 160,000 smallholder farmers with the goal of improving the livelihoods of at least 3 million farmers and their rural communities through targeted collaboration and investments that strengthen agricultural systems and make food more available, nutritious and culturally appropriate by 2020. DuPont National AgriScience Teachers Ambassador Academy: This Academy is a professional development institute sponsored by DuPont and is a special project of the National FFA organization and the National Association of Agricultural Educators. The curriculum developed by LAB-AIDS includes sessions on agricultural science, horticulture, veterinary science, natural resources, sustainability, food safety and food security. It includes tours of DuPont facilities and interaction with DuPont scientists and engineers. Over the last decade, DuPont through its Ag Ambassador Academy has trained over 229 Ag Science teachers in inquiry based science. These Ambassadors went on to present workshops and spread their knowledge to over 12,000 teachers across the US impacting tens of thousands of students. 29 Environmental Summary Please refer to the 2013 Sustainability Progress Report located on our website. The Report provides our progress towards achieving our eleven sustainability goals that focus on reducing our footprint and energy needs as well as researching and developing products. At DuPont, our sustainability journey has evolved over the last few decades. We began by responding proactively to calls for environmental compliance, and by reducing our operational footprint. Since the early 2000s, we’ve expanded our sustainability efforts into market-driven goals that have helped us produce more sustainable solutions for customers. This year, we’re beginning to report progress in a new category, Food Security. Throughout this journey we’ve made significant progress in sustainability – and this year is no exception. Since 2004, we’ve reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent, surpassing the goal by 10 percent, and we’ve lowered our global water usage by 12 percent. Our Market-Facing Goals have seen progress since 2011, producing an additional $2 billion in revenue from products that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and $11.8 billion in revenue from products based on non-depletable resources. In the new category of Food Security, DuPont has set goals to help ensure sustainable food production in order to ultimately end world hunger and guarantee food safety. We’re investing more than $3 million each day on research and development to this end, and we’ve already begun to see progress in our goals to strengthen agricultural systems and make food more available and nutritious. We’ve made such substantial progress toward our 2015 commitments that the time has come for us to look more broadly toward the future. We’re focused now on determining our 2020 sustainability goals, as well as defining the ways in which we can make new leaps and bounds toward our vision of solving the world’s greatest challenges. Our perspective is that new technologies such as biotechnology and nanotechnology – offer compelling benefits, and should be part of the suite of solutions that help bring safe and nutritious food to the world, decrease our dependence on fossil fuels, and safeguard people and the planet. Therefore societal acceptance of these technologies will be critical. We’re committed to working closely with stakeholders to understand concerns, to make sure our solutions are safe, and to be transparent about our work in these areas. We know that our ability for future growth is contingent upon our continued effort to be a socially and environmentally responsible corporate citizen. We look forward to sharing with you a complete set of our 2020 sustainability goals in the near future, and to furthering our sustainability journey. Linda J. Fisher Vice President of DuPont Safety, Health & Environment and Chief Sustainability Officer 30 Environmental Performance Indicators EN3 Direct energy consumption by primary energy source The total amount of non-renewable fuel consumed by DuPont in 2012 was approximately 30.3 million Megawatt hours (MWh) or 109 million gigajoules (GJ), a reduction compared to 2011 data. Biogenic (renewable) fuel sources in 2012 totaled 1.4 million MWH or 5.1 million GJ.

These voluntary activities resulted in primarily Scope 2 emission reductions and are ongoing. This summary of actions was sent to all Wilmington area employees and energy efficiency reminder cards were distributed and posted in area offices. Below are some of the initiatives that comprised the program.  Peak Savings – Decrease electrical consumption when you receive site notices of a high-priced electricity day or time period. During peak periods, electricity prices can increase many times greater than the normal price.  Reduce HVAC loads – close blinds on sunny side of building in summer  Reduce lighting loads – turn off lights whenever you leave your office or work area  Turn off equipment when not in use (e.g., computers, printers, etc.)  Report Problems with exterior doors, temperature control, other energy inefficiencies Investment required was minimal, predominantly involving people's time to coordinate program and printing and distribution of reminder cards. Process Change/Projects: DuPont's corporate energy efficiency strategy is managed through our Bold Energy Plan. We have an online database that tracks plant performance toward annual energy targets. The database currently tracks over 2,000 completed, in progress, and proposed projects, some of which require capital investment. Since the inception of the Bold Energy Plan in 2008, DuPont has realized year-over-year energy cost savings of $230 million. The company also looks for opportunities to make its overall portfolio less energyand emissions-intensive, and weighs energy use when investments or divestitures are considered. DuPont also conducts annual Sustainable Growth Reviews with each of the businesses, which result in dialogue with the leadership of each business and recommendations on shortand long-term strategy presented to members of the Office of the Chief Executive for consideration. Wide range of energy efficiency projects implemented at DuPont facilities (e.g., process optimization, fuel switch) to reduce energy use and Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The figures reported represent aggregate 2012 savings for the Company’s voluntary global energy efficiency improvement program, 32 the Bold Energy Plan. The savings were achieved from the implementation of over 600 individual improvement projects, 74 of which required capital investment. The NPV of the portfolio was $141MM. The Bold Energy Plan was launched in January 2008 and is expected to continue indefinitely as DuPont’s method of driving continuous improvement in energy efficiency at its global facilities. EN6 Initiatives to provide energy-efficient or renewable energy based products and services, and reductions in energy requirements as a result of these initiatives. One of DuPont’s corporate sustainability goals sets a challenge to, by 2015, grow our annual revenues by at least $2 billion from products that create energy efficiency and/or significant greenhouse gas emissions reductions for our customers. We estimate these products will contribute at least 40 million metric tons of additional CO2 equivalent reductions by our customers and consumers. This goal was launched in 2006, and as of 2012, we had reached $2 billion in annual revenue from products that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These products in the marketplace resulted in cumulative greenhouse gas emissions of nearly 16 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. DuPont products and technologies are diverse and enable avoided GHG emissions for our customers in a number of different sectors and applications (e.g. renewable materials, buildings and construction, alternative energy, transportation, and agriculture). An internal team from sustainability and engineering (with expertise in life cycle analysis) is tasked with identifying those products with use-phase (scope 3) GHG benefits for our customers and tracking annual revenue and associate GHG emissions avoided. The specific methodology, assumptions, emission factors, and GWPs vary from product to product, as individual analyses are done for each product by final end-use included in our reporting on this goal. The following are examples of products that enable avoided GHG emissions by others in our value chain. Photovoltaics: DuPont Photovoltaic Solutions represents the broadest portfolio in the solar energy industry, with more than 10 products critical to photovoltaic production. DuPont materials and technology solutions are designed to help increase the efficiency and lifetime of crystalline silicon and thin film photovoltaic solar modules, while reducing total systems cost and enabling the photovoltaic industry to reach grid parity faster. The business has set a goal to exceed $2 billion in sales by 2014. We continue to invest in both capacity expansions to support the explosive industry growth and the development of new innovative technologies to address different applications within the industry.

In a life cycle analysis of the use of virgin glass reinforced nylon in place of secondary aluminum for an engine component of the Ford F250 truck, it was found that lighter weight in vehicle use far offset energy consumption in manufacturing. During a 10 year lifetime of 100,000 trucks included in the analysis, a 77 billion BTU net energy savings was achieved and 11 million pounds of CO2 emissions were eliminated. DuPont materials help improve automotive efficiency and get more power to the wheel by reducing friction, especially in driveline systems. Innovative Seed Products: Pioneer Hi-Bred is aggressively developing corn hybrids that exhibit enhanced efficiency in nitrogen use, that require reduced quantities of nitrogen, by up to 30 percent, while maintaining overall yield. Decreasing the amount of nitrogen needed presents the opportunity for farmers to reduce their input cost per bushel of corn produced, while reducing the environmental impact of nitrogen fertilizer production, application and use. EN7 Initiatives to reduce indirect energy consumption and reductions achieved. See EN5 for examples of initiatives to reduce indirect energy consumption. EN8 Total water withdrawals by source Our 2015 Footprint Goal is to reduce water consumption by at least 30 percent at global sites that are located where the renewable freshwater supply is either scarce or stressed as determined by the United Nations analysis of river basins globally. For all other sites, we will hold water consumption flat on an absolute basis through the year 2015, offsetting any increased demand from production volume growth through conservation, reuse and recycle practices. We have reduced our consumption by 20.9 percent at sites in water scarce or stressed locations and 12.2 percent at all sites. Water Consumption (millions cubic meters) Baseline 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Total 125.1 123.6 117.2 119.5 122.2 117.3 112.0 116.5 119.6 110.7 All Sites Ground Water 50.0 49.4 55.8 56.8 55.8 55.5 56.3 47.9 52.0 45.5 Potable Water 35.5 35.0 30.4 30.6 33.1 30.6 27.1 32.1 34.0 28.6 Surface Water 39.6 39.2 31.0 32.1 33.3 31.2 28.6 36.4 33.6 36.6 Sites in Water Total 24.2 22.7 21.9 22.4 22.9 22.1 19.3 19.5 21.7 19.1 Stressed Ground Water 6.2 5.9 5.3 5.3 5.1 4.4 4.3 4.3 4.2 2.6 or Scarce Potable Water 7.6 7.1 7.3 7.7 9.0 9.0 6.9 7.7 7.3 6.4 Locations Surface Water 10.4 9.8 9.3 9.4 8.8 8.7 8.1 7.6 10.2 10.0 EN9 Water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water 34 DuPont has assessed consumption at our global sites using the definitions recognized by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and using the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Global Water Tool (http://www.wbcsd.org/work-program/sectorprojects/water/global-water-tool.aspx). DuPont’s withdrawals do not significantly affect any water sources because of the following.  None of the withdrawals account for an average of 5% or more of the annual average volume of a given water body.  None of the water bodies from which DuPont sires withdraw are recognized by professionals to be particularly sensitive due to their relative size, function, or status as a rare, threatened, or endangered system (or to their support of a particular endangered specifies of plant or animal). EN10 Percentage and total volume of water recycled and reused. Although a number of sites reuse and/or recycle water, currently, recycle or reuse water usage data are not collected throughout the company. DuPont has set publicly stated water conservation goals based on reducing water consumption at sites in locations having annual renewable water supply per capita identified as “scarce” by definitions recognized by the UNEP (determined from the WBCSD Water Tool), and holding water consumption flat on an absolute basis in other locations. DuPont does not impose on the sites requirements regarding the method for attaining these goals; rather, businesses and their sites develop their own plans for attainment. Therefore, DuPont does not require sites to report on internal use of water; but must report metrics on water withdrawals (by type) and water consumption (by type). A number of manufacturing sites have accomplished substantial reductions in water consumption and/or withdrawals in recent years. Two examples are: 3 3  Starke, Florida site has reduced its annual consumption of groundwater from approximately 4.5 million m to 0.8 million m by recycling clean effluent water for process use in lieu of fresh water and upgrading its water distribution system to eliminate unintentional losses and improve use efficiency.  The Sohna, India, Industrial Biosciences site redirected an effluent treatment plant to treat its waste water from production for horticulture irrigation instead of discharging it in the drain. In the first year of effect, 339.2 cubic meter of underground water was saved. EN11 Location and size of land owned, leased, managed in, or adjacent to, protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas. Included in our Position Statement on Biodiversity is a commitment to inform and engage local communities in decisions impacting natural resource biodiversity in those communities. EN12 Description of significant impacts of activities, products, and services on biodiversity in protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas We are not aware of significant impacts on biodiversity in 2012. Also, the water and runoff discharges from DuPont sites do not significantly affect any habitats because of the following:  None of the discharges account for an average of 5% or more of the annual average volume of a given water body. 35  None of the discharges are known to have or are highly likely to have significant impacts on the water body and associated habitats. All sites that discharge water do so under permits developed by national or state authorities that specifically consider the potential for water quality impacts including habitat damage. (Note: Some sites discharge their water to public or private multi-client treatment works rather than to water bodies.) DuPont performs environmental assessments (which are generally required by national or state agencies) when operations are sited.  None of the discharges are to water bodies that are recognized by professionals to be particularly sensitive due to their relative size, function, or status as a rare, threatened, or endangered system (or to their support of a particular endangered specifies of plant or animal). EN13 Habitats protected or restored. Teams of employee volunteers at 14 DuPont sites around the globe continue to work diligently to enhance, protect and restore wildlife habitats on their plant properties and in their communities. These sites are certified by the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC), a Maryland U.S. based non-profit organization dedicated to increasing the quality and amount of wildlife habitat on corporate, private and public lands. Combined, nearly 10,000 acres of land at the 14 DuPont sites are certified as Wildlife Habitats. To earn and maintain certification, the teams of employee volunteers develop and execute various programs to protect the natural resources at their sites and to create partnerships in the community with students and adults to help educate them about environmental preservation. One example is the team at the Fayetteville Works, NC, site which collaborated with a local middle school honors science club to digitally map the site’s existing nature trail and then journal and research highlighted features along the trail. Another is the Wildlife Habitat team at Washington Works, WV, which conducted projects with Eagle Scouts to construct three nature trails, and collaborated with a Cub Scout troop to build new bluebird boxes on the site. These and other habitat enhancement projects helped earn Washington Works WHC Corporate Lands for Learning Certification, which provides third party recognition for conservation educational programs. Washington Works was one of four DuPont certified plant sites that received special recognition at the WHC’s 25th Annual Symposium in November 2013 for their contributions to wildlife habitat conservation. The other sites were Asturias, Spain; DeLisle, Pass Christian, MS; and Spruance, Richmond, VA. In addition to the wildlife habitat preservation work at the plants, for the past seven years, DuPont has conducted a communitybased conservation initiative called Clear into the Future (CITF). CITF has an ongoing commitment to maintain and improve the health and beauty of the Delaware River Estuary watershed in the U.S. The program focuses on using science, volunteerism, education and special projects to help preserve and enhance the natural beauty and integrity of the Estuary for generations to come (www.clearintothefuture.com). Through CITF DuPont employee volunteers and family members have collaborated with many environmental organizations at numerous events across the Estuary – from tree planting, to cleanups to storm water retention projects – to help make a difference. CITF also conducts a program called Clear into the Classroom in which Delaware students can win field trips to the DuPont Environmental Education Center to learn about the Estuary. Since it began, CITF has continued to strive to make a difference through collaboration and partnerships with Universities, local environmental organizations, and educators. As part of that, CITF has provided grants to numerous organizations that work to support the Delaware Estuary, including the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to sustain and promote fish, wildlife, and plant resources throughout the watershed and the Nature Conservancy to preserve and enhance important habitats in the state of Delaware. 36 EN14 Strategies, current actions, and future plans for managing impacts on biodiversity. Environmental stewardship is a core value for DuPont. We will continue our efforts to conserve and protect natural resources in our communities in collaboration with partners such as the Wildlife Habitat Council and The Nature Conservancy. We are also working with stakeholders and organizations such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the Business for Social Responsibility to enhance our understanding of ecosystem services. EN16 Total direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions by weight For overall greenhouse gas emissions, from 1990 to 2003, we reduced emissions by 72 percent, which includes our Invista business, and 60 percent excluding Invista. Invista assets were divested in 2004. Direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, also known as Scope 1 GHG emissions under the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol, are emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by DuPont. In 2012 the gross DuPont Scope 1 GHG emissions were 10,817,700 metric tonnes. While we report our gross Scope 1 emissions as required under various reporting schemes, we set our goals based on those emissions over which we truly have control, thereby excluding emissions due to energy generated for third parties, such as non-DuPont tenants of adjacent facilities. On this basis our net Scope 1 GHG emissions were 9,629,000 metric tonnes. Indirect GHG emissions, also known as Scope 2 GHG emissions under the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol, are emissions from sources as a consequence of DuPont energy needs but are not owned or controlled by DuPont (e.g., purchased electricity, steam, heat and chilled water). In 2012 the gross DuPont Scope 2 GHG emissions were 4,416,200 metric tonnes. While we report our gross Scope 2 emissions as required under various reporting schemes, we set our goals taking into account GHG offsets due to the purchase of renewable electricity. On this basis our net Scope 2 GHG emissions were 4,303,800 metric tonnes. Including all acquisitions and removing all divestitures from our emissions reporting over the period 2004-2012, our total Scope 1 + Scope 2 emissions have been reduced by 25%. DuPont Scope 1 & 2 Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Year, million metric tons 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 18.6 16.1 16.1 17.3 15.4 13.9 15.6 16.6 13.9 EN17 Other relevant indirect greenhouse gas emissions by weight. Other relevant indirect greenhouse gas emissions for 2012 were calculated to be 1,570,000 metric tons. Greenhouse gas emissions related to business travel were calculated as 98200 metric tons. Other relevant indirect GHG emissions not yet calculated included purchased goods and services. As a manufacturing company, purchased goods and services are expected to be a relevant category for our Scope 3 emissions. Preliminary 37 screening confirms this assumption. However, uncertainty is too significant for reporting at this time. Based on the product portfolio for DuPont and review of Scope 3 results from similar companies, the use of sold products is expected to be the most significant Scope 3 category. EN18 Initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reductions achieved 2015 Footprint Sustainability Goals Since the early 1990s when DuPont began taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the company has achieved major global reductions in emissions. In 1994, DuPont established our first greenhouse gas emissions goal and committed to reduce 40% from our 1990 base. After meeting that goal, in 1999 DuPont established a new goal to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 65% from a 1990 base. By the end of 2003 we had reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 72%. Our current goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 2015 from an updated base year of 2004. As of 2012, we have reduced by 25 percent since 2004. 2015 Market-Facing Sustainability Goals In October 2006, DuPont announced our market-facing goals. These goals address all stages of product development, from R&D efforts through marketing and sales. We have a goal that by 2015, we will grow our annual revenues by at least $2 billion from products that create energy efficiency and/or significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We estimate these products will contribute at least 40 million tonnes of additional CO2 equivalent reductions by our customers and consumers. As of 2012, the annual revenue from those products reached $2 billion. 2020 Energy Goal Our corporate energy efficiency strategy is managed through our Bold Energy Plan. Our new objective is to reduce non-renewable energy use by 10 percent per price adjusted dollar revenue by 2020 compared to a baseline of 2010. We have set a milestone of 3 percent reduction by 2015. As of 2012, we have reduced energy intensity by 1.2 percent. We have an online database that tracks plant performance toward annual energy targets. Progress is measured by the energy savings achieved from individual improvement projects at each plant. The database currently tracks over 1,000 completed, in progress, and proposed projects, some of which require capital investment. Availability of capital for energy efficiency improvement projects is critical setting public goals alone will not drive improvement unless you have adequate financial and personnel resources available to implement improvements. For example, in 2007 DuPont created an Energy Capital Fund from which we invested $60 million in energy projects that will reduce CO2 emissions and energy use by 6%, and deliver $170 million in projected 10-year net present value at an aggregated 60% IRR. Plant Site Managers have responsibility for all aspects of site operations and set priorities for the workforce. Their performance is judged by annual metrics (e.g. safety, environment, fixed costs, etc.). Energy is a new metric being added to the Site Manager report card, providing additional incentive and individual accountability for our success in meeting annual energy savings targets. With over 100 plants with annual energy targets, Site Energy Champions are an essential part of implementing the Bold Energy Plan. Site Energy Champions have monthly conference calls and bi-annual corporate energy conferences where they can share best practices and identify opportunities to rapidly replicate successful projects. Sustainable Growth Excellence Awards Each year since 1990, DuPont has held an award program to recognize the most significant employee accomplishments. The Sustainable Growth Excellence Awards seek to honor those teams and individuals who have made significant contributions (some related to energy efficiency and/or climate change) toward DuPont implementing our mission and the Sustainability Goals. Climate Change 38 To encourage environmentally effective and economically sustainable policy actions, DuPont is actively engaging with policymakers and other business and NGO stakeholders from around the world to develop constructive public policies to address global climate change. DuPont's belief in the importance of taking prompt, coordinated, and strong action to address climate change is why we actively participate in a number of stakeholder initiatives around the globe and why we were a founding member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP). The business community has a critical role to play in developing and bringing to market the technologies and solutions that will make possible the transition to a low-carbon economy. This transition will provide new markets for innovative companies to prosper. Beyond our commitment to reduce our own environmental footprint we have set goals related to products that help others reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. These include both research and development investment targets and product revenue goals. These goals tie business growth to the development of safer, cleaner, and more efficient products for global markets. DuPont is dedicated to using our science to bring these innovative products and solutions to market. We are applying our science to develop technologies and materials that will help enable energy generation, improve efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions across value chains in a wide range of sectors. EN20 NOx, SOx, and other significant air emissions by type and weight NOx Emissions (metric tons): From 1995 to 2003, DuPont reduced nitrogen oxides (NOx) by approximately 57 percent, which included the Invista business. After divesting Invista, from 2004 to 2009, the NOx emissions were reduced by an additional 25 percent. From 2008 to 2012, the reduction was approximately 8 percent. 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 8,520 7241 8128 8188 7836 SOx Emissions (metric tons): From 1995 to 2003, DuPont reduced sulfur oxides (SOx) by approximately 37 percent, which included the Invista business. After divesting Invista, from 2004 to 2009, the SOx emissions were reduced by an additional 57 percent. From 2008 to 2012, the reduction was approximately 63 percent. 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 23,900 12989 10603 10274 8758 The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions have been fairly steady while we have substantially reduced air carcinogens.

Please refer to EN12 above. EN26 Initiatives to mitigate environmental impacts of products and services, and extent of impact mitigation. DuPont has programs such as Product Stewardship, Life Cycle Assessments, and our mandatory commitment for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). DuPont has also informed members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works that the U.S. Congress should modernize the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to strengthen market and public confidence in the U.S. chemical management process. DuPont is working collaboratively with non-government organizations, federal legislators, regulators and trade associations, including the American Chemistry Council, on a modernization plan that assures the safe use of chemicals, provides transparency for the public and fosters ongoing innovation by industry. As part of our comprehensive product stewardship management system, all new and existing products and services are required to have a product stewardship review rescheduled, conducted and documented prior to commercialization and on a periodic frequency (e.g. every 2, 3, or 4 years) commensurate with risk. Please refer to the Product Stewardship section for more details. The DuPont 2015 Sustainability Goals are the expression of a life-cycle-thinking business concept integrating all of our operations, from research and development to manufacturing to marketing. Successful new products provide superior functionality and favorable sustainability attributes to customers and stakeholders, such as reduced energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. DuPont practitioners use Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) to identify areas of concern and improvement opportunities in the early development stages. EN28 Monetary value of significant fines and total number of non-monetary sanctions for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations. For a description of environmental proceedings with potential monetary sanctions greater than $100,000, please see DuPont 2012 Form 10-K and subsequent DuPont Forms 10-Q.

Please refer to EN17 above for information on business travel. In addition, DuPont reports performance against fleet fuel efficiency in the annual Sustainability Progress Report centers around. See page 11 of our latest report on our Sustainability Reports webpage for more information. EN30 Total environmental protection expenditures and investments by type As a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and 42 degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. Related to these activities, the company incurred environmental operating costs of $595, $562 million, and $521 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. In 2012, DuPont spent approximately $65 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals. DuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company has recorded a liability of $436 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. 43 Labor and Human Rights Summary Recognizing that our people are our greatest resource, DuPont has earned international recognition for the series of race and gender awareness programs, and for our management of an ethnically and geographically diverse workforce. Our Core Values are the underpinnings of our corporate culture and are expected of all of us without exception:  Safety and Health  Environmental Stewardship  Highest Ethical Behavior  Respect for People It is our intention to create an environment where people can use all of their capabilities to support our business. Therefore, we encourage our employees to balance their work and personal responsibilities. We offer programs such as Family Leave, Flexible Work Practices, Adoption Assistance and others. Our Practices Code of Conduct: We have a Code of Conduct which consolidates all Company policies with respect to business ethics and conflicts of interest for DuPont and our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and joint venture arrangements in which we have a majority interest or operating responsibility. These policies require that each employee conduct the Company’s business with integrity, in compliance with applicable laws, and in a manner that excludes consideration of personal advantage. Any allegations or breaches of the Code of Conduct are investigated promptly and disciplinary actions around confirmed violations are taken. Compliance Officers, HR, Legal and Finance leaders serve as resources and focal points for employees to answer questions on code of conduct. The company maintains an employee ethics hotline for the reporting of suspected misconduct consistent with applicable laws. Breaches to our ethics code are written up and cascaded through the organization globally so that all employees can see the issues, the consequences of not being in compliance with our Business Conduct Policy, and the lessons learned from the breach. We have conducted an annual Business Ethics and Compliance Survey with employees worldwide including employees who are in majorityowned businesses or for which DuPont has operating responsibility. We also have an internal system called LegalEagle which provides valuable training tools for employees. Human Rights: DuPont has a strong commitment to the protection and advancement of human rights wherever we operate. Our Human Rights Policy is based on our core values of Safety and Health, Environmental Stewardship, Ethical Behavior, and Respect for People. We also endorse the 10 Principles in the UN Global Compact. 44 In 2012 DuPont created the Human Rights Leadership Team and Human Rights Corporate Advisory Board to lead our strategy for sustained progress in a purposeful human rights approach. The Council was created to focus human rights efforts along four key risk areas: field labor, contract manufacturing, construction and suppliers. Equal Employment: DuPont is an equal opportunity employer. It is our policy not to discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of age, race, religion, color, sex, disability, national origin, ancestry, marital status, sexual orientation, or veteran status. Harassment of any type is not tolerated. Respect is the Recognition of Value Respect for People is of one our core values. It means inspiring participation, ensuring fairness and dignity, and creating an atmosphere of openness, engagement, active listening and trust. It is about embracing and appreciating people of their unique background, thinking, experience, knowledge, skills, needs and abilities. In 2010 we launched a systemic process to advance respect for people as a core value, much as we have with other core values such as safety and ethics. We established Respect for People Central,” a global team that converged on a standard definition, vision, and behaviors consistent with a respectful work environment. In 2011 our goals include a global roll-out of training modules to build competency in the organization and visible communications and tools to inspire employees around the work. In 2012 we launched Let’s Solve to build engagement internally for DuPont, the company’s brand, and our core values. Career Training and Development Learning is a continual process in DuPont. A formal process known as Career Development Planning, helps our employees plan their development to meet both business and personal goals. DuPont recognizes the effectiveness of experiential learning and values on-the-job training as a primary means of development. We have collaborations with many leading universities, research institutions, companies, and industry & professional organizations to provide developmental experiences. Formal training is another important avenue for gaining new skills. Each business within the company has ongoing training programs that are designed specifically to maximize the performance of its employees in meeting business objectives. Other development opportunities include training sessions and seminars presented by industry or professional organizations. DuPont also offers a program that provides financial assistance to employees pursuing courses at academic institutions. 45 Labor Performance Indicators LA1 Total workforce by employment type, employment contract, and region, broken down by gender.

Learning is a continual process in DuPont and there are opportunities provided to employees to enhance professional and personal skills. A formal career development process helps employees and their supervisors in planning development to meet both business and personal goals. DuPont recognizes the effectiveness of experiential learning and values on-the-job training as a primary means of development. The company's collaboration with many leading universities, research institutions, companies, and industry & professional organizations also often present unique developmental experiences. Formal training is another important avenue for gaining new skills. Each business within the company has ongoing training programs that are designed specifically to maximize the performance of its employees in meeting business objectives. DuPont taps on the expertise of external training providers and the company's own functional experts to offer a wide range of courses in areas such as Leadership & Management, Sales & Marketing, Finance, Manufacturing, Human Resources, Information Technology, Personal Skills, and Safety & Health. There are many thousands of courses available to employees via the electronic learning management systems available at DuPont. Other development opportunities include training sessions and seminars presented by industry or professional organizations. DuPont also offers a program that provides financial assistance to employees pursuing courses at academic institutions. It is the intent of DuPont to make any separations required by business situations as supportive as possible of both employee and family needs. DuPont provides benefits and assistance to employees who are terminated for lack of work. DuPont offers a career transition program to provide employees with financial assistance as well as support for interview skills, resume preparation, job search strategies, and support with change management. Other benefits include medical and dental coverage, life insurance, tuition assistance and, for eligible employees, pension. LA12 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews. At DuPont, our Performance Partnership is the process for managing, coaching, developing, assessing and rewarding employee performance. It consists of ongoing formal and informal coaching.

This policy operates in conjunction with and is supportive of our Safety, Health and Environmental Commitment, our product stewardship programs, our regulatory compliance program, and our endorsement of the 10 Principles in the UN Global Compact. DuPont will not tolerate the use of illegal or forced child labor in any of its global operations and facilities. We will not tolerate the exploitation of children, their engagement in unacceptably hazardous work, and the physical punishment, abuse, or involuntary servitude of any worker. We expect our suppliers and contractors with whom we do business to uphold the same standards. For purposes of these Principles, we are using the United Nations definition of a “child” as anyone who is less than 16 years of age. DuPont supports temporary workplace internship and apprenticeship education programs for younger persons as well as customary seasonal employment so long as such persons are closely supervised and their morals, safety, health, and compulsory education are not compromised in any way. Additionally, our Pioneer Hi-Bred business is a member of CropLife International, a global federation representing the plant science industry. Pioneer was involved with the preparation of the CropLife Position on Child Labor in the Seed Supply Chain. Pioneer has implemented a child labor prevention 52 program which includes an audit component for the cotton seed operations in India. One of the components is inclusion of a “No Child Labor” clause in our contracts with growers and other third parties. DuPont is extending the effort in our cotton seed operations in India by establishing a Core Values Standards for Supply Chain Contractors. This standard includes steps to prevent child labor, specific direction on migrant labor, field sanitation and other worker rights. This standard also establishes a management structure that will govern the audits and management review of our operations against the standard. This standard is being applied to all of our Pioneer operations globally. Please refer to the DuPont Statement on California Transparency Supply Chains Act for more information on our commitment. HR7 Operations identified as having significant risk for incidents of forced or compulsory labor, measures taken to contribute to the elimination of forced or compulsory labor We have not identified our operations as having significant risks for forced or compulsory labor. DuPont’s position on forced or compulsory labor is reflected in the response for HR6 and can be found in our Human Rights Principles.

The DuPont human rights council is working on establishing a formal process for tracking human rights incidents to be initiated in 2014. 53 Societal Summary We believe collaborations are needed to address the dynamic needs of the growing world. As the world’s population grows, demand for natural resources is increasing, while availability is decreasing. The world is undergoing transformational change triggered by global population growth and the rising middle class in developing geographies. DuPont is responding to meet the increasing demand for food, decreasing dependence on fossil fuels, protecting lives and the environment and meeting emerging markets’ demand for science-based solutions. Today, thousands of DuPont people are collaborating with stakeholders and partners – including customers, governments and communities – to meet these complex challenges that will define the coming decades. Global Leadership Climate Change DuPont is a leader on climate change. DuPont began taking action to address climate change almost twenty years ago. We have accomplished major global reductions in our own greenhouse gas emissions, and we continue to set ambitious goals for additional emission reductions. We publicly report our corporate emissions data and associated climate risks and opportunities through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). DuPont is focused both on reducing our own footprint and on delivering solutions that help our customers conserve and use energy efficiently. We are applying our science to develop technologies and materials that will help enable energy generation, improve efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions across value chains in a wide range of sectors. UN Global Compact DuPont is a member of the UN Global Compact which is a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. Collaborating with our Communities DuPont improves the quality of life and enhances the vitality of the communities in which we operate by supporting community sustainability efforts. Sustainable communities recognize the interdependence of social progress, economic success and environmental excellence. Through financial contributions and the active volunteer participation of employees, DuPont provides support to programs and non-profit organizations that address one or more components of community sustainability. Over the next several years, DuPont will be making a step change in its Corporate Giving and Outreach approach to focus it to advance the impact it has on our communities and on DuPont’s Corporate Purpose to meet the challenges around feeding the world, creating a sustainable energy future, protecting people and the environment, and creating a future STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) ready workforce. DuPont has a global presence with each facility leader empowered to work with local community leaders to better understand and support local community sustainability initiatives in accordance with our stated corporate giving philosophy. Through support of funds and volunteers at the local level and through our Community Fund/Volunteer Recognition efforts DuPont can better focus on meeting the needs of the local community with a goal of being a good community partner. 54 In the USA, Canada and Latin America, DuPont works closely with the United Way organization. Activities include corporate and employee giving and paid time off for volunteer activities at United Way agencies. Most of these activities and funds go directly into local community agencies. DuPont strongly supports education as a key component to a sustainable community and to enable youth to be prepared for the future. We have a commitment globally to improve science education at the K-12 level focused on systemic reform such as Common Core Standards and Next Gen Science, increasing teacher proficiency through our relationship with the National Science Teachers Association and FAA, making STEM fun and exciting for students to encourage the pursuit of science at both the National Level through programs such as the DuPont Challenge Essay Contest, Science Olympiad and FIRST® Robotics and at the local level by working with State government and schools through individual volunteer efforts . We also advocate for STEM literacy through strategic partnerships with organizations such as Change the Equation and STEMConnector. At the University level, grants to universities extend to more than 200 colleges and universities worldwide, expanding DuPont access to leading-edge research and continuing our investment in the development of a highly skilled workforce and a scientifically literate citizenry. Higher Education Partnerships operate at both the undergraduate and the graduate level, with many initiatives focused on increased participation of underrepresented populations. Government Affairs Our government affairs organization works to understand the corporate direction of DuPont and individual business priorities and then engages in federal, state, and international public policy processes ranging from climate change to chemical management. We are focused on the following primary external activities: Advocacy: Identifying, building and maintaining relationships that are critical to success in the public policy process. Public Policy: Proactively engaging in federal, state and international public policy processes, which include legislative, executive branch and regulatory involvement, as appropriate. Business Collaboration: Partnering with DuPont businesses and select functions to identify, pursue and secure opportunities in the government market spaces. 55 Society Performance Indicators SO1 Percentage of operations with implemented local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs. While percentage cannot be calculated at this time, DuPont is involved in many initiatives focused around local community engagement. The DuPont Office of Education (OOE) works with educators, university faculty, the business community and local DuPont sites to prepare today's children for tomorrow's world. Our goal is to ensure that the next generation of citizens has a working knowledge of the unique method of science and a reasoned understanding of science as a domain of human knowledge. To that end, OOE is engaged in a variety of collaborative initiatives to bring inquiry-based science programs to communities where we operate, to nurture young Americans' interest in science and mathematics professions through national and international competitions, to increase the numbers of underrepresented minorities prepared for careers in science and mathematics, and to safeguard the competence of our teachers of science and mathematics. See our Position Statement on local sustainable development at http://www.dupont.com/corporate-functions/news-andevents/insights/articles/position-statements/articles/sustainable-development-local-sustainability.html. SO2 Percentage and total number of business units analyzed for risks related to corruption. In 2012, 11% of audits incorporated risks related to corruption. SO3 Percentage and total number of business units analyzed for risks related to corruption. 100% of DuPont employees who are required to take the DuPont Code of Conduct web-based training module in 2012 were trained in the organization’s anti-corruption policies and procedures. The Code of Conduct provides a framework for employees to interact within and outside the company while adhering to the DuPont’s Highest Ethical Behavior Core Value. Employees are required to take the Code of Conduct and related ethics training annually. The training is available in 22 languages. SO4 Actions taken in response to incidents of corruption. When a suspected incident indicating corruption, or any other Core Values violations, the Global Ethics Investigations team gathers data required to facilitate a decision whether to pursue the issue. If the issue is pursued, a full investigation is conducted, disciplinary action taken, root cause analysis conducted and related control improvements implemented. SO5 Public policy positions and participation in public policy development and lobbying DuPont maintains many policy positions and participates in public policy development ranging from climate change to chemical management. Below are some efforts and for a complete listing, please refer to our position statements (http://www.dupont.com/corporate-functions/news-andevents/insights/articles/position-statements.html). Climate Change 56 DuPont began taking action to address climate change almost 20 years ago. We believe the scientific understanding of climate change is sufficient to compel prompt, effective actions to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. We believe that to be successful these actions will require concerted engagement by the world’s governments, along with technological innovations by businesses, and individual actions by all citizens. We believe any strategy to address climate change must be both environmentally effective and economically sustainable. Policy solutions must be good for the environment, for business, and for people around the world. To encourage environmentally effective and economically sustainable policy actions, DuPont is actively engaging with policymakers and other business and NGO stakeholders from around the world to develop constructive public policies to address global climate change. For example, DuPont is engaged in advocacy work to support a proposed amendment to the Montreal Protocol that would develop a cap and reduction plan for hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), similar to what was done for CFCs under the Montreal Protocol. Significant progress on climate change could be made by ensuring and accelerating the transition to next generation alternatives with significantly lower global warming potential. Please also see our Position Statement on the Montreal Protocol (position statement on Montreal Protocol: http://www.dupont.com/corporatefunctions/news-and-events/insights/articles/position-statements/articles/montreal-protocol.html). Agricultural Biotechnology Biotechnology holds a great deal of promise to enhance our lives and planet. With a world population expected to reach nine billion by 2050, biotechnology offers new potential for sustainable living, healthy eating and battling diseases while reducing our footprint on the planet. We believe the broad field of biotechnology presents important opportunities that should be explored and developed to identify those safe and commercially viable applications that bring significant benefits to society. These opportunities arise in areas including food, materials, energy generation, polymers, sensors and electronics. Benefits may include lower cost, higher quality products and reduced reliance on fossil fuels along with other environmental benefits. Biodiversity Protection of the world’s biodiversity is an important societal need, as well as a critical requirement for developing new products. As part of our corporate commitment to sustainable growth, DuPont seeks to conserve and protect natural resource biodiversity; consider concerns of local communities in the selection, design, production, and introduction of our products; and publicly advocate positions consistent with this commitment. Bioethics We have developed Bioethics Guiding Principles that guide us operationally and are further confirmation of our commitment to stakeholders as we pursue the opportunities and resulting benefits Biotechnology can offer the world. The Principles reflect independent work by the University of Pennsylvania Bioethics Center, along with direct guidance from the DuPont external Biotechnology Advisory Panel and influence from other diverse, international groups with whom we interact. We are committed to continuous learning and improvement, to address emerging issues and to adjust as needed. SO6 Total value of financial and in-kind contributions to political parties, politicians, and related institutions by country DuPont sponsors a Political Action Committee (PAC) called the DuPont Good Government Fund (DGGF). The DGGF is managed by the DuPont Government Affairs Advisory Council (GAAC) which has the responsibility to review and approve all DGGF political contributions. GAAC members represent a cross-section of business interests and include several members of the DuPont executive management leadership team. 57 The DGGF activities are authorized by federal law in the United States which allows DuPont to solicit funds from eligible employees for the purpose of providing financial support to political candidates. Both corporate and PAC contributions are made to candidates who have demonstrated a positive concern for issues that are important to the businesses and markets in which the Company operates, and are based on the following criteria, among others:  The candidates demonstrated honesty, integrity, effectiveness, and commitment to good governance;  The candidates’ understanding and support for issues important to DuPont and its employees;  The location of DuPont employees and/or facilities in the candidates’ state or district;  The candidates’ position in leadership or in key committees, or the candidates’ potential for leadership;  The candidates’ financial need and chance of being elected; and  The alignment of the candidates’ voting record with DuPont’s values and positions.

DuPont has safety, health, and environment (SHE) standards as well as engineering standards to prevent and mitigate negative impact of operations on local communities, along with internal and external experts. 58 Product Stewardship Summary Implementation of the Product Stewardship & Regulatory Management System (PS&R MS) has provided DuPont businesses a standardized framework for planning, implementing and measuring performance of priority work for meeting global regulatory requirements while allowing flexibility to meet the specific needs of individual businesses. The PS&R MS is a proven and valued process and a cornerstone of our commitment to Product Stewardship and Responsible Care®. In 2004, DuPont made a commitment to the American Chemistry Council to adopt a new management system approach for implementing Responsible Care® in the U.S., including mandatory independent third-party certification. At the time there was no standardized approach to planning and executing the product stewardship activities and there was no formal approach to monitoring and evaluating performance. The decision was made to implement the Responsible Care® management system for all DuPont businesses, globally. The PS&R MS has provided an integrated, structured approach to improve planning processes, drive execution, develop transparent business product stewardship metrics and measure performance. A key part of the Responsible Care® commitment is mandatory certification by an independent, accredited auditor. All of the more than 220 companies taking part in the Responsible Care® initiative at the American Chemistry Council undergo headquarters and facility audits to assure that they have a system in place to measure, manage and verify performance. For DuPont, product stewardship certifications occur through business audits. This is a unique element to the DuPont implementation and was first accomplished in 2007. The PS&R MS process begins with a strong commitment from business leadership. Business and Corporate leadership annually review the continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of the PS&R MS and makes any necessary changes to enhance performance. The PS&R MS has delivered significant improvements in closure of action items, on-time completion of product stewardship reviews, worldwide training and assurance of PS assessment of all new products prior to commercialization. The PS&R MS also established business PS metrics with action levels for businesses and the PS Incident Program. Inherent in this framework is a commitment to continual improvement. 59 Product Responsibility Performance Indicators PR1 Life cycle stages in which health and safety impacts of products and services are assessed for improvement, and percentage of significant products and service categories to such procedures Our goal for new product stewardship reviews is 100% and our actual completed reviews in 2012 were 99.5%. As part of our comprehensive Product Stewardship & Regulatory Management system, the goal is to have all new and existing products and services covered by a product stewardship review. Product stewardship reviews for all products and services are scheduled, conducted and documented prior to commercialization and repeated on a periodic frequency (e.g. every 2, 3 or 4 years) commensurate with risk. The product stewardship review process is one means to verify that effective risk assessment and risk management processes are implemented for each product or product line and to identify opportunities for continuous improvement. The process also requires businesses to conduct product stewardship reviews when significant changes to hazard, exposure, product use, regulatory, or other information is obtained. PR2 Total number of incidents of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services during their life cycle, by type of outcomes Product Stewardship Reviews completed during the 2012 reporting period revealed compliance with regulations and voluntary codes concerning known safety or health impacts. All businesses receive an annual internal Product Stewardship & Regulatory Management System audit and an assessment of incidents is included in the performance measurement section of the audit program. External verification that our product stewardship program meets the American Chemistry Council's requirements was achieved in 2007 and was verified again in 2010. PR3 Type of product and service information required by procedures, and percentage of significant products and services subject to such information requirements The goal for information requirements covered in the table below is part of our product stewardship review requirement. The product and service categories subject to such requirements is 100%. Actual completed reviews in 2012 were 99.5%. The product and service information contained in the table is accessible for all products through Material Safety Data Sheets and product labels where required by hazard communication laws and requirements. This information is also reviewed as part of our product stewardship review process for all new and existing products and services. The review includes an assessment of the applicability of regulations, legislation and other Responsible Care® related requirements. 60 Additional customer support may be obtained by contacting Customer Service (FIND.INFO@usa.dupont.com) or the Material Safety Data Sheet coordinator at the contact information provided on the data sheet. PR4 Total number of incidents of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary codes concerning product and service information and labeling, by type of outcomes All businesses receive an annual internal Product Stewardship & Regulatory Management System audit and an assessment of incidents is included in the performance measurement section of the audit program. External verification that our product stewardship program meets the American Chemistry Council's requirements was achieved in 2007 and was verified again in 2010. Two incidents of non-compliance with regulations were identified during the 2012 reporting period. Each of the recorded incidents involved incorrect information on a product label, such as incorrect language. In each case there was no known safety or health impact identified prior to the corrections being made. In each case, improved labeling management practices and stakeholder engagement improvements resulted to prevent reoccurrence. PR5 Practices related to customer satisfaction, including results of surveys measuring customer satisfaction DuPont uses a customer loyalty measurement and improvement system rather than a focus on customer satisfaction, since satisfaction is not a predictor of customer behavior. A metric is in place to track customer loyalty, based on customer ratings of DuPont performance in support of our businesses. Additional customer input provides insights that indicate drivers of loyalty or disloyalty, so that actionable steps can be considered and taken in follow-up. A standardized survey is deployed electronically to customers and is targeted for decision-makers and decision-influencers in top customer companies that represent value chain positions where business and marketing strategy is focused. It is a targeted relationship survey, so it is not sent to all customers. Only a few high-level questions are involved. Businesses provide customer names and related input to the survey process that enables depth of analysis. Businesses then employ processes for listening, acting and tracking improvement opportunities and their impact on both customers and the business. 61 Results are business-specific, though customer responses are not related to individual products or locations of operations. DuPont does not communicate externally about its customer loyalty metric. General results show ongoing improvement in the metric, which has been in place for 6 years. PR6 Programs for adherence to laws, standards, and voluntary codes related to marketing communications, including advertising, promotion, and sponsorship The product stewardship review process is one means to connect with marketing communication across the organization. The product stewardship review process assesses banned and restricted lists in certain markets, weighs public perception, and is used to engage stakeholders along the product trail for each product, product line or service. The process also requires businesses to conduct product stewardship reviews when significant changes occur in any of these areas. In addition, as part of the product stewardship review process, feedback from all stakeholders is assessed (e.g., customer complaints, technical issues, concerns, etc.) and may result in product changes or other improvements. All new and existing products and services are required to have a product stewardship review scheduled, conducted and documented prior to commercialization and repeated on a periodic frequency (e.g. every 2, 3 or 4 years) commensurate with risk. DuPont developed an environmental marketing claims online application to evaluate all environmental marketing claims made by the 13 business units in the company (as of end-of-year 2012), thus avoiding exaggerated or false claims. In addition, the DuPont legal team regularly reviews all marketing materials including web content, marketing claims, marketing communications, and trade show materials. PR7 Total number of incidents of non-compliance with regulations and codes concerning marketing communications, including advertising, promotion, and sponsorship by type of outcomes Product Stewardship Reviews completed during the 2012 reporting period revealed compliance with regulations and voluntary codes concerning known safety or health impacts. In addition, all press releases mentioning sustainability are vetted before being published for evidence of greenwashing or inaccuracies.
