In SP Moulding, our ambition is to contribute to sustainable development. We see a good correlation between behaving responsibly while increasing our internationalisation, earnings and growth. To ensure that we live up to our ambition of responsibility, we established a CSR policy for SP Moulding in 2012. The CSR policy reflects our core value: to create the best plastic solutions for the benefit of both our customers and the surrounding environment. We act as an innovative, reliable and competitive partner for our customers and societies. This is our first annual Communication on Progress and we describe our actions to integrate the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We are also committed to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. Our Communication of Progress report covers the period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012. Yours sincerely Frank Gad CEO SP Moulding A/S April 2013 Communication on Progress – 2012 Page 3 ABOUT SP MOULDING SP Moulding is a leading manufacturer of injection-moulded plastic precision components for a wide range of industrial enterprises worldwide. SP Moulding corporate values: Our employees are innovative, reliable and competitive. They work on a global level with our customers to create the best plastic solutions, not only for the benefit of the customers, but also for the environment. We naturally comply with the principles in the International Labour Organization’s conventions, UN’s human rights conventions and Global Compact’s 10 commandments. We implement the Lean-processes at the production facilities to give our employees influence on their own work situation and work flow. Plastic is the material of the future and only lack of creativity sets the limits for its applications in our future world. SP Moulding has modern production sites in Denmark, China and Poland. Production and processes in Denmark and China have been certified in accordance with DS/EN ISO 9001:2008 and DS/EN ISO 14001:2004. In Poland we have been certified in accordance with DS/EN ISO 9001:2008. SP Moulding (Suzhou) Co. Ltd. in China and SP Moulding (Poland) Sp. z.o.o. manufacture technical plastics and perform assembly work. In addition to the actual one-component injection moulding, we also have twoand three component injection moulding plus insert moulding. Everything is carried out in modern production facilities. The technology area also handles all finishing treatment such as ultrasound welding, surface treatment and printing. Furthermore SP Moulding is handling part or full assembly, packaging and consignment for a large number of customers. In Karise (Denmark) and Zdunska Wola (Poland), the business unit SP Medical develops and manufactures injection mould medical devices and makes advanced coating solutions. SP Medical has been certified in accordance with ISO 9001, ISO 13485 and ISO 14001. In 2012 SP Moulding generated revenue of DKK 488.3 million.

See SP Moulding Annual Report 2012. SP Moulding A/S April 2013 Communication on Progress – 2012 Page 4 Working with CSR We established our SP Moulding CSR policy in 2012 in consistence with our corporate values. The CSR Policy is based on our compliance with all laws, regulations and standards as well as present practice within our business sector. In 2012 none of our sites have received administrative or judicial sanctions for failure to comply with laws, regulations and prevailing industry standards.2 This is our first CSR report and it is based on qualitative and quantitative data from our business units. All our sites in Denmark, Poland and China have delivered data in a systematic manner based on UN Global Compact principles and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators. As it is our first CSR report, we do not have historical data to document developments and changes over time. Our aim is to be able to document general progress in our CSR work in our next Communication on Progress report in 2014. Our CSR report is not verified by third-party. However, a comprehensive work with the collection and internal verification of information lies behind the report. Furthermore, all our sites are certified in accordance with a number of ISO standards by external certifying bodies. 2 GRI G3 SO-08. SP Moulding A/S April 2013 Communication on Progress – 2012 Page 5 HUMAN RIGHTS Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses Statement of continued support In 2012 we developed and adopted our SP Moulding CSR Policy. Here we state that we will support and respect the protection of international human rights. We also underline that we will strive to prevent any human rights violations. Without employees, our company is nothing. With regards to the human rights of our employees, we state in our CSR Policy that we will provide them with good employment and that we will follow applicable laws and collective agreements with regard to wages and other employment conditions. We also state that we will work to ensure development opportunities and a safe and healthy working environment. In 2012 and early 2013 we developed and adopted a SP Moulding Supplier Code of Conduct. In the Code of Conduct our suppliers and business partners are requested to support and respect the protection of international human rights and to remedy violations in case they are involved in such. Implementation We are in the process of distributing our CSR Policy to our employees and to publish it on our website to make it available to all interested stakeholders. In March 2013 we initiated a self-assessment screening process of our suppliers of tools based on a general risk assessment of these suppliers. Starting from UN Global Compact and Global Reporting Initiative, our most significant suppliers of tools have been asked to report on a number of indicators with regards to human rights, labour, environment and anticorruption. Our suppliers of materials do not participate in this screening, as they are large reputable international companies that already in a detailed manner publish their efforts in the area of CSR. We will report about the outcome of the supplier screening in our 2013 Communication on Progress report. Measurement of outcomes No incidents of involvement in human rights violations have been reported in 2012. SP Moulding A/S April 2013 Communication on Progress – 2012 Page 6 In 2012 our suppliers did not undergo a systematic screening on human rights. In SP Moulding (Juelsminde) in Denmark, 4 contracts included human rights criteria or screening.3 We have received no substantiated complaints concerning breaches of employee or customer privacy.4 Likewise we have received no administrative or judicial sanctions for failure to comply with laws and regulations concerning the provision and use of our products and services.5 With regard to our employees, in 2012 we have had an increase in the number of employees in our sites outside Denmark. The total number of employees in all our sites in 2012 was 615 employees.6 Employee turnover Poland7 Male Female Age < 30 3 4 age 30-40 2 8 age 40-50 1 1 age 50-60 0 0 age 60-70 0 0 age > 70 0 0 Total 6 13 Employee turnover China8 Male Female Age < 30 17 9 age 30-40 18 21 age 40-50 5 8 age 50-60 0 1 age 60-70 0 0 age > 70 0 0 Total 40 39 Employee turnover Denmark9 Male Female Age < 30 2 3 age 30-40 2 5 age 40-50 5 5 age 50-60 2 3 age 60-70 1 1 age > 70 0 0 Total 12 17 At our sites in Denmark, wages and salaries and working conditions are determined in collective agreements resulting from central and local 3 GRI G3 HR-02. 4 GRI G3 PR-08. 5 GRI G3 PR-09. 6 GRI G3 LA-01. 7 GRI G3 LA-02. 8 GRI G3 LA-02. 9 GRI G3 LA-02. SP Moulding A/S April 2013 Communication on Progress – 2012 Page 7 negotiations. In Poland and China (the smallest organizational entity), the conditions and rights of the employees are primarily stipulated by legislation, codes and regulation. In general, we follow national labour market regulations and make sure that the salary of our employees is fair and equal; that the workweek is limited to an absolute maximum of 48 hours; that overtime is infrequent and limited; and that employees are given reasonable breaks and rest periods. We also seek to offer our employees additional benefits. We work to ensure a safe and healthy working environment in all our sites.10 In Poland every autumn, we organize vaccination against influenza for interested employees. Lost working Hours11 Number of occupational injuries for employees 6 Lost working hours for employees because of occupational injuries 1,468 Fatalities of employees arising from an occupational injury 0 Lost working hours for employees because of sickness not due to occupational injuries 14,046 We take measures to improve health and safety at all our workplaces and we provide our employees with protective equipment, including safety shoes, safety glasses, safety gloves and work wear. We also provide our employees with necessary training to perform their tasks safely, including fire handling and first aid training.12 We seek to improve the qualifications of our employees through supplementary training and continuing education.13 Many of our employees receive regular performance and career development reviews.

SP Moulding A/S April 2013 Communication on Progress – 2012 Page 8 Case: LifeStraw® Community delivers clean drinking water LifeStraw® Community is a high-volume, pointof-use water purifier that provides reliable, safe drinking water for educational centres, communities and medical centres in the developing world. SP Moulding has been instrumental in developing this unique offering from Vestergaard-Frandsen, which filters out bacteria, viruses and protozoan parasites without the use of chemicals, electric power or batteries. SP Moulding is now focusing on scaling up this offering from Vestergaard-Frandsen. Approximately 43 % of the global population, especially the lowerincome population in the remote and rural parts of the developing world, is deprived of household safe piped water. LifeStraw® Products has the potential to provide access to safe drinking water and to promote the basic human rights to life and health in developing countries. SP Moulding A/S April 2013 Communication on Progress – 2012 Page 9 LABOUR Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Statement of continued support In our CSR Policy, we state that we recognize our employees' right to freedom of association and collective bargaining. We also state that we denounce forced labour and child labour, and that we will not discriminate in the workplace. In our Supplier Code of Conduct, our suppliers and business partners are requested to support and respect the protection of these international labour standards. Implementation We are in the process of distributing our CSR Policy to our employees and to publish it on our website to make it available to all interested stakeholders. As described under the Human Rights section, we are also in the process of screening our suppliers with regard to UN Global Compact including the principles of labour rights. SP Moulding is a member of the Confederation of Danish Industries (DI). In its capacity of employer’s association, DI is responsible for collective bargaining at the Danish level within our sector. Through our membership of DI and in our daily practice, we support the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining and many of our employees are members of labour unions. Measurement of outcomes We have not identified sites in Denmark, Poland or China in which the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining have been at significant risk.15 At the sites in Denmark, employees appoint representatives for joint consultation committees and working environment committees where they meet with local management. At the sites in Poland and China, systems have 15 GRI HR-05. SP Moulding A/S April 2013 Communication on Progress – 2012 Page 10 been established where the employees appoint spokesmen for negotiations with management.16 All our employees are provided with an employment contract and no claims of forced labour were reported in 2012.17 Likewise no claims of discrimination were reported in 2012 and we only had a minor case of workplace harassment in SP Moulding (Suzhou).18 As an international company, we respect differences in cultures and traditions and we value a diverse workforce.19 In general, we do not hire children or young workers below 18 years of age and no claims of child labour or forced labour were reported in 2012.20 We only have one business unit SP Moulding (Juelsminde) in Denmark – where we hire children above 13 years of age to help us with lighter work after school hours. In 2012, four children between 13 and 18 years of age worked for a maximum of 2 hours a day and we have special quality procedures for these children.21 Composition of governance bodies and employment categories22 Board, Management White collar Blue collar Total / executives employees employees Age < 30 0 54 100 154 age 30-40 3 63 144 210 age 40-50 3 62 57 122 age 50-60 6 52 52 110 age 60-70 2 5 10 17 age > 70 1 0 1 2 Total 15 236 364 615 Composition of governance bodies and employment categories23 Male Female Total Board, Management / executives 12 3 15 White collar employees 68 75 143 Blue collar employees 148 309 457 Total 228 387 615 16 GRI G3 HR-05. 17 GRI G3 HR-07. 18 GRI G3 HR-04. 19 GRI G3 LA-13. 20 GRI G3 HR-06 and HR-07. 21 GRI G3 HR-06. 22 GRI G3 LA-13 23 GRI G3 LA-13 SP Moulding A/S April 2013 Communication on Progress – 2012 Page 11 Case: Job training In 2011, SP Moulding Juelsminde in Denmark made an agreement with the local municipality of Hedensted to offer practical work experience to a woman with psychological problems. The woman had previously not been able to stay in a job for more than 2 weeks. The responsible team-leader in the production gradually introduced the woman to new and additional tasks. Today after 2 years, she works 6 hours a day and is happy and satisfied in her job. The local municipality has decided not to send her on for more practical experience training, and she now stays with SP Moulding in Juelsminde. SP Moulding A/S April 2013 Communication on Progress – 2012 Page 12 ENVIRONMENT Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Statement of continued support In our CSR Policy we state that we will work systematically to reduce our negative environmental impact and promote greater environmental responsibility through our certified environmental management systems. In general, plastic has a number of unique characteristics and if plastic is produced and used wisely, it has a positive impact on the environment. In our Supplier Code of Conduct our suppliers and business partners are requested to support and respect these principles of environmental responsibility. Implementation We have a management system implementing our environment policies and goals. We are certified to the ISO 9001 standard and to the ISO 14001 standard. Our management system includes key elements from ISO/TS 16949. We comply with all environmental directives, among these the RoHS Directive, REACH. We are in the process of distributing our CSR Policy to our employees and to publish it on our website to make it available to all interested stakeholders. As described under the Human Rights section, we are also in the process of screening our suppliers with regard to UN Global Compact including the principles regarding environment. Measurement of outcomes We have not received any administrative or judicial sanctions for failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations.24 In our site in Juelsminde in Denmark, we had a factory inspection by the local authority in beginning of December 2012. The inspector found that we had not been in compliance with a local regulation from 2007 regarding the sorting 24 GRI G3 EN-28. SP Moulding A/S April 2013 Communication on Progress – 2012 Page 13 and disposal of kitchen waste separated from industrial waste incineration. Our procedure for handling waste has been improved and implemented by the end of December 2012. We did not receive any fine or other sanctions.25 Energy: We try to buy green electricity. In our SP Moulding sites Juelsminde and Stoholm (Denmark) and in our SP Medical site in Karise (Denmark) our purchased electricity stems from:26 50% coal power plant 25% natural gas plant 25% wind power energy / water power energy / nuclear power We have done an active effort to save electricity by reducing our energy use and increasing our energy efficiency.27 Initiatives on our various sites include:  Automatic movement sensors in corridors,  Replacement of lighting with a new generation of fluorescent (electricity consumption is now one third of consumption before the replacement)  Lighting the designation of sectors (production floor divided into eight areas to be controlled individually)  Motion sensors in the locker rooms / kitchens / toilets  New windows in warehouse and production areas  Adjustment of cooling system by adding more effective ventilation system (60% warm air from cooling system is used to heat up 1728 m2 warehouse, which means that there is no need to use additional heaters in these areas)  Using LED lights instead of common light bulbs;  Setting up double-pane windows to insulate against noise and cold. We have reduced our indirect energy source by replacing some of our business-related travel with video conferences and telephone meetings.28 In China we encourage our employees to go to work by bus, metro or bicycle. Case: Poland, phone and video meetings “We assume that we have one phoneor video meeting per week, which has replaced business travels. We estimate that we have saved 2,000 km per 2 weeks on business travels. During the year of 2012, it amounts to 50,000 km. The car uses 7 l of fuel per 100 km. This means that we have saved 3500 l of fuel in 2012. We assume that 6 l of fuel gives 11 kWh, which means that we saved 6416.7 kWh in energy in 2012.” 25 GRI G3 EN-28. 26 GRI G3 EN-04. 27 GRI G3 EN-05. 28 GRI G3 EN-07.

Case: Biodegradable plastic material Danish Nature Urn® Danish Nature Urn® is proof that innovative and unorthodox thinking can result in very exciting solutions when it comes to developing new products. The urn is developed in cooperation with Nordmark Jacobsen ApS, where SP Moulding has produced a special, biodegradable plastic material: a plant-based material that degrades in less than 10 years buried in the ground. Production in Denmark ensures a minimal CO2 contribution, and Nature Urn® is thus a highly environmentally friendly product. 39 GRI G3 EN-26. SP Moulding A/S April 2013 Communication on Progress – 2012 Page 17 ANTI-CORRUPTION Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Statement of continued support In our CSR Policy we state that we do not participate in corruption or bribery and that we will not offer, promise or give any kind of bribes to improperly influence public officials, judges or business associates. We also state that we will refrain from receiving or accepting any bribes ourselves and that persons acting on our behalf are subject to the obligation not to participate in corruption or bribery. In our Supplier Code of Conduct our suppliers and business partners are requested to support and respect these anti-corruption principles. Implementation We are in the process of distributing our CSR Policy to our employees and to publish it on our website to make it available to interested stakeholders. As described under the Human Rights section, we are also in the process of screening our suppliers with regard to UN Global Compact including the principle of anti-corruption. We are in the process of planning adequate procedures against anticorruption as well as formal training sessions on anti-corruption for core employees. Measurement of outcomes Management makes very detailed controlling on all sites and any significant transactions are analysed by management. As part of the audit of the Group companies the auditors have considered the risk of bribery and the measures taken by management to reduce this risk.
