Source: Universum Graduate Survey Providing pure energy In a world with considerable challenge related to climate change, ­Statkraft’s core product is more valuable and sought after than ever. The need for clean energy has created significant opportunities for growth. ­Statkraft is in unique position to take part in this growth, and will develop renewable energy in a way that supports a positive societal development. Statkraft ANNUAL REPORT 2012 3 Competence and competitiveness enables growth ­ tatkraft is Europe’s largest producer of S Renewable energy is becoming increasingly cost-efficient. Hydropower is already competitive with the reasonable, but renewable energy. The last decade has seen carbon-intensive coal power. Offshore and onshore wind power, ­Statkraft grow internationally, and it is now biomass and solar power are also becoming increasingly costefficient. By 2025, several of the renewables technologies are a global group with activities in more than expected to have become able to compete with coal. And that 20 countries. This development is based on means competing without subsidies. In the coming years, climate challenges will make renewable energy resources that are unique in an interenergy even more important than oil and gas are today. ­Statkraft is currently the largest producer within renewable energy in national context and hydropower expertise Europe, and a leading player in the global market. that has been developed over generations. In actual size, however, ­Statkraft is a relatively small player compared with other international energy companies. If ­Statkraft In a world where the climate challenge is growing with the is to make its mark in international competition in the future, rapidly increasing population, the demand for renewable energy size and financial clout will be of great significance. will also continue to grow. ­Statkraft is uniquely positioned to play Norway’s resources and expertise give us a unique foundaan important role in addressing this growth. tion. ­Statkraft can and will play a leading role in the developWe are already seeing growth in S ­ tatkraft’s international ment of renewable energy in Europe. ­Statkraft can be the driving businesses, and the market prospects confirm S ­ tatkraft’s stratforce in the development of renewable energy.

At the same time, Norway is where we are laying the foundation for S ­ tatkraft’s international growth. ­Statkraft is now harnessing expertise developed over the hundred years that have passed since the first hydropower developments started. Within development, operations, and various market activities, ­Statkraft has become an organisation which can hold its own against international competition. This expertise must be nurtured and developed further in order to defend this position. It can neither be filed nor put in storage. It must be constantly used and challenged. When we compete in a challenging and exciting international market, our experience, technology and systems comprise our most important competitive edge. 2012 saw the breakthrough for wind power in Europe, where S ­ tatkraft really highlighted how the energy heritage can be applied in new areas. The opening of the Sheringham Shoal offshore wind farm off Norfolk in England by HRH Crown Prince Haakon confirmed S ­ tatkraft’s goal to develop the company in new renewables technologies, in new countries and markets. Sheringham Shoal is the world’s third largest offshore wind farm with the capacity to cover the electricity needs of 220 Christian Rynning-Tønnesen 000 British households. The wind farm is a cooperation project President and CEO, ­Statkraft between Statoil and S ­ tatkraft, which are also cooperating on the development of another two offshore wind power projects in the UK: Dudgeon and the giant Dogger Bank project. Wind farms are also under construction on dry land. In 2012, S ­ tatkraft started pre-engineering four new wind farms in Sweden and one in Scotland. 4 Statkraft ANNUAL REPORT 2012 ­Statkraft Group Management 1 5 Hilde Bakken Jon G.

Growth from hydropower For more than 100 years, ­Statkraft has developed and managed Norwegian hydropower resources to the benefit of Norwegian society. Our business has secured considerable profits for the Norwegian state and has established important knowledge and technology which is now used to generate growth in new markets. The Norwegian state purchase of Paulenfossen waterfall in ­Statkraft has broad experience from managing Norwegian 1895 signalled the start of an ambitious energy policy.

Waterfalls were replaced by pipes. Households received electricity. Farmers became industry workers. And when Norway was rebuilt following WWII, power developers were crucial in the development of prosperity. The power developments generated new technology, expertise and knowledge. When Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen opened the power station Tokke 1 in 1961, it was Europe’s largest power plant and an icon of the accomplishments of Norwegian engineering. Norwegian hydropower had created the basis for cornerstone factories in communities such as Rjukan, Notodden, Sauda and Høyanger. Not only had hydropower lifted Norway out of poverty, it had become a major industry. Half a century later, ­Statkraft and Norwegian hydropower have changed. From being a supplier of energy to an emerging industry, ­Statkraft is now Europe’s largest producer of renewable energy. Norwegian hydropower supplies Norwegian and foreign companies and households with green energy. Norwegian hydropower resources are becoming Europe’s green battery, securing a stable power supply in periods where other renewable energy sources produce less. At the same time, S ­ tatkraft is stepping up the development of hydropower resources in other parts of the world. Emerging economies are dependent upon more energy, but their consumption growth also threatens the global climate. To avoid disastrous climate-related destruction, as much as possible of the new energy must be renewable. This is why S ­ tatkraft is bringing Norwegian technology, expertise and competitiveness to the world, to contribute to giving more countries the chance to benefit from Norwegian prosperity development. Statkraft ANNUAL REPORT 2012 9 Cakit Hydropower Plant is one of three plants ­Statkraft is developing in Turkey. Together, the three plants have a combined installed capacity of 619 MW. International growth with pure energy Water is the blue thread running through ­Statkraft’s most important international journey. The subsidiary SN Power, giant Turkish development projects and hydropower from German rivers are all important contributors to international growth. 20 years have passed since ­Statkraft first started mapping of opportunities for hydropower abroad. The destinations were Laos and Nepal. The ambition was to apply Norwegian hydropower expertise internationally. 10 years later, in June 2002, SN Power was established as a subsidiary of ­Statkraft and state-owned Norfund. Today, S ­ tatkraft and SN Power work in parallel with hydropower developments all over the world. While ­Statkraft handles the giant development projects in Turkey and hydropower projects in Europe, SN Power handles investments in emerging economies in Asia, Latin America and Africa. ­Statkraft is already Europe’s largest producer of renewable energy. With our 100 years as a developer of Norwegian hydropower, we are in a league of our own internationally. Through SN Power, ­Statkraft has a profitable portfolio of 38 hydropower plants distributed over nine countries and three continents. This comes in addition to S ­ tatkraft’s own hydropower plants in countries such as Germany, Sweden and the UK. The largest ongoing project right now are the developments in Turkey, Europe’s largest emerging power market. Over the next ten years, the demand is expected to increase tenfold, and from 2015, ­Statkraft’s development of the Cakit, Kargi and Cetin plants will deliver a total of 2 TWh of clean hydropower per year. 20 years after the first reconnaissance expeditions, ­Statkraft has really become an international company.

With 88 turbines, the development is the third largest offshore wind farm in the world. Offshore power The Sheringham Shoal offshore wind farm not only supplies green energy to 220 000 British households, it also secures an important foothold for ­Statkraft in offshore wind power.

They are the Sheringham Doggerbank development awaits, a wind power project 30 times Shoal offshore wind farm, a wind power development combining the size of Sheringham Shoal. Statoil’s offshore expertise with ­Statkraft’s renewable energy ­Statkraft is already a major player in Norwegian onshore expertise. The result is the world’s third largest offshore wind wind power. By building offshore expertise, ­Statkraft is taking an farm – supplying green energy to an impressive 220 000 British important step to secure an important role in the international households. transition from fossil to renewable energy. And perhaps even Europe’s reorientation from fossil to renewable energy is more importantly, S ­ tatkraft is now learning valuable lessons taking place at breakneck speed.

In the autumn of 2012, ­Statkraft and Statoil announced another joint venture development off the coast of the UK, the Dudgeon Statkraft ANNUAL REPORT 2012 13 In July, the delivery of 26 wind turbines to ­Statkraft and SCA’s wind farm Stamåsen in the municipalities of Sollefteå and Strömsund in Sweden commenced. The turbines have a combined installed capacity of 60 MW. Wind power with the wind at its back In the forests of the Swedish region of Jämtland, more and more wind turbines reach for the wind. In partnership with Swedish forest owners, Statkraft is in the process of making Sweden’s largest industrial investment. Far above the tops of the firs, wind turbines are reaching greedily for wind. 190 tall wind turbines in five wind farms are under installation in the forested Swedish regions Jämtland and Västernorrland. In partnership with local forest owner SCA, ­Statkraft is realising one of Sweden’s largest ever industrial investments. While wind turbines are most often associated with open landscapes, coastal areas and rough weather conditions, the wind passing over the Swedish treetops is so strong that ­Statkraft chose Sweden as the venue for its largest onshore wind power investment ever. By joining forces with three industrial partners, S ­ tatkraft has the potential to generate four times more wind power than from the Smøla, Hitra and Kjøllefjord wind farms combined. If all the projects are realised, S ­ tatkraft’s portfolio will supply partners and 120 000 Swedish households with green electricity. 10 years after opening its first wind farm – on Smøla – wind power is becoming an increasingly important focus area for ­Statkraft, with activities in Norway, Sweden, England and ­Scotland. In addition, the subsidiary SN Power has started production at its first wind farm, in Brazil. Few energy sources are growing faster than wind. Wind power plays a key role in the European transition from fossil to renewable energy. However, European wind power is also an important driver for new growth in Europe, now stuck in the economic doldrums. By 2020, the number of jobs in the sector Stamåsen wind farm is one of seven planned wind farms in Jämtland and is expected to increase to 520 000 – which means that it has Västernorrland. tripled over the course of eight years. 2012 was the year when S ­ tatkraft really upped its investment in wind power, and lifted production of energy from wind up to become one of the company’s most important investment areas. In recent years, the costs of developing onshore wind power have halved, and we hope to make gold from green wind power in another few years. 14 Statkraft ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Statkraft ANNUAL REPORT 2012 15 Statkraft in facts and figures Statkraft in facts and figures shows that the group has delivered according to the strategy, and maintained a high production in the Nordic countries thanks to high reservoir levels and high inflow. 60 TWh represents a production record, despite lower market prices for electricity throughout the year.

INVESTMENTS IN 2012 Additions of property, plant and equipment in 2012 of NOK 6976 million and of intangible assets of NOK 174, consisted of both investments in increased capacity and maintenance investments. Maintenance investments amounted to NOK 1065 million (NOK 1129 million in 2011). These investments relate primarily to the segments Nordic hydropower and Industrial ownership (Skagerak Energi). Investments in increased capacity was NOK 6085 million (NOK 5217 million in 2011). The largest projects were the Norwegian hydropower plants Svartisen, Eiriksdal / Makkoren and Nedre Røssåga, power plant Knapsack II in Germany, hydropower plants in Turkey, Panama and Peru, land-based wind power in Sweden and the United Kingdom, district heating plants in Norway and Sweden, and small-scale hydropower in Norway.

Assets in the segment Continental energy and trading are impaired by NOK 1762 million related to gas power plants in Germany, (NOK 1087 million in 2011). High gas prices, low coal and CO2 prices that result in high coal production, high production of renewable energy and flat demand growth for power, are creating major challenges for European gas. Expectations of continued low margins for gas power plants in Germany have resulted in the impairment. Assets in the segment Industrial ownership are impaired by NOK 136 million. In essence, this is related to cost overruns in two development projects. Assets in the segment International hydropower, on a power plant in SN Power Group, have been impaired by NOK 78 million because of lower expected future cash flows.

A manageGroup’s ability and willingness to take risks, expertise, solidity and ment framework has also been established to limit the interest rate development plans. The purpose of the risk management is to identify exposure in currencies other than NOK. The currency positions that threats and opportunities for the Group, and to manage the risk are to be entered into are assessed on an ongoing basis, given the towards an acceptable level to provide reasonable surety for achieving market conditions observed for the currency and the overall exposure the Group’s objectives.

The GHG-protocol (from the World Business Council for Sustainabile Development and World Resources Institute) divides greenhouse gas emissions into three types. Type 1 emissions are direct emissions from own activitites. Type 2 emissions are indirect emissions from purchased electricity and district heating, while Type 3 emissions are other indirect emissions. All the emissions in the table above are Type 1, except for business travel, which falls under Type 3. The electricity consumption in Statkraft is guaranteed renewable, resulting in zero Type 2 emissions.

To succeed, the Group depends on skilled, satisfied employees and maintaining a continuous dialogue with all stakeholders to resolve conflicts and create win-win situations. This part of the annual report presents Statkraft’s work and performance in the area of corporate responsibility for 2012, describing challenges and activities within areas such as environment, health and safety, human rights, labour issues and business ethics. Corporate We channel our corporate responsibility efforts towards those areas responsibility where we have the greatest impact on our surroundings, where the risk of taking the wrong step is the greatest and the potential consequences in Statkraft are the most serious. Statkraft works systematically with corporate responsibility and the follow-up has been integrated in the Group’s management system. In 2012, Statkraft’s overall corporate responsibility policy was updated and the guidelines for all associated areas were revised. Corporate responsibility is an important factor in development projects and acquisitions. The company has developed a decision-making model for execution of major development projects, mergers and acquisitions, integrating important corporate responsibility issues. Statkraft’s basic ethical principles are described in Statkraft’s Code of conduct. The Code of conduct applies to all employees and companies in the Statkraft Group, and our business partners are expected to have standards in accordance with Statkraft’s Code of conduct. Statkraft has developed its own ethical guidelines directed at the Group’s suppliers. Health and safety Health and safety have the highest priority in Statkraft and all work is planned and executed with the goal of achieving zero injuries. Clear requirements and close follow-up in all operations and project phases are decisive for achieving safe and sound workplaces. In 2012, special focus was placed on traffic safety in international development projects, follow-up of contractors and investigative work to ensure efficient learning. Climate and the environment Statkraft applies international good practice as the basis for environmental work. We mainly produce renewable energy without emission of greenhouse gases and thereby help to prevent climate change. However, renewable power generation also affects the environment. We include environmental impact assessments in relevant business activities and work systematically to find sound and environmentally friendly solutions. Human rights Statkraft is active in parts of the world where human rights can be challenged, either directly through own operations or indirectly through the supply chain. Statkraft actively promotes respect for human rights in all parts of its business. Role in society As a power producer, we have a long-term perspective which makes it right and necessary to develop sustainable solutions. Success in this regard can best be achieved in open dialogue and interaction with everyone affected by the company’s activities. This is ensured through regular meetings with host municipalities, meetings with stakeholders in development projects and through active participation in national and international forums for energy and corporate responsibility issues. MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 138 Managing Follow-up and management of Statkraft’s corporate responsibility is an corporate integrated part of the Group’s management system, The Statkraft Way. Statkraft’s fundamental principles for acting in a sustainable, ethical and responsibility socially responsible manner are described in Statkraft’s Code of conduct. The Statkraft Way In 2012, Statkraft’s management system was renewed and presented in a new format, The Statkraft Way. The Statkraft Way is based on the Group’s vision, values, Code of conduct and business model and provides, through brieﬂy formulated policies and more supplementary procedures and supporting documents, an introduction to how Statkraft works. Corporate responsibility is a key topic in The Statkraft Way. Launch of The Statkraft Way Follow-up of corporate responsibility November 2012 Corporate responsibility is a line responsibility in Statkraft. This means that each individual business unit in Statkraft has an independent responsibility to conduct the business activities in a responsible manner and that follow-up of topics such as health Always refer to the intranet for updated documents and safety, corruption, human rights and environmental impact are incorporated in relevant processes in all business units. In addition Statkraft has a central staff to follow up the Group’s work and performance as regards corporate responsibility. The staff has an advisory role vis-à-vis the business units and will ensure that corporate responsibility is properly discharged in the Group’s management and reporting system. Code of conduct and guidelines Statkraft will operate in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in all countries where we have activities and adhere to internationally recognised standards and guidelines. We focus our work towards creating a work culture in accordance with our principles and which promotes good business practice. Statkraft’s basic ethical principles are described in Statkraft’s Code of conduct, which sets requirements for both our own employees and our business partners. The Code emphasises our basic commitment to act in a sustainable, ethical and socially responsible manner – and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations – wherever we have activities. In 2012, Statkraft’s overall policy for Corporate Responsibility & HSE was updated and the guidelines for all areas associated with corporate responsibility were revised. More detailed descriptions of how Statkraft’s corporate responsibility will be safeguarded throughout the value chain can be found in the specification and support documents for the different areas, including for business ethics, environment and health and safety. π Statkraft’s Code of conduct π Group policy: Corporate responsibility and HSE π Group policy: People, leadership and communication Statkraft is a member of the UN’s Global Compact and is committed to following up this initiative and its ten principles. Furthermore, Statkraft takes guidance from globally supported initiatives and standards, including principles from OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and IFC’s Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability. OECD’s guidelines present recommendations from governments to multinational companies in relation to responsible business conduct, while IFC’s standards provide guidelines for sustainable behaviour throughout the value chain. MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 139 Corporate responsibility in the decision-making process Statkraft has implemented a decision-making model for execution of major development projects, ensuring a uniform project approach from the planning phase forward. The model’s basic principle is that each main decision must be accompanied by structured and documented information on a number of topics, including corporate responsibility, as part of the basis for decisions. Environment and health and safety management system The Group’s environmental management system has been designed in accordance with ISO 14001:2004, and most of the Group’s activities in Norway and Sweden have also been certified under this standard. Statkraft has prepared Group-wide requirements and guidelines for environmental management, covering mapping of environmental impact and risk, mapping of expertise and expertise needs, as well as establishment of goals and action plans. Statkraft has a group-wide management system for health and safety based on OHSAS 18001. Common requirements and guidelines are prepared for a number of areas, for example as regards reporting and investigation of incidents, handling of specific work operations and emergency preparedness plans. Emergency preparedness Emergency preparedness plans have been prepared for all operating units in the Group and regular emergency drills are held to ensure efficient handling of serious situations. The emergency response plans focus particularly on health and safety, environmental impact and security for people and assets. Performance follow-up KPIs have been established on the Group’s score card, reflecting operational performance for all business units in the areas environment and health and safety. The corporate audit considers various aspects of how the Group’s corporate responsibility is discharged, both in focused audits and as part of broader topics. In 2012, no serious non-compliances were registered in connection with corporate responsibility. Statkraft has established a Group-wide solution for registration and structured follow-up of non-compliances and potential improvements. The system facilitates proposing and implementing corrective measures in accordance with an established schedule. Competence development Sound and proper competence on corporate responsibility issues among managers and employees is an important factor for Statkraft to perform well in this area. Relevant corporate responsibility topics have therefore been incorporated in training programmes for both new employees and managers. Projects place a special emphasis on health and safety training. Statkraft offers several types of web-based courses that are available, and to some extent also mandatory, for both employees and contractors. In order to raise expertise and understanding of anti-corruption work, Statkraft has developed an e-learning programme and handbook on the topic. MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 140 Supplier follow-up Statkraft’s guidelines for suppliers contain clear requirements relating to business ethics, environment and health and safety. Statkraft’s Supplier Code of conduct Statkraft has developed a version of Statkraft’s Code of conduct which is especially aimed at Group’s suppliers. This document describes the Group’s requirements for suppliers as regards protection of the environment, human rights, labour rights and labour standards, health and safety and anti-corruption. Statkraft’s suppliers are informed of our Code of conduct and other relevant requirements during the procurement processes and contract signing. Follow-up of suppliers A comprehensive systematic approach will ensure that the correct requirements are applied to Statkraft’s suppliers in all phases of the procurement process, from pre-qualification to follow-up and supervision. Particularly important and vulnerable deliveries are subject to more rigorous follow-up through several supplier links in the form of company visits and unannounced inspections. Statkraft has decided to implement a risk-based analysis tool in order to attempt to achieve further follow-up of corporate responsibility in the procurement process and among the Group’s suppliers. Stakeholder dialogue Statkraft communicates in an open and active manner with stakeholders affected by our activities. Important partners in this dialogue include the owner, elected officials on all levels, employees, customers, suppliers, local and regional authorities, voluntary organisations and the media. In 2012, we were working in particular to further develop the cooperation with host municipalities in Norway and to develop a positive dialogue with young Norwegian politicians. Meetings with local communities and host municipalities Statkraft emphasises direct and predictable dialogue with all host municipalities, and this was a special focus area in Norway in 2012. When meeting with host municipalities, Statkraft provides information about ongoing and coming activities, opening up for discussion about topics important for the individual municipality. Information and transparency are particularly important in connection with development projects. In line with the licensing process, open meetings and hearings are held, providing information about development plans and topics interesting for those affected by the project, for example expropriation, employment opportunities and environmental impact. Input from young politicians In order to create an arena for mutual exchange of information and dialogue, Statkraft invited political youth organisations and the environmental organisation Nature and Youth to participate in the Ungt Energiutvalg 2012. Through lectures, debates and power plant tours, the group was introduced to several energy policy dilemmas. The energy committee was also given the opportunity to formulate and present input for Statkraft’s further strategy. The main feedback from the participants was that Statkraft should invest more in new, immature renewable energy technologies and terminate the Ungt Energiutvalg 2012 visits a Statkraft facility. development of gas power. Dialogue with policymakers Maintaining a dialogue with policymakers is important for highlighting the challenges and influencing the framework conditions that guide further development. Statkraft actively participates in several national and international forums for the purpose of discussing and influencing energy policy. These forums include Energy Norway, Eurelectric, Word Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the International Hydropower Association (IHA). MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 141 Statkraft’s corporate Statkraft annually reports the most important challenges, measures and responsibility reporting performances pertaining to corporate responsibility. The objective is for the reporting to provide a correct and balanced picture of the Group’s activities and achieved performance. Based on GRI’s recommendations Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting is based on the recommendations from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for reporting of corporate responsibility and sustainability issues. GRI also presents ten reporting principles. These mainly describe methods for identifying significant topics and provide guidelines for how to carry out the reporting. Statkraft has established a systematic process to obtain information about and report on various corporate responsibility topics. In this connection, several qualitative and quantitative indicators have been identified, and all relevant business units report their performance in relation to these indicators. These indicators are intended to capture the most important aspects as regards corporate responsibility in the Group, and also take into account reporting requirements and expectations from our stakeholders. Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting describes the most important topics and performance on the Group level. More information can be found on Statkraft’s website. Verification of corporate responsibility information Statkraft’s external auditor verifies the Group’s corporate social responsibility reporting, including the management systems and processes that form the basis for the reporting. The auditor’s work is based on the ISAE 3000 assurance standard, and the conclusion for the work is set out in the auditor’s statement. In addition, a summary report is prepared, reviewing strengths and weaknesses in Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting.

Source: Universum Graduate Survey ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 143 Environmental Statkraft offers renewable and sustainable energy solutions, from impact financial, social and environmental perspectives. This is in itself an important contribution to meeting one of the greatest environmental challenges of our time: global warming. At the same time, all power generation, even renewable power generation, is associated with different forms of interventions in nature. Renewable and Statkraft has a good basis for sustainable power production with a sustainable energy portfolio consisting of mainly hydropower and wind power. Statkraft is Europe’s largest producer of renewable energy, and in 2012, about 97% of solutions the company’s power production was based on renewable energy sources. Statkraft’s environmental ambition In 2012, Statkraft updated its environmental ambition. The ambition states that Statkraft will support a global transition towards a low-carbon economy through offering renewable and sustainable energy solutions. Furthermore, all activities will be planned and executed in a manner which contributes to strengthening and implementing good international practice. Statkraft’s environment-friendly portfolio Power generation and district heating (Statkraft’s share) In 2012, 97.2% of Statkraft’s production was based on renewable energy sources, TWh and more than 94%, or 57.6 TWh, came from hydropower. This technology has many 70 60 advantages, including high efficiency, long lifetime and high flexibility. The large, 50 Norwegian water reservoirs enable us to produce electricity even when there is little 40 30 inflow. This flexibility is particularly important when combining regulative and non20 regulative technologies, for example hydropower and wind power. 10 0 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 ■Hydropower ■Wind power ■Gas power ■District heating Development and operation of hydropower plants facilitate multiple uses of watercourses and regulation plants, in e.g. areas such as irrigation, water supply, transport and recreation. In addition, flood control using reservoirs is an important safety measure in many areas. Wind power is a renewable technology with few environmental effects and almost no emissions. The tendency is towards larger turbines, higher towers and fewer turbines in each wind farm. This is considered to be a positive development as regards environmental effects. Gas power has substantially lower emissions than coal and is considered to be a transitional technology in anticipation of the 100 % renewable society. The Group’s non-renewable power production, 2.8% in 2012, includes gas power and some of the district heating production. Statkraft’s gas power plants in Germany operate only as peak load producers and, like hydropower, therefore contribute to flexibility in the European energy markets. Due to high gas prices, low carbon prices and growth in Development of new power and district heating, Statkraft’s share (Investment decisions had been made as of 31 Dec. 2012) inflexible power production (solar and wind power), Statkraft’s production of gas power MW 1000 910 was significantly lower in 2012 than in previous years. 900 800 700 600 Statkraft has several ongoing development projects, and as of 31 December 2012, 500 430 400 300 361 investment decisions have been made for the development of another 1792 MW of 200 100 91 installed capacity. About 50% of this capacity is hydropower, and almost 90% of the total 0 Hydropower Wind power Gas power District heating development capacity will be built outside Norway. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 144 Environmental Statkraft’s core business areas are hydropower and wind power. Neither of challenges these technologies generates significant emissions or discharges, but both cause interventions in ecosystems and the landscape. Making these interventions as minimal as possible and adapting them to local conditions minimises impact on natural diversity and facilitates multiple uses of the affected areas. Hydropower and the environment Rivers and river systems fill important functions, both as elements of the landscape and as ecosystems. Watercourses play an important role in both droughts and floods, and also have a multiple-use value for people in the form of recreation, transport and as water supply to households, industry and agriculture. The development and operation of hydropower plants must therefore take into account many interests. Statkraft is working continuously to achieve sustainable water management. This takes place through continuous follow-up of authority requirements as well as certain improvement measures beyond these requirements, including facilitation of fish spawning areas and improved access to river systems as regards outdoor life. The EU’s Water Framework Directive is a set of regulations developed to ensure comprehensive management of European water resources based on the ecosystems. Statkraft is working closely with the authorities to implement the Water Directive and to find sound environmental solutions in the river systems where we have activities. In order to ensure sustainable water management in international hydropower projects, Statkraft’s planning, execution and operation adhere to good international practice. The International Finance Corporation’s standards for sustainable project development and the International Hydropower Association’s protocol for evaluation of sustainability in hydropower projects are good tools in this respect. Wind power and the environment Both onshore and offshore, Statkraft’s wind power developments are facing environmental challenges. Birds are a recurring topic, both due to the risk of birds colliding with the turbines, and because wind farms can drive certain bird species away from their natural habitats or form barriers to important migration routes. The general effect of wind power on bird populations is, however, considered to be a relatively small problem. This emerged from the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change’s (IPCC) assessment of the environmental effects of wind power (presented in 2011). Establishing the infrastructure for a wind farm can influence living conditions for plants and land animals, particularly in the construction phase. Statkraft seeks to take this into account through locally adapted solutions and mitigating measures, and by avoiding construction activities during particularly vulnerable periods. Noise and landscape aesthetics are also topics that are very carefully considered when establishing new wind farms. Offshore, the impact on the marine environment is a particularly challenging topic, not least as there is currently little knowledge about the consequences for sea mammals, fish and benthic fauna. There are a lot of indications that negative effects are mainly temporary and limited to the construction phase, and that offshore wind farms may also benefit the environment in the longer term. A wind farm resting on the seabed can e.g. provide shelter and create good growth areas for fish and other organisms.In connection with the development of Sheringham Shoal and the planning of the Dogger Bank development, Statkraft has spent considerable resources on monitoring programmes, studies and investigations of all types of environmental impact in order to acquire new insight and expertise. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 145 Environmental challenges facing other technologies Statkraft is also involved in activities using other technologies, primarily production of gas power (Germany), production of biopower (Germany), production of district heating (Norway and Sweden), grid distribution (Norway) and some gas distribution (Norway through Skagerak Energi). Gas power results in CO2 and NOx emissions, and discharge of cooling water. CO2 is a greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming, while NOx is associated with overfertilisation. Discharge of cooling water can impact biodiversity in nearby river systems. The operation of district heating plants and biopower plants generates NOx emissions, and district heating plants also emit SOx, which can contribute to acidification of river systems. The emission volumes vary with the source of energy used. District heating plants which use waste as a raw material also generate residual production and can also face challenges relating to noise and smell. Environmental challenges in connection with grid activities are primarily related to radiation from power lines and landscape impact, which in turn can change visual qualities and the opportunities for recreational activities in the area. As regards gas distribution, the risk lies primarily in gas leakages. This distribution is subject to detailed guidelines and controls covering environmental, health and safety risks. Climate impact Climate change and global warming is one of the greatest challenges of our time, and IPCC points to increased use of renewable energy as perhaps the single most important measure to combat climate change. Statkraft offers renewable and sustainable energy solutions and in this manner supports a global transition to a low-carbon economy. The Group’s own emissions of greenhouse gases are mainly from our gas power plants. Climate Advisory Panel Climate change is widely accepted as real and the majority of scientific environments agree that observed changes can only be explained as the interaction of anthropogenic and natural factors. This is an important conclusion in IPCC Assessment Report Four (2007), and scientific work from recent years supports this conclusion. Statkraft’s activities have a very long perspective and climate change will influence both operations and business opportunities significantly, e.g. through influencing energy sources (precipitation, run-off and wind) and through changes in the political framework. In order to meet the challenges caused by climate change, Statkraft established the Climate Advisory Panel (CAP) in 2012. CAP is a cross-disciplinary group aiming to ensure a consistent understanding of climate change and how it may influence Statkraft’s activities. The group’s work will include evaluation of global emission scenarios, which will then be applied as a basis for Statkraft’s planning and operations. The Group will also investigate how global climate models can be broken down by region and local geographic area, and influence both hydropower and wind power production. In this work, IPCC’s review of the scientific basis plays a key role. In some locations, climate change will result in more water, in other locations less. Statkraft contributes to dampening the effects of climate change by using its own installations, where possible and practical, for e.g. flood control. In dry countries, the installations can be used for irrigation and water supply. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 146 Greenhouse gas emissions Most of Statkraft’s portfolio is more or less emission-free hydropower and wind power production, and our emissions of greenhouse gases are therefore relatively low. In 2012, the Group’s total emissions of greenhouse gases amounted to 0.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents, corresponding to a relative emission of CO2 equivalents of 11 kg/MWh. The emissions of greenhouse gases directly related to Statkraft’s production of power have been reduced by more than 70% since 2010 due to significantly lower gas power production in Germany. In 2012, about 82% of the Group’s emissions of CO2 equivalents came from the German Greenhouse gas emissions gas power plants Knapsack, Emden and Robert Frank. CO2 emissions from district heating Tonnes CO2 equivalents amounted to about 16% and came from the non-renewable share of waste and some oil. 2 000 000 1 500 000 The Group buys ordinary carbon quotas in the international carbon quota market to 1 000 000 compensate for greenhouse gas emissions from that part of the business that is not 500 000 subject to mandatory quota schemes. This applies to fuel consumption, business travel 0 and any accidental emissions of the greenhouse gases halon and SF6. In 2012, the 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 ■Gas power ■District heating plants ■Accidental emissions of SF6 and halon emissions from these sources amounted to 13 500 tonnes of CO2 equivalents. ■Fuel consumption ■Business travel Emission quota and green energy trading Statkraft is engaged in trading with all types of carbon certificates permitted under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). We trade in EUAs (European Union Allowances), CERs (Certified Emission Reductions) and ERUs (Emission Reduction Units). Furthermore, we participate in projects under the Kyoto Protocol’s CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) and JI (Joint Implementation), and buy emission permits directly from such projects. One of our core activities relating to emissions trading is designing products to help our counterparties comply with their CO2 obligations. Other environmental products traded are guarantees of origin, which are certificates that that guarantee the source from which a given amount of power has been produced. Concern for the Statkraft’s activities are based on international good practice for environment and environmental management. Concern for the environment shall characterise all activities in the Group, and the overall objective is to avoid biodiversity negative environmental effects. We continuously implement measures in order to limit our ecological footprint and maintain a special focus on red-listed species and prioritised nature types. Concern for the environment and environmental management Concern for the environment shall characterise all activities in Statkraft, and potential environmental impact must be identified and evaluated for all activities. The paramount objective is to avoid negative environmental effects. Where this is not possible, mitigating and compensatory measures to reduce negative environmental effects as much as possible are implemented. Environmental management is an integrated part of Statkraft’s management system and covers all business units and activities. The environmental management system will ensure a systematic and goal-oriented approach to environmental work, with key elements being identifying environmental risk, establishing goals and action plans, implementing measures, securing necessary expertise and registration, follow-up and improvement. The Group’s development projects are planned and implemented in line with good international practice. This entails impact analyses as regards environmental impact and follow-up of environmental aspects throughout the project process. Statkraft’s contractors are also subject to the Group’s environmental requirements, and these are therefore incorporated in all contracts where relevant. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 147 Assessment of environmental performance Environmental performance rating: As a basis for our continuous improvement work, a decision was made in 2012 to use an environmental rating provided by an external rating agency, oekom research AG, as an environmental KPI on the Group’s score card. The annual assessment is based on a broad set of criteria covering environmental management, power production and energy efficiency, and provides an understanding of how the world around us rates our efforts and which areas to prioritise as regards improvement measures. This method also makes it possible to compare Statkraft to other power companies. The 2012 assessment resulted in the rating prime/B-, which corresponds to good international practice in the oekom Corporate Rating. In 2013, we will use the rating and the underlying information in our further improvement work. Hydropower and sustainability: In 2010, the International Hydropower Association (IHA) launched a new version of its evaluation tool IHA Sustainability Assessment Protocol. The protocol has been developed through a broad cooperative effort involving several voluntary organisations, companies (including Statkraft), banks and national and international institutions. The protocol is a tool used to evaluate sustainability both in hydropower projects and hydropower plants in operation. In 2012, Statkraft participated in a comprehensive international collaboration where the IHA protocol was tested on different types of hydropower plants and projects. As an IHA Sustainability Partner, we carried out a test of the protocol at the Jostedal power plant. The experiences and results so far show that the protocol can be a good aid, contributing to sustainable development and operation of hydropower. Testing will continue in 2013. ISO 14001: Statkraft’s environmental management system has been designed in accordance with ISO 14001:2004, and most of the Group’s activities in Norway and Sweden have been certified under this standard. The Group will be recertified in 2013. Impact on biodiversity Statkraft’s core activities cause interventions in nature and impact natural diversity as a result. We strive to make the interventions as minimal as possible in order to maintain biodiversity. Statkraft has developed a method of mapping the activities’ impact on biodiversity in Norwegian water regulation areas. This mapping method aims to identify potential ecological conflicts. The data basis is obtained from public databases and covers protected areas, species and nature types. The method is still undergoing testing and will over time provide us with a better basis for evaluating how the operation of plants can be adapted to such conflicts. Fish: Statkraft’s environmental activities relating to river systems and fish are extensive and include environmentally adapted operation of the power plants, laying down suitable spawning and smolt growth substrate, fish restocking, egg planting, construction of fish ladders and improvement of thresholds and migration barriers. The overall objective for this work is to achieve sustainable and self-recruiting fish populations. Many of these measures are imposed by licence, but Statkraft also implements voluntary measures, often in close cooperation with landowners and local organisations. Statkraft operates nine fish cultivation facilities and is a large producer of stocking fish and fish eggs in Norway and Sweden. We are also carrying out extensive studies of affected river systems and operate two of the three Norwegian gene banks for salmon. In recent years, there has also been a focus on securing the population of eel, which is vulnerable to turbine injuries when migrating from regulated rivers. In Sweden, eel are now moved downstream of power plants, while in Germany a system has been developed to control turbines and stop them when the eel migrate. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 148 In Norway, the licence terms for many power plants are now under revision, aiming to update the environmental terms to current standards. In 2012, Suldalslågen river, a national salmon river system, was given new river management regulations following comprehensive research and study efforts. Birds: For a number of years, Statkraft has carried out R&D activities at the Smøla wind farm to look into how white-tailed eagles and the local variety of willow ptarmigan are affected and what can be done to avoid collisions between birds and turbines. Population studies of white-tailed eagles in the Smøla area indicate that most of the pairs which previously bred in the wind farm area have now found new territories away from the wind farm, and that the white-tailed eagle population is stable. Various types of measures to reduce collisions are currently being tested in the wind farm. Experience from the research work on Smøla is being used actively in the planning of new wind farms. Wild reindeer: Statkraft is participating in several research projects in order to safeguard wild reindeer, which is one of the species Norway has a special responsibility for, as several of Statkraft’s power plants are located in Norwegian wild reindeer habitats. The overall objective of the projects is to safeguard the wild reindeer’s habitat and strengthen the knowledge basis for sound wild reindeer management. Statkraft focuses in particular on how physical interventions in the landscape, traffic and other activities affect the reindeer’s use of the areas, and which measures have the greatest effect. Nature types and vegetation: Partly as a result of the Nature Diversity Act, the focus on preservation of vegetation and nature types has been strengthened. Coastal moors is an example of a so-called priority nature type requiring special consideration, for example when establishing wind farms near the coast. Waterfall spray zones can be the existential basis for some plants, lichen and moss. In the same way that concern is shown for particularly vulnerable species and their habitats, it is important that foreign species are not spread into areas where they may displace naturally occurring species. In interventions in the landscape, natural revegetation is therefore an increasingly preferred method of repairing wounds in the landscape. Consumption, Statkraft’s activities do not cause waste production, emissions or emissions and waste discharges to any significant degree. Most of the energy use is in connection with electric boilers in district heating plants and pumpedstorage hydropower. Data for the Group’s energy consumption, emissions and discharges, waste volumes and environmental incidents can be found in the corporate responsibility statement. Energy consumption In 2012, electricity consumption in Statkraft was 2054 GWh, of which 92% was used in electric boilers in district heating plants and for pumped-storage hydropower. Electricity use in the Group is certified as renewable in accordance with RECS. A major energy efficiency project was initiated at Statkraft’s Norwegian hydropower plants in 2010. The purpose of the project is to reduce internal energy consumption, and this will primarily be achieved through installation of management systems for pumps, ventilation, heating and light. The project has been implemented in several power plant groups, and the work will be continued in 2013. Local pollution Statkraft faces only limited challenges as regards local pollution. The largest environmental risk is associated with oil spills from vehicles, construction equipment and production equipment, but such spills are only in exceptional circumstances of a nature which significantly affects the local environment. There were no such events in 2012. There are also local challenges with noise, dust and smell in connection with operation of plants, transport and construction. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 149 Statkraft’s new gas power plant in Germany, Knapsack II, is being built in an area previously polluted by chemical industry. In connection with the development, a rehabilitation programme for polluted ground has been established in cooperation with the authorities and other expertise. The programme will address environmental, health and safety risks. In Norway, the work of mapping and cleaning up polluted (heavy metals, PAH) blasting sand in connection with the company’s pipe routes has been continued. Waste handling The Group aims to separate as much as possible of its waste at source. All hazardous waste is processed in accordance with applicable regulations. The operations generated about 78 800 tonnes of hazardous waste in 2012. More than 99 per cent came from the Group’s biomass plant in Germany and the district heating plant in Trondheim. In addition, 8200 tonnes of other waste was generated. Environmental incidents Environmental incidents are recorded and followed up systematically throughout the Group and are reported regularly to the Group’s management and board of directors. No serious environmental incidents have been recorded since 2008, but 128 minor environmental incidents with little or no impact on the environment were reported in 2012. Most of the environmental incidents were short-term breaches of the river regulation provisions, minor oil spills and non-conformities in connection with waste management. All incidents that deviate from given permits, licences or legislative requirements are reported to the applicable authority. HEALTH AND SAFETY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 150 Health As an employer, Statkraft shall ensure safe operation and project and safety activities, protecting people, society, the environment and the company’s assets. In Statkraft, no activity is important enough to be conducted with hazard to life and health. Setting clear requirements and close follow-up create a safety culture that is crucial to achieving good results. Health and safety Statkraft works systematically to achieve a working environment that work in Statkraft promotes health and where no-one is injured. In 2012, there has been a special focus on investigation and learning from serious incidents, improved safety assessment requirements as a basis for strategic decision processes and better traffic safety in international development projects. Statkraft’s safety culture Statkraft strives towards a safety culture based on transparency and a desire to learn from our own mistakes. All accidents, near-misses and hazardous conditions are therefore recorded and followed up in a consistent manner, and sharing of experiences across the organisation is encouraged. A fundamental approach is to identify health and safety hazards and assess risks before starting any activity. The number of recorded near-misses and unsafe conditions in the Statkraft Group has increased steadily in both operations and projects in recent years (a total of 8602 recorded, undesirable conditions in 2012). This is an indication of a greater transparency as regards health and safety issues, but also signals a need to achieve further improvement as regards health and safety work. Statkraft’s health and safety management system is based on OHSAS 18001. Health and safety competence Sound expertise within health and safety adapted to individual work situations is crucial if Statkraft is to move towards the zero injuries objective. Information and training in connection with health and safety are therefore given in several ways: ππ Health and safety is included as a regular topic in the introduction programme for new employees and all management programmes in the Group. ππ An online basic course in health and safety is available to all employees. ππ There is also an online health and safety course focusing on operational activities. The course is mandatory for all employees and contractors in Statkraft’s operations unit who work at the company’s plants. In 2012, this programme was completed by 1200 employees and 3600 contractors. The course is also available to employees and contractors in other parts of our activities, both nationally and internationally. ππ Within our Norwegian activities, all safety delegates and members of the working environment committees (AMU) complete a 40-hour health and safety course. Health and safety in projects Health and safety is integrated in Statkraft’s project management tools and is safeguarded in all project phases through stipulated requirements and procedures. Assessment of health and safety elements features as part of the supporting documentation in all main decisions. Investigations and audits show that satisfactory specification documents as regards health and safety are in place in most projects, but that they are not always fully implemented in the daily work. In 2013, the evaluation and follow-up of contractors in relation to safety work and performance will therefore be a priority. Statkraft offers a special training programme for project managers. This programme has a separate module on health and safety, which was both expanded and updated in 2012. A special health and safety manual will also be prepared. HEALTH AND SAFETY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 151 Investigation of serious incidents Statkraft carries out internal, independent investigations of all incidents with, or with the potential for, serious consequences. These investigations are summarised in an investigation report describing the course of events, causes and corrective measures. The investigation report with associated improvement measures will then be followed up by the individual business unit, and by Statkraft’s board and the board of the relevant subsidiary. A brief summary of each investigation report is also made available throughout the entire organisation in order to learn from serious incidents. In addition, internal, but not necessarily equally independent, investigations are also conducted for less serious incidents. In 2012, the focus on raising expertise in accident investigation has been maintained to ensure that investigations are carried out in a structured and uniform manner. It has also been a priority to further facilitate learning from serious incidents as well as transfer of experience across the organisation and countries. Absence due to illness Absence due to illness in Statkraft was 3.1% in 2012, below the target of 3.5%. All Norwegian companies in the Group have entered into Inclusive workplace (IA) agreements, which include active follow-up of absence and close cooperation with the company health service. Accidents Four fatal accidents were recorded in connection with the Group’s activities in 2012, of which two were work-related. Two contractors lost their lives during work on the Cheves development project in Peru, one person drowned in the intake channel of the La Oroya plant in Peru and one person died in a car accident in connection with the Çetin development project in Turkey. In total, 138 lost-time injuries and 239 injuries overall were recorded among the Group’s employees and contractors in 2012. This gives an injury frequency (TRI) of 7.1 for the Group’s employees and 6.3 for the Group’s contractors. Fatalities Fatal accidents Number There were four fatal accidents in connection with Statkraft’s activities in 2012, two of 10 9 which were work-related. The work-related fatal accidents took place in the Cheves 8 7 development project in Peru, which is wholly owned by SN Power. Statkraft owns 60% of 6 5 SN Power. In addition, there were two fatal accidents involving third parties who were in 4 3 or near the Group’s plants. 2 1 0 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 ■Contractors, subsidiaries ■Contractors, associates The first fatal accident occurred in July when a contractor died after being hit by rocks ■Third parties, subsidiaries ■Third parties, associates ■Employees, associates during tunnel work. The second fatal accident occurred in October when a contractor was electrocuted. This accident also took place in connection with tunnel work. The two fatal accidents involving third parties occurred in connection with SN Power’s wholly-owned La Oroya plant in Peru, and in the Çetin development project in Turkey, which is wholly owned by Statkraft. In Peru, one person was found drowned in the plant’s intake channel, while there was a fatal car accident on a construction road in Turkey, where a driver not affiliated with the project died. In addition to police investigation, Statkraft carried out internal and independent investigations immediately following the incidents. The investigation reports with associated improvement measures were then presented and followed up by both Statkraft’s board and the board of the respective subsidiary. At the end of 2012, several seminars were also held, focusing on transfer of experience from serious incidents. Generally, the investigation reports show that satisfactory guidelines form part of the specification documentation in almost all projects, but that the implementation rate HEALTH AND SAFETY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 152 varies between contractors. Measures to strengthen Statkraft’s follow-up of contractors will therefore be given special priority going forward. Statistics from recent years show that many of the fatal accidents occur in connection with work in relation to roads and transport. As a result, traffic safety campaigns have been carried out in both Statkraft and SN Power in order to reduce the number of traffic accidents. Great emphasis is placed in all projects on achieving a sound safety culture, and courses and other activities are held to stimulate good understanding and expertise as regards safety issues among employees, contractors and sub-contractors. Total recordable injuries for employees and contractors Injuries Number per million hours The LTI indicator (number of lost-time injuries per million working hours) was 4.1 18 16 (4.5 in 2011) among Group employees, while H1 among the Group’s contractors 14 12 was 3.6 (3.4 in 2011). 10 8 6 4 Correspondingly, the TRI indicator (number of injuries per million working hours) among 2 0 Group employees was 7.1 (10.0 in 2011) and 6.3 among contractors (6.2 in 2011). In total, 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 ■LTI employees ■TRI employees ■LTI contractors ■TRI contractors 239 injuries (280 in 2011) were recorded, of which 138 (141 in 2011) were lost-time injuries, among the Group’s employees and contractors. The development as regards injury frequency is still heading in the right direction for employees, while the injury frequency for contractors shows a marginal increase from 2011 to 2012. In 2012, 34 serious injuries and injuries with a serious injury potential were recorded. This type of injury is subject to close follow-up as regards preventive measures and learning. Beyond the two fatal accidents in La Oroya (Peru) and Cetin (Turkey), no serious injuries were recorded for third parties in 2012. Unsafe conditions and near-misses Statkraft aims for systematic registration and follow-up of unsafe conditions and near-misses in order to promote transparency and safety learning. In 2012, 8239 (6125 in 2011) unsafe conditions and 363 (365 in 2011) near-misses were recorded. 74% of the incidents took place in project activities. Security Statkraft has prepared emergency preparedness plans for all operative units in order to be as well prepared as possible for a crisis. The security situation is evaluated regularly in all areas where Statkraft has personnel and activities. Emergency preparedness All business units, country offices and operative units in Statkraft have established emergency preparedness plans in order to handle different emergencies in a structured and systematic manner. In addition, an overall Group emergency preparedness plan has been established to safeguard notification, interaction, information sharing and communication in the event of a crisis. The emergency preparedness plans are regularly revised and verified, and regular drills are held on small and large scales. In 2012, a full-scale drill was held involving the corporate management, the line organisations and personnel in three countries. The experiences from both this and other drills are now being incorporated in the individual emergency preparedness plans. HEALTH AND SAFETY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 153 Security All of Statkraft’s buildings, plants and infrastructure are secured against unauthorised access. The purpose of this is both to secure the Group’s assets against external threats and vandalism, and to protect third parties against any safety risks in connection with the Group’s installations. Risk assessment The security situation, as regards e.g. political instability, terrorism and organised crime, is followed up continuously in the areas where Statkraft has a presence. Subject to changes to the security situation, measures may be implemented, such as reinforced security routines and travel restrictions. Guards and security Statkraft is involved in development activities in countries and areas which can be politically unstable. This may result in an increased need to provide security for people and assets. If the threat situation and national guidelines so warrant, this may involve armed guards. The Group’s guidelines for providing security for people and assets in the operations and projects are based on internationally recognised best practice. This includes: π The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights π The UN Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials π The UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials Business ethics Ethical and responsible behaviour is one of the founding pillars of Statkraft. In order to build sound understanding of what this means in practice, we have developed clear regulations and governance structures. Statkraft’s code of conduct Statkraft’s basic ethical principles are described in Statkraft’s Code of conduct. The Code applies to all employees and companies in the Statkraft Group, and our business partners are expected to have standards in accordance with Statkraft’s Code of conduct. Statkraft has developed its own ethical guidelines directed at the Group’s suppliers, and we carry out background checks of potential partners, suppliers and contractors in order to ensure Statkraft’s that their practice corresponds with Statkraft’s own requirements and expectations. Code of Conduct Follow-up of anti-corruption work www.statkraft.com In 2012, a decision was made to strengthen the follow-up of the Group’s anti-corruption work. In order to facilitate consistent and systematic handling of ethical issues, each business unit will have one contact point, an integrity manager, while a function to fill the role of Integrity officer has been established at staff level. The results of our SN Power anti-corruption work will be presented regularly to the corporate management and board of directors. Ethics and anti-corruption training Statkraft promotes ethical and responsible behaviour through training in business ethics and anti-corruption work. All employees are offered training using online courses, dilemma training and a handbook with an overview of relevant laws and guidelines, as well as relevant examples of situations one might come to face. Ethical issues are also a key topic in the training of new employees and managers. Whistleblower channel Employees facing difficult decisions can seek advice through several channels. Statkraft’s employees have the right and duty to blow the whistle on questionable issues and the corporate audit functions as an independent whistleblowing channel. No whistleblower issues were registered in 2012. In development projects, any complaints from stakeholders are registered and handled in line with the procedures for such projects. ROLE IN SOCIETY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 154 Role in Statkraft creates major value for Norwegian society. In 2012, Statkraft society contributed almost NOK 3 billion to the state coffers through dividends, while total taxes paid to the state and local authorities in Norway amounted to almost NOK 6 billion. Innovation and development are important priorities, and Statkraft has three R&D programmes closely associated with the Group’s strategic focus areas: hydropower, wind power and bioenergy. The Group supports various causes, teams and events in sports and culture through national and regional sponsorship agreements. Economic Statkraft’s financial value creation amounted to NOK 14 272 million in 2012. value creation Below is a presentation of the Group’s total value creation in the form of tax contributions, dividends to the state, total investments and goods and services purchased.

Technology analysis, continuous operational improvements, R&D programmes and long-term projects are key factors in Statkraft’s innovation. Focused innovation Statkraft’s innovation strategy is based on the Group’s business strategy and closely linked to the Group’s core activities. By focusing the innovation work towards projects that provide more knowledge and reflect the Group’s main focus areas, Statkraft will generate long-term value for itself and society in general. Through targeted R&D programmes, we want to strengthen our competitive advantage and develop new business models. Statkraft has three R&D programmes closely linked to the Group’s strategic focus areas, hydropower, wind power and bioenergy: ππ The Future Hydro Power programme covers Statkraft’s focus on flexible power production in north-western Europe and hydropower in emerging markets. The purpose of the programme is to secure hydropower’s competitive advantage, optimise future production and find solutions to technical and environmental challenges in new emerging markets. ππ The Competitive Wind Power programme covers onshore and offshore wind power. The objective is to increase the company’s ability to exploit existing expertise and technology and to make Statkraft one of the most cost-effective wind power players. ππ The Energy from Biomass programme originates in Statkraft’s district heating business. The objective is to reduce risk and fuel costs in district heating, as well as increase Statkraft’s ability to participate in bio-related business opportunities in Norway. Statkraft is looking into the opportunity of building a pilot plant for osmotic power in Sunndalsøra in Møre og Romsdal County. Osmotic power In 2012, Statkraft applied for a licence to build a pilot plant for osmotic power in Sunndalsøra in Møre og Romsdal County. Osmotic power is an example of long-term innovation work in Statkraft. Statkraft has been engaged in the development of osmotic power for renewable energy production for more than a decade and is currently a world leader in this area. The concept involves producing electricity by exploiting the energy that is generated when fresh water and salt water meet. The global potential is somewhere between 1600 and 1700 TWh. Statkraft aims to take an investment decision as regards building an osmotic power pilot plant in 2013. In 2012, Statkraft signed a three-year agreement with Hydro-Québec. The purpose of the partnership is to develop cost-efficient technologies for preprocessing of fresh water for use in osmotic power plants. Sponsorships In 2012, Statkraft spent about NOK 22 million on national and international sponsorship agreements, as well as support for local sporting and cultural activities. Statkraft is an active sponsor of sports and culture, and in 2012, the Group had sponsorship agreements with (not exhaustive): ππ The Norwegian Biathlon Union ππ The Norwegian Opera and Ballet ππ The Nobel Peace Prize concert ππ Oslo Jazz Festival ππ Hardanger Music Festival Her Majesty Queen Sonja of Norway opens the Munch exhibition at Tate Modern in London. In addition, Statkraft supports sporting and cultural activities in the local communities where we are present. ROLE IN SOCIETY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 156 Main sponsor of the Munch anniversary In 2012, Statkraft signed an agreement with the Norwegian National Museum and the Munch Museum to be one of the main sponsors of the 150th anniversary for Edvard Munch in 2013. The Group also followed up their funding of the exhibition “Edvard Munch The Modern Eye” when it was on display at the Tate Modern in London. Strategic In 2012, Statkraft entered into long-term partnership agreements with cooperation several special interest organisations. The main purpose of these agreements was to strengthen environmental work and humanitarian work, both locally and internationally. In 2012, Statkraft spent NOK 3.4 million to support humanitarian and environmental organisations. The new strategic partnerships will commence in 2013. The original form of the Statkraft Fund was changed in 2012. The assets in the fund will from 2012 be used in long-term agreements with various organisations. In particular, Statkraft wants to establish cooperation with special interest organisations present in areas where Statkraft has business activities. Statkraft now has formal partnership agreements with WWF Norway, Bellona, the Norwegian Society for the Preservation of Nature and the Norwegian Red Cross. The purpose of these agreements is to contribute to exchange of experience and increased expertise for all parties. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY IN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 157 Corporate In 2012, Statkraft was involved in a number of development projects. responsibility Most of these take place in international emerging markets, but there is also a high level of activity in Norway. In the following, we provide in development an overview of how we addressed corporate responsibility in these projects projects. Expansion of Theun Hinboun Power Company (THPC) in Laos, of which Statkraft owns 20 Theun-Hinboun per cent, opened two new power plants in January 2013. Like the existing plants in Laos, the new plants will be operated and maintained by Statkraft. hydropower in Laos In total, the expansion will double power production to 3 TWh per year. ππ Ownership: Statkraft 20%, Electricité du Laos 60%, GMS Lao Company 20% ππ Capacity: 280 MW (220 MW for export and 60 MW for the local grid) in the development project – a total of 500 MW with the existing plants ππ Development phase: Operations started January 2013 Corporate responsibility challenges and measures The new dam will make it possible to store large amounts of water in the rainy season for dry periods. However, the development meant that about 13 000 people had to move. About Theun Hinboun Power Company (THPC) in Laos, where 4600 of them were resettled from the reservoir area to new villages established by the Statkraft owns 20 per cent, opened two new power plants in January 2013. project and about 8400 were relocated from the river banks downstream of the power plant. A key goal in the process has been to ensure that affected households receive a good and preferably better basis for establishing a sustainable livelihood after the relocation than they had before. Rice production is of great importance in this respect, both financially and culturally, and developing good rice paddies has been a major challenge. The work of levelling the ground, creating good soil and, not least, developing good irrigation systems has been demanding. It has also been demanding for farmers to get used to new production methods. In spite of improved yields, there is still a lot to be gained in this area. As regards the environment, the work to improve water quality was continued in 2012. Rice production is of great importance, both financially Following completion of the work to remove biomass in 2011, this work has primarily and culturally, and developing good rice paddies has been a major challenge. consisted of removing waste and floating objects in the reservoir. This prevents damage to the dam and makes boat traffic in the reservoir safer. In total, more than 2500 m3 of floating objects was removed in 2012. Social conditions and environmental impact are followed up continuously through comprehensive monitoring of living standards, health, nutrition, school services, crops, fish stocks, water quality, erosion etc. The measurements and follow-up will continue until the defined project objectives have been achieved, including after the power plant starts operating. Examples of sustainability indicators in the expansion of Theun-Hinboun: INDICATOR BASIS 2008 STATUS 2012 TARGET Anaemia among women of reproductive age 53% 41% <30% Households <5 km away from the nearest 31% 64% >80% health centre Villages with year-round road connection 26% 63% >90% Households owning agricultural land 88% 80% >90% Households which have planted at least 45% 56% >80% 1 hectare of rice CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY IN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 158 Çetin hydropower In 2012, Statkraft started construction of Çetin, the company’s third in Turkey hydropower plant in Turkey. With a total output of 517 MW, Çetin will be Statkraft’s largest hydropower plant outside of Norway and will have an annual maximum delivery of 1.4 TWh. ππ Ownership: Statkraft 100% ππ Capacity: 517 MW (from two power plants) ππ Development phase: Under construction, scheduled to start operating in January 2015 Total production capacity will be about one per cent of Turkey’s total electricity production, and about three per cent of the country’s hydropower production. Up to 1500 people will be working on the plant during the construction period. With a total output of 517 MW, Çetin will be Statkraft’s Corporate responsibility challenges and measures largest hydropower plant outside of Norway and will have an annual maximum delivery of 1.4 TWh. In 2012, priorities in relation to corporate responsibility have been in connection withon development of sustainable solutions for agriculture in the area, infrastructure investments and contributions to good local health and education services. It has also been important to establish a positive and open dialogue with local authorities and those affected by the development in different ways. As regards infrastructure, 2012 saw a particular focus on development of good systems for water supply and renovation of the drainage system in some of the villages affected by the project. As part of the work to establish a constructive dialogue with those affected by the project, an office for public affairs has been established where anyone can pose questions and register complaints. Kjensvatn hydropower In 2012, Statkraft decided to build Kjensvatn power plant in Hemnes in Nordland county, municipality in Nordland. The power plant is an upgrade and expansion project in Rana power plant’s regulation area. The expansion will yield an Norway annual production increase of about 80 GWh. ππ Ownership: Statkraft 100% ππ Capacity: 11 MW ππ Development phase: Under construction, scheduled to start operating in January 2014 Corporate responsibility challenges and measures Kjensvatn power plant is a good example of an upgrade and expansion project where new solutions for tunnels and access to new water make it possible to generate more power without new, major interventions in nature. Kjensvatn power plant will be a part of an already developed catchment area, and will be built inside the mountain. Kjensvatn power plant will be a part of an already developed catchment area, and will be built inside the mountain. When the installation starts operating, it will contribute to more stable water levels and better water quality in Kjensvatn, as the inflow of cold water with a high sediment content from the Okstindbreen glacier will be reduced. Some construction roads in the area will also have to be upgraded and, to some extent, extended, and the general public will benefit from this when the construction is complete. New power lines will partly be buried in the ground, which makes it possible to remove 27 km of old high-voltage lines from the high mountains. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY IN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 159 Mörttjärnberget In autumn 2011, Statkraft started the development of the Mörttjärnberget wind power in Sweden wind farm, which will be Statkraft’s third wind farm in Sweden. The farm, which will consist of 37 turbines, is scheduled to start operation in late 2013. ππ Ownership: Statkraft 60%, SCA 40% ππ Capacity: 85 MW ππ Development phase: Under construction, commissioning scheduled for January 2013 The project will be executed by the company Statkraft SCA Vind AB, owned by Statkraft and SCA, and about 300 people are involved in the development phase of the project. Corporate responsibility challenges and measures Mörttjärnberget wind farm will consist of 37 turbines, There are several bogs and creeks in the area around Mörttjärnberget requiring special and is scheduled to start operation in late 2013. attention. It has been an objective in the design of transport systems and execution of installations to impact bogs and creeks as little as possible, and to ensure revegetation when the work has been completed. Both Statkraft and the supervisory authorities conduct regular visits and audits to ensure that the contractor implements the project in line with applicable licence requirements. People living near the wind farm are informed of ongoing activities through information letters and public notices in the local community. The project also has its own website, which is used actively to provide information. Jovnevaerie Sami village uses areas around and in the wind farm for reindeer winter grazing land. The development of the wind farm will result in the reindeer scattering over a larger area than before. The development company maintains a close dialogue with the Sami village to minimise impact and has also installed collecting corrals and feed racks near the wind farm. EMPLOYEES AND ORGANISATION CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 160 Employees and Statkraft’s employees manage large amounts of natural resources and organisation assets on behalf of society. Today, our employees are among the most skilled and motivated in the industry, and the Group is working focused to ensure that Statkraft remains an attractive employer which facilitates employee development also in the future. Organisation and The Statkraft Way was launched in December 2012. The Statkraft Way is a management revised version of the Group’s management system and makes it clear to all employees how different activities are to be executed in Statkraft. The Statkraft Way A revised management system for Statkraft was launched towards the end of 2012 The Statkraft Way. The system is based on values and practices that have developed in Statkraft over considerable time, while at the same time reflecting changes in our business environment. All employees are required to familiarise themselves with the core documents of the system, including Statkraft’s vision and values and Statkraft’s Code of conduct, as well as policy documents, and all managers must ensure that the activities in their area conform with this framework. In addition, the system contains specification and supporting documents which explore the policy documents in depth. The Statkraft Way will be fully implemented throughout all wholly-owned activities in 2013. Competence and manager development Competence is one of the Group’s core values, and Statkraft works systematically to develop employee competence. Competence development planning is an integrated part of our annual performance interviews, and courses covering a number of areas are regularly offered as part of the Group’s competence platform. In general, employees are encouraged to continuously develop their own expertise, to ensure that it remains adapted to their work and the company’s needs. Statkraft’s management platform describes the requirements set for the Group’s managers. The platform puts special emphasis on three areas – the ability to inspire others, the ability to develop our own employees and the company’s competence and the ability to organise work and deliver in line with the Group’s strategies. All managers are followed up in line with the requirements of the management platform. Statkraft has its own corporate programmes for manager development. Leadership in Statkraft (LIS) is a basic course, while Next is aimed at experienced managers. In addition, a programme aimed at experienced managers named Expand was started up in January 2012. In 2012, 78 managers participated in the Group’s management programmes, 43 in LIS, 14 in Next and 21 in Expand. The programmes are undergoing continuous development and adaptation to new challenges, not least those created by the Group’s international growth. Statkraft also has its own training programme for project managers, and 136 employees participated in these programmes in 2012. Employee survey For the second time, Statkraft held the COMPASS survey in 2012, where all employees were invited to evaluate the Group’s organisation and management. The survey covered topics such as leadership, cooperation, working conditions, ethics and corporate responsibility and personal development. The purpose of the survey was to compare ourselves with other companies in the industry and make Statkraft a better place to work. The results from the 2012 survey were generally good and Statkraft scored well above the industry average in several areas. Both the corporate management and individual departments are following up the results through specific action plans. EMPLOYEES AND ORGANISATION CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 161 Cooperation with trade unions Statkraft has a close and structured cooperation with all represented trade unions. In addition to national cooperation with trade unions, Statkraft established a European works council (Statkraft European Works Council, SEWC) in 2011, with employee representatives from Norway, Sweden, Germany and the UK. SEWC is an important cooperation forum for coordinating and implementing principles and guidelines as regards labour issues and labour rights in Statkraft. SEWC also ensures a good flow of information concerning decisions made, and provides employee representatives from the different countries with a formal and accepted arena for meeting with the corporate management. Statkraft’s At the end of 2012, Statkraft had 3615 employees. Women made up 24% of the employees Group’s employees, and the Group now has employees in 23 countries. Employees and geographical distribution Employees in Statkraft Statkraft had 3615 employees in 2012, an increase of 6% compared with 2011.

The percentage of non-Norwegian employees is 35. We want diversity among our employees. More diversity among the company’s employees will strengthen us in our international development, for example by providing us with necessary expertise as regards national legislation and administration processes, language and local culture. Statkraft has been one of Alarga’s partners since its start-up in 2007. Alarga is a foundation working to increase the percentage of employees with multicultural expertise in Norwegian industry and commerce. Alarga awards scholarships to talented candidates from multicultural backgrounds. In addition, scholarship students are assigned to a partner company which will offer support in the completion of a Master’s degree, as well as offering summer internships and in-house mentors. Statkraft hosted the annual Alarga Academy in 2012. Percentage of women in Statkraft Percentage of women i Statkraft The percentage of women in the Group has been stable in recent years. The percentage % 30 of women is somewhat higher in the Norwegian part of the business. Statkraft wants a 25 more even gender balance in the organisation and is participating in a research project 20 in 2012-2013 along with other major Norwegian companies. The purpose is to identify 15 10 measures which can be implemented to increase the percentage of female managers. 5 Furthermore, the Group’s manager development programmes strive to achieve an even 0 Norway Nordic countries Rest of Europe Rest of the world gender balance. ■2010 ■2011 ■2012 Percentage of female employees 24% Percentage of female managers 21% Percentage of female new employees 29% Percentage of women on Statkraft’s board of directors 44% EMPLOYEES AND ORGANISATION CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 162 Recruitment We are working systematically to ensure that Statkraft is an attractive employer, and surveys show we are headed in the right direction. Our annual summer project and our trainee programme are two of many recruitment and profiling measures. An attractive employer We want Statkraft to be an attractive employer and have therefore implemented a systematic employer branding effort. This work is directed at both students and employees with experience, and Statkraft regularly participates in recruitment events and cooperation schemes. Statkraft is generally perceived to be an attractive employer, and many emphasise that working with clean energy is meaningful. The Universum Student Survey is Norway’s largest career, working life and future Participants in Statkraft’s Summer Project getting ready expectations survey among students. Over the course of the last ten years, Statkraft has for visiting an offshore wind farm. climbed steadily in the ranking of attractive employers. In the 2012 survey, engineering students ranked Statkraft seventh (no change from 2011), while economics students ranked Statkraft as the 33rd most attractive employer (30th in 2011). Statkraft also achieves good results in the Universum Professionals Survey, which measures how attractive employers are to professionals. Among engineers, Statkraft was ranked ninth in 2012 (sixth in 2011), while economists rank Statkraft as Norway’s 17th best workplace (12th in 2011). Equal treatment in the recruitment process Equal treatment is a basic tenet of Statkraft’s recruitment and HR policies. Objective and professional recruitment processes, for both internally and externally advertised positions, will ensure that the best qualified candidate is always chosen. The summer project Statkraft organises an annual summer project, which is carried out by a select group of talented students. The summer project gives a group of students from different study programmes the opportunity to get to know the energy industry and Statkraft. For Statkraft, the summer project is also a great PR opportunity. This year’s assignment for the students was: How will the technical, financial, regulatory and environmental framework conditions for wind power develop, and how will this affect Statkraft’s investments in existing and future wind power projects? The results of the project were presented to the corporate management in August. Trainees and apprentices Statkraft has a two-year trainee programme which is very popular among graduate students. In 2012, a total of 15 trainees were working in different parts of the Group, both in Norway and abroad. The trainee programme has become more international in recent years in time with Statkraft’s general development. Statkraft has also developed a trainee programme for technical personnel, partly to ensure future access to power plant operation expertise. Furthermore, apprentice positions for different types of trade certificates have been established throughout the Group. In 2012, 75 apprentices were working for Statkraft. EMPLOYEES AND ORGANISATION CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 163 Human rights Statkraft actively promotes respect for human rights. Companies and human rights The UN’s and ILO’s declarations and conventions on human rights are sets of obligations directed at sovereign states. However, it has now become generally recognised that companies have a responsibility to safeguard human rights. Statkraft monitors and participates in international developments in this area, in particular through implementation efforts on Business and Human Rights. We also actively support the principles of the UN Global Compact. Statkraft and human rights Statkraft is involved in activities where human rights may be challenged, either directly through our own operations or indirectly through the supply chain. Within its sphere of influence, Statkraft supports and respects internationally recognised human rights, labour rights, including freedom of association and recognition of the right to collective bargaining, abolition of all forms of forced labour and child labour and abolishment of discrimination as regards employment and professions. Statkraft’s duty to actively promote respect for human rights is described in Statkraft’s Code of conduct and in Statkraft’s Supplier Code of conduct. The latter emphasises human rights and labour rights as particularly important issues. The requirement to ensure respect for human rights has become standard in all contracts. Human rights are addressed several places in Statkraft’s management system, The Statkraft Way, and have also been integrated in the Group’s project management tool. Statkraft reported to the National Contact Point for OECD guidelines In October 2012, the Norwegian and the Swedish National Contact Points (hereinafter the NCPs) for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises were contacted by Jijnjevaerie Sami Village in connection with the development of a wind farm in Jämtland and Västernorrland counties in Sweden. Statkraft owns 60% of the company developing the wind farm Statkraft SCA Vind AB. Jijnjevaerie Sami Village claims they have not been sufficiently consulted on the parts of the project that affect the reindeer herding of the village, and that Statkraft is therefore in violation of the principles in the guidelines. The sami village has therefore requested the NCPs to facilitate a dialogue with Statkraft. As recognized by Swedish judicial authorities, the project has complied with all applicable laws and procedures, provided extensive information, and consultations have taken place since 2007. In their assessment of the admissability of the case, the NCPs have acknowledged the ongoing dialogue and decided to defer the case to allow Jijnjevaerie and Statkraft to find a mutually acceptable solution without the assistance of the NCPs. The NCPs also emphasised that it cannot re-examine decisions made by national authorities or courts. Statkraft is commited to continue the dialogue with Jijnjevaerie Sami Village. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 164 Corporate Statkraft’s corporate responsibility statement aims to provide a responsibility balanced description of the company’s work and performance within the corporate responsibility area. statement Scope of the Statkraft’s corporate responsibility statement aims to provide a balanced statement description of the company’s work and performance within the corporate responsibility area.

Since 2002, Statkraft has issued systematic information about strategy and performance in connection with corporate responsibility. From 2004, the reporting has been based on GRI’s guidelines and from 2010, GRI’s guidelines prepared specifically for the energy industry. About GRI GRI develops industry-adapted guidelines for corporate reporting of sustainability and corporate responsibility. The guidelines define both reporting principles and general and industry-specific indicators. GRI develops reporting tools Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an independent organisation which, since it was established in 1997, has worked to create a more standardised format for corporate responsibility and sustainability reporting. The most recent main version of GRI’s guidelines (G3) for sustainability reporting was issued in the autumn of 2006. In 2009, the guidelines prepared especially for the energy industry (Electric Utilities Sector Supplement) were approved. GRI defines ten reporting principles. Four of these deal with establishing the scope and content of the report, while the other six address the quality of the information presented. GRI has prepared both general and industry-specific indicators, divided between core and supplementary indicators, for enterprise profile, economy, environment, working conditions, human rights, corporate citizenship and product responsibility. For all areas, companies must describe the governance and follow-up mechanisms that have been implemented. Different reporting levels GRI has three corporate reporting levels – A, B and C – where A is the highest level. In addition, the reporting level is marked with a ”+” if the reporting has been verified by an external third party. Statkraft’s Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting for 2012 is based on guidance GRI index and recommendations given in the GRI’s Energy Utilities Sector Supplement. Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting has been verified by an external auditor. The auditor’s conclusion is presented in the Auditor’s report: “Statkraft applies a reporting practice for its corporate responsibility reporting aligned with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines reporting principles and the reporting fulfills application level B+ according to the GRI guidelines.” Explanations Reported = The indicator has been reported completely or partially. Not reported = The indicator has not been reported. Not material = The indicator has been considered as not material at the Group level. * = Additional indicator in GRI’s Energy Utilities Sector Supplement. EU = Indicator numbers starting with EU mean that the indicator is specific for the energy utilities sector.
