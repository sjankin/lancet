We have zealously affiliated ourselves to the UN Global Compact, having faith in its principles. This year, however, we have seriously contemplated the feasibility of our affiliation to that Compact, all the more because we have sensibly and tangibly noticed the global corruption, especially in the realm of information media… Albeit, we repeatedly requested in our preceding reports the necessity of seriously taking into consideration the problem of global corruption and of handling it with creditability and in-depth, not only through luring words and information… . Yet, our confidence is shaken by the credibility of the United Nations that laid down the Global Compact, regard being had to the flagrant corruption in information media, to the sectarian incitation and to the orchestrated ruining of Syrian companies… We have accordingly decided: • Not to shun our culture and beliefs as faithful Syrians and not to be scared and quit Syria or embark on a policy of self-distancing. • To go ahead with our endeavors, having faith in our thoughts and principles which are compatible with the Global Compact and are considered sublime principles. • To develop our company and maintain its Syrian mosaic where no discrimination is made between man and woman, Muslim or Christian... For it has become a must to embrace these principles which thus preserve our planet where we are in the same ship and maintain our societies, as all these are interconnected, whereby this has become a matter of essentials rather than intellectual luxury. It is our hope that these principles spread worldwide and be respected by all companies, indeed all countries and institutions and even individuals, in practice rather than theory.

TEN PRINCIPLES OF THE CLOBAL COMPACT The global compact asks companies to embrace, support and enact, within their sphere of influence, a set core values within the following areas: First of all, allow us to point out that Direct Line was the company that printed the booklet distributed at the United Nations’ Headquarters in New York on the occasion of the Leader Summit 2010, which included a summary of the activities of the Global Compact Network – Syria. Also, as implementation of the principles of the Global Compact of the UN, our company contributed, despite of its small size, with a quarter of the printing expenses of the booklet in addition to the design and creation of the slogans reflecting those principles. HUMAN RIGHTS Principal 1: businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human right; and Principal 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human right abuses. Given the meaning of its name and its own values, Direct Line decided to join the Global Compact for companies and to abide by all its principles which correspond to its own beliefs. From the rest of this report and from the diversity of its employees, we will find that Direct Line respects all human rights, giving a perfect example to all its business partners, companies, associations and individuals; therefore it participates in supporting and encouraging the Syrian society’s development on the basis of those principles. These principles faced a test during the upheaval which started in Syria since mid-May 2011 and is still waging. Divergence in the public opinion of Syrians is far and wide, involving even those in their workplaces. Some of our employees are pros and others are cons. Day in day out, they trade debates on what is going on in Syria. It has been our principle that each and every individual of Direct Line should respect the other individual’s opinion and his/her right in free expression pioneered by debate. �is has led to moderation in stances and a better understanding of the other’s opinion; hence, intimacy has ruled among them all, and positive opinions have become increasingly prevailing as time wears on. One of our staff members was kidnapped by terrorists. All our company personnel pooled efforts to help him and assist his family members. When he rejoined us, safe and sound, thanks God, he told us in detail his predicament. Now everybody looks at these events with vivid conscience and reasoning, regard being had to the principles of human rights, after they were naively looked at from the purview of cons or pros. LABOUR Principal 3: businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right of collective bargaining; Principal 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principal 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principal 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. In Direct Line we seek to act as one family in these critical circumstances plaguing us in Syria. All the employees at Direct Line are older than 19 years of age; 52% of them are men and 48% women. And since we in Syria are of various coexisting religions and communities, the Direct Line team consists of Christians and Muslims from various communities spread among the different work posts. We encouraged and supported our employees when they created an “Employees’ Fund”, where each sta� member participates with his/her share of savings, as well as an additional contribution from the Management; the resulting sum goes to a different member of the fund every month, therefore benefiting all the employees on regular basis. In addition, we have an isolated area within the company building to religious practices, where employees (of di�erent religions) wishing to pray during working hours are able to do so in the best of conditions. Back to the enormous crisis experienced by Syria since mid-March 2011, speciﬁcally its economic impact. Syrian economy has receded because of embargo, overseas sanctions, boycott on purchase of Syrian oil even on those who buy it, the war against the Syrian Pound exchange rate, etc.. This has led to closing down a number of commercial firms and to weakening of the workforce’s psychological and financial stability, so much so that they fear losing their jobs, accept lower wages and work on part time basis to keep earning their bread and butter (or whatever can be salvaged), away from unemployment and all misfortunes associated with it. Notwithstanding these precarious circumstances, our company kept on all its employees willing to stay with us, maintained their payroll scale and even supported those facing an adverse political situation without any discrimination as to gender, religious denomination or political affiliation. Anxious as we all are to survive and go ahead as a company and individuals, we have set up a sound studio in the company so that we may act and integrate our services and expand the source of our income. This juncture calls upon us to make such enormous efforts and personal sacrifices as cannot be plausibly easy with the time element ever hovering on the crisis. This attitude could not materialize had it not been for our adherence to the great principles of which the Global Impact is considered a part. ENVIRONMENT Principal 7: businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principal 8: undertake initiative to promote greater environmental responsibility and; Principal 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Conservation of the environment, in its broader sense, has become part of our culture in such a manner that it is now embedded in all our activities, and initiatives from our side are taken automatically without second thoughts. Here is an example showing the previously mentioned as a true reality, not for the sake of enumeration but just as a glimpse to visualize our assimilation of these principles which have simply become part of us: Concerning the seventh principle, calling for the encouragement to adopt a precautionary approach towards environmental challenges, we installed double-layered glass to strengthen the offices’ insulation against temperature ﬂuctuations, hence saving energy (gas oil for heating and electricity for cooling); and therefore contributing (on our humble scale) to reducing the emission of gases in the atmosphere which ultimately may lead to thermal retention in our planet. Thanks to the Lord’s great mercy and to “double-layered glass” we were protected against mortar splinters shelled by terrorists on the Damascus Free Zone where our company exits. In addition, we include and circulate in all our e-mails the phrase:  Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail It would be worthwhile to refer in this connection to our frustration because of our inability to do anything against the tremendous pollution (let alone human victims) caused by various explosions and mortar shells blasted in Syria by terrorists who are, unfortunately, backed by most civilized nations purportedly seeking to disseminate the concept of environment protection on a worldwide scale. Lastly, we also have to cite the critical circumstances which our country has been experiencing for more than 2 years and have led to power cuts hours and hours daily because of terrorist bombings that aimed to destroy the Syrian economy. In order to continue business in our office and protect the environment from pollution, we decided to replace a diesel-powered generator with a sophisticated inverter at a higher cost of purchase. That said, we have protected our staff and environment from the increased pollution, have oriented the use of power, and have contributed towards our modest standard through minimizing the emission of gases and protecting the ozone layer. After examining the steps mentioned above, we find that Direct Line is constantly and instinctively oriented towards the conservation of the environment, always supporting initiative to that end. ANTI-CORRUPTION Principal 10: businesses should work against corruption in all forms, including extortion and bribery. We vigorously seek to participate in limiting the massively spread bribery and to resist the corruption that has infested all societies (each society having its own devious ways for extortion, bribery and all other forms of corruption…). Actually, this topic reveals itself to be the most di�cult one to implement in the real world, as commercial competitiveness has become even fiercer than in previous times, and one of its illegitimate ways depends on corruption that has reached all levels. So that we remain transparent and shy away from the corruption that we combat in say and deed, it is because of the war waged against our country that the number of our staff members has diminished as some of them left away (one of them was the victim of kidnapping). A condition of a�liating to the Global Compact network is that the company should have a minimum number of personnel who are fully prepared to comply with this proviso and quit that network if the Compact management so deems fit. The media being our line of business, we have noticed the huge corruption worldwide and the perilous sectarian incitation prevailing in information and TV stations. We have organized several seminars to counsel our employees on the risk of corruption and information lies and on making them feel that we are one and the same people living together under the roof of one and the same nation, despite our various doctrines and beliefs. It would be worthwhile to add that in 2012 we and everybody else in Syria have found that the control of corruption is a priority for the society as a whole and that all reforms sought worldwide will be doomed to failure if not started with combating the corruption and the fight against sectarian incitement, beginning from the highest levels down to family and child... Finally, While closing this COP, we kindly request those in charge of the Compact project to: • Spare no e�ort and sincerely arrange to cut down the orchestrated ruining of Syrian companies. • Stand up against corruption, the looting of Syrian companies and the sale of their equipment to other countries with the knowledge (au vu et au su) of decision makers in those countries. • Arrange to cut short the corruption and killing of innocent people for the sake of crude oil and natural gas. We reiterate and reiterate our request to you to organize an initiative of the United Nations to declare the year 2013 or next year 2014; “World Year for Combating Corruption and Sectarian Incitation (which is considered an aspect of intellectual corruption). because this epidemic has infected the entire globe, and because individual initiatives, no matter how heroic they may be in comparison to the size of their respective owners, remain marginal if not accompanied by key reforms on all levels, starting from education in schools and at home (in order to found new generations on the basis of higher principles); going on to the voluntary contribution of all the media and advertising channels to actively and effectively be the Fourth Power, by detecting corruption and following up the main issues until completely resolved once and for all, based on the development of laws that impose transparency in the business world and severely punish all kinds of corruption; and ending with the actual implementation of these laws and sanctions on all categories, particularly at higher levels in society, including those benefiting from «political immunity», and those with the advantage of «financial immunity». To your kind selves and to all contributors to the Compact and its success, Best regards and deepest respect. Syria is the cradle of civilization and the convergence of religions “From here a light emerged anew…” Direct Line Family Syrian and proud to be
