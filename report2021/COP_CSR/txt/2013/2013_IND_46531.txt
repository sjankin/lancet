This is the first of its kind that covered a country and sector specific long term action plan to mitigate climate change risks. Sustainable Development ACC Limited We are playing an exemplary role in conserving fossil fuels by expanding the use Report Web Update 2012 of lower carbon alternative fuels and increasing our fuel substitution, guided by Holcim’s Geocycle philosophy. In doing so, we render valuable services to the country by eliminating deleterious industrial wastes, municipal wastes, agricultural and bio-mass, thus benefiting waste generating industries, cities and society at large. An important means of reducing CO2 emissions in cement production is by reducing Logistics the clinker factor which is the share of clinker in cement. We promote the production Strategic Projects Excellence of blended cements in which clinker is partially replaced by cementitious materials Manufacturing Excellence People Excellence like fly-ash and granulated blast furnace slag, which are byproduct materials from Sales & Marketing other industrial processes. Our blended cement CDM project is one of the biggest Excellence for the cement sector in India. On the environment front, we complied with all applicable local environmental regulations, while adopting Holcim’s global environmental standards and practices. I am pleased to present highlights of During the year we established Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems and ACC’s 6th Sustainable Development Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations in most of our plants. In a Report. move that introduced greater transparency, live data from some of these systems is uplinked to state pollution control board websites.

These initiatives reached out to 132 villages, touching the lives of about half a million people. Skill development programmes for differently-abled youth enabled placement of 136 young deaf adults while our HIV/AIDS treatment centres reached out to 319 afflicted people. We initiated behavioural change campaigns to encourage segregation of wastes by households to promote solid waste management. We believe that sustainable development makes a strong business case. Many of the goals in our sustainable development agenda are also specifically targeted in a programme launched by us in early 2012. Called “Institutionalizing Excellence”, it was meant to deliver superior value to customers while simultaneously seeking cost leadership. The programme targets time-bound improvements in manufacturing, sales, logistics, people processes and procurement of major inputs. By the end of the year, the excellence journey had already started showing positive results in these areas. We acknowledge the contribution of our employees which enabled us to achieve the company’s goals. The Institutionalizing Excellence programme visibly helped in upgrading skills and competency building of employees, in sharing and replicating best practices and in developing long term visions and action plans for critical performance indicators. As we look ahead, we see India’s economy continue to grow resulting in construction activity particularly in housing and infrastructure sectors. As one of the country’s largest cement producers, we aim to enhance our capacity to meet the increasing requirements for cement. We have projects under implementation that will usher in growth while strengthening the outlook for further reducing our carbon footprint. Work has commenced on the Jamul expansion project which will add 5 million tonnes of capacity in the east. This project, which will produce low carbon cement, will be completed in 2015. There are other green energy initiatives on the radar. A waste heat recovery power generation plant is nearing completion at Gagal and will go into trials by the end of 2013. To support the thrust on increasing alternative fuels, we are setting up AFR pre-processing platforms at three plants Madukkarai, Wadi and Kymore. Logistics emerged as a major priority. We aim to develop a world class logistics organization with best-in-class performance in terms of cost-to-serve and timeto-serve. In 2012 we deployed emerging technologies like RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and GPS (Global Positioning Systems) for the first time in the Indian cement industry, to enable easy tracking of road transport vehicles in our plants and in transit to the end-consumer. We plan to take these initiatives further. Providing superior value to our customers is among our most important objectives. We will continue to pursue improvements in quality and service levels and expand our marketing and sales organization. Our product development strategy will include environment-friendly offerings for special applications. As we carry on with our determined efforts towards institutionalizing excellence, we are confident that Sustainability will continue to drive a large part of this journey and our future growth plans. In doing so, we will continue to rely on the valuable support we receive from our parent company Holcim and benefit from their rich experience. We welcome your feedback and suggestions. Kuldip Kaura ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [2] 1 Organization & Strategy 1.1 Organizational Profile In 1936, ten cement companies merged together to form a single entity that was called “The Associated Cement Companies Limited”. In 2006 the name was changed into the simpler version of just “ACC Limited”. Today ACC is part of the Holcim group of Switzerland which owns 50.3 % of its total equity. The company operates 17 cement factories, over 50 ready mixed concrete plants, 21 sales offices and several zonal offices across India with a workforce of about 9000 persons. The organization structure of the company is divided into three autonomous geographical regions North, East and South-West each headed by a chief executive under the overall leadership of the Chief Executive officer and Managing Director at corporate level. In 2013 the South-West region was bifurcated into two regions South and West, each with separate chief executives. People’s Brand The brand name ACC is well recognized in India and internationally. While many iconic and enduring structures such as Mumbai’s Marine Drive and the Bhakra Dam are built with ACC cement, the brand is also counted as being the most preferred one to construct homes for the masses of India in its cities, towns and villages. The company’s cordial relationships with generations of customers and other stakeholders have added to the trust, respect and confidence this brand enjoys. ACC cement is made easily available across Indian cities and towns with the support of over 9000 authorized dealers and more than 50,000 sales outlets located all over the country. Innovation at its core The name of ACC is associated with numerous innovations in cement and concrete technology. These include notable achievements like India’s first indigenous cement plant, the world’s largest cement plant, commercial distribution of Bulk cement and Ready Mix Concrete and most significantly, the promotion of eco-friendly blended cements in India Portland Slag Cement and Portland Pozzolana Cement that utilize industrial wastes from steel plants and from thermal power stations. Focus on Sustainability Growing from a capacity of 1 million tonnes per annum in 1936 to 30 million tonnes per annum by 2012, the company took an early lead in areas like energy conservation and demonstrating concern for the environment, long before the concepts of sustainable development and Triple Bottom Line were evolved. ACC‘s focus on sustainable development is such that it integrates a sustainable approach into all activities of its value chain from mining to sales. Among the company’s most important achievements have been mineral conservation and the gainful utilization of industrial wastes which enabled India’s cement industry to achieve an impressive reduction of its carbon footprint. A Social Volunteer In partnership with the rural community living around its operations, ACC implements social volunteering initiatives leading to the betterment of society. These include efforts in rural health, livelihood creation, education, vocational guidance and technical knowledge advancement programmes. Among its many contributions the ones that stand out are its treatment centres for patients of HIV/AIDS, the adoption of seven government-run technical schools and the operation of two technical institutes for students from remote places.

The approach has become an integral part of our business decision making process where in the financial implications on account of Climate change are evaluated and corrective / preventive measures are ascertained & considered. We have institutionalized Business Risk Management Process (BRM) which helps us in identifying various risks and opportunities associated with our business. We have also developed Materiality Matrix which identifies the material issues to the organization. ACC’s identifies the risks and opportunities based on the following three paradigms: Changes in the regulations Changes in Physical Climate parameters Changes in other Climate related parameters Risks and Opportunities based on the changes in regulations: ACC has identified risks on account of Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme which sets specific energy consumption targets for energy intensive sectors like Power, Cement etc., and Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) which gives an obligation to consume certain percentage of renewable energy in proportion to the coal based power generation. This risk has opened doors for ACC to explore various opportunities to embark on the journey of aggressive implementation of various energy conservation measures & to identify sources of renewable energy. Risks and Opportunities based on the Climate parameters: Water scarcity is one of the major risk identified on account of climate parameters. However extreme rains may not have much impact on the overall operations of the organization as our operations are having PAN India presence. However the water scarcity has made us to explore opportunities in the areas of rain water harvesting, adopting latest dry technologies to minimize the water consumption etc., It would be difficult to ascertain the financial implications as it is linked with the degree of water scarcity. Risks and Opportunities based on other Climate related parameters: Consumers, as well as investors are becoming more and more aware of the environmental impacts of manufacturing cement. At the same time government has also put up stringent regulations seeking information on social and environmental impacts in the form of Business Responsibility Report (BRR). Any lapse on meeting the expectations of Consumers and Investors on account of environmental performance will impact the organization’s reputation. However this risks opens an opportunity to adopt best available environment technologies to achieve excellent environmental performance. During the year 2012 our 9MW Tamil Nadu Wind Mill Project has realized 18111 CERs and our Blended Cement project has realized 138793 CERs. Similarly our 7.5MW Rajasthan Wind Mill Project is registered as CDM Project.

EC9: Understanding and describing significant indirect economic impacts, including the extent of impacts Being an essential construction material, cement is a global commodity that makes important contributions to economic activity. At ACC, we realize that our economic performance has direct and indirect impact on all of our stakeholders, including our employees, local governments, non-profit organizations, customers, suppliers and the communities in which we operate. In our efforts to contributing value to society, we recognize that our activities also create indirect economic impacts such as advances in innovation or the economic effects of changes in locations and/or operations. Due to our growing operations, the activities of our different stakeholders have also been growing, thereby creating value to the local and national economy. Such rising level of operations has also enabled increased job creation in our value chain by our suppliers, distributors, contractors and customers. The use of our products to improve the infrastructure in the country had resulted in improvement in the quality of life of communities. SO6: Total value of financial and in-kind contributions to political parties, politicians, and related institutions by country The company did not make any financial or in-kind contributions to any political parties during the year 2012. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [20] 2.2 Customer Relations CRM Customer Relationship Management ACC has been continuously adapting different innovative techniques to reach more & more customers base to deliver best quality cement/ products & services. In this line, ACC has rolled out CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software across the organization. It is an initiative targeted to improve relationship with two broad segments i.e. Channel Partners (Cement Dealers) and End-Consumers (Home Builders). 1. Channel Partners (Cement Dealers) Our channel partners are located all across the country from metros to small villages. With the help of CRM software, ACC sales force receives updates with realtime information on the commercial transactions. This facilitated better interaction between the ACC sales force and our channel partners and also resulted in quicker resolution of issues pertaining to deliveries, payments, branding support etc. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [21] 2. End-Consumers (Home Builders) To provide quality products and technical services to its end consumers has always been aim of the sales force. CRM software helps ACC personnel to plan and deliver the services in a more structured and real-time manner which has strengthened our association with end customers. The broad range of services offered were: on-site services, right product guidance, knowledge sharing sessions, good construction practices, complaint resolution, site demonstrations etc. This software is now being used extensively by the front-end sales teams and customer service teams. The CRM software is being used by 800+ active users across ACC. Websales In year 2012, 37% of ACC has introduced Websales, an online portal that allows the ACC Dealer network to order cement anytime from anywhere. The dealers can view complete transaction the orders were placed history which includes Order List, Pending Orders, Dispatch List, Invoice details for last 1 month. through Websales. With this system there is an absolute transparency on order booking time and delivery status. The dealer benefits are in terms of no follow up required regarding orders and thereby more time available for building customer relations/acquiring new customer. Websales was introduced in year 2010. It has been rolled out in phases across ACC and in year 2012, 37% of the orders were placed through Web sales. ACC Concrete Club ACC Concrete club is a long term engagement program with Influencers which provides a platform for the Influencer community for exchange of knowledge within the influencer groups through online and offline forums. Also this platform gives ACC the opportunity to further strengthen the relations. The Architects/ Consultants/ Engineers were informed about the latest practices followed in the world of Construction and Sustainable Development. Online discussion forum helped in sharing best practices currently operational in the field. Workshops and training programs are organized for Contractors and Masons for skill up-gradation, which helped them to replicate the best construction practices. Around 1300+ members have been enrolled in ACC Concrete Club. EasyACCess EasyACCess is an on-line issue resolution platform for ACC Dealers. Dealers are able to login their issues pertaining to different functional areas like Product, Logistics, Accounts etc. online. Based on the type of issue and location, they are forwarded for resolutions to respective functional areas. These issues are thereafter to be resolved in a time-bound manner. Issues not getting resolved within stipulated time are escalated to higher officials for information and necessary action. This initiative has helped ACC in giving a time-bound and transparent issue resolution to its channel partners. This has also helped ACC in maintaining an inventory of issues and thereafter resulting in process and system corrections. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [22] PR5: Practices related to customer satisfaction, including results of surveys measuring customer satisfaction addressed in customer satisfaction ACC conducts Channel satisfaction survey and Brand Health studies on a regular basis. Brand Health studies are conducted among the end-consumers i.e. Individual Home Builders. Apart from the derived figure of Brand Equity Index for ACC, other direct metrics like Brand Awareness, Brand Consideration, Brand Usage are also tracked. The overall brand equity index of ACC on an all India basis measured in 2012 was 4.7 Brand Equity Index is a 10 point index. As per Nielsen norms on 11% of the brands have a Brand Equity more than 5. Satisfaction survey was conducted online by ACC for the first time in year 2012. The survey was hosted in a portal dedicated for ACC Cement Channel (Lakshya). The satisfaction scores for year 2012 were 76 out of 100. Apart from this satisfaction survey, Net Promotor Survey as a tool to measure the operational effectiveness of the company is being piloted at ACC EN27: Percentage of products sold and their packaging materials that are reclaimed by category The quantity of bulk cement sold during the period Jan-Dec’12 is 1006650 MT. Quantity of paper sacks used in 2012 is 2774700. We co-process waste plastics in cement kiln which in a way partially compensate the plastic cement bags we send in the environment. EN29: Significant environmental impacts of transporting products and other goods and materials used for the organization’s operations, and transporting members of the workforce Environmental impacts on account of transporting products and other goods and materials used for the organization’s operations and transporting members of the workforce results mainly in two aspects i.e., CO2 emissions and dust emissions. On the CO2 emissions front, the aspect of CO2 emissions from our out bound logistics was studied by us during our Carbon foot print activity carried out during Increase of 6% Bulk the year 2010 and realized that the CO2 emissions from our outbound logistics contribute to <1% of our total emissions. On products transportation, out bound sales in volume in 2011 logistics contribute to major part. Coming to employee commuting, our major compared to 2012 work force is situated at our plants where the commuting distance is <1 2 Kms and thus does not contribute to major part of our activities. Hence we believe that our total CO2 emissions on account of transportation of products, other goods etc., is less than <2% of our total emissions. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [23] 2.3 SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT ACC strives to achieve the highest ethical standards in all its procurement activities. For the past 3 years, procurement has been one of the focal point to drive the sustainability agenda in the company. To make the Central Procurement Organization the best in the Cement Industry and to achieve the World Class status, we have implemented several sustainability initiatives guided by Holcim Group. Our Central Procurement Organization (CPO) has achieved many milestones and benchmarks within Holcim and outside. We also convey our sustainability agenda to our suppliers and vendors to drive it together. Our vendors have rated us best in the industry in terms of satisfaction as surveyed by A.C. Neilson. We have also been nominated at “Procurement Leaders Awards” in excellence category. All of our procurement agreements include sections and clauses pertaining to Labour standards and Occupational Health and Safety. Sustainability Principles in Procurement The principles of Sustainable Development value creation, sustainable environment performance and corporate social responsibility are integral to our business strategy. ACC Limited seeks to engage in long-term relationships with Suppliers that commit to their social responsibility, that adhere to international standards such as SA8000 (Social Accountability) and ISO 14001 (Environment Management System) and that have systems in place to comply with relevant local provisions. The Company has set minimum requirements pertaining to Sustainability (including Environment Management, Safety standards and Social Accountability) to be followed by any Supplier / Third Party Service Providers (Contractors). A standard questionnaire on CSR & OH&S is sent to suppliers while seeking Requests for Quotations (RFQs) in which appropriate clauses have been incorporated based on the nature of order. It is mandatory for new suppliers to provide these details. Most of our vendors have been covered under this initiative which helps to reduce the number of supplier related incidents. In cases, where Suppliers are not able to meet these minimum requirements, we ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [24] engage in a dialogue and adopt mechanisms to improve our Suppliers’ standards. Re-assessment of qualified Suppliers’ compliance with these requirements takes place within the regular schedule of Supplier re-qualification. However, in any cases of violation or obvious non-compliance by the Supplier, re-assessment must be immediate and termination if necessitated. Contractual Agreement of Compliance All Purchase Orders or Agreements we enter into incorporate different clauses related to Safety, Environment Management and Corporate Social Responsibility. During the year 2012, no cases of human rights violation (viz. incidences of child labour, forced or compulsory labour, overtime without pay etc.) were recorded in our operations. Sustainable Procurement ACC has always been committed to procure responsibly and therefore under the guidance of its parent company Holcim, integrated approach has been constituted to ensure consistent management of the risk derived from doing business with non compliant suppliers that do not uphold the Company’s standards on environment, OH&S and social responsibility. The Company has started the implementation of Sustainable Procurement through the Supplier Code of Conduct which is meant to provide clear summary of ACC’s expectation from the suppliers in all procurement dealings. Transparency and accountability should be strictly adhered to in all procurement activities. This has listed nine standards that Suppliers are expected to adhere to, in addition to complying with local and national laws and regulations. These standards cover Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S), Working Conditions, Freedom of Association and Non-retaliation, Forced Labour, Child Labour, NonDiscrimination, Environmental Regulatory Compliance, Management of Environmental Impacts, Bribery and Corruption. The Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), a voluntary global initiative for responsible business practice that Holcim is a member of. The integrated approach to implement sustainable procurement across the supplier base consists of 5 steps: 1. Communication of the Supplier Code of Conduct Communication of company’s expectations and terms of engagement to existing and potential suppliers ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [25] 2. Supplier prioritization Identification of potential high-risk suppliers based on Operating Companies’ judgment of local conditions 3. Risk assessment Continuous evaluation of risk exposure through self-assessment, fact finding or verification 4. Risk mitigation Supplier development or replacement, as determined by Operating Companies. 5. Scorecard Continuous performance-tracking of the management of SD related risks by our suppliers. Our position with respect to various Indicators is as under: The Company requires all its suppliers to complete the Supplier CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) and OHS (Occupational Health and Safety) Management System Questionnaire as a condition for eligibility. The questions in the self declaration cover the aspects of employee’s safety, occupational health, corporate social responsibility and environment. All procurement agreements of the Company include conditions pertaining to labour standards and occupational health and safety. (HR2) As disclosed in (HR2), inclusion and ensuring the compliance of Human rights in all our agreements / purchase orders irrespective of the nature and size has become an integral part of conducting our business. (HR1) All Suppliers operating from within the Indian Territory (National suppliers) are treated as Local suppliers. The total spend on all Suppliers during the year 2012 was ` 8354 Crores of which the expenditure on local Suppliers was ` 7701 Crores representing 92.18 per cent. Also, wherever viable, ACC considers vendors located in the proximity of its plants. (EC6) ACC encourages collective bargaining to maintain harmonious Industrial relations. The issue of mutual interest are periodically discussed and resolved with employee’s representatives. They are also inducted in various committees constituted for their welfare (such as Safety Committee, Canteen Committee and Works Committee). (HR5) It is the Company’s practice to only engage with an employee once he has attained the minimum age of 18 years. Those, who are below 18 years of age, are not allowed to enter into the plants. ACC also ensures that its contractors strictly comply with the same guidelines. (HR6) The Company adheres to the law while engaging labour. It does not engage forced labour. The labour engaged by the contractor is governed by the Contract Labour (R&A) Act and the contract is supposed to obtain license to engage Contract labour after fulfilling the prescribed condition of the Act. (HR7) ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [26] 2.4 Eco-Efficient Products Reduction in clinker factor: The in-house developed cement additives combinations were optimised Plant wise for PPC / PSC. These additives worked as grinding aid, accelerators for cement hydration and helped to improve wettability of Cements, thus reducing the water demand of PPC. The effect of these additive combinations on properties of PPC/PSC was understood in details through series of experiments by varying the concentration of chemicals, singularly and in combination at different levels of fly ash/slag and with varying sources of clinker substantial reduction in clinker factor could be achieved in PPC / PSC with improved quality and performance of the PPC/PSC in Concrete. Use of Cement additives on regular basis in cement grinding also resulted in improved Cement Mill productivity, achieving reduced power consumption per Ton of Cement. Advantages in manufacturing Blended Cements: Reduction in CO2 emission by substituting clinker by alternatives like Flyash (from thermal power plants) and Slag (from Steel plants) Preserving natural resources like limestone & corrective materials like Iron Ore , bauxite etc Blended Cements substantially improves durability of Concrete Structures and prevents environmental deterioration, thus the structures do not require rehabilitation, there by contributing to sustainability Development of Application Oriented Cements: Special premium grade application oriented cements have developed Fly ash Based: Concrete Plus, ACC Gold, Slag Based Cements: Coastal Plus, F2R (Foundation to Roof) A specially developed Slag Cement, which have faster setting, high early strengths but due to slag component provides decreased permeability in concrete with increased resistance to chloride and sulphate penetration and attack on concrete. This prevents reinforcement corrosion and thereby enhances durability of concrete structures ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [27] Foundation to Roof Cement , A specially developed Slag Cement, which have faster setting, high early strengths but due to slag component provides decreased permeability in concrete with increased resistance to chloride and sulphate penetration and attack on concrete. This prevents reinforcement corrosion and thereby enhances durability of concrete structures A specially developed PPC which has fast setting properties and early strengths comparable to OPC, hence provides alternative in market to OPC for the customers and compared to OPC would enhance durability of concrete structures due to fly ash component, the GHG impact is much lower to OPC It is the only one of its kind specially formulated cement with higher strength, enhanced durability. Water repelling Cement particles in the concrete structure prevents water ingress at early, as well as later ages in the Durable water resistant PPC Concrete, thus enhancing the durability quotient. It also reduces rising dampness in brickwork when used in mortar ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [28] EN1: Materials used by weight or volume Raw Material Unit 2012 2011 2010 Limestone Million Tonnes 22.07 22.69 18.729 Gypsum Million Tonnes 1.185 1.14 1.075 Others1 Million Tonnes 1.50 1.51 -Raw Material (Recycled Unit 2012 2011 2010 waste material) Alternative Raw Materials Million Tonnes 0.245 0.18 0.273 Slag Million Tonnes 2.44 2.68 2.286 Flyash Million Tonnes 4.35 3.98 3.879 Additives Unit 2012 2011 2010 Additives2 Million Tonnes 0.017 0.018 1.652 Associated materials Unit 2012 2011 2010 Lubricating Oil Tonnes 813 890 921 Grease Tonnes 226 211 208 Packaging Materials Unit 2012 2011 2010 Weight of Bags Consumed Tonnes 31969 29523 29131 1.

Our units embark every year on unique drive for Sustainable Business Development to maintain a perfect balance between manufacturing, ecology and society. 3.1 Energy As part of “Institutionalizing Excellence”, Communities of Excellence (COEs) were formed at PAN ACC to reduce energy intensity across the Key Performance Indicators. 1) Electrical Energy Community 2) Thermal Energy Community 3) Clinker Factor Community 4) Captive Power Plant Community 5) Thermal Substitution Rate (TSR) Community Each Community was led by a Plant Director as Community Leader, with Champions for each COE at designated Plants and plant level champions at each plant. Energy Circles were formed for each process area at each plant. Some of the activities by the COE were a) Aspiration setting for each plant by carrying out section wise Gap analysis against the best achieved performance of 2011 & Bench marking of the equipment with similar equipment in other plants b) Plant visits were carried out to identify projects and finalize the plant road maps to achieve the aspirations c) Preparing Training Modules for enhancing capabilities d) Conducting Boot camps to build individual and institutional capabilities ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [30] Concurrently another initiative by the acronym EARN (Energy Activation across Regional Network) was started across South East Asia region of Holcim. The 5 Pillars of this initiative are: 1) Reduction of Energy intensity 2) Optimization of Fuel Mix & Increase in AFR 3) Proactive Energy Management 4) Excellence in buying energy 5) Energy Business participation. These initiatives created a basis for providing opportunities for regular sharing of best practices and ideas across the organization as well as for internal and external benchmarking. A notable feature of the programme is the creation of model plants characterized by their best performance, best practices, infrastructure and setting up a good training culture. Major part of the year was spent in streamlining the process, idea creation, identifying projects requiring major Capex and processing Capex request and getting projects approved for implementation. Many projects leading to reduction in specific energy were ordered out and some of the low cost / low cycle time projects were implemented during the year. New benchmarks in performance have been created by several plants with notable achievements in reducing specific thermal energy consumption, specific electrical energy and outstanding results in reducing the percentage of clinker factor. A new milestone was also achieved by one plant when it successfully switched to 100 per cent use of pet-coke. Driven by the Communities of Excellence, ACC executed many energy saving projects, which are collectively listed as below, which influenced our energy performance 1) Installation of Low Voltage & Medium Voltage Variable Speed Drives for fans, pumps and compressors across ACC plants. Many LV & MV VSD’s were also ordered towards the end of the year. 2) Replacement of Existing Separator with High Efficiency V-Separator ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [31] 3) Installation of New Air Cooled condenser in place of existing condenser to increase the de-rated generation capacity in the Captive Power Plant 4) Installation of High efficiency fan impellers 5) Installation of Rota-scale for coal feeding 6) Conducted Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Study to improve flow across cyclones, thereby reducing the pressure drop and fan power consumption 7) Conducted detailed Energy Audits to identify fresh energy conservation projects. 8) Installation of Capacitor banks to the individual systems across ACC plants to improve plant power factor. 9) Replacement of conventional lamps with Compact Fluorescent Lamps and LED light for plant and colony lighting. 10) Conducted ISO 50001 Certification Audit at 4 of our plants. 11) Optimisation of :Vertical Roller Mills & Ball Mills to improve output, clinker cooler to reduce radiation losses , and compressed air distribution system to reduce pressure drop and power consumption EN3: Direct energy consumption by primary energy source Energy Consumption Unit 2012 2011 2010 Coal + Pet Coke consumption TJ 46933 48983 42086 in Kiln Diesel Oil consumption in Kiln TJ 52 62 56 Alternative Fossil fuels* TJ 164 111 331 consumed in Kiln Alternative Bio-mass TJ 396 156 123 consumed in Kiln Diesel Oil consumption for TJ 563 554 550 Onsite vehicle movement Fuels for drying of raw TJ 1124 1262 --materials# Coal for onsite power TJ 24602 24515 23767 generation Diesel Oil consumption for TJ 32 35 63 Onsite power generation Biomass for Onsite Power TJ 42 60 --generation# *As per WBCSD protocol Alternative fossil fuel comprises of waste oil, waste tyres, plastics, solvents, impregnated saw dust etc. # Started reporting from 2011 as advised by SD assurance provider ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [32] Specific energy consumption Energy Consumption Unit 2012 2011 2010 Specific power consumption KWH / Tonne 73.39 73.61 76.17 upto & including clinker of Clinker production Specific power consumption KWH / Tonne of 85.37 86.35 88.26 upto & including cement Cementitious grinding Material Specific power consumption KWH / Tonne of 87.75 88.93 90.85 including cement grinding, Cementitious colony, auxiliaries Material Specific total power KWH / Tonne of 90.01 90.93 92.86 consumption including Cementitious cement grinding, colony, Material auxiliaries & packing Specific thermal energy GJ / Tonne of 3.076 3.101 3.137 consumption Clinker EN4: Indirect energy consumption by primary source Electrical Energy Purchased Unit 2012 2011 2010 Electricity Purchased MWH / Annum 606200 701929 588514 EN5: Energy saved due to conservation and efficiency improvements (Partial list of energy conservation initiatives during 2012 and corresponding annualized savings) Plant Electrical Energy Conservation Initiatives Savings in Lakh kWh Wadi Reducing the dam ring height in RM2 to 23.76 reduce Main Drive load and increase feed Madukkarai Replacement of Dynamic separator in 19.49 Cement Mill VRPM with Static separator cum settling chamber Jamul Grinding media optimization & pattern 13.78 change in cement mill Wadi Operating Raw Mill 1 & Raw Mill 2 Fan with 20.46 GRR for speed control Chanda Optimisation of Distribution transformers 6.67 Madukkarai Modification in the Settling Chamber to 5.25 improve the efficiency from 50 to 65% Jamul Optimization of kiln 3 Pre heater fan and K-2 4.96 exhauster fan Lakheri Modification of wobbler discharge chute and 4.11 clamshell gate at mines to increase wobbler output Plant Thermal Energy Conservation Initiatives Saving in Lakh Kcal Chanda Recuperation efficiency was improved by 76947.3 operating secondary air at 1100°C & tertiary air at 915°C Chanda Optimised cooler operation thereby Reducing 63951.7 clinker temperature by 20°C ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [33] Chanda Reducing Pre Heater Outlet Temperature by 41380.5 5˚C Chanda Optimization of burner momentum 34198.8 (current-4.5-5.5) to (7.5-8.0 NMw) Lakheri Improvement in Raw Mix & Fuel Mix 30400.7 Chanda Optimised cooler fan efficiency thereby 18467.3 reducing excess air in cooler and reducing temperature by 5°C EN6: Initiatives to provide energy-efficient or renewable energy based products and services, and reductions in energy requirements as a result of these initiatives More than 2.34 Lakh Some Part of our electrical energy consumption is obtained from our renewable energy source which is used for manufacturing cement.

For recirculation and reuse of water used for extracting heat from equipment used in cement manufacturing process, a closed loop cooling system is used with one ID (Induced draft) cross flow cooling tower with two shells. This cooling tower has five pumps installed to supply the cold water for oil coolers, injection into mills and compressors for entire cement mill and packing house operation. Out of these 5 pumps, two pumps run at a time for 24 hours. Hot water returning from the process goes to HOT well and from HOT well it is again pumped to the top of cooling tower as well as for spray system for cooling. The schematic is given below: Fig 1: Schematic of existing system at CMU section ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [34] Modification in the process water flow line After detailed study of the system, the same was modified, whereby the return header was connected with the cooling tower pump and Spray pump discharge header so that the running of Cooling tower pump and spray pump are avoided. The pressure in the return header was sufficient to move the hot water up to the height of cooling tower. The modified scheme is shown in figure 2 below: Fig 2: Schematic of modified system at Pre grinder section Cost Benefit Analysis Annual electricity savings: 1.845 Lakh kWh Savings from electrical energy saving: ` 9.098 Lakh Total investment required: ` 2 Lakh Payback period: 2.63 months Lower maintenance required 2. CFD study helps to reduce pressure drop across cyclone and dust accumulation at cyclone inlet Most of the solutions can be achieved in cost effective manner Accumulation of dust at the cyclone inlet is very common problem faced by a cement plants. But to get it resolved in a cost effective way is seldom achieved. Similar problem was encountered by Kymore plant, where dust layer of about 500mm used to get accumulated at the inlet of 4th cyclone of pre-heater tower. This excessive dust was leading to reduction in cyclone efficiency and also an increase in pressure drop, resulting in higher power consumption of the fan. Kymore plant referred this issue to Techport, Thane an ACC-Ambuja Cement Ltd Modified system Technical support centre. Based on Computational Fluid Dynamics study done at Techport, plant was advised to modify the cyclone inlet to guide the flow towards the circumference of the ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [35] cyclone inlet. With this modification, the dust accumulation has reduced to a large extent. More significantly, this modification improved the efficiency of cyclone and reduction in overall pressure drop of preheater leading to substantial power power.

The objective of developing a new logistics management system through SPEED was stimulate efficiency and productivity along with saving on freight costs and reducing the detention time of vehicles at its cement plants. Earlier vehicles were originally labelled with barcode labels for tracking, which started to deteriorate and be obscured by dirt, which sometimes caused failure in registering the vehicle. Sometimes tracking the location of the vehicles at any stage of the loading process due to high volume was extremely difficult. SPEED has given the logistics team the functionality to monitor real-time in-plant movement of vehicles and improve the overall safety inside the plant. Now, with the help of RFID based tracking, seasonal and occasional trucks coming to the plants for loading during lean seasons can be sorted out and more focus can be given to the dedicated and regular fleet. In addition, parking yard infrastructure can now be better utilized by the dedicated fleet. This project has helped the company to improve the performance of the distribution fleet. An RFID tag composed of an antenna or coupling element bearing a unique identifier is attached on the vehicle. RFID readers communicate with these tags through a radio frequency channel to obtain identifying information and display it. The technology assures regular tracking on real-time basis, access control and better supply chain management. RFID technology offers several significant advantages over barcodes (the earlier technology) such as long distance scanning without manual intervention, more data capacity, more legible and quicker reading and faster processing even in adverse conditions such as dirt and dust. It also facilitates rapid product movement and measure detention time at each stage of truck loading and thus the utilization of assets within the plant. SPEED was successfully implemented in ACC’s Tikaria Cement Works followed by Damodhar Cement Works and Thondebhavi Cement Works. The company plans to roll out the system to all of its 17 plants in two years. This project was named SPEED as it guarantees Safety of the stakeholders, Productivity of the packers, Efficient utilization of the assets and Ensuring customer Delight.

ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [39] 3.3 Atmospheric Emissions: Cement Industry by its nature of manufacturing is prone to generate dust & gaseous emissions. The emissions from cement manufacturing can be classified as (a) Stack Emissions Dust & Gaseous Emissions (b) Fugitive Emissions ACC has incorporated various control measures to minimize these emissions on continuous basis. Stack Emissions: ACC is continuously upgrading the existing Air Pollution Control equipments / installing new equipments to meet the requirements of latest emission norms. Some of the initiatives in this direction are listed below: (a) Commissioning of 8 high efficiency bag filters at different locations at Gagal (b) Modification of bag filter for Cement mill at Damodhar (c) Modification of bag filters at different locations at Kymore (d) Modification of bag filters at different locations at Madukkarai (e) Modification of bag filters for cement mill & clinker hopper at Chanda Apart from these Capex intensive projects, ACC has also upgrading its emission monitoring systems continuously. In line with this, ACC has installed Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS) in its Kiln stacks and also provided Opacity Monitors for other process stacks wherever required. During the Year 2012 ACC has installed CEMs for the following Kiln Stacks: Wadi I Chaibasa Madukkarai SO2 and NOX Emissions: With CEMS in place, we are tracking SO2 and NOX emissions in real time which is helping us to take immediate corrective actions on the process to control the emissions. It also helps us to prepare for the upcoming regulations on SO2 & NOX emissions.

The increase in SO2 emissions is due to increased clinker production at Chanda Cement Works from previous year. There is a slight increase in NOX emissions during 2012 when compared with 2011. During the year 2012, by implementing various air pollution control equipment measures which are indicated above has resulted in decreasing our absolute dust emissions by ~14% when compared with 2011 absolute dust emissions. Fugitive Dust Emissions: ACC has been continuously implementing various measures to control the fugitive dust emissions. Some of the initiatives taken in this direction during the year 2012 are as given below: Installation of various equipments to control fugitive dust emissions at many plants Road sweeping machine at Bargarh ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [41] In addition to control measures, we have also installed Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) to measure the ambient air quality at our premises. In 2012, CAAQMS was installed at Thondebhavi Cement Works, Kudithini Cement Works and Tikaria Cement Works CAAQMS Station installed at Tikaria & Kudithini The information on the measured ambient air quality by CAAQMS installed at various plants is being uploaded continuously on CPCB website. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [42] 3.4 Mineral Resources Management: Since ACC operates several limestone mines, ecosystems restoration and biodiversity conservation is a significant aspect to be taken care of. None of the ACC sites fall under or adjacent to any Protected Area. Environmental Impact Assessment studies conducted at all operational units including mines, concludes that there has not been any significant changes to natural habitats at site. To ensure minimum impact to biodiversity, closure plans are prepared as and when required, for rehabilitation of relevant areas. Mined out areas are then rehabilitated such that they are restored to a level nearing original state or one which is considered to be healthy for the ecosystem. EN12: Description of significant impacts of activities, products, and services on biodiversity in protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas The company realizes that our activities have an impact on biodiversity though not very significant as concluded in Environment Impact Assessment studies conducted so far. As per EIA, none of the locations have identified any significant environmental impacts to natural habitats due to operational activities. All locations of ACC have Environment Clearances from Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India. EN13: Habitats protected or restored ACC adopts all measures to ensure least damage to nearby habitat. All the quarries of ACC are worked out and restored / rehabilitated according to the approved mine plan including progressive mine closure plan. EN14: Strategies, current actions, and future plans for managing impacts on biodiversity Acknowledging the fact that activities have an impact on the environment and biodiversity no matter how minimal it is, it is our responsibility to manage those impacts. We aspire to restore important habitats and ecosystems at all locations through rehabilitation of our quarries. Native species of trees are chosen to afforest the land to retain the uniqueness of the ecosystem and to avoid the infestation by invasive species. Speciesspecific conservation plan have been developed at locations wherever required, under the recommendation and guidance of regulatory authorities. A Progressive Mine Closure Plan is included in the Mining Plan which is validated from time to time and resubmitted for approval to IBM as and when required. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [43] In 2012, a biodiversity study was undertaken at one of the site, in collaboration with IUCN. The study outcome is being referred to formulate the further action plan not just for that respective site but also for other units as well. EN15: Number of IUCN Red List species and national conservation list species with habitats in areas affected by operations, by level of extinction risk No IUCN Red List species or Schedule I fauna have been reported in any of the Environmental Impact Assessment studies conducted at the company’s plant locations. Afforestation at Mined out land Our mining sites encompass various types of landscapes including extracted area / mined out land at locations. By reclaiming these sites for a better ecological system, we attempt to minimize the impact of our operations on biodiversity and ecosystem. We believe that water harvesting and afforestation activities can contribute significantly to biodiversity conservation. Therefore we dedicate our concerted efforts in implementing above two practices at all our sites. We engage local communities and organizations for carrying out water harvesting and tree plantation. In 2012, total 93,376 numbers of trees were planted at ACC. Local native species such as Acacia nilotica, Lucenea leucocephala, Delonix regia etc were chosen for plantation at respective locations depending on the climate, geographical location and suitability, in consultation with local forest department. Since these species are adapted to local condition, they grow fast and also help in maintaining the local ecological balance. Specific targets of tree plantation are set by individual units. Most of the afforestation activities are undertaken by school students on various occasions and events celebrated in plants such as Earth Day, Environment Day, Mines week etc. Total area equivalent to 35 hectares has been afforested in year 2012. Please refer section 3.6 for water harvesting initiatives. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [44] 3.5 Alternative Fuels & Raw Materials: ACC firmly believes that organizations today need to demonstrate the will to tackle sustainability challenges and enhance triple bottom line performance in every aspect of business. This belief has remained a foundation of our operations and has translated to a successful initiative towards exploring new forms of alternative fossil fuel energy and alternative raw material sources. ACC recognized very early on that the dire challenge of increasing waste (industrial & municipal) volumes on one hand and fast depletion of natural resources on the other hand could be addressed through innovative green thinking. Given the vast technical expertise and research experience available with us in the field of cement technology, ACC took the lead in research and development to demonstrate that the waste disposal through co-processing in cement kilns is the ideal solution to this challenge. Our initiative to encourage waste co-processing in cement kilns across the country under the aegis of Geocycle has grown from strength to strength. This initiative solves a growing problem by encouraging the philosophy of industrial ecology. Wastes from industries which would otherwise have been disposed through land filling or incineration without any resource/energy recovery are safely co-processed in our cement kilns. Through Geocycle we are offering sustainable waste management services/solutions to different industrial sectors such as automobiles, rubber, chemicals & allied industries, pharmaceuticals, food & beverages, FMCG, machinery manufacturing, petrochemicals, refineries, pulp & paper, steel, sugar & distillery, toy manufacturing etc Any resource or energy value inherent in the waste is utilized as alternative fuel or alternative raw material in our manufacturing process. We are encouraging the use of Alternative fuels and raw materials (AFR) across our units in India in keeping with our commitment to work towards sustainable development. ACC is further strengthening its co-processing infrastructure by investing in state of the art feeding systems, storage areas and pre and co-processing platforms to ensure that we can provide more sustainable and environmentally sound waste management solutions for larger waste volumes. ACC has been in the forefront to ensure greater responsibility by cement companies ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [45] while using AFR and has ensured that usage of AFR is governed by an “Alternative Fuels & Raw Materials Policy” policy across the company. The cornerstone of co-processing operations at ACC Limited is Occupational Health and Safety. At ACC, OH&S is based on thorough information, efficient risk assessment, and complete implementation of all preventive measures. The OH&S vision of ‘no harm anywhere to anyone associated with ACC’ is followed in letter and spirit and we ensure highest safety standards for our employees, business partners as well as communities surrounding our facilities. We kicked off an internal safety audit for all our co-processing facilities (ACert) in 2010. By 2012 we have conducted a preliminary ACert assessment in all our facilities and final third party audit by M/s DNV has been completed in 3 facilities (Chaibasa Cement Works, Kymore Cement Works and Lakheri Cement Works). Taking forward the commitment to sustainable development ACC has also extended support to various municipal bodies for disposal of waste plastics from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). We have signed MoUs with Municipalities from the States of Himachal, Madhya Pradesh, Goa and Odisha to provide environmentally sound management of segregated plastic waste. This initiative of acting as a partner to society by offering sustainable waste management services for sorted municipal waste was continued in the year 2012. Engaging with our stakeholders with open & transparent communication with them is a critical part of the way we manage our business. ACC communicates with wide range of stakeholders in many forms. Communicating transparently with all its stakeholders is a key principle of ACC’s AFR policy. In the year 2012 we laid focus on communicating with our stakeholders through a wide variety of platforms and sharing information transparently regarding our operations of co-processing. To encourage open sharing of all activities carried out by Geocycle amongst our internal stakeholders a quarterly newsletter was initiated. We also made presentations in various interaction forums and seminars all across India to create awareness about co-processing technology. These forums saw a representation from our various stakeholders such as NGOs, regulatory bodies, Industrial bodies, academicians etc. EN2: Percentage of materials used that are recycled input materials. Parameter Unit 2012 2011 2010 Recycled Raw Materials Used % 22.09 21.23 23.09 Thermal Substitution Rate % 2.2 0.53 1.1 Key initiatives and achievements: Signing of contract with 24 new industries Tonnage contribution of Industrial waste jumped, in 2012, by 26 % over 2011 Eight successful third party emission monitoring trial burns conducted across ACC in 2012 EN26: Initiatives to mitigate environmental impacts of products and services, and extent of impact mitigation The waste management solution/services extended by ACC to other Industries and municipalities through co-processing is a proven environmentally sound solution. This solution lies higher on the waste management hierarchy compared to traditional methods of secured land filling and incineration. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [46] In spite of Co-processing being an environmentally safe solution ACC remains committed to ensuring that any possible impacts on environment or surrounding communities are avoided through the precautionary approach. Some initiatives for the same are as follows: Information about each co-processable waste is collected, reviewed and communicated in simplified language as a work place label. ACC has built appropriate feeding systems and made storage arrangements for handling wastes in isolation ensuring appropriate spill control and fire fighting measures. People handling wastes are trained on the risks and hazards associated with it along with the required controls and emergency response actions. ACC has established state-of-the-art laboratories for assessing the co-processability of wastes at following locations. > ACC R&D at Thane, Maharashtra > ACC Kymore Cement Works, MP > ACC Wadi Cement Works, Karnataka > ACC Madukkarai Cement Works, Tamil Nadu > ACC Bargarh Cement Works, Odisha In order to demonstrate safe & environment-friendly disposal of wastes, several plant-scale trial runs have been conducted at ACC Plants. ODS disposal in cement Kilns @ ACC Kymore Ozone depleting substances (ODS’s) are chlorine and bromine-based chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC’s), halons used for air conditioning, refrigeration and fire extinguishing equipment etc. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of ODS can be several hundred to several thousand times more than carbon dioxide and its safe disposal is a challenging task. With an aspiration of providing sustainable solution to the waste management through co-processing under the brand name of GEOCYCLE, ACC has undertaken various co-processing trial of difficult industrial wastes in past few years. In 2012, the company once again demonstrated its capability to dispose one of the most difficult wastes i.e. ODS, safely. In December 2012, ACC’s Kymore, along with Geocycle Team, carried out the trial of ODS destruction at its kiln no. 2 where an appropriate facility was set up encompassing all appropriate instruments and equipments. Requisite safety measures were put into place to ensure its safe destruction. A risk assessment was carried out to identify any associated risks and mitigation actions. The facility operators and workers are provided with proper training sessions to understand the detailed process and operation of its destruction. The system was based on logics for its start up and shut off operation and controlled from CCR. The CFCs were fed to the kiln along with primary air through blower. In order to demonstrate complete destruction of CFCs fed to the kiln, Destruction and Removal Efficiency (DRE) Assessment was conducted. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), existing cement kilns, when properly operated, can destroy most organic compounds because the temperature in the burning zone is over 1500ºC and residence times are up to 10 seconds. The alkaline nature of the material being processed in the kiln neutralizes the acid gases formed by the destruction of CFCs. Thus ODS were safely disposed through co-processing in cement kiln without any impact on the cement process, emissions or the final product. For ACC, Kymore unit and Geocycle, it was a remarkable achievement which has enhanced everybody’s confidence to deal with difficult wastes. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [47] 3.6 Water & Waste Management: We at ACC continuously strive to minimize our water foot print during our manufacturing process. Lot of emphasis is given to minimize water consumption by implementing various measures like up-gradation of process, arresting the leakages, reuse, recycle of water wherever possible. Our plants harvest rain water in our mined out pits which helps us to use this water for our manufacturing purposes and reducing the dependency on surface or ground water. Apart from reducing the impact on environment, the harvested water also serves as recharging pit for ground water, thereby improving the ground water level in the surrounding areas which will have a positive impact on the environment. We also harvest rain water in our plant & colony premises and in communities under CSR activities. Two of our manufacturing facilities namely Jamul Cement Works & Kymore Cement Works are running completely on harvested rainwater in the mined out pits without depending on any other water sources. Rain water harvesting in mined out pit at Bargarh ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [48] EN8: Total water withdrawal by source* (For Plant, Captive power plant, Colony and nearby Communities) Source of Water Unit 2012 2011 2010 Surface Water Million M3 8.18 8.85 5.46 Harvested Rain Water Million M3 8.16 7.66 5.10 Municipal Water Supplies Million M3 0.048 0.016 0.061 Ground Water Million M3 1.34 1.23 1.41 *Partial quantities are based on meter readings where available while the rest is calculated Few of the initiatives taken in water management during 2012: At Chanda Cement Works, we have created two rain water harvesting ponds, to which are connected all storm water drains of entire plant area. The rain water harvesting pits serves to harvest rain water and as well as recharging the ground water by the recharge bore well which is attached to harvesting pond. The capacity of rain water harvesting pit is around 7000 m3. Rainwater Harvesting Pond at Chanda At Kudithini Cement Works, we have a created rain water harvesting ponds inside the plant premises with an approximate capacity of 1200 m3. All the rain water is being collected in these ponds. The rain water harvesting pond helps in recharging the ground water as well as improves the aesthetic look of the entire area. Rainwater Harvesting Pond at Kudithini ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [49] At Thondebhavi Cement Works, Vertical Roller Mill (VRM) has started to operate with ZERO table water spray and successfully stopped heating of the system during mill start-up which saved LDO as well as huge water consumption. At Jamul Cements works, initiatives taken for minimizing water consumption during manufacturing process are as follows: 1. Water savings in Captive Power Plant (CPP) cooling tower by increasing the Cycle of Concentration (COC) 2. Water savings in Gas Conditioning Towers (GCT) by installing VVFD for the pump motor 3. Water savings by installation of float valve in all the over head tanks to stop over flow of water EN9: Water Source significantly affected by withdrawal of water No significant impact reported on the water sources affected by withdrawal of water. In reference to EN8 & EN10, we are increasing our water consumption from harvested rainwater and thereby decreasing the dependency on other water sources. Apart from shifting the source of water consumption, we are also increasing our recycling & reuse capacity gradually. At Chaibasa Cement Works, we have installed a Sewage Treatment Plant with a capacity of 600m3/day. The treated waste water is used for dust suppression and gardening in & around plant premises.

ACC has invested in various areas like upgradation of pollution control measures, CEMS, dust suppression systems, rainwater harvesting, air pollution control equipment, green belt development, environmental training & awareness, road sweeping machine etc. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [51] ACC believes in its human capital and always strives to impart technical training to update the knowledge which helps the individuals to grow and can contribute better to the organization. Various training programs are organized at corporate level and at individual plant levels. Trainings are conducted by in-house experts as well as external speakers depending upon the topics. Annual Meet of Environmental Engineers ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [52] 3.7 Sustainable Construction Concrete Roads Popularity of Concrete Roads has been increasing due to its higher resistance to aggressive & different climatic conditions like heavy rainfall & extreme temperature/ weather changes in many parts of country. Current Bitumen roads deteriorate faster due to lower resistance to abrasion caused due to heavy traffic , heavy axel loads and harsh metal wheels. Also such surfaces of such roads get damaged faster under rapid changes of weather, heavy rainfall and ground water. Over a period, concrete roads offer proven economies of 15-25% in fuel consumption and 10-15% savings in vehicle running costs. In the above context, sustainability of concrete roads, lower carbon footprint cannot be overlooked. To improve awareness and training in respect to Concrete Roads various Seminars and Awareness Workshops were organized. ACC along with Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) created a platform to improve awareness with stakeholders. Seminars have been held in various cities like Delhi, Gwalior, Shimla, Bhopal, Jaipur etc. ACC & CII have also been working closely with central & state governments. ACC has initiated activities to spread awareness on the benefits of concrete roads. To take this initiative forward to next level, we need to upgrade the skills of the personnel in the field of concrete road construction. Hence Technical & Knowledge Sharing Programmes were conducted in many cities. These were done in Jabalpur, Indore, Chindwara, Sagar, Ratlam, Dewas etc. Skill Development programme were also done for masons and supervisors in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Madhya Pradesh (MP) covering some major topics such as correct ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [53] manufacturing of concrete, concrete mix preparation, testing of concrete, use of equipments, concrete surface compaction, groove cutting and importance of curing. A total of 24 such programmes have been conducted covering more than 1000 engineers from govt. road sector and 960 masons and supervisors from road building contractors. We in ACC believe that making infrastructure like good and strong concrete roads will help in building a solid platform for India’s economy to grow. This will also help in connecting rural and semi urban areas of India with Urban cities of India creating job opportunities in each segment. The experience of those who have built concrete roads in recent years in the cities of Mumbai, Surat, Indore and Hyderabad demonstrates even greater economies. An important fact not usually considered in life cycle cost analyses is that concrete roads continue to serve long after their declared useful life. Examples like Mumbai’s famed Marine Drive and Express ways like Mumbai Pune Express Road made of concrete are proving its worth and endures all. In fact Mumbai’s Marine Drive must have paid back its costs decades ago. Affordable Housing As a step towards providing affordable housing to the rural population ACC has started an initiative to design and construct affordable housing for this segment 2 years back. Just to name few places, during last year we have completed 25 units in Hoshangabad, 50 units in Mandla, 25 units in Sagar, 50 units in Chindwara, 25 units in Betul. Most of these units were built with trained masons who were given 2 days training on the subject. Total 560 units have been completed till Dec 2012. No. of beneficiaries and masons training in AFH covered are 560 nos in M.P. through 7 program session at various centers. Joint session with selected builders of Rajasthan was also organized to cover AFH in urban areas. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [54] Public Positions: Lobbying: ACC is continuously engaged with various regulatory authorities, industrial bodies like TERI, CII, NCBM, FIMI, BCC, CSI etc., in formulating new regulations and updating the existing norms to meet the changing requirements. Interactions with various regulatory authorities like Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) Co-chaired the Sector Expert Committee for Cement Sector along with Government of India, Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) to streamline the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) Scheme for Cement Sector. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [55] 4 Social Performance 4.1 Community Engagement SO1: Percentage of operations with implemented local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs One of the key stakeholders for the company are the communities living around its operations. The company actively assists these communities in identifying prioritising and meeting their developmental aspirations through periodic needs assessment surveys. A detailed five year action plan is developed in consultation with the local communities that addresses the needs assessed in survey. This action plan is further divided into year wise action plans based on the priorities decided by the community. The implementation of these yearly plans is then continuously monitored to ensure that they respond to the needs expressed by the communities. ACC’s CSR initiatives focus on holistic development of host communities and create social, environmental, and economic value for the society. CSR initiatives are delivered by company’s CSR team in partnership with reputed NGOs and government organisations. A formal Community Advisory Panel (CAP) is constituted at each plant location, consisting of relevant local stakeholders and opinion leaders such as panchayat representatives, villagers, district officials and union representatives among others. The panels have proven to be valuable in presenting stakeholder views and ensuring appropriate delivery of plan initiatives. CAP meetings typically focus on activities like planning, sharing of information on various aspects and project implementation. Whenever needed, CAP meetings are facilitated by respective local ACC teams, active engagement and support of the CAP at each plant location has enabled the company to strengthen the participation of the local community in village development initiatives. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [56] A Stakeholder Engagement Survey is conducted on a yearly basis, wherein all stakeholders particularly the community members are involved to discuss effectiveness of each CSR initiative’s implementation. Community offers its feedback on progress and outcomes of the projects conducted during the year. This helps in making the CSR initiatives more appropriate to community needs and enhance the sustainability. Meetings with the villagers and their representative bodies, helps to reviewing the progress of community projects, obtain timely feedback from stakeholders, gain recognition for the efforts made and most importantly to take corrective measures as and when required to ensure that resources are utilized more effectively and optimally.

Community level HIV intervention programs Information Education and Communication (IEC) activities Move towards a better quality of life ACC collaborates with the community and local bodies to improve the environment they live in. The upward shift in quality of life is notable at several locations. ‘Clean and Green Habitat’ project at Madukkarai, initiated in early 2012, is notably successful project in this genre. It has created and strengthened a mechanism for effective disposal of solid and domestic waste in the project area. This initiative is a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with Madukkarai Town Panchayat and ‘Hand in Hand’, a local NGO. Clean Green Madukkarai has created a clean habitat for 8500 households with a population of 35,000 people. About 120 tonnes of segregated waste is collected and effectively reused and disposed every month. Nearly half of the waste is bio composted. About 1.5 tonnes of plastic waste is consumed by the cement kiln as an alternative fuel. The fuel costs for transporting the solid waste have drastically reduced than earlier years due to this project. Sanitary workers and Garbage collectors from the community are called ‘Green Friends’. Forty five Green Friends jobs have been created leading to regular employment in this project. A green belt has been planned around the habitat and the community has already planted thousand saplings. Success is owed to active participation of community, consistent engagement of Madukkarai Panchayat for this notable transformation through ACC’s initiative.

SO9 Operations with significant potential or actual negative impacts on local communities SO10 Prevention and mitigation measures implemented in operations with significant potential or actual negative impacts on local communities ACC is among the first Indian companies to include commitment to environmental protection as one of its corporate objectives. Long before pollution control norms and regulatory laws came into existence, ACC inducted the use of sophisticated high efficiency pollution control equipment for cement kilns, raw mills, coal mills, power plants and coolers, in 1966. Today ACC factory has high efficiency state-of-the art pollution control equipment and devices. ACC is the industry ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [61] leader in the urgent race to reduce CO2 emissions. Our performance is seen by independent sources to be best in class. We have established systems and procedures to manage improvements in the control of greenhouse gases and atmospheric emissions and water harvesting. All these effort has minimised the adverse impact, if any, on the community due to our operations. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [62] 4.2 Employment Practices On employment front, we strive to maintain a competitive and favourable working environment. We believe that workplace should be such that employees are highly motivated to achieve company’s as well as individual’s objective. For last two years, ACC has been working to develop a learning culture to foster internal growth, to become more responsive to changing needs and to synergize HR professionals to achieve excellence. We aim to offer a workplace to our employees where everyone feels proud to work and also inspire others. In 2012, we started with our People Excellence journey to re-engineer our existing processes and align to the Business Excellence journey. We focused on designing and improving the following People Practices: 1. Recruitment and On-Boarding 2. Talent Management and Capability Building 3. Workmen Development ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [63] To meet the business challenges around growth, performance and market & business environment we have designed our HR strategy around the People Excellence model described in picture above. Recruitment and On-Boarding Our Recruitment Philosophy strives to : > Hire freshers from campus and build internal talent pipeline > Restrict lateral hiring to 50-60 people per year to infuse fresh blood Robust recruitment process is put in place where by > Trainees are hired from identified colleges only 15 colleges for MBAs and 25 colleges for GETs > Selection criteria is decided to hire ACC fit > Building Brand equity initiatives to ensure first day slot in GET campuses > Campus interview panel members are selected and trained on ‘Target Selection workshop’ Impact of the initiative: 15 } MBA Colleges identified for GETs Colleges identified for 25 } recruitment Line managers trained on selection 90 } process Out of 25 GET Colleges where ACC 21 } got Day 1 slot On-boarding Philosophy which helps in > Improving the effectiveness of training provided to trainees > Improving retention rate > Develop a robust handholding process for trainees so that they can take on the line role On-boarding Process consists of: > Three year on-boarding program designed for the trainees, which includes a blend of classroom training, on-the-job tasks and mentoring. > Skill builder which was created for Graduate Engineers and B.Sc trainees with help of line managers includes ~ 18-21 modules across the value chain (production and sales value chain). > On-boarding centres were created for trainees in Sales Units (SU) and Plants.

ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [72] 4.3 Occupational Health & Safety At ACC, we believe that OH&S is an integral part of our business and Safety is our License to lead. We have various safety management systems & programs like OH&S Pyramid, Fatality Prevention Elements (FPE’s), Contractor Safety Management (CSM), Cardinal Rules, Safety Observation Tours (SOT’s), Job Safety Assessments (JSA), etc. to ensure a systematic approach to inculcate OH&S into organization processes and to ensure involvement and participation of each employee of the organization in our journey towards Zero Harm. Risk assessment process is integral part of any job/activity. We have in place risk assessment tools to help Line Managers to evaluate risk in their work areas and activities. This helps them to identify high risk areas and incorporate appropriate controls in place to reduce the risk. Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) workshops have been continued at sites to improve skills of employees on management of Hazards to reduce risk. Apart from our own employees, contractors are being involved in HIRA workshop, which shows a remarkable change in the attitude of contractors towards safety. A pocket size card called “Job Start Card” has been introduced presently in six cement plants to provide employees with a simple to follow and quick risk assessment tool at fingertips. Risk Assessment Teams (RATs) have been introduced at all the sites, which are dedicated teams of personnel, trained to conduct systematic risk assessments of hazards identified in the workplace. A Behaviour based safety training program “ACC Chetna” was launched in June 2012. In this program the employees were trained to practice 5 simple behaviours that can prevent injuries at workplace as well as at home. We have covered more than 16000 employees including contract workmen in the program resulting in improvement in safety behaviours. ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [73] Visible Safety Leadership programs have been conducted across business units for senior line managers with special emphasis given to Top Management. The program comprises of practical exercises and interactive sessions and prepares line managers to be a role model to their subordinates by leading safety visibly in the field. Concept of Safety Champions has been successfully established and aims to involve and engage line managers in safety by way of execution of short term safety projects in a deputed site. Approx. 178 line managers have been trained and worked as Safety Champions. A concept of “Safety Circle” has been rolled out across ACC plants to promote safety ownership amongst line management. The intent of this concept was to involve as well as to engage shop floor employees including contractor workforce to identify safety concerns and execute safety projects for focused improvements in their respective work areas. The design safety aspects have been reviewed from time to time particularly for project work to ensure the technical integrity of our plants and equipments. Shut down protocols have been developed for addressing all applicable OH&S aspects during plant shut downs. Safety procedures for commissioning have been established for projects. To improve our safety in Logistics a program entitled “Logistics Safety Excellence” was implemented from June 2012. The program focuses primarily on ensuring roadworthiness of contractor vehicles, training of drivers and the development of onsite traffic management systems along with amenities for drivers. Our focus on Occupation Health has been on keeping our employees healthy, having effective sustainable Emergency Medical Response (EMR) system and making our work places healthy. The robust health surveillance system and pro-wellness programs on prevention of life style diseases, nutrition, fitness, No tobacco use, awareness for HIV/AIDS have started showing results in the form of reduction in health risk factors. Our pro wellness programs reached more than 7,500 employees, contractors and community members during the year. All the cement units have been profiled for health risk hazards by conducting industrial hygiene surveys. A unique initiative, “Safe & Healthy Student” has been rolled out all over ACC. To make the initiative sustainable, 300 teachers have been trained in wellness, nutrition, fitness, safety and first aid. The resultant initiatives have been incorporated in daily curriculum of the school and would be impacting the behaviour of about 9000 students. Effectiveness of these different programs targeting critical areas was being reviewed by the Top Management every month. 2nd party and 3rd party audits were conducted to check the level of implementation of these safety programs apart from the plant internal audits. Goal Statement: To achieve zero fatality and sustain LTIFR of < 1 in 2013 LA6: Percentage of total workforce represented in formal joint management-worker health and safety committees that help monitor and advise on occupational health and safety programs 100% representation was ensured in formal joint management-worker health and safety committees. Each plant formed a site central safety committee comprising of equal representatives from the management as well as shop floor associates. The committee headed by the Director Plant, met every month to discuss various OH&S issues, review OH&S performance and plan initiatives. This forum enabled the ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [74] workmen to participate in the decision making process pertaining to Occupational Health and Safety issues of the plant. LA7: Rates of injury, occupational diseases, lost days, and absenteeism, and total number of work related fatalities by region and by gender As a step forward towards our long term goal of Zero Harm, we have moved out of the boundary line of our operations and started monitoring, reporting and investigating off-site incidents which occurred on the road involving transport vehicles carrying raw materials and products for us. The number of fatalities and lost time injuries which have increased are due to inclusion of off-site incidents. We have also put in place logistics safety initiative to address our concern areas and improve safety. 2012 2011 2010 Fatality 12 3 8 LTIFR (Own and subcontracted 0.43 0.31 0.65 employees) LTISR (Own employees) 18.79 12.39 29.84 Occupational Diseases No Case No Case No Case Lost time injuries 22 18 32 Note: The indicators are based on the definitions given by Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) which records lost time injuries when the injury results in person not being able to perform work for more than one day. LA9: Health and safety topics covered in formal agreements with trade unions Health and safety forms are part of the standing orders signed by the unions. Issues of personal protective equipments, adherence to the established OH&S procedures, etc. have been made mandatory. Union representatives also participated in various OH&S decision making process and actively participated in site OH&S systems and practices like planned inspections, internal audits and incident investigations. Case Study: Safety : “ACC Chetna” : Being conscious about behavioural safety ACC Chetna is one of the most important OH&S initiatives of the year falling under Behaviour Based Safety program [BBS]. “Chetna” is a Hindi word which means ‘consciousness’. It is a people centric OH&S program to complement the existing traditional Safety Management programs in accident prevention and control. ‘ACC Chetna’ equips a person with a set of five specific behaviours, Eyes on Path; Eyes on Hands; Assess the Area; Line of Fire & Body Limits; which act as “Last Line of Defence” in accident prevention. These Life changing behaviors empower and encourage people to make Safe choices in their routine operations which prevent them from potential accidents. The key phrase of this program is ‘When we live Chetna, we benefit from Chetna’. Last Line of Defence Behaviours The program was implemented with two hour awareness session followed by high intensity reminders through various activities and forums. The first session of awareness program was conducted at Tikaria Plant. More than 16,000 personnel including employees and contract men have been covered in this program of awareness session.

Similarly a tool for automation and e-monitoring of legal compliance lead to efficient processing. Internal Audit Department assesses ACC Sustainable Development Report 2012 [76] the risks related to corruption through regular internal audits and checks, based on a well structured risk assessment approach. This helps in ensuring that Internal Control Systems (ICS) were in place and the responsibilities were being discharged effectively. In 2012, 167 key controls were tested at 12 locations. The testing methodology and documentation is reviewed and validated by the Company’s external auditors. Potential fraud risk areas, their probability and impact are a vital input for the risk assessment. The testing methodology and documentation is reviewed and validated by the Company’s external auditors. The Audit Committee of the Board also reviewed the adequacy and efficacy of internal control systems. (SO2) Fraud Risk Management The company has endorsed a Fraud Risk Management (FRM) Policy since January 2009. For implementation, a Fraud Risk Management committee has been formed chaired by the Company Secretary with Head Legal and Chief Internal Auditor as members. The committee reviews and takes appropriate action on suspected cases of fraud or misconduct. Anyone with knowledge of any incident of misconduct or fraud can communicate with the committee in confidence through a dedicated e-mail/Fax and hotline or by letter. To make employees aware about FRM policy, it has also been uploaded in the intranet portal. In addition several trainings were undertaken along with display of posters at prominent locations in units and uniform screensavers on computers.

Technology Road map for Low Carbon Economy for Indian Cement Sector: ACC continued to work closely with other members of the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) as well as a host of external stakeholders with technical expertise by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the National Council for Cement and Building Materials (NCBM) in the development of a technology road map for a low carbon economyfor the Indian cement sector. The exercise is partfunded by International Finance Corporation (IFC). Twenty-seven papers were developed as part of the road map explaining opportunities to drive the industry towards a low carbon economy with threadbare discussions on each and every paper, taking and improvising based on feedback from all stakeholders. ACC was Co-chair for the initiative along with UltraTech Cement and Shree Cement. The document was released during January 2013 b. Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP): ACC has participated in this project since 2009. This is an international platform where organizations voluntarily disclose their performance in respect of aspects such as corporate governance, climate change strategy, targets and initiatives, climate change communication methodology, climate change risks and opportunities, emissions measurement methodology, details of CO2 emissions, energy portfolio, emissions performance, and emissions trading. In India CDP Disclosure 2012, the company ranked second in the materials sector and an overall 12th in the country. c.

United Nations Water Tool: We are co-chairing the development of United Nations water tool United Nations Global Compact (UNGC): ACC is a signatory of UNGC and makes public disclosure on adherence to UNGC principles and makes public disclosure of these through Communication of Progress Anti-competitive, Anti-trust and Monopoly practices There are four matters against ACC under the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act and two under the Competition Act, in which the company is arraigned with other cement manufacturers and the Cement Manufacturers’ Association. In two matters, the company had appealed in the Supreme Court against the orders of the MRTP Commission and these appeals are pending hearing. The Competition Commission of India published an order on June 21, 2012 against eleven cement manufacturers including ACC and the Cement Manufacturers’ Association imposing a penalty of half of the profit for the year 2009-10 and 2010-11. For ACC the amount works out to ` 1147.59 crores. The company is deeply aggrieved by this verdict and is preparing to appeal against the order before the competent authority. The company strongly believes that the penalty thus sought to be imposed on it is unjust and harsh and that the allegations in the order appear to be based on presumptions that are not supported by facts or evidence. Enquiry is in progress before the concerned body in the remaining matters. In all these matters, ACC maintains that it has always operated independently and has never been a part of any cartel as alleged.
