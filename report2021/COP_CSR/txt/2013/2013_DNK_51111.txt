It is not a big bang, which will change society from one day to the next. Instead, it is a slow but surely change that takes place because of demographic and socioeconomic changes. There is wide agreement that it requires fundamental rethinking if the Nordic welfare society wants to meet the challenges ahead. Governments, institutions, businesses and civil society must collaborate in order to open to new perspectives and provide actual solutions to the future challenges. At AART architects, we recognise this responsibility to act and think innovatively. We are thus committed to our role as decision-makers for the built environment, which in the 1950s formed the foundation for the Nordic welfare society and in the years to come will play a crucial part in its further development. In our desire to communicate our social commitment, we joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2008. The Global Compact is the largest corporate social responsibility initiative in the world. As a member, we are committed to aligning our strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. In this book, we express our continuing commitment to supporting advances in the building industry in ways that benefit the Nordic welfare society and societies around the world. The purpose of this book is thus to give our clients and business partners an insight into our practice and socially innovative design approach.

The education centre stands out, as it has no traditional classrooms. Instead, all lessons take place in various group areas, which allow for a more diverse approach to education. 4 X GAZELLE For the fourth year running, we were appointed as a Gazelle company by the Danish newspaper Børsen. As a Gazelle company, we are among the fraction of Danish companies that meet the high-growth requirements of the Gazelle criteria. We are the second highest grossing architectural firm (statistic-article JP). INNOVATIVE STUDENT HOUSING During the summer, the Bikuben Student Residence was displayed in Paris as part of an exhibition of innovative student housing. The exhibition displayed a chronology of socially remarkable buildings in the world built during the last 50 years. ICONIC PLACES IN EFFECTIVE DENMARK RISK MANAGEMENT In August, the Culture Yard fell in good comIn May, we were keynote speaker at an pany when Post Danmark issued a series of international risk management conference 26 new stamps. The stamps featured iconic in Copenhagen. Under the heading “ArchiDanish places and people.

AWARD-WINNING SCIENCE CENTRE In October, Inspiria Science Center received the Iconic Award 2013 by the German Design Council. With the award, the German Design Council honoured outstanding architecture and its integration in the urban, cultural and economic context. CREATIVE CONTRIBUTION TO LEGO In December, the team behind LEGO Architecture visited our office in Aarhus in their desire to gain an insight into our conceptual design approach. We hope we inspired the team to further develop their amazing range of products. 9 10 VUC SYD HADERSLEV / DENMARK 11 AART ARCHITECTS We are a high-performance team of 70 architects, designers and construction managers who offer consultancy in architecture, interior architecture and industrial design. By combining craftsmanship with research on how contemporary life evolves and changes we develop socially innovative projects that open to new perspectives on Nordic welfare architecture. With offices in Aarhus (DK) and Oslo (NO) and several international winning projects, we are one of the leading architectural firms in the Nordic countries. Over the years, our work has received several honorary awards and been exhibited internationally in places like the Venice Biennale, La Galerie d’Architecture in Paris and the European Parliament in Brussels. Currently, we are developing 375,000-m2 in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. All our projects stem from a careful analysis of the social and economic context. In this way, we develop socially and economically strong projects by carrying out targeted research work in usability, user experience and building technology. In 2011, we established our own dedicated research department AART+ in our desire to promote a more innovative and well-documented approach to architecture. We are continuously engaged in several research projects. Most recently, we have developed a social survey method of evaluating the social effects of the built environment. 12 ” Currently, we are developing 375,000-m² in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. 13 14 ROOTS AART architects OSLO, NO NORDIC AART architects AARHUS, DK Currently, we are developing 375,000-m2. This is the equivalent of twenty-one Opera Houses in Sydney. For the fourth year running, we have been appointed as a Gazelle company by the Danish newspaper Børsen. As a Gazelle company, we are among the fraction of Danish companies that meet the high-growth requirements of the Gazelle criteria. In addition, we are the second strongest growing architectural firm in Denmark. We are currently engaged in sixty-five projects in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. In 2013, we won six project competitions and received four honourable awards. We are a dedicated team of seventy architects, designers and construction managers. 15 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY We are committed to our role as decision-makers for the physical environment. In order to communicate this commitment, we joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2008. The Global Compact is the largest alliance for corporate social responsibility initiative in the world and reflects our commitment to develop socially innovative architecture that create long-term value for our clients, business partners and for society. The Global Compact builds on ten principles that is of fundamental importance in terms of achieving progress through upholding human rights, implementing international labour standards, protecting the environment and preventing corruption. As a member, we are committed to aligning our strategies and operations with these principles and promote them within our sphere of influence. By doing so, we help to ensure that the building industry advances in ways that benefit not only the Nordic welfare society but also societies around the world. 16 WE SUPPORT THE PEOPLE ENVIRONMENT PRINCIPLE 1: Businesses should support PRINCIPLE 7: Businesses should support a GLOBAL COMPACT’S and respect the protection of internationally precautionary approach to environmental proclaimed human rights. challenges.

PRINCIPLE 6: Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 17 18 ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY As economic challenges affect the Nordic welfare society more than ever before, we have recognised the need to undertake the responsibility of leading the development of a more efficient, transparent and economically sustainable building culture. Therefore, we work at the intersection between research and practice with a view to developing cutting-edge project engineering solutions. Project engineering is the most expensive phase in the development of a new building. Through continuous development work and close collaboration with engineers and researchers, we optimise our planning procedures, as economically sustainable development can only be achieved by encouraging knowledge sharing between various sectors. WE ENSURE A HIGH QUALITY LEVEL As part of our economically sustainable focus, we continuously develop our quality assurance procedures, which cover all of the project’s core phases, ranging from the competition and concept of the project to the main design and advisory services regarding the implementation and project follow-up. Through dialogue with our clients and business partners, we define the appropriate quality levels. At the same time, and on the basis of project reviews and planning meetings, we incorporate these quality levels in the service’s programming, because a holistic approach to architecture and satisfied clients is the predominant goal of our quality assurance. WE ENSURE A HIGH ETHICAL STANDARD As architects, we must respond actively to our ethical responsibility, as trust and credibility form the basis of our public relations. Therefore, we use substantial resources to ensure a high ethical standard in our business strategy and day-to-day operations. All our employees are thus subjected to the rules and regulation of the Danish Architects’ Association, including paragraph 8, which states that an architect must respect the duty of confidentiality regarding any confidential facts the architect gains insight into as part of the daily work. 19 BUSINESS INTERVIEW WITH TORBEN SKOVBJERG LARSEN, PARTNER IN AART ARCHITECTS FORMING THE FUTURE NORDIC WELFARE SOCIETY 20 TORBEN SKOVBJERG LARSEN Partner in AART architects In the 1950s, Nordic architects built a brand new society. Quite literally. Schools, hospitals, sports centres, civic centres and city halls changed appearance for good. It was the golden age of Nordic architecture. It was the construction of the welfare society, which for more than 50 years has brought remarkable benefits for the Nordic countries. Latest, a special report by the internationally acknowledged magazine the Economist highlights the Nordic countries as global role models. “The Nordics cluster at the top of league tables of everything from economic competitiveness to social health to happiness. They have avoided both southern Europe’s economic sclerosis and America’s extreme inequality. Development theorists have taken to calling successful modernisation ‘getting to Denmark’,” the Economist highlights. THE WELFARE SOCIETY FACES GREAT CHALLENGES However, the Nordic welfare society has embarked on a huge transformation that will have profound consequences many years into the future. It is not a big bang, which will change society from one day to the next. Instead, it is a slow but surely change that takes place because of growing welfare services and decreasing resources. “There is wide agreement that the existing welfare society requires fundamental rethinking so as to meet the challenges ahead,” Torben Skovbjerg Larsen, CEO and partner in AART architects, points out. “At AART architects, we are aware of our role as decision-makers for the built environment and thus the design of the future welfare society. Therefore, we not only create robust, beautiful and functional architecture. We also explore the ways in which society evolves and changes so that we are able to open to new perspectives on the future of Nordic welfare architecture,” he elaborates. 21 BIKUBEN STUDENT RESIDENCE COPENHAGEN, DENMARK THE WATERFRONT STAVANGER, NORWAY 22 INSPIRIA SCIENCE CENTER SARPSBORG, NORWAY IT’S ALL ABOUT CREATING LONG-TERM VALUE However, how can architecture give form to the future wealth and welfare? How can it provide tangible solutions for the challenges that the Nordic countries face? According to Skovbjerg Larsen, it is about combining socially innovative architecture with market leading work processes. It is about creating well-documented, long-term value for both developers, end-users and for society. “We work systematically with combining high efficiency with research in the dynamics of modern society. Thus, architecture becomes a much wider practice than merely the art of making buildings. It is becomes a productive and problem-solving way of working with people from various fields of engineering, social sciences and humanities. In this way, we take an investigative approach to architecture,” he explains. “In our desire to face future challenges and push the potential of architecture we have established AART+, our own dedicated research department. Because in order to give form to the future wealth and welfare you have to gain a deep understanding of the complexity of the built environment and how it affects contemporary life. Only by doing this you are able to provide well-documented, long-term value.” “This investigative and socially innovative approach manifests itself in many of our completed projects, ranging from the Bikuben Student Residence designed to counteract loneliness, to the Waterfront designed to inject new life into Stavanger’s harbourfront, to Inspiria Science Center awarded as one of the most sustainable buildings in Europe.” “Just as important, each of the projects has proven to be an economic success. For instance, the Bikuben Student Residence was cheaper than traditional social housing, the buyers flock to the Waterfront and Inspiria Science Center has attracted much more visitors than expected,” he wraps up. 23 R&D DEPARTMENT 24 MENTS I N DO OR E NVIRO NVIRO ME N LI NG E TS / U LFIL / AC /F TIV Y/ ATI LIT N GA UA A LQ RC H UR IT T EC EC PT AA IT TU AR RE CH E R NC // SOCIAL // US ITY ER RS IVE AAR TH I NV OLV LD CIA TC EA EM ENT // SO O LTH E // HO SP R SH IP CO-OWNE ITAL DE SI GN PROJECT ENT // U PROCESS SEREC O NM ORIEN CT M NO TEDT DES OJ E IGN RO & PR AA M VI EN Y RE GE EN A NA RT SS OU ME B UI RE RC NT // LD T G EM AN AG AR M CO EM POE N NT DE A N/ / ENT SIG PTIO N/ UM /R NS OB CO US AL TNE ERI SS / / LIF MAT E CYC TION // A LE COST TIMIS S ENERGY OP TURNIING IDEAS INTO INNOVATION In 2011, we established AART+, our own dedicated research department. By working at the intersection between research and commercial development, AART+ specialises in developing and implementing innovative solutions in our building projects. In order to promote architectural innovation we have organised our AART+ into four teams: AART concept, AART build, AART green and AART health. Together the teams offer a 360˚ design perspective by which we are able to identify the innovative potential in each project. In this way, AART+ is closely involved in all of our projects. By listening to our clients’ needs and promoting cross-disciplinary cooperation, AART+ develops state-of-the-art solutions that combine architectural innovation with a deep understanding of people and the environment. In more than ten years, architectural innovation has imbued our practice. Over the years, we have engaged in several research and development projects, ranging from the development of state-of-the-art active houses, to student residences designed to counteract loneliness, to cultural centres designed to inject new life. 25 THE CULTURE YARD ELSINORE, DENMARK NANNA FLINTHOLM MA in Architecture Head of AART concept Nanna Flintholm ensures a targeted development work based on her analytical approach to optimising and rethinking the conceptual phase. AART CONCEPT AART concept takes an innovative approach to the conceptual design phase. By working research-minded with user involvement and different building typologies, the team ensures that we remain an innovative practice with an eye for future opportunities and challenges. ØSTFOLD HOSPITAL GRAALUM, NORWAY KARSTEN SINNING MA in Architecture Head of AART health Karsten Sinning ensures a targeted innovation work based on his long-standing experience in health promoting architecture. AART HEALTH AART health works at the intersection between research and practice in order to offer expert consultancy in hospital architecture. Based on research-based design processes the research team brings the new ideas into play with the desire to combine healing architecture with operational efficiency and highly functional operating solutions. 26 MARTIN GERTSEN Construction manager Head of AART green Martin Gertsen ensures a focused development work based on his insight into the many aspects of environmentally friendly architecture. AART GREEN AART green works research-minded with sustainable materials and technologies with the desire to lead the way for the next generation of sustainable architecture. The team’s objective is to ensure that we maintain our position as one of Scandinavia’s leading architectural practices in sustainable design NATURE CENTRE HINDSGAVL and architecture. MIDDELFART, DENMARK THE CULTURE YARD ELSINORE, DENMARK THOMAS HJORTLUND SVENDSEN Construction manager Head of AART build Thomas Hjortlund Svendsen ensures a professional focus based on his vast experience as a project manager of several major building projects. AART BUILD AART build strives to achieve the highest architectural quality in our completed buildings. Through research and cross-disciplinary collaboration, the team works research-minded with components and construction methods, and new ways in which they can be brought into play and put into practice. 27 R&D CASES THE CULTURE YARD ELSINORE, DENMARK R&D CASE / SOCIAL SURVEY METHOD In partnership with the Alexandra Institute and with the support of the Danish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education, we have developed a social survey method of evaluating the social effects of buildings, i.e. how and to what extent the built environment creates social value by enriching user experiences. In 2013, we published a book about our social survey method. In the book, we present a selection of cases. We also show how the social survey method can be applied to any building and how it gives our clients a deeper understanding of how users utilise and experience the completed structure. The aim of our social survey method is to study how and to what extent our finished buildings meet the original social ambitions such as well-being, accessibility and social facilities. This is what we mean when we talk about documenting the social effect of buildings. 28 NATURE CENTRE HINDSGAVL HINDSGAVL NATURE RESERVE, DENMARK R&D CASE / ECO-FRIENDLY EXPERTISE Over the years, we have developed several award-winning buildings where we have shown that society has much more to gain from building sustainably than simply a clean conscience. Sustainable construction is also capable of blazing the trail for more vigorous and dynamic architecture. We thus provide highly specialised consultancy services in the area of sustainable construction. In order to be at the cutting edge of a more vibrant sustainable architecture, we work proactively with sustainable construction and specialise in implementing innovative sustainability initiatives in our many projects. In 2013, we were certified passive house designer by which we offer consultancy on the design of passive houses. We were also certified DGNB consultant by which we have an in-depth knowledge of the new Danish sustainable certification scheme. 29 OUR TEAM WE ARE 3 PARTNERS MEET THE PEOPLE BEHIND OUR PRACTICE WE ARE 67 TEAM MEMBERS 9/10 WE EAT 4230 APPLES PER YEAR OF US PARTICIPATED IN OUR YEARLY STRATEGY WEEKEND 3/4 OF US CYCLE TO WORK EVERY DAY 10/10 OF US LOVE TO WORK AT OUR OFFICE 30 IN AVERAGE WE HAVE 4.4 SICK DAYS PER YEAR 9/10 OF US THINK WE HAVE AN OPEN WORKING ENVIRONMENT 1/3 OF US RUN MORE THAN 10 KM EACH WEEK 8/10 OF US ARE PLEASED WITH OUR FURTHER TRAINING PROGRAM 1 OF US PLAYS UNDERWATER RUGBY 31 PROJECT INTERVIEW WITH ANDERS TYRRESTRUP, PARTNER IN AART ARCHITECTS THE CULTURE YARD 32 In many years, the attention has been aimed at the site adjacent, where the UNESCO World Heritage site, Kronborg Castle, which is famous for its role in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, exerts its magnetic pull on both tourists and local citizens of Elsinore. However, in 2010 Elsinore’s old shipyard was transformed into a 13,000 m2 cultural centre, including concert halls, showrooms, conference facilities, a dockyard museum and a public library. “The very inspiriting challenge of the Culture Yard was to balance the respect for both pasts with the ambition to express a new identity. Our approach has quite simply been to make the contrast ANDERS TYRRESTRUP between new and old very clear. Punctuating and sewing together the existing buildings gives Partner in AART architects nuanced spatial experiences and direct visual contact from the refurbished shipyard toward Kronborg Caste and the sound,” Anders Tyrrestrup, partner in AART architects, explains. Tyrrestrup was one of the main architects behind the Culture Yard, which AART architects won in an open architecture competition in 2005. Eighty-seven architectural firms from around the world participated in the competition. According to Tyrrestrup, AART architects’ proposal won because of its arcade, which not only preserved and linked the former shipyard buildings together. It also appeared as an open, vibrant venue that would inspire people to meet and hang out. “The arcade has created a new gathering point for visitors and local citizens. You meet people of every age and from every side of the community, in a fantastic intersection of history, harbour and city life. The presence of the past brings a magical dimension to our aim of creating a place with a distinct feeling of community. At the same time, the contrast between new and old creates a diverse setting for multiple users,” he highlights. 33 34 LATEST PROJECTS VUC SYD / DK HORSENS STATE SCHOOL/ DK MUSHOLM BAY HOLIDAY RESORT/ DK NATURE CENTRE HINDSGAVL / DK ÖREBO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL / SE KUNGÄLV HOSPITAL / SE TORSTVEDT SCHOOL / NO INSPIRIA SCIENCE CENTER / NO THE WATERFRONT / NO 35 VUC SYD HADERSLEV, DENMARK COMPLETED IN 2013 THE NEW EDUCATION CENTRE FOR VUC SYD HAS NO TRADITIONAL CLASSROOMS.
