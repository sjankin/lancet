P age |1 2013 United Nations Global Compact Communication of Progress Report ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P age |2 1. Introduction Altron is pleased to present its 2013 United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Communication on Progress (COP) report, covering the group’s activities for the period 1 November 2012 to 31 October 2013. Altron has been a signatory to the UNGC since 2009, and has been an active participant in various meetings and related initiatives in line with the UNGC principles, in particular through the National Business Initiative (NBI), a local business association that supports and encourages implementation of among others the UNGC’s 10 principles and the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in South Arica. This document represents our fourth COP report and as the different commitments, initiatives and projects outlined in this report shows, we continue to integrate the 10 principles into our strategy, our culture and the day-to-day operations, demonstrating our continued commitment and support towards the UNGC. By our commitment to the UNGC we emphasise our efforts to embrace, support and enact a set of core values in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment as well as our efforts to combat corruption. We believe that the 2013 COP report not only highlights the importance we place on the 10 principles but also assists stakeholders to cross reference each of the principles to the various initiatives we have implemented and the progress made to date. As a publicly listed company on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) in South Africa, Altron accepts that we have a responsibility to ensure that our companies operate in a manner that not only strive to be financially sound, but also encourages a high level of transparency, accountability and social and environmentally responsible behaviour. To achieve this, we ensure that our governance and risk management structures identify and, where applicable, adhere to local and international standards and best practices, including the UNGC. In addition to being signatories to the UNGC, Altron actively takes part in the following local and international initiatives and codes of good practise:  Carbon Disclosure Program (CDP) – 2008 to 2013;  Carbon Disclosure Program Water (CDP W) – voluntary submission 2011 to 2013;  JSE Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) Index – 2004 to 2013;  Adherence to the recommendations of the King Code of Corporate Governance for South Africa (King III) – 2010 to 2013; and  United Nations Millennium Development Goals. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P age |3 2. Statement of Continued Support Allied Electronics Corporation Limited (Altron) continues to support the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact in respect of human rights, labour rights, environmental protection and anti-corruption As Chief Executive of Altron, I welcome the opportunity to again reaffirm our commitment to advancing the UNGC principles not only through our direct business activities, but also within our sphere of influence. We aim to lead by example in the area of responsible business conduct by raising awareness of the importance of the UNGC principles. Respecting these principles today will ensure a better future for our company and our stakeholders tomorrow. Having formally launched our sustainability strategy in 2013, we know and understand that our business success is directly linked to the integration of environmental, social, and governance issues into our long-term business strategy as well as our day-to-day operations. The Altron group continues to strive for the highest possible standards in good corporate citizenship and sustainable business practices. As such, integrity and commitment to our stakeholders have been one of our primary focuses over the years. In all of our business dealings, honesty, fairness, equality, and ethical conduct form the cornerstone of how we conduct business.” R.E.Venter, Chief Executive Altron 3. Communication on Progress in Meeting the Expectation of the 10 UNGC Principles The UNGC is a call to all companies to voluntarily align their operations and strategies with the ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, and to take action in support of UN goals and issues related thereto. The UNGC is a leadership platform for the development, implementation and disclosure of responsible corporate policies and practices. This year marks the fourth year of Altron’s commitment to the UNGC and its ten guiding principles. While much has changed in the world and within our company since our first COP report in 2009/2010, our commitment to the Compact’s ten principles remains firm. We recognise that we have a duty of responsibility that extends to our shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, business partners, government and the communities in which we operate. Our commitment to the Global Compact – as well as our commitment to working responsibly – is a fundamental part of how we fulfil our company’s vision. The principles are embedded within our company’s business practices, policies, and operations and help us perform and operate in a responsible manner. The landscape of business is changing. Governments, citizens and customers are increasingly calling on companies to account for the way in which they do business – they expect businesses to behave responsibly and transparently, and to ensure that their impacts do not cause harm to people or the planet. What this means is that business can no longer chase profits at the expense of everything else. A company that makes money while harming the environment, employing child labour, disrespecting the rights of its employees or selling harmful products, will no longer be tolerated and cannot survive or thrive. In other words, it will not be sustainable in the long term. Sustainability is not a new concept to Altron – it is something that we have been doing for a long time in various ways. While we have always focused on ensuring that the business is well-run, profitable and ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P age |4 able to adapt to changing market conditions, our sustainability journey first began in the late 1990s when we turned our attention to diversity and the issue of black economic empowerment. This was followed by a strong focus on corporate social investment and later, an effort to understand and reduce our environmental impacts. In the mid-2000s we produced our first dedicated Sustainability Report and at the end of the decade Altron was one of the first companies in South Africa to make the transition to integrated reporting which brings sustainable business practices into the core of our business. This evolution has paved the way for where we find ourselves today – a company with a fully-fledged sustainability strategy which cuts across all aspects of business and drives the fundamental business strategy of our organisation. Sustainability is no longer a part of our business – it is our business. It has become part of our DNA. 4. Summary of progress toward meeting the expectation of the 10 UNGC Principles The Compact has presented practical guidelines and has been a source of inspiration to Altron in its journey to integrate sustainability into our business strategy. In 2012 Altron developed its first formal sustainability strategy which was launched in January 2013, followed by the development of a sustainability manual that supports the implementation and rollout of the sustainability strategy in the group. In addition, Altron’s Social and Ethics Committee, which was appointed by the Altron shareholders and came into effect on 1 March 2012, monitors and oversees those social and ethical functions as set out in the Companies Act as well as those responsibilities assigned to it by the Board. These responsibilities include but are not limited to Altron’s performance with respect to legislation and codes of best practice, labour, human rights, and the environment. With this COP, we confirm that we are actively working towards ensuring that the UNGC and its principles become fully entrenched in our business strategy and culture, and that we will continue to seek and participate in collaborative projects that advance the broader development goals of the UNGC and the MDGs. The aim of the 2013 COP report is to detail the commitments, actions and progress Altron has made against the 10 principles. The report provides an abridged and partial view into how we acknowledge and implement the 10 principles in our business. The report should be read in conjunction with the 2013 Altron Integrated Annual Report, which can be found at www.altron.com ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P age |5 Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Principle 2: Business should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses Policies, procedures and management structures Altron remains committed to upholding fundamental human rights in the workplace and throughout our sphere of influence. In general, human rights are well managed throughout the group. As a signatory to the UNGC, Altron has made a public commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This commitment is encapsulated in the company’s Code of Ethics and its Human Rights and Labour Conditions Policy that can be found on our website at www.altron.com Altron has a comprehensive set of policies, procedures and committees to ensure the protection of human rights, where the protection of rights permeates through a number of employee, subsidiary and/or supplier codes and/or agreements. We review these policies annually to ensure that we adequately address issues such as forced and/or compulsory labour, child labour, discrimination and gender equity. Implementation and initiatives The Altron Social and Ethics Committee, which is a statutory committee in terms of the Companies Act of SA, assists the group with the oversight of social and ethical matters relating to the Altron group and performs an oversight and monitoring role in terms of any relevant human rights abuses associated with our group, our suppliers and our partners. Altron acknowledges that our ‘sphere of influence’ extends beyond our shareholders and employee population and embraces a cradle-to-grave approach to corporate responsibility and as such extended our human rights focus to include our suppliers and contractors. In the previous reporting period we surveyed a broad range of international suppliers from different countries and industries to assess their practices relating to basic human rights including health and safety; hours, wages and leave; fair treatment of employees; community impacts; product stewardship, labour practices; the risk profile of the country concerned; and the extent to which suppliers’ manage and monitor human rights in their own supply chain. The survey was a once-off exercise and was therefore not repeated during the year under review. However we continue to engage with and educate suppliers on issues of human rights, ensuring that they are familiar with our expectations as outlined in our Human Rights Policy. Although other areas of minor improvement were identified as part of the survey, overall, the findings of the survey did not highlight any material risks to the group regarding human rights. Altron is in the process of finalising a “sustainability in the supply chain strategy” and is currently looking at engaging with our major suppliers around our four core themes of sustainability of which one is human capital. As part of this engagement we aim to identify any human rights violations and incidents in our supply chain with the view to guide and if necessary assist these suppliers in addressing their human rights issues. In addition, Altron will require all suppliers to confirm that they have read and understood and agree to the relevant Altron policies and that they subscribe to principles of lawful and ethical business conduct as dealt with in these policies. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P age |6 Continued stakeholders engagement is a material focus for the group. Altron’s Sustainability Department engages with a wide range of stakeholders including employees, suppliers, customers and contractors on key topics such as human rights, ethics and the company’s sustainability strategy. A detailed discussion of our stakeholder engagement is available on our group’s website at www.altron.com. To date no human rights issues were brought to, or identified as part of our stakeholder engagement process. While certain countries in which Altron operates have been identified as posing a potential risk to human rights, none of our operations reported or were implicated in any incidents of discrimination, violation of human rights or the rights of indigenous peoples, nor were there any grievances relating to human rights abuses. Feedback and Goals The following provides a summary of achievements and future human rights commitments: Achievements  Concluded our human rights survey for international suppliers and followed up on any areas of concern;  Monitored human rights through our Social and Ethics Committee;  Chief Ethics Officer continued to monitor any human rights abuses;  Rolled out ethics training to executives and managers; and  Reviewed and where applicable updated the following policies and procedures:  Human Rights and Labour Conditions  Code of Conduct  Code of Ethics Commitments  Develop a ”Sustainability in the Supply Chain Strategy” and include human rights as one of the issues to review;  Continue to engage with all stakeholders to promote human rights;  Continue to roll out the ethics training to all employees; and  Annually compile articles for internal and external use, reconfirming our commitment to promote and prevent human right abuse.

Labour Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Policies, procedures and management structures As expressed in our “Human Rights and Labour Conditions Policy”, Altron actively recognises the right of employees to collective bargaining and freedom of association in accordance with all relevant labour legislation. Altron is also committed to facilitating open communication and direct engagement between employees and management in those situations where the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining is restricted under law. Organised labour unions are an important stakeholder in many of our businesses, and large numbers of employees belong to various unions across the group, particularly in our manufacturing operations. Around 30% of employees in Altech UEC and Arrow Altech Distribution are subject to collective bargaining agreements with the Metal and Engineering Industries Bargaining Council (MEIBC) and 4% belong to the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (NUMSA). ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P age |7 The proportion of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements at Bytes is small and does not meet the minimum requirements for a formal constitution body. Union representation of employees is most pervasive at Powertech, where 63% of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and belong to either the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), the South African Equity Workers Association (SAEWA), the United Association of South Africa (UASA), the Federal Council of Retail and Allied Workers (FEDCRAW) and the Metal and Electrical Workers’ Union of South Africa (MEWUSA). In addition to union representation, employee rights are protected through the full compliance of all Altron companies with relevant local legislation, including the Labour Relations Act (1995), the Basic Conditions of Employment Act (1997), the Employment Equity Act 55 (1998), the Skills Development Act (1998), the Occupational Health and Safety Act (1993), the Unemployment Insurance Act (1993) and the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act (2003). We are also governed by the Bill of Rights as contained in the South African constitution, the United Nations Global Compact on Human Rights and our own internal Human Rights Policy, all of which cover various aspects of the rights of employees. Implementation and initiatives Wherever employees are represented by unions or through collective bargaining units, Altron maintains constructive relationships with all of our unions, who are afforded consultative and/or negotiating powers on issues of shared interest. Copies of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, the Skills Development Act and the Employment Equity Act are displayed in all work places and made available on the company’s intranet. Formal grievance procedures are also in place through which employees can raise issues. Through its Social and Ethics Committee Altron continues to monitor and provide feedback on any issues related to freedom of association and collective bargaining. Feedback and Goals During the year under review, none of Altron’s operations have specifically been identified as posing a risk for undermining the rights of employees to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining. All employees have the freedom to belong to recognised bargaining councils as per the Labour Relations Act of South Africa. The following provides a summary of achievements and future commitments on freedom of association and collective bargaining: Achievements  Engaged with employees via unions and collective bargaining units;  Included unions and collective bargaining units in relevant meetings and committees;  Continued to monitor and review issues related to freedom of association and collective bargaining; and  Reviewed and where applicable updated the following policies and procedures:  Human Rights and Labour Conditions  Industrial Relations Policy  Code of Conduct Targets  Continue to uphold and implement the actions listed above GRI LA4, LA5; HR1 HR3, HR5, SO5 Indicators UN MGD Refer to initiatives supporting the UN MDG on pages 20-26 of this report. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P age |8 Labour Principle 4: Elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Principle 5: Effective abolition of child labour Policies, procedures and management structures As indicated in our ‘Human Rights and Labour Conditions Policy”, Altron does not permit any form of forced, compulsory or child labour be it within any of our own companies, or within our extensive supply chain. All employees, including contractors, are sourced from the open labour market, with all employment occurring in the presence of mutually agreed upon labour contracts in accordance with relevant labour legislation. All employees are afforded the freedom to resign at any time. Altron actively monitors compliance with the labour legislation in each of the countries within which we operate, and are mindful of the variances in minimum age restrictions. Implementation and initiatives Altron supports the promotion of equality and prevention of unfair discrimination within the work environment. Its group-wide transformation strategy “Beyond 2012” was launched in July 2012. This strategy strives to address, among others, employment equity targets for senior management and higher levels within the group. Similar to overseeing human rights in the group, Altron’s Social and Ethics Committee, is also responsible for monitoring social and ethical matters relating to forced and compulsory labour or child labour. As previously mentioned in principal one, Altron’s “sustainability in the supply chain strategy” will include human rights issues such as forced, compulsory and child labour issues. As part of this engagement we aim to identify any human rights violations and incidents in our supply chain with the view to guide and if necessary assist these suppliers in addressing their human rights issues. While certain countries in which Altron operates have been identified as posing a potential risk to human rights, none of our operations has specifically been identified as posing a risk for incidents of forced or compulsory labour, child labour or for undermining the right to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining. To our knowledge there were no grievances filed relating to any of Altron’s operations, their partners or suppliers with regards to any form of human rights abuse including forced and compulsory labour or child labour during the year. Feedback and Goals The following provides a summary of achievements and future commitments on forced and compulsory labour as well as child labour issues: Achievements  Provided our “Human Rights and Labour Conditions Policy” to suppliers;  Concluded our human rights survey among our international supply chain, which included elements of forced and compulsory labour;  Improved awareness among employees on their rights around forced and compulsory labour;  Provided feedback on human rights survey; and  Reviewed and where applicable updated the following policies and procedures:  Human Rights and Labour Conditions  Human Resources and Employment Policy  Code of Conduct ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P age |9 Commitments  Continue to uphold and implement the actions listed above;  Include labour issues in our “Sustainability in the Supply Chain Strategy”; and  Continue to monitor and manage any labour related issues internally in the group and in our supply chain. GRI HR1 HR3, HR7, HR10, HR11, SO5 Indicators UN MGD Refer to initiatives supporting the UN MDG on pages 20-26 of this report. Labour Principle 6: Elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Policies, procedures and management structures Altron adheres to this principle through a combination of policies, procedures and committees ensuring the protection of employee rights. Altron supports the promotion of equality and prevention of unfair discrimination within the work environment. Its group-wide transformation strategy, “Beyond 2012”, was launched during 2012 and strives to address, among others, employment equity targets. The Altron Code of Ethics clearly lays out aspirational ethical guidelines for everyday behaviour to codify the conduct required by managers, employees and owners in their dealings with one another, customers, suppliers and society at large. Altron requires all its representatives to act in good faith and in a manner that promotes our aspiration to be a good corporate citizen. The issue of corporate ethics receives attention from the highest level of management within Altron, with the chief executive being ultimately responsible for implementing our Code of Ethics and Corporate Code of Conduct. We also require all of our suppliers to acknowledge and confirm in all supply contracts that they conclude with the group that they have read and understood our Code of Ethics and agree to be guided by it in terms of their actions and behaviour towards their own employees. Implementation and initiatives The Board, Audit and Social and Ethics Committees monitor compliance with Altron’s Codes of Ethics through feedback from the whistle-blower hotline (Tip-off Tim), the ethics office, Altron’s Internal Audit Department and the relevant sub-holding group security officers. Our Social and Ethics Committee is the vehicle for the Altron directors to initiate various programmes and receive feedback on any unethical behaviour and discrimination in the workplace. Results of these programmes are reported to the Social and Ethics Committee which filter through to the Risk Management Committee, the Audit Committee and ultimately the Board. The Social and Ethics Committee also assists the Board with the reveiw of social and ethical matters relating to the Altron group, its employees, partners and supply chain. It performs an oversight and monitoring role in terms of:  the embedding of a culture of ethical behaviour in Altron in partnership with the Altron ethics office, which is run by the chief ethics officer, and the internal audit function;  activities with regard to any relevant legislation or codes of best practice;  activities with regard to social and economic development;  good corporate citizenship; ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P a g e | 10  performance in terms of the environment, health and public safety, including the impact of the company’s activities on its employees; and  promotion of equality, prevention of unfair discrimination, reduction of corruption, transformation policies and strategies and social responsibility policies and strategies. Altron has established itself as a transformation leader in its industries, and is pleased to report the achievement of all transformation goals set out in the “Altron Transformation Vision 2012” strategy. Altron recognises that transformation and elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, is an on-going process, not an end-point, and with this in mind the company has formulated a new “Beyond 2012” transformation strategy to drive the next phase of transformation. Altron’s Transformation Committee (Transcom) plays an integral part in the company’s transformation success. Reporting to the Altron Executive Committee, Transcom drives the company’s transformation strategy and is guided in this by South Africa’s broad-based black economic empowerment (B-BBEE) legislation, which includes the Skills Development Act and Employment Equity Act, and the Department of Trade and Industry’s Codes of Good Practice (dti CoGP). As per South African legislation, Altron submits to government an annual Employment Equity Report, and includes all relevant statistics within our Integrated Annual Report. Altron is committed to prevent discrimination in respect of employment and to promote employment equity in the workplace. To his end Altron continues to improve overall awareness around discrimination and where relevant review and update policies that deal with discrimination and harassment. The following policies and procedures are available from the Human Resource Departments of the Altron group and can also be accessed on the Altron Intranet:  Human Resources and Employment Policy  Sexual Harassment Policy  HIV and AIDS Policy  Disciplinary Code and Procedures  Grievance Procedures  Succession Planning Procedure  Code of Conduct  Corporate Compliance Policy  Code of Ethics  Anti-corruption and Economic Crime Policy  Safety Health and Environmental Policy  Human Rights and Labour Conditions  Whistle-Blowing Guidelines Policy During June 2012, the Department of Labour gazetted a South African Code of Good Practice on HIV and Aids and the World of Work document. Altron’s Group HIV/Aids Policy and its Health and Safety Policy were subsequently updated to incorporate the recommendations set out in this document. In 2013 Altron is planning to place a renewed focus on HIV/AIDS in the workplace and if possible extend awareness of the disease to our employees’ families and communities. Feedback and Goals The following provides a summary of achievements and future commitments to monitor and control any discrimination in respect of employment and occupation: Achievements  Implemented “Beyond Vision 2012” transformation strategy;  Maintained our Ethics Office through the appointed Chief Ethics Officer;  Continued to report any discrimination to the Social and Ethics Committee; ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P a g e | 11  Rolled out ethics training to all employees;  Continued to conducted ethics climate surveys across our operations;  Various articles published in our internal magazines to prevent any form of discrimination; and  Reviewed and where applicable updated the following policies and procedures:  Human Resources and Employment Policy  Sexual Harassment Policy  HIV and AIDS Policy  Disciplinary Code and Procedures  Grievance Procedures  Succession Planning Procedure  Code of Conduct  Corporate Compliance Policy  Code of Ethics  Anti-corruption and Economic Crime Policy  Safety Health and Environmental Policy  Human Rights and Labour Conditions  Whistle-Blowing Guidelines Policy Commitments  Continue to uphold and implement the actions listed above;  Implement specific targets are part of our “Beyond Vision 2012” transformation strategy; and  Roll out a new HIV/AIDS awareness campaign amongst staff with specified focus on our manufacturing operations.

Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Policies, procedures and management structures There is a clear business case for sound environmental management. It reduces our exposure to a range of risks including financial risks arising from taxes and fines, reputational brand risks, supply chain management and business interruption risks that could arise from changes in weather patterns or extreme weather conditions associated with climate change. In response to the imminent threats posed by climate change and increased pollution, Altron has, over the last few years, increased its understanding of environmental issues, and made a strong commitment to reduce its environment footprint. We focus on lowering our carbon footprint, improving energy efficiencies, reducing pollution, reducing waste to landfill and ensuring the responsible use of water. While most of our operations, with the exception of Powertech, operate in industries with a low environmental footprint, we remain committed to lowering our environmental impact as part of our journey towards greater sustainability. Environmental management is closely aligned to some of our business goals and has the potential to positively impact on our bottom line. Recycling and more efficient use of water and electricity, reduces overhead costs at a time when the entire group is focused on more stringent cost management initiatives. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P a g e | 12 Implementation and initiatives The precautionary approach to identifying and managing environmental risk is at the heart of Altron’s environmental policies, procedures and newly formulated sustainability strategy. Altron’s first formal sustainability strategy was launched in January 2013 and was followed shortly by the release of a sustainability manual that provided more detail as to how the strategy was developed, the implications and practical implementation of the strategy. Altron will continue to monitor and update the strategy and the manual to ensure any new environmental developments and commitments are included in the strategy. Altron continue to produce an annual sustainability report, in the form of our Integrated Annual Report, and is predominantly based on Altron’s understanding of ever-increasing stakeholder expectations for effective environmental management and continued environmental awareness requirements. During the year Altron reaffirmed its commitment to reduce its environmental footprint, guided by our environmental management processes and our three year reduction targets for water, waste and carbon emissions. These environmental risks are managed and monitored by the group and remains a standing item on all Risk Management and Social and Ethics Committee meeting agendas. Both these committees comprise the chief executives (‘CE’) and senior executives from the various sub-holding companies, as well as non-executive directors and various group managers. We have appointed key individuals at board level to represent and provide feedback on the group’s sustainability agenda. Altron’s committed to environmental management has been a key performance indicator directly linked to the award of bonuses to executive management since 2010 (carbon emissions only). In 2012/2013, the commitment has been increased in that management’s performance bonuses will now be directly linked to Altron’s three year environmental reduction targets for waste, water and carbon emissions. External environmental consultants continue to conduct internal compliance audits on water, waste and energy at relevant sites in our operations. These audits did not identify any significant issues during the year and there were no significant environmental incidents or spills. We were not subject to any fines for non-compliance with environmental laws and/or regulations. The aim of our recently completed biodiversity study (2013), was to identify whether any of the group’s operations are located near to or impact on any sensitive habitats, has revealed that Altron has no sites that pose an immediate or high risk to biodiversity. A few sites were rated as having a medium to low risk, with the remainder of the Altron facilities rated as low to zero risk or impact. In 2013 Altron hosted its third annual environment/sustainability workshop. The workshop was attended by more than 40 CEO’s, FD’s and executive managements with an additional 60 environmental coordinators. The theme of the workshop was “sharing costs through environmental initiatives”. This annual workshop provides a great platform to share ideas, introduced new targets and for company expects to network. Altron plans to continue with these annual events. In 2011 Altron also introduced, as part of its annual awards event, an award for the “greenest company” in the group. The award was so well received that in 2012 we introduced an additional award for the “greenest employee” in the group. This not only shows the group’s commitment towards environmental management but also the buy in from our group companies and our staff. Not only is Altron committed to continuous improvement in our environmental performance, as reported in our Integrated Annual Report, but our attempts to educate our employees, customers and suppliers, through our internal magazine, screensavers, workshops and awareness campaigns, further demonstrates how we intend to use the knowledge we gain at the operational level to inform positive change throughout our sphere of influence. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P a g e | 13 Feedback and Goals The following provides a summary of achievements and future commitments to monitor and control environmental challenges and to improve general awareness: Achievements  Launched our group sustainability strategy that is aligned with the company’s four core strategic objectives;  Reviewed and updated the groups Sustainability Manual Version II;  Summited our forth CDP submission;  Took part in our second voluntary Water CDP submission;  Conducted a Biodiversity Desktop Assessment of all of our local operations;  Determined a new baseline for water use and waste to landfill;  Set new three year reduction targets for water, waste and carbon reductions;  Conducted our third internal “environmental/sustainability workshop”;  Participated in the draft G4 guideline process;  Included new water and waste reductions targets to executive teams KPI’s;  Continued to conduct internal environmental legal compliance audits;  Reviewed and updated our SHE Policy; and  Reviewed and updated our Climate Change Framework.

The group continues to focus on delivering the best quality products and services without harming the environment. To this end we adhere to applicable legislation, policies and procedures as well as relevant standards and frameworks including but not limited to ISO14001, ISO9001 and OSHAS18001. Although not applicable across all product and/or service lines, the development and diffusion of environmentally-friendly technologies is often at the forefront of our future-minded thinking. The increased global focus on environmental responsibility and the ever increasing pressure from our stakeholders opens up new business opportunities for the group each year. With the cost of electricity rapidly rising, and water soon to follow, the decision to develop and/or adopt energy-and-water-wise solutions is most frequently based on our continuous push towards financial efficiency and waste minimisation. In addition to being an important part of our environmental responsibility, greater energy and water efficiencies are a social and business imperative. The most evident business case for environmental responsibility is that it reduces our exposure to a number of risks and should result in cost reductions throughout the group. Direct financial risks arise from the proposed South African carbon taxation legislation, the potential for fines relating to noncompliance with environmental legislation, damage to operations and business disruptions that could result from physical environmental disasters. In addition, responsible environmental management protects us from reputational risk and the risk of losing customers and industry partners, as a result of products and services produced and delivered in an environmentally unfriendly manner. Implementation and initiatives Environmental, health and safety reviews conducted throughout the group in the past year revealed that no SHE impacts relating to group’s activities, products and services have been reported on communities, employees and/or customers. Altron continues striving towards improving product stewardship and monitors potential risks associated with products and services in its supply chain, including the potential risk of a product recall. As part of our innovation and R&D initiatives, operations within the group continue to look at and investigate environmentally friendly technologies associated with our products and services. Some of these initiatives include but are not limited to the following:  Powertech’s System Integrators division offers energy metering solution developed by Strike Technologies, a company within the Powertech stable;  Powertech’s new Renewable’s division provides turn-key solutions to renewable energy projects locally and internationally;  Altech UEC – has doubled the manufacturing of set-top-boxes using the same amount of electricity. This was achieved through implementing improved infrastructure and better technologies in the manufacturing process; and  Altech Autopage Cellular – operates in an paper free environment by eliminating paper from its retail outlets. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P a g e | 15 Altron’s Sustainability Department is in the process of finalising a “sustainability in the supply chain” strategy that they are planning to initiate in 2014. Although this strategy is based on our four core themes of financial sustainability, human capital, products and services and external relationship, two of these themes do address, in some form or another, improvements in our products and service delivery.

Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery Policies, procedures and management structures Altron subscribes to the highest standards of good governance and ethical business practice. Altron has a zero-tolerance approach towards those who engage in corruption, bribery, fraudulent or illegal acts in the conduct of its business. Altron’s compliance framework rests on the company’s comprehensive set of policies. These are regularly updated to reflect governance best practice and the evolving legal environment. All group companies and employees are obliged to comply with these policies. Altron’s Corporate Compliance Policy focuses on ten fundamental principles of business conduct, which includes the following:  No anti-competitive behaviour;  No corruption; ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P a g e | 16  No inappropriate risks for human health and the environment;  No insider trading;  No deception;  No discrimination;  No infringement of others’ intellectual property rights;  No conflicts of interest;  No misinformation; and  No breach of laws. We are guided by the Altron Code of Ethics and Corporate Code of Conduct which commit all employees to the highest standards of behaviour. The Code of Conduct is included in the Altron group Policy Manual and outlines Altron’s philosophy on corruption. In addition, Altron’s Anti-corruption and Economic Crime Policy provides guidance on preventing and dealing with corruption, fraud and other illegal acts. This policy is closely aligned with the requirements of the UK Bribery Act the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and our own domestic legislation regarding bribery and corruption. Altron requires all its representatives to act in good faith and in a manner that promotes our aspiration to be a good corporate citizen. The issue of corporate ethics receives attention from the highest level of management within Altron, with the chief executive being ultimately responsible for implementing our Code of Ethics and Corporate Code of Conduct. We also require all of our suppliers to acknowledge and confirm in all supply contracts that they conclude with the group that they have read and understood our Code of Ethics and agree to be guided by it in terms of their actions and behaviour. As stated previously the Board, Audit and Social and Ethics Committees monitor compliance with Altron’s Codes of Ethics through feedback from the whistle-blower hotline, the ethics office, Altron’s Internal Audit Department and the relevant sub-holding group security officers. Implementation and initiatives During the year, the South African National Business Ethics Survey, conducted under the auspices of The Ethics Institute of South Africa, ranked Altron first in South Africa in terms of overall ranking, organisational culture, organisational satisfaction and leadership with regards to ethics. The Ethics Institute of South Africa commented: “This is a great achievement for the company as it is evidence that the organisational values have been embedded in the culture and the employees are very satisfied with Altron and its leadership. The company has realised the value of investing in a capacity to manage ethics risks and promote sound business conduct. These results are indicative of the company’s efforts in this regard”. Initiatives are in place to counter-act risks of fraud, bribery and corruption and we are working at improving the visibility of these matters throughout the group. Last year we embarked on an ethics campaign, co-ordinated through the ethics office, focusing on group values, ethics and appropriate behaviour, thereby fostering a workplace culture of being ethical. Staff completed interactive web-based ethical surveys and signed declarations confirming that they had attended ethics training and undertake to be ethical in all their business dealings. Further training on The UK Bribery Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act forms a standing agenda item on all group companies’ risk management agendas. In compliance with the requirements of the Altron Competition Law Policy, directors and senior managers throughout the group completed and signed annual declaration forms acknowledging that they have read and understood our policy not to engage in any anti-competitive behaviour. An agenda item in this regard has been added to the agendas of board meetings throughout the group. During the year 38 Powertech operations were analysed for risks related to corruption, in line with the goal stated during the previous reporting period. In the previous year, 14 Altech operations and 23 Bytes operations underwent corruption risk analysis. This brings to 75 the total number of operations ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P a g e | 17 analysed for risks relating to corruption. In total there were 9 incidents of specific action taken in response to corruption. The company’s vulnerability and risks associated with bribery and corruption are regularly reviewed by the Altron Risk Management Committee, especially in the light of its operations in countries identified as high-risk environments for bribery and corruption, including Kenya, Lesotho, Mozambique, Nigeria and Uganda. Another risk area monitored closely is the company’s involvement in various government contracts that may require government licensing. Altron has also developed a number of initiatives to counteract the risks associated with bribery and corruption in the workplace. These include, among others, the:  adoption of an Anti-corruption and Economic Crime Policy that deals with many of the issues contemplated in the UK Bribery Act and in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the USA;  adoption of a Corporate Compliance Policy;  adoption of a Gifts and Entertainment Policy as well as an electronics gifts register;  implementation of a Declaration of Interest Policy;  inclusion of a standard ethical conduct clause for incorporation in all supply and other customer contracts;  adoption of a Reportable Irregularities Policy;  amendment of Altron’s memorandum of incorporation to record that no donations may be made to political parties without obtaining the prior approval of shareholders;  implementation of a Whistle-blowing Guidelines Policy; and  the adoption and regular review of a group-wide Code of Ethics and Corporate Code of Conduct. Over the past few years we have made a considerable investment in building an ethical culture throughout our group. These efforts continued during the year and as a result more than 11 500 employees receiving ethics training. In addition an ethics survey was developed in conjunction with the Ethics Institute of South Africa, which the Risk Management Committee mandated our Internal Audit Department to undertake in the group. The results of the survey indicated that our ethical culture is sound, based on employee responses to the survey. Our efforts in this regard have been recognised by the UN Global Compact, which selected Altron as one of only 13 global corporations to be featured during the Rio + 20 Corporate Sustainability Forum in terms of the work these companies have done regarding the Compact’s 10th principle, which deals with anti-corruption. We were delighted that our efforts to build an ethical culture were also recognised by the South African National Business Ethics Survey, conducted under the auspices of the Ethics Institute of South Africa, in which Altron was ranked first in terms of overall ranking, organisational culture and organisational satisfaction and leadership, within South Africa. As part of the on-going awareness campaign around ethical behaviour, Altron launched an internal ethics competition called “What does ethics mean to me?” Employees were encouraged to enter the competition by submitting drawings/photographs/stories/poems of their interpretation of ethics and how they would explain it to someone else. The competition received an overwhelming response, which in itself, supports the positive ethical culture throughout the group. Having obtained the information from the competition, we were able to review and update the Altron Code of Ethics appropriately. We therefore believe that the Altron Code of Ethics is unique to the group and effective in continue to build an ethical culture. “Tip-Off Tim”, our anonymous tip off hotline is designed to deal with reports of theft, fraud, dishonesty and anti-corrupt behaviour within the group. The hotline is has been outsourced to a third party and intentionally kept at arms-length to gain the confidence of those reporting and requiring their identity to be kept confidential. Once the reports are received by Tip-off Tim, they are referred to the relevant management teams within the group and investigated within 24hours. Where potentially feasible, ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Altron’s 2013 UNGC COP Report November 2013 P a g e | 18 feedback is provided to the relevant employee(s) who provided the tip-off. We believe that as a result of this initiative, human resources has been able to conduct disciplinary processes effectively. Except for our anonymous tip-off line, concerns around fraudulent or illegal activity can also be reported directly to:  a secure, confidential e-mail address at the ethics office;  Altron’s Internal Audit Department;  Altron’s Ethics Officer; and  the relevant sub-holding group security officers. There was no legal action taken against the company for anti-competitive behaviour, anti-trust or monopoly practices and we were not subject to any fines or non-monetary sanctions for noncompliance with laws and regulations. During the year we joined World Without Corruption, an international initiative to fight corruption. No donations were made to any political parties during the year under review. The Altron memorandum of incorporation plus our policy on political donations, which is aligned with our Corporate Compliance Policy and Anti-corruption and Economic Crime Policy, states that all donations to political parties must be pre-approved by shareholders in a general meeting. Altron’s new “Sustainability in the Supply Chain Strategy” will so require suppliers to confirm that they have read, understood and comply with the relevant Altron policies and that they subscribe to principles of lawful and ethical business conduct as dealt with in these policies. As the actions of a single employee can affect the reputation of the entire Altron group, all employees and partners are required to maintain the highest ethical standards to ensure that the group’s business is conducted in a way that in all reasonable circumstances is beyond reproach.
