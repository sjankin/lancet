Towards a sustainable future SNCB Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2012 Destination better 2 About... …the UN Global Compact Network The United Nations Global Compact is a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption: • Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights • Principle 2: Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. • Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; • Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; • Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labour; and • Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. • Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; • Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and • Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. • Principle 10: Businesses should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery. Endorsed by chief executives, the Global Compact is a practical framework for the development, implementation, and disclosure of sustainability policies and practices, offering participants a wide spectrum of workflows, management tools and resources — all designed to help advance sustainable business models and markets. Overall, the Global Compact pursues two complementary objectives: 1. Mainstream the ten principles in business activities around the world. 2. Catalyse actions in support of broader UN goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. With these objectives in mind, the Global Compact has shaped an initiative that provides collaborative solutions to the most fundamental challenges facing both business and society. The initiative seeks to combine the best qualities of the UN, such as moral authority and convening power, with the private sector’s solution-finding strengths and the expertise and capacities of a range of key stakeholders. The Global Compact is global and local; private and public; voluntary yet accountable. (Source: UN Global Compact) 3 …a COP When joining the Global Compact, companies make a commitment to issue an annual Communication on Progress (COP), a public disclosure to stakeholders (e.g., investors, consumers, civil society and governments) on progress made in implementing the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, and in supporting broad UN development goals. The COP is the most important expression of a participant’s commitment to the Global Compact and its principles. (Source: UN Global Compact) …the scope of this report This COP is limited to SNCB; it does not report on the activities of its sister companies Infrabel and SNCB Holding, nor its subsidiaries and its participations. …the reporting year All actions described in this report took place in 2012 (unless otherwise stated). The data also refer to 2012. How to read this report? The report is built around three sections. The first section describes the profile of SNCB, its strategic challenges and its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy. You will also read about SNCB’s corporate governance approach. The following sections explain our CSR efforts towards our four main target groups: our customers, our employees, our stakeholders and society. In the final part of the report you will find an overview of our fleet and the details of our reporting methodology. 4 Table of contents 2012 Highlights 5 CEO’s message 6 Organization 7 SNCB’s approach to CSR 19 Committed to meeting our responsibilities Responsibility towards our customers: improve quality of our service 22 Responsibility towards our employees: anchor sustainability into corporate culture 38 Responsibility towards our stakeholders: operate cost-effective services 53 Responsibility towards society: contribute to a sustainable mobility 60 Fleet overview 74 Reporting methodology 80 5 2012 highlights PEOPLE Operational safety (page 24) 98,2% of our trains are equipped with the automatic train control system TBL1+ Encouraging diversity (page 40) Number of female employees has increased by 43% since 2012 PLANET Sustainable mode of transport (page 28) CO2 emissions per passenger further reduced to 21.1 g (-60% compared to 1990) Environmental management systems (page 45) Merelbeke and Stockem traction workshops qualified for their ISO 14001 certificate PROFIT & PERFORMANCE Passenger growth (page 29) 231,2 million passengers transported Productivity and efficiency (page 49) BeLEAN project launched at the workshops in Monceau, Gentbrugge, Schaerbeek and Cuesmes 6 CEO’s message 2012 was a fascinating year for SNCB, with many novelties taking shape. Our energy-efficient Desiro trains were put on the rails; we opened the new, fast connection to Brussels Airport; we launched a completely renovated, user-friendly website and we made progress in terms of punctual train traffic as well as customer satisfaction. We also managed to maintain our efforts towards increased safety at good levels; as a result, all of our trains will be equipped with the automatic stop system TBL1 as early as the second quarter of 2013. So, can we say that SNCB is ready for the future? Yes, the projects launched in recent years will greatly enhance our position as a safe and high quality railway operator. Yes, we are watchful of our expenses and are streamlining our business processes so as to increase productivity and efficiency. However, much more is needed if we want to make real progress in the future. To reshape transport in our country (fewer traffic jams; less car use; more sustainable transport) we need an integrated vision covering all the different modes of transport. A vision integrating local, regional and national ambitions; but one that also looks to the future and addresses the role we wish to play in Europe as a hub and supply and transit country. SNCB is ready to share thoughts and provide input – after all, our future depends on it. In this second SNCB COP report you will learn more about the initiatives SNCB took in 2012 to guarantee a sustainable future, according to the commitment SNCB made when joining the UN Global Compact and its local Belgian Network in July 2011. SNCB supports the UN Global Compact principles and will continue to keep them in mind whilst implementing its business objectives.

SNCB Mobility is expected to provide its passengers with a comprehensive range of national connections together with a number of destinations just across the Belgian borders. The fares are set up in such a way as to promote home/work travel, home/school travel and mobility of the socially underprivileged. Given the fact that passenger revenues cannot cover all costs, expenses for national passenger transport are co-financed by the government. The public service obligations SNCB has to fulfil in order to receive this government compensation are described in a management contract (the so-called ‘contrat de gestion’). The domestic passenger rail market is currently not open to competition, so SNCB is the sole operator on the domestic passenger rail market in Belgium.

SNCB does not receive government financing for its commercial activities (which are open to competition). International trains are operated by SNCB Europe, SNCB’s international passenger division. The high-speed trains Thalys, TGV (SNCF), ICE (DB) and Eurostar provide the international traveller with comprehensive service to the largest cities in our neighbouring countries. In the competitive international passenger traffic market, SNCB Europe cooperates with Thalys, DB and SNCF. Since September 2010, Eurostar has become an independent train operating company (Eurostar International Ltd.) which operates high speed traffic between Belgium and the United Kingdom.

Freight Services is SNCB’s division that manages the freight stations. Freight Services conducts tasks such as shunting and marshalling in the freight stations. The other freight activities are provided by SNCB Logistics NV/SA. SNCB Logistics NV/SA has been an independent branch of SNCB and SNCB Holding, operational as railway operator for freight transport since 1 February 2011. SNCB Logistics and its subsidiaries offer services on freight axes and in market segments such as steel and container transport. The majority of the subsidiaries are responsible for commercializing freight transport. Their activities also include container transport, inland shipping and sea transport. The activities of SNCB Logistics and its subsidiaries are not covered in this report. In order to ensure that its activities function effectively, SNCB is also responsible for purchasing, maintaining, managing and financing its rolling stock. The SNCB Technics department operates a range of workshops across the country for maintaining and managing rolling stock.

As a public law company, SNCB fully endorses this endeavour to raise awareness and improve the effective management and control of its activities. In the framework of its public service tasks, SNCB must be accountable to the State and its customers, the train passengers. In terms of Corporate Governance rules, SNCB concentrates on the reference code imposed by Royal Decree of 6 June 2010 (Belgian Statute Book of 28 June 2010), except for explicitly different definitions from the Act from 21 March 1991 regarding the reform of some economic governmental companies.

The UN approved this request so that SNCB is a fully-fledged member of the Global Compact Network. With this, SNCB underscores that it endorses the principles of the Global Compact and that these principles systematically constitute part of the business strategy. Together with 62 other Belgian companies, SNCB forms part of the local Belgian Global Compact Network.

This has not yet produced the desired results: the quality of service took an unacceptable step backwards and is currently insufficient for a number of essential indicators such as punctuality. It is therefore essential that SNCB assumes its responsibility towards its customers by improving the quality of its service. One of the challenges for the coming years is to focus the operating structures even more on the needs of the customer and in this sense to streamline the level of quality the customer desires and the organization. SNCB’s vision concerning quality translates into the motto that the company launched in 2009 and on which all employees work day in day out to effectively achieve it: destination better!

A pilot 246 traction units equipped with ETCS project is ready for implementation in 2013. According to the plan, the required safety Status certificates will be issued by the end of 2014. Gradual rollout of the required IT system and technical adjustments on all of the platforms and trains can then start in 2015. I Chapter 3: Responsibility towards our customers Chapter 3: Responsibility towards our customers 26 Improving train accessibility The accessibility of rolling stock remains one of SNCB’s constant focal points. This will become even more important in future because of population ageing. That is why in the long-term SNCB Target gradually increase number of trains that can would like to enable passengers with reduced mobility (PRM) to use the train with no or limited accommodate wheelchairs external assistance. In order to reach this goal, wheelchair accessibility to rolling stock should improve. In line with Schedule not defined this, 76 multifunctional M6 double-deck carriages have been taken into service in the past few years. These passenger cars have lowered access doors and offer increased space. The new ‘Desiro’ carriages have been added to the network since the start of 2012. A low access step and Situation 2012 24,1% of all SNCB trains can accommodate wide door opening make these trains easily accessible for PRM. They are also equipped with a wheelchairs ramp for wheelchair users. In the multifunctional area, two seats are reserved for wheelchairs. The toilet, too, is accessible for persons with reduced mobility and equipped with an alarm at a low point for people who are unable to get up independently after a fall. Status Trains that are easy to access are not only advantageous for passengers with limited mobility, but also for passengers who carry a child’s pram, suitcase or bike with them. By the end 2012, 24.1% of all SNCB carriages/railcars were able to accommodate wheelchairs. Chapter 3: Responsibility towards our customers 27 Expanding services for passengers with reduced mobility Passengers with reduced mobility (PRM) are able to make use of a system of mobile teams which provide assistance in stations where no or insufficient numbers of staff are available. This service Target is called “B-for-You Assistance”. gradually expand and optimize services for passengers with reduced mobility This assistance is provided in 114 stations, from the first to the last train of the day, seven days a week if a request is submitted to the Call Centre at least 24 hours in advance by internet or Schedule telephone. In addition, PRMs can be driven by taxi to one of these 114 stations from 17 stations not defined where no assistance is available. In 2012, SNCB Mobility employees officially provided assistance about 100,759 times to PRMs. Furthermore, it is estimated that ‘unofficial’ assistance is provided Situation 2012 to PRMs approximately 6,000 times each month (when no official request for this was submitted). services provided in/from 131/552 stations (17 with taxi service) About stair climbers, assistance columns and induction Status loop devices for the hearing impaired To further improve the accessibility of stations, SNCB purchased 24 stair climbers in 2012. Stair climbers ensure that in case of an elevator breakdown, works performed at the station or any other exceptional circumstances, passengers with reduced mobility still can take the train without any problems. SNCB will also install assistance points in these 114 stations for anyone with reduced mobility. These points will allow less-able people to request assistance or wait for help. 75 assistance points were in use in 2012. Finally, passengers with impaired hearing sometimes have a problem understanding the words of agents at the counter. For those passengers SNCB now provides induction loop devices that send the agent’s spoken words directly to the passenger’s hearing aid. 330 induction loop devices have been distributed among the stations that have counters.

Chapter 3: Responsibility towards our customers 29 Profit & Performance Improving punctuality For several years, the punctuality of train traffic has been under pressure. Despite strict followup of delays and an analysis of the problem, in recent years SNCB has made little progress. Punctuality is the result of a complex interplay of factors that have been put under pressure by the robust growth of the number of passengers, more intensive use of the railway network, infrastructure works and the age of the trains. Punctual driving is a vital concern for SNCB. Delays are the greatest annoyance of the customers and do not benefit the image of the company. With the punctuality action plan, SNCB, in collaboration with Infrabel, wants to win the battle against the clock. The action plan contains more than 100 measures in 6 different areas such as transport planning and scheduling, rolling stock…. These measures should have positive impact on punctuality in the short and medium-term. Chapter 3: Responsibility towards our customers 30 Case: Punctuality 2012: better, but the track, he is compelled to stop and no longer not as good as was forecast allowed to proceed ‘carefully’.

Between 2000 and 2012, SNCB Mobility transported up to 60% more passengers (from 139.9 mil. passengers in 2000 to 223.3 mil. passengers in 2012). The increase in passengers in recent years was even so great that SNCB became the European leader by far.

The customer’s perception of quality is evaluated on the basis of the quality barometer. Between 2009 and 2011, the quality barometer revealed a sharp decline. For general customer satisfaction, the average score out of 10 decreased from 6.92 in 2009 to 6.28 in 2011. However, 2012 again saw an improvement of customer satisfaction to a score of 6.49 out of 10. Average score out of 10 2009 2010 2011 2012 (n=13,994) (n=12,633) (n=12,366) (n=12,075) General customer satisfaction 6.92 6.41 6.28 6.49 Various studies and surveys clearly demonstrate that information is a very important element of customer satisfaction. Customers want access to correct and current information always and everywhere. SNCB responded to this with the development of all sorts of applications via internet, sms, smartphone and mobile information stands. Further development of these applications continued in 2012. Smartphone apps have been downloaded more than 500,000 times since! Case: a new website tailored to our customers’ needs September 2012 saw the launch of SNCB’s new website. Despite a visual upgrade in 2009, the previous website was, in fact, past its use-by date. The new website not only looks better, it is also more user-friendly and offers several new options. More than before, the site has been built to meet our customers’ needs and includes a new route planner, a more logical purchasing module, expanded leisure time offer, better search options, etc. The technology used for the site allows SNCB to provide better responsiveness and also facilitates speedier content modifications and rapid problem detection.

To this end, SNCB employees serve to formulate an answer to the challenges of tomorrow which are situated within each pillar of the triple bottom line. Against the background of increasing interculturalism, a crooked age pyramid (nearly half of SNCB employees will reach natural retirement age in the coming ten years) and onrushing liberalization, more and more attention will also have to be paid to increasing productivity and accentuating care for the environment.

Chapter 4: Responsibility towards our employees 41 Women At the end of 2012, SNCB employed 2,192 women, representing 11.3% of all staff. The railways used to be a male bastion (explained by the fact that some rather technical jobs have long been regarded as jobs for men), but female employees are gaining ground. Their numbers have increased by 43.08% since 2005. Number of female employees 3,000 2,157 2,192 2,025 2,000 1,793 1,917 1,532 1,516 1,598 1,000 0 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 In conclusion, it is not insignificant to mention that SNCB makes no distinction between men and women when it comes to remuneration of its employees. Case: Ladies’ Day, edition 2012 On 26 March 2012 the seventh edition of SNCB’s Ladies’ Day took place. On that day, 120 participants had the chance to meet some of their female colleagues – all with different backgrounds. One third of the participating ladies were field workers. For them it was an ideal opportunity to exchange experiences. The morning’s interactive workshops led by professional coaches on themes such as communication, assertiveness and conflict management, were followed by an afternoon presentation of the various workshops, ending in a debate on the themes discussed. Laurence Bovy, Chair of the Board of Directors of SNCB, is a great supporter of Ladies’ Day: “I wish to support all the women in our company by organizing a day dedicated entirely to them. I encourage all our female staff to realize their professional ambitions.” Chapter 4: Responsibility towards our employees 42 Foreigners Reclassification The number of foreign employees is very difPeople who can no longer carry out their ficult to ascertain.

Rainwater is also increasingly being used for flushing toilets, cleaning workshops and washing the trains. Given the signifiStatus: cant rise in water prices, the capture and use of rain water is economically interesting, however it not available is not free. Investments must be made in the infrastructure in order to capture it, and an internal distribution network with pipes and pumps must be installed. Case: water recovery at the train wash unit of the Ostend workshop The traction workshop (TW) in Ostend took a covered train wash unit into operation in 2005. The main advantage of covered train wash units is that trains can be washed regardless of the weather circumstances, whereas in uncovered units, washing is impossible at temperatures below zero. But TW Ostend goes even further: it catches the wastewater and filters it for renewed use in train washing, saving up to 80% of the mains water per unit. How does the filtering work? The filthy washing water is caught in a tank and subsequently pumped to the oil separator. More tanks then serve to remove the waste through flocculation. The flakes sink to the bottom and are removed separately; the water is then pumped through a sand filter after which it is ready for use. The cycle obviously is not unlimited, which is why TW Ostend uses measuring systems that check how many times the water can be reused. As soon as the water quality no longer meets certain conditions, it is discharged.

Chapter 4: Responsibility towards our employees 49 Profit & Performance Increasing productivity and efficiency Maintenance and repair workshops form the heart of SNCB. Without the daily efforts of more than 6,000 employees, no train can ride safely and comfortably. These workshops are facing a revolution. The Taylorian, strongly hierarchical approach of the working organization is being completely revised in order to provide an answer to the challenges of tomorrow. That is the commitment of the ambitious BeLEAN project: the introduction of lean management principles should lead to a more horizontal organization, empowerment of the employees on the shop floor, inspirational coaching instead of strict leadership and assertive teams. The final commitment: satisfied customers. BeLEAN places the customer at the centre of the working organization. The focus is on what the customer considers to be added value. Operational practices and management systems are examined based upon this. The whole process is supported by the staff, so that their attitude and behaviour also play an important role in implementing the lean methodology.

Associations and official bodies which influence the policy of the railway operator are among the key stakeholders of SNCB. Our stakeholders constitute an important target group in this report. Through its financing mechanisms via the government, the railway in our country requires substantial financial contributions from the community. It goes without saying that it is expected from a company like SNCB that in exchange for this, it provides a balanced and high-quality offering of train services and in this pays great attention to adequate management of operational costs.

This plan will offer solace in the short to medium-term for accommodating the increasing number of passengers. Chapter 5: Responsibility towards our stakeholders 56 Engaging stakeholders SNCB attaches great importance to providing information to its stakeholders: key stakeholders such as TreinTramBus, ACTP (Association des Clients des Transports Publics), the ombudsmen, RCG/CCU (Raadgevend Comité van Gebruikers/Comité Consultatif des Usagers) and FOD M&V/SPF M&T (Federale Overheidsdienst Mobiliteit & Vervoer/Service public fédéral Mobilité & Transports) are invited about four times per year for an informational meeting which presents projects which are about to be realized. SNCB is also ready to enter into dialogue with local authorities or clients in order to, for instance, discuss the consequences of a change to the timetable or to provide more explanation about recurring problems on certain connections.

We keep employees and families moving and we provide an essential public service for many people. We also play an essential role in contributing to sustainable mobility: the train is a safe, climate friendly, increasingly quiet and congestion-free mode of transport. Chapter 6: Responsibility towards the community 62 People Offering safe mobility Fatalities and seriously injured per billion passenger km in Belgium (Source: FPS Economy, 2010) The train is intrinsically a very safe means of transportation. In 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012, no passengers died in accidents of which SNCB was at the cause. In 2010, 19 people lost their 10 lives in a tragic train accident near Buizingen.

Chapter 6: Responsibility towards the community 65 Planet Delivering climate-friendly mobility In 2009, the European transport sector (EU27) was responsible for approximately 31% of total CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in Europe. Road transport accounted for 71% of all CO2 emissions from European transport, railways for only 1.8%. Between 1990 and 2009, CO2 emissions from European transport grew by nearly 28%: all transport modes – except railways – have increased their total emissions. (Source: International Energy Agency – International Union of Railways, 2012) EU27 CO2 emissions from fuel combustion by sector (Source: IEA – UIC, 2012) Transport Transport 31.2% Road 71.0% Electricity and Heat 37.8% Rail 1.8% Agriculture, forestery and fishing 1.5% Navigation 14.3% Manufacturing 13.2% Aviation 12.3% Residential 11.3% Other Transport 0.5% Other 4.9% Chapter 6: Responsibility towards the community 66 Change in CO2 emission from fuel combustion per mode between 1990 and 2009 • vision 2050: European railways will strive (Source: IEA – UIC, 2012) towards carbon-free train operation by 2050 80% SNCB actively contributes to help realize these objectives. Between 1990 and 2012, specific CO2 emissions in passenger transport decreased by no less than 60%. The decline is even so strong that the European target of -30% was already reached in 2005 and the 40% target of -50% in 2008.

With this formula, employees can combine use of their leased car with the train, always in function of travelling. A journey from city centre to city centre, for example, is much more efficient with the train than with the car. In 2012, 79,901 people made use of Railease. Chapter 6: Responsibility towards the community 69 Providing value for money In 2012, SNCB invested 423.0 million euros. That money went primarily for new trains (72.7%). In terms of new stock the new Desiro power cars take the biggest share of the expenditure, followed by the T18 locomotives. Furthermore, in the area of passenger equipment, modernization (Breakpower cars and M5 carriages) and installation of TBL1+ and ETCS are important investment items. For future rolling stock purchases, SNCB is currently developing a project in which the entire life cycle cost is taken into consideration as an award criterion. The life cycle cost of the rolling stock will hereby be divided into different cost categories in which energy consumption and environmental cost (e.g. noise) are given a place. SNCB continues to work on a thorough renewal of its management tools with the introduction of ERP-related applications. These include information management, customer relations management (CRM) as well as personnel applications, such as more optimal registration of activities in the workshops. The workshops also receive more resources, on the one hand for renovation works, on the other hand for investments in new workshops. Last but not least, an investment of almost € 10 million was made into passenger reception (e.g. new vending machines). SNCB investments in 2012 Rolling stock domestic services 72.7% Passenger reception 3,2% IT 17,2% Workshops 7,4% Other 0,4% Chapter 6: Responsibility towards the community 70 Rendering stable employment opportunities Employees are the greatest asset of our company as they enable the growth and development of the railways. On 1 January 2013, SNCB employed 18,320 full-time equivalents. This makes SNCB one of Belgium’s largest companies in terms of number of employees. In 2012, a total of 920 new employees were recruited. About 98% of all SNCB employees work on a permanent basis (statutory basis). An employee that is recruited on a statutory basis does not sign an employment contract but falls under the remit of the personnel statute that sets out the legal terms and conditions of the statutory employee. The personnel statute encompasses definitions which relate to recruitment, remuneration, holidays, various rights and obligations, social advantages and pensions etc. Non-statutory or temporary employees (about 2% of all SNCB employees) are recruited in order to meet extraordinary and temporary demands, to carry out tasks that require specific knowledge or requirements, to replace other staff during periods of absence or to conduct specific, additional tasks.
