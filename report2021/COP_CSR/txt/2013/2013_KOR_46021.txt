Yuhan-Kimberly’s Creating Shared Value (CSV) management Yuhan-Kimberly pursues a ‘Creating Shared Value (CSV)’ management model whereby the company promotes its senior business while contributing to addressing the pressing social problem of aging in Korean society. CSV in essence means creating shared values to open up new business opportunities in the course of addressing social problems. This model originated in the idea that the social issues involved in an aging society can be an opportunity, rather than a problem, and that, from this perspective, if seniors become active seniors, they will contribute to resolving the perceived problems to do with aging. CSV aims to contribute to the development of society as a whole through creating new business. For this, YuhanKimberly strives to expand senior employment by establishing ‘senior occupation fund’ and fostering small companies and social enterprises.

SCOTT® Reusable Towel Yuhan-Kimberly’s innovative products (Released in July 2010) ‘SCOTT® Reusable Towel’ and ‘My Bidet’ The reusable towel is an innovative product that can reduce product usage and waste thanks to its wet strength which is three times greater than normal kitchen towel products. This superior performance was realized through a special method combining pulp with non-woven fabric, while two times higher wet absorption enables its reuse. My Bidet, a toilet wet tissue, was released based on the result of a survey that 65% of consumers are not satisfied with using only toilet paper. Combining the merits of toilet paper and bidets, My Bidet loosens easily in water in a toilet bowl. It is an innovative product that can bring changes to the way we use the toilet.
