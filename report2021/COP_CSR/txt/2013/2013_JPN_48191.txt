Review of the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2013 Our consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, the first year of Medium-Term Business Plan ’12, were as follows. Orders received increased by 6.4% from the previous fiscal year to ¥1,449.5 billion, primarily due to an increase in orders for large-scale projects in the Tokyo metropolitan area for the domestic building construction business. Net sales increased by 16.3% to ¥1,448.3 billion from the same period last year due to an increase in net sales from mainly the construction business and real estate and other business of the Company and its subsidiaries.

Targets for the final year of the Medium-Term Business Plan ’12 ending March 31, 2015 are interest-bearing debt balance of less than ¥360 billion and D/E ratio of lower than 0.9. We aim for ROE of 8%. For that reason, we will work to improve profitability in the domestic construction business, and enhance asset efficiency by firmly reviewing our asset portfolio.

This is an insightful urban development and civil engineering project in which a super high-rise building with a major thoroughfare (Loop Road No. 2) piercing right through it is being built for the first time in Tokyo. Obayashi is constructing a super high-rise building that will be the secondtallest in Tokyo, rising 247 meters high, with 5 floors below ground and 52 floors above ground.

Sakurada Street Atagoshita Street Hibiya Street Shimbashi Nishiguchi Street Road above ground Road above ground and subterranean tunnel Related information http://www.obayashi.co.jp/projects/project16 (currently available in Japanese only) OUR SOLUTION Respond to Short Schedules and High Degrees of Difficulty with Technology and Ingenuity Obayashi brings complex projects to realization through technological capabilities and ingenuity. Outer wall lifting system Construction of super high-rise buildings requires transporting a large amount of materials up to great heights, so the challenge is coming up with a safe and efficient method of transport. We adopted a novel system for transporting only curtain walls such as outer wall glass. Obayashi achieved safe and efficient operations by separating the transport of these materials from other construction materials such as steel frames. Total Station This groundbreaking project has a subterranean tunnel curving under a super high-rise building. Achieving this required support pillars pile-driven very accurately into the invisible ground, and furthermore, along the curve of the road. We used Total Station, the 3D laser surveying equipment we also used in the construction of TOKYO SKYTREE®, to pinpoint the positions of 237 support pillars, some weighing as much as 90 tons, to less than 3 mm in surveying error and more than 1/700 in vertical accuracy.

Today, Thai Obayashi has established an unassailable standing in the construction ­industry within Thailand, and is continuing to develop. In 2012, net sales increased substantially as a result of strong capital expenditure by Japanese corporations in Thailand. Going forward, we will become more selective in the orders we receive and apply centralized procurement in re-examining our cost structure to create a stable earnings structure. And we will also promote the introduction of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and other new information and communications technology (ICT) to improve operating efficiency. In addition to entering new business domains such as real estate development, engineering, and data centers, Thai Obayashi will develop business in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and other neighboring countries to expand its earnings base.

Thai Obayashi has for many years supported mainly Japanese manufacturing customers entering Thailand. In factory construction, in particular, Thai Obayashi has provided the same level of construction technology and ingenuity as in Japan. In areas other than construction, Thai Obayashi also supports customers comprehensively, for example, by providing information on land available for building.

corporate responsibilities as the best way “toward a brighter future.” This is the goal of all of our business activities. As a good corporate citizen, Obayashi strives to meet the expectations and needs of all stakeholders. Obayashi’s social responsibility policy, “Our Unique Approach,” was formulated as part of Obayashi’s Vision, Values, and Commitments in order for the Company to be strongly aware of its responsibilities incurred in developing business activities ( p.01). Obayashi’s social responsibility policy “Our Unique Approach” makes the Company’s CSR initiatives easier to relate to by defining its mission and responsibilities through the keyword “EGAO,” which means “smiles” in Japanese, sorting the priority areas that Obayashi should work on towards realizing a sustainable society into four aspects: “E” for Engagement with customers, “G” for Global perspective, “A” for Amenity and associates, and “O” for Open communication with stakeholders. “EGAO,” or smiles, also reminds Obayashi of its responsibilities to society, captured in its corporate message, “Toward a brighter future.” Obayashi is committed to securing the trust of society by thoroughly practicing fundamental CSR, centered on compliance with laws and regulations and on internal controls, and to contributing to the creation of a sustainable world. To this end, Obayashi engages in “CSR that creates value.” Which is to say, CSR involvement in solving social issues through business activities, by maintaining dialogue with stakeholders and reflecting their expectations and demands toward the Company in Obayashi’s business strategies.

EG AO Related information Engagement with Customers http://www.obayashi.co.jp/english/csr/society/customers Provide High-Quality Construction Obayashi Corporation is introducing new information and communications technology (ICT), such as tablet computers, cloud computing and building information modeling (BIM) for construction management, to transform construction site work styles. Through this ICT-driven transformation, we are working to improve operational efficiency, enhance quality control, and supply our customers with top-quality buildings that meet their expectations. m Use of Tablet Computers Approximately 3,000 tablet computers have been distributed to all on-site engineers managing construction. Deployment of the tablet computers takes maximum advantage of their key characteristics—mobility and visual capabilities—to enable on-site engineers to review the latest data and process work even at the construction site. This new work style makes it possible for us to respond even more quickly to what is happening on-site. Obayashi has developed and deployed construction management support applications utilizing these tablet computers, including inspection systems for reinforcing bar arrangements, equipment, and finishing inspections. These applications have streamlined tasks and enhanced our quality assurance functions. Introduction of Cloud-based Blueprint Service Obayashi has also introduced a cloud-based blueprint service. The latest blueprints are centrally managed on a cloud-based server, and can be viewed in the field using a tablet computer. At a construction site, blueprints may be frequently revised during construction in response to diverse customer needs. In managing the construction work, on-site engineers were also required to carry around stacks of heavy, paper blueprints. Introduction of this cloud-based service makes it possible to view the latest blueprint versions with a tablet computer, preventing re-work caused by confusion over blueprints, ensuring quality, and resulting in enhanced productivity.

Use of visualized building models assists information sharing and mutual understanding among everyone involved in a project, including clients, architects, and builders. It enables them to form a consensus on various aspects of the project during the early stages. The models can also run simulations to make pre-construction interference checks to find and resolve conflicts, eliminating re-work and contributing to smooth progress in construction and a quality product. We are taking steps to apply BIM in all of our design and construction projects by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016.

Employing proprietary concrete mixed with seawater developed by Obayashi, high-quality concrete can be produced using seawater. Because the technique greatly increases the initial strength of the blocks, allowing them to be removed from the forms quickly, production time is also reduced. In addition, because the concrete rubble can be used as-is, with no additional crushing or processing needed, costs can be reduced by about 35% compared to using fresh concrete. * Joint development between Obayashi Corporation, Tokyo Institute of Technology, and Tohoku University Filling a tetrapod form with concrete rubble A completed tetrapod Create a Nature Symbiotic Society Ratio of green space m Development of the Ikimono-Navi Environmental Evaluation System for Urban Biodiversity Adjacency of differing Woodland proximity environments Obayashi has developed Ikimono-Navi, a system for estimating the habitats for living organisms without actual biological surveys.

To prevent occupational accidents, we have established an Occupational Safety and Health Management System that integrates management methods for health and safety. We make constant improvements to this system by reviewing the policies we implemented each year. We made eliminating fatal accidents one of our targets for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, ­carrying out the following priority measures.

To address this problem, since 2011 Obayashi has offered its Obayashi Excellent Site Supervisor Certification Program, which certifies exceptional supervisors responsible for skilled construction workers, and provides an ­additional allowance for them. In addition, we support our supplier groups, including the Rin-yu-kai and the Obayashi Accident Prevention Association, dispatching lecturers for training sessions and holding joint training sessions for newly recruited employees at the various member companies.

Additionally, the Company practices precise and swift decision-making through its executive officer system and Management Meeting, which is composed of members appointed from among the directors and executive officers. The Board of Directors is composed of up to 15 directors. Each director makes management decisions, as well as supervises the execution of duties by other directors, executive officers and employees. The tenure for directors is one year, which enables the Company to respond dynamically to changes in the business environment, while also clarifying management responsibilities for each business term. In order to clarify the selection process for directors, corporate auditors and executive officers and the decisionmaking process for remuneration and other matters, Obayashi has established a Recommendation Committee and a Remuneration Committee. The Audit Committee comprises a maximum of five corporate auditors (of whom the majority must be outside corporate auditors). In accordance with the “Obayashi Audit Guidelines for Corporate Auditors,” the corporate auditors, in a position independent from the directors, conduct audits of the status of business execution by the directors, and to ensure the appropriateness of the financial statements, by monitoring and verifying the work of the independent auditor (accounting firm). Appointment of Outside Director In order to further strengthen corporate governance, Obayashi appointed one new outside director at the 109th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 27, 2013. Obayashi’s standards for appointing outside directors/corporate auditors, including standards regarding independence, are as follows. Selection Criteria of Outside Director/Corporate Auditor Candidate 1. The candidate has capabilities, knowledge, experience and character suited to become an outside director/ corporate auditor of Obayashi, and is able to offer guidance and opinions to Obayashi management from an independent and impartial standpoint. 2. The candidate is not a former director/corporate auditor or employee of Obayashi or any of its affiliates. 3. The candidate is not currently affiliated with, or was not affiliated in the past with, Obayashi’s currently contracted accounting firm, law office or main bank. 4. The candidate is not a major shareholder with an ownership stake of 10% or more (or a person currently affiliated with or affiliated in the past with an entity that is a major shareholder). 5. The candidate is not, and has never been, in the service of a trading partner of the Company where the annual transaction amount during the past three fiscal years has been greater than 2% of either the ­Company’s or the trading partner’s annual net sales. 6. The candidate is not serving, and has never served, as an administrator of operations at a non-profit organization to which the Company has made annual donations in excess of ¥20 million during the past three fiscal years. 7. If any of 3 through 6 apply, at least five years have passed since the candidate left the relevant entity. 8. The candidate meets the requirements of “independent directors/auditors” stipulated in the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s securities listing rules. (Enacted October 22, 2010, and revised December 1, 2012) Collaboration between Corporate Auditors and Independent Auditor, and Support System Corporate auditors, the independent auditor, and the Business Administration Department (Obayashi’s internal audit arm) each conduct audits from their independent standpoints, and also collaborate through exchanges of information and opinions as needed to heighten the effectiveness of audits. In addition, an Audit Department independent of the executive branch of the Company has been set up under the instructions of the Audit Committee and corporate auditors as part of the strengthening of their functions. This office primarily monitors compliance with laws and regulations as a department supporting the Audit Committee and corporate auditors. The Company assigns full-time staff to the Audit Department. To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2013 42 Policies for Determining Remuneration for Directors, Corporate Auditors and the Independent Auditor The basic policy with regards to director remuneration is to determine the amount of remuneration for each business term in accordance with actual contribution to earnings, in order to secure outstanding human resources and to provide incentive to each director to improve earnings and enhance corporate value. ­Specifically, the Board of Directors has set a remuneration table in accordance with title and earnings contribution ranking, and at the end of each business term, the Remuneration Committee, which is chaired by the president and comprises members delegated by the committee chairperson, appraises the degree of earnings contribution of individual directors and determines the amount of remuneration for the following fiscal year. The basic policy with regards to the remuneration of the corporate auditors is to set an amount required to secure outstanding human resources in order to have corporate governance function effectively. ­Specifically, remuneration standards are set up in advance in accordance with full-time and part-time status, etc., through discussions among corporate auditors, and remuneration for each corporate ­auditor is determined in line with those standards. With regards to remuneration of the independent auditor (auditing firm), the auditing structure and auditing time required for an appropriate accounting audit is discussed with the auditing firm, taking into account the Obayashi Group’s business size and business characteristics, etc., and a fair auditing ­remuneration amount is determined with the approval of the Audit Committee.

Comments from an Outside Director Q1. What is your impression of Obayashi? My impression is that Obayashi is always taking on new challenges at the cutting edge in ­construction—from the first version of Osaka’s iconic Tsutenkaku tower way back in 1912, to the TOKYO SKYTREE®, completed just last year. The company appears to me to have advanced technical capabilities and to be dedicated to the pursuit of technological innovation. Q2. What are your thoughts on corporate governance? Today, individual consumers are concerned with distinguishing which corporations they can trust. To build its business on the basis of rigorous compliance and earn the trust of its stakeholders, a company must have in place a corporate governance structure to maintain sound business Shinichi Otake ­practices and ensure transparency. Furthermore, there must be an ongoing effort to enhance Outside Director corporate value. Q3. How will you leverage your own experience as a top executive in the management of the Obayashi Group? I’ve been involved for many years in the telecommunications industry, where technical innovation happens very quickly, and companies need to respond swiftly to customer needs. Over the years, I have faced many management issues, including the deregulation of telecommunications markets and the shift from government to private ownership. I want to bring the outside perspective I have gained in this different setting to my work with the management of the Obayashi Group. 43 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2013 To Contents About Obayashi Corporation Business Overview Together with Stakeholders Corporate Data p03–p10 p11–p30 p31–p46 p47–p104 Strict Application of Corporate Ethics Obayashi Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation includes the stipulation that “The Corporation will act in good faith in compliance with laws and regulations,” in order to ensure thorough awareness of compliance issues, including corporate ethics, and create a sound corporate culture. Obayashi Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation, Article 3 (Compliance and ­sensible course of action) Each and every director and employee of the Corporation will comply with all laws and regulations, have a high awareness of ethics in corporate activities, and will act in good faith. In particular, in winning orders for construction work, no actions will be taken that hinder the fairness and legitimacy of public tenders, such as tender bids that violate criminal law or the Anti-Monopoly Act (Act on Prohibition of Private Monopolization and Maintenance of Fair Trade). Hold Corporate Ethics Committee Meetings The Corporate Ethics Committee, chaired by the president, has been established based on the ­Corporate Ethics Program. It meets regularly to deliberate on important matters related to corporate ethics, including the establishment of basic compliance policies, and works to rigorously ensure compliance within the Company. In order to incorporate assessments from independent parties, the Committee’s members include ­outside authorities and the head of the employees’ union. Group companies have also established similar committees, and systems are in place for promoting corporate ethics. Corporate Ethics Training In April of each year, workplace training in corporate ethics is held for all officers and employees in Japan and overseas, with the goal of ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations and sensible behavior. Using a Corporate Ethics Workplace Training Textbook produced by the Corporate Ethics Committee secretariat, the detailed training focuses discussion on specific cases addressing elimination of anti-social forces, prevention of accounting fraud and other issues. m Initiatives Overseas Initiatives at Group companies outside of Japan are proceeding according to ­circumstances in each country. These Textbook translated include ethics training for national staff into different languages (locally hired staff) using versions of the Corporate Ethics Workplace Training ­Textbook translated into the language of each country. Training session at Obayashi Vietnam m Initiatives with Suppliers At its main branches nationwide, Obayashi holds an ongoing series of training sessions for suppliers who comprise the Rin-yu-kai, as part of our effort to help member firms build and establish corporate ethics within their own organizations.

Further details Financial Statements http://www.obayashi.co.jp/english/ir/financial_statements/ To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2013 56 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements OBAYASHI CORPORATION For the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 1. Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the accounts maintained by OBAYASHI CORPORATION (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Companies”) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan. Certain amounts in the prior year’s financial statements were reclassified to conform to the changes made for the latest fiscal year. 2. U.S. Dollar Amounts The accounts of the consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in Japanese yen by rounding down to the nearest million. The U.S. dollar amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto were translated from the original Japanese yen into U.S. dollars on the basis of ¥94.05 to US$1, the rate of exchange prevailing at March 31, 2013, and were then rounded down to the nearest thousand. The approximate rate of exchange prevailing at May 31, 2013 was ¥101.18=U.S.$1. These U.S. dollar amounts are not intended to imply that the Japanese yen amounts have been or could be converted, realized or settled in U.S. dollars at this or any other rate. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (1) Scope of consolidation and application of the equity method The Company had 87 subsidiaries at March 31, 2013. The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 included the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Investments in all affiliates (28 companies for 2013) are accounted for by the equity method. (2) Business year for consolidated subsidiaries Certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries (31 companies) and a domestic consolidated subsidiary (1 company) have a fiscal year that ends on December 31. Certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries (5 companies) have a fiscal year that ends on February 28. The consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the financial statements as of the same date or provisional settlement based on the latest quarterly financial statements. Necessary adjustments for consolidation were made on significant transactions that took place during the period between the fiscal year-end of the subsidiaries and that of the Company. Consolidated subsidiaries other than those referred to above have the same business year as the Company, which ends on March 31. (3) Goodwill Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 5 years. However, goodwill that is not material is charged to income in the year of acquisition. Differences between the cost and underlying net equity of investments in affiliates accounted for by the equity method are charged or credited to income as they occur. (4) Foreign currency translation Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses from translation are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The balance sheet accounts of the foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for the components of net assets excluding minority interests which are translated at their historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Differences arising from the translation are presented as foreign currency translation adjustments and minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. 57 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2013 To Contents About Obayashi Corporation Business Overview Together with Stakeholders Corporate Data p03–p10 p11–p30 p31–p46 p47–p104 (5) Cash equivalents All highly liquid investments, generally with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are so near maturity that they represent only an insignificant risk of any change in value attributable to changes in interest rates, are considered cash equivalents. (6) Short-term investment securities and investment securities Securities are classified into two categories: held-to-maturity and other securities. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at cost. Cost of securities sold is determined by the moving average method. (7) Inventories Real estate held for sale, costs on uncompleted construction contracts, costs on real estate business, inventories for PFI and other projects and costs on other business are all stated at cost determined by the specific identification method. Raw materials and supplies are stated at cost determined by the first-in first-out method. The net book value of inventories in the balance sheet is written down if the net realizable value declines. (8) Property, plant and equipment The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries mainly calculate depreciation by the decliningbalance method, while straight-line method is applied to the buildings, excluding building fixtures, acquired on or after April 1, 1998. Foreign consolidated subsidiaries mainly apply the straight-line method. The useful lives and residual values of depreciable assets are estimated mainly in accordance with the ­Corporate Tax Law. (9) Intangible assets Intangible fixed assets are amortized by the straight-line method. Computer software for internal use is ­amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 5 years. (10) Leased assets Depreciation of leased assets under finance leases that do not transfer ownership of the leased assets to the lessee is calculated by the straight-line method over the lease period with a residual value of zero. (11) Allowance for doubtful accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on the historical experience with respect to writeoffs for the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and based on an estimate of the amount for specific uncollectible accounts for the Companies. (12) Provision for warranties for completed construction The provision for warranties for completed construction is provided to cover expenses for defects claimed concerning completed work, based on the estimated amount of compensation to be paid in the future for the work completed during the fiscal year. (13) Provision for loss on construction contracts The provision for loss on construction contracts is provided at the estimated amount for the future losses on contract backlog at the balance sheet date which will probably be incurred and which can be reasonably estimated. (14) Provision for retirement benefits The provision for retirement benefits is provided mainly at an amount calculated based on the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of the pension plan assets, as adjusted for unrecognized actuarial differences and unrecognized prior service cost. Prior service cost (PSC) is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 10 years which is shorter than the average remaining years of service of the employees, while PSC of certain subsidiaries is expensed as incurred. Actuarial differences are amortized commencing in To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2013 58 the year or in the following year after the difference is recognized primarily by the straight-line method over periods (5 years to 10 years) which are shorter than the average remaining years of service of the employees. (15) Provision for loss on real estate business and other The provision for loss on real estate business and other is provided for the estimated losses to be incurred in liquidating real estate and restructuring the real estate related business. (16) Provision for environmental measures The provision for environmental measures is provided based on an estimate of costs for disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) waste, which the Company and its domestic subsidiaries are obliged to dispose of by the Act on Special Measures Concerning Promotion of Proper Treatment of PCB Waste. (17) Derivatives and hedge accounting (a) Method of hedge accounting Hedging instruments are valued at fair value and accounted for using the deferral method of accounting. The monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, for which foreign exchange forward contracts or currency options are used to hedge the foreign currency fluctuations, are translated at the ­contracted rate if the foreign exchange forward contracts or currency options qualify for hedge accounting. The interest rate swaps, which qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria, are not remeasured at market value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is charged to income (short-cut method). (b) Hedging instruments and hedged items To hedge foreign exchange risks related to the monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and projected future foreign currency transactions, foreign exchange forward contracts and non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts are employed as hedging instruments. To hedge the interest-rate risks and foreign exchange risks related to loans payable and transactions of affiliates, interest rate swaps or ­interest rate/currency swaps are employed as hedging instruments. (c) Hedging policy The Companies utilize derivative financial instruments only for the purpose of hedging future risks of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates in accordance with internal rules. (d) Assessment of hedge effectiveness Hedge effectiveness is not assessed when substantial terms and conditions of the hedging instruments and the hedged transactions are the same. The evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted for interest rate swaps as they meet certain criteria under the short-cut method. (18) Recognizing revenues and costs of construction contracts Revenues and costs of construction contracts of which the percentage of completion can be reliably estimated are recognized by the percentage-of-completion method. The percentage of completion is calculated at the cost incurred as a percentage of the estimated total cost. The completed-contract method continues to be applied for contracts for which the percentage of completion cannot be reliably estimated. Revenues from construction contracts and the related costs of the overseas subsidiaries are mainly recorded on the percentage-of-completion method. (19) Revenues and expenses associated with finance lease transactions Sales and cost of sales are recognized upon receipt of lease payment. (20) Consumption taxes Consumption tax and local consumption tax are accounted for under the tax-exclusive method. (21) Income taxes The Companies apply deferred tax accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of income taxes by the asset/liability method. 59 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2013 To Contents About Obayashi Corporation Business Overview Together with Stakeholders Corporate Data p03–p10 p11–p30 p31–p46 p47–p104 Under the asset/liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. (22) Consolidated taxation system The Companies adopted the consolidated taxation system. 4. Standards Issued but Not Yet Effective “Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Statement No. 26) and “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Guidance No. 25) (1) Summary Actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost that have yet to be recognized in profit or loss shall be recognized within net assets (accumulated other comprehensive income), after adjusting for tax effects, and the deficit or surplus shall be recognized as a liability (liability for retirement benefits) or asset (asset for retirement benefits). (2) Effective date This standard and related guidance are effective as of the end of fiscal years beginning on or after April 1, 2013. (3) Impact on applying this standard and related guidance The Company is currently evaluating the impact these modifications will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial position. 5. Change in Accounting Policies With the revision of the Corporation Tax Act, the Company and domestic subsidiaries have changed the method of depreciation of tangible noncurrent assets acquired on or after April 1, 2012. This change has little impact on operating income and income before income taxes of the fiscal year. 6.

Financial Instruments (1) Overview (a) Policy for financial instruments The Companies raise funds by borrowing from banks and issuing commercial paper or corporate bonds. Also, the Companies restrict temporary excess fund management to highly secure assets, time deposits and other short-term investments. The Companies use derivatives in order to avoid the risks, fluctuations of particular assets and liabilities, and fluctuations of interest rates. The Companies do not use derivative transactions to gain short-term profits or for speculative purposes. (b) Types of financial instruments related risks and risk management “Notes receivable, accounts receivable from completed construction contracts and other” and “Accounts receivable-other,” which are operating receivables, are exposed to the credit risk of customers. In order to mitigate the risk when orders are received, the Companies conduct a strict screening and determine project plans so that potential risks are minimized. Short-term investment securities and investment securities mainly consist of stocks. While short-term investment securities and investment securities are exposed to market risk, the Companies monitor market prices of these securities. “Notes payable, accounts payable for construction contracts and other” and “Deposits received,” which are operating liabilities, are due within one year. “Short-term loans payable,” “Long-term loans payable,” “Commercial paper” and “Bonds payable” are used for operations or capital investment. “PFI and other project finance loans” are used for enterprise funds related to particular PFI projects and other. The floating rate loans are exposed to fluctuation in interest rates. In order to hedge against the interest rate risks and fix the payment of interest, the Companies utilize derivative transactions (interest rate swaps) for each contract of certain long-term loans payable. The evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted for interest rate swaps as they meet certain criteria under the short-cut method. The transactions of derivative financial instruments are carried out in accordance with the Companies’ internal rules, and the status of the transactions is reported regularly to the Board of Directors. The Companies trade derivative transactions with major financial institutions and therefore consider there is no credit risk underlying those transactions. While operating debt and borrowings are exposed to liquidity risk, the Companies manage the risk mainly by preparing quarterly and monthly cash management plans. (c) Supplementary explanation of fair values of financial instruments Notional amounts of derivative transactions, disclosed in “(2) Fair values of financial instruments,” do not indicate market risk in derivative transactions. 67 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2013 To Contents About Obayashi Corporation Business Overview Together with Stakeholders Corporate Data p03–p10 p11–p30 p31–p46 p47–p104 (2) Fair value of financial instruments The following table shows the carrying values and fair values of financial instruments as of March 31, and any differences.

To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2013 68 Note 1. Method to determine the fair values of financial instruments, and other information related to ­marketable securities and derivatives Assets Cash and deposits Since deposits are settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value. Notes and accounts receivable from completed construction contracts and other The fair value of these items is determined based on the present value of carrying value, grouped by term of settlement, discounted at an interest rate determined taking into account the remaining period of those and credit risk. Short-term investment securities and investment securities The fair value of stocks is determined based on quoted market price and the fair value of debt securities is determined based on either quoted market price or prices provided by financial institutions making markets in these securities. Information on securities classified by holding purpose is disclosed in Note 13 “Securities.” Accounts receivable—other Since “Accounts receivable—other” is settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value. Liabilities Notes and accounts payable for construction contracts and other, Short-term loans payable, Current portion of PFI and other project finance loans, Commercial papers, Current portion of bonds and ­Deposits received Since these accounts are settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value. Bonds payable The fair value of bonds issued by the Company is based on the present value of the total principal and interest discounted by an interest rate determined taking into account the remaining period of bond and current credit risk. Long-term loans payable and PFI and other project finance loans For fixed rate loans, the fair value is based on the present value of the total principal and interest discounted by an interest rate to be applied if similar new loans were entered into. For floating rate loans, since the market interest rate is reflected in the interest rate set within a short period of time, the carrying value is the same as the fair value. The fair value of loans qualifying for special hedge accounting treatment of interest rate swaps is based on the present value of the total principal and interest hedged by interest rate swaps, which is discounted by an interest rate to be applied if similar new loans were entered into.

Segment Information (1) Segment information (a) Overview of reportable segments The reportable segments of the Companies are components for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee to make decisions about resource allocation and to assess performance. The Building Construction, Civil Engineering and Real Estate Development divisions at the Company are responsible for strategic planning and business development of the building construction, civil engineering and real estate development businesses, respectively. Business operations of the building construction and civil engineering divisions are classified geographically with headquarters and each branch as separate operating units and evaluated individually. The Company’s subsidiaries are also evaluated on an individual basis. The building construction and civil engineering businesses are segmented based on domestic and overseas areas. The Companies therefore have five reportable segments: “domestic building construction,” “overseas building construction,” “domestic civil engineering,” “overseas civil engineering” and “real estate development.” The overview of each reportable segment is as follows: Domestic building construction: Execution of building construction contracts and related businesses within Japan Overseas building construction: Execution of building construction contracts and related businesses outside Japan Domestic civil engineering: Execution of civil engineering construction contracts and related businesses within Japan Overseas civil engineering: Execution of civil engineering construction contracts and related businesses outside Japan Real estate development: Purchase, sale and rent of real estate properties, development of land ­parcels and related businesses. (b) Accounting treatment for net sales, income (loss) , assets, liabilities and others by each segment The accounting methods of the segment are substantially the same as those described in “3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Segment performance is evaluated based on operating income or loss. Intersegment sales are recorded at the same prices used in transactions with third parties. 79 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2013 To Contents About Obayashi Corporation Business Overview Together with Stakeholders Corporate Data p03–p10 p11–p30 p31–p46 p47–p104 (c) Reportable segment information (net sales and income (loss)) Millions of yen Reporting segment Domestic Overseas For the year building building Domestic civil Overseas civil Real estate Others ended March 31, 2013 construction construction engineering engineering development Subtotal (Note 1) Total Net sales: Sales to third parties ������� ¥822,936 ¥196,110 ¥283,591 ¥40,544 ¥66,687 ¥1,409,870 ¥38,435 ¥1,448,305 Inter-segment sales and transfers����������������������� 44,967 21 14,815 – 1,926 61,731 7,470 69,202 Segment sales����������������� 867,904 196,131 298,406 40,544 68,613 1,471,601 45,905 1,517,507 Operating income (loss): Operating income (loss) from sales to third parties (Note 2)������������� 11,067 6,429 8,411 (1,742) 10,150 34,315 837 35,153 Inter-segment operating income and transfers����� 195 – (252) (1) (0) (59) (224) (284) Segment income (loss)����� ¥ 11,262 ¥ 6,429 ¥ 8,158 ¥ (1,743) ¥10,149 ¥ 34,255 ¥ 612 ¥ 34,868 Thousands of U.S. dollars Reporting segment Domestic Overseas For the year building building Domestic civil Overseas civil Real estate Others ended March 31, 2013 construction construction engineering engineering development Subtotal (Note 1) Total Net sales: Sales to third parties ������� $8,749,991 $2,085,170 $3,015,326 $431,096 $709,060 $14,990,645 $408,668 $15,399,314 Inter-segment sales and transfers����������������������� 478,127 230 157,527 – 20,486 656,372 79,431 735,803 Segment sales����������������� 9,228,119 2,085,400 3,172,854 431,096 729,546 15,647,017 488,100 16,135,118 Operating income (loss): Operating income (loss) from sales to third parties (Note 2)������������� 117,671 68,361 89,432 (18,523) 107,925 364,868 8,905 373,773 Inter-segment operating income and transfers����� 2,080 – (2,689) (19) (8) (637) (2,389) (3,027) Segment income (loss)����� $ 119,752 $ 68,361 $ 86,743 $ (18,542) $107,916 $ 364,230 $ 6,515 $ 370,746 Note 1. Businesses that cannot be classified into the reportable segments are shown as “Others.” This includes PFI (Private Finance Initiative), finance, operation of golf courses and other businesses. 2. “Operating income (loss) from sales to third parties” was computed by subtracting “Inter-segment operating income and transfers” from “Segment income.” The total “Operating income (loss) from sales to third parties” equals to “Operating income” as shown in the consolidated statements of income. 3.

The majority of energy is used to power construction machinery and vehicles, which emit carbon dioxide and other gases. Construction m ­ aterials become buildings and structures, while scrap materials, packaging and the like are discharged as waste. Waste is also produced when buildings are demolished, and soil is displaced in construction digging. Waste and displaced soil are recycled or effectively reused to the extent possible, and the remainder is buried at final disposal sites.

Protection for Wild Animals • In a worksite adjacent to tidal mudflats that were designated in the Ramsar Convention, we took measures to control noise and vibration for the sake of the wild birds that visit the mudflats. For example, we banned the use of large-size hydraulic breakers in crushing concrete and rocks. • When operating in a mountainous area, we made sure to use opaque light for night illumination and took other measures to avoid startling raptorial birds that nested in the area. • To protect fireflies inhabiting an urban riverbank construction site, we followed the survey and advice of an entomologist to avoid construction work during the breeding season, and took pains to reduce the negative impact of light during construction work. Preserve and Restore Natural Areas • To protect the natural secondary forest near a construction site, we set up elevated walkways for workers to prevent people involved in the project from trampling on grass, flowers and tree roots. • After using stone from a quarry for a large-scale dam project, we filled in the quarry with rocks and soil, covered it with topsoil, and planted trees of the surrounding varieties, as well as seeds, in order to restore greenery in line with the local natural habitat.
