Our company has thereby committed itself to aligning all operational and strategic processes with the Compact's Ten Principles. The UN Global Compact asks companies to embrace, support and enact, within their sphere of influence, a set of core values in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption. At Speexx, we strive to support and disseminate the UN Global Compact's principles in our daily company procedures and to encourage our partners and clients to do the same. Our initiatives, such as 'A Million Chances' projects, 'Green Learning' programmes and our ongoing financial support of 'LINGOS' (Learning in NGOs), reflect the Compact's values through and through. It is clear to us that the systematic incorporation of sustainability concepts in all operative areas of the company remains a continuous task. We are proud to continue our support for the United Nations Global Compact and to renew our ongoing commitment to the initiative and its principles.

Description of policies, public commitments and company goals on Human Rights. Speexx wholly supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We make every effort to ensure that internationally proclaimed human rights are upheld in every stage of business and that we are not complicit in human rights abuses. Of particular resonance to Speexx is Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states: (1) Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit. (2) Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. (3) Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children. Speexx supports various charity projects each year through its project “A Million Chances”. By supporting education, foreign language skills and sustainability in disadvantaged regions and communities around the world, Speexx hopes to support communities to support themselves in upholding internationally proclaimed human rights. Our goal in the next reporting period is to conduct a human rights risk-assessment for the company, its partners and suppliers. Implementation  Description of concrete actions to implement Human Rights policies, reduce Human Rights risks and respond to Human Rights violations. The majority of our products are produced in-house, where human rights protection is ensured. Our partners and suppliers are selected carefully and evaluated annually as part of our quality management system. Each year, we donate 1 million Euros' worth of educational products to a variety of projects around the world as part of our charity project “A Million Chances”. By doing what we do best – providing learning and continuing education opportunities – we are committed to being a reliable partner in the building of a better future in particularly disadvantaged regions of the world. A Million Chances does this by focusing on three main goals: 1) Education as a springboard for independence and autonomy – is not par for the course in all regions of the world. It needs to be facilitated and supported. 2) Foreign language skills as a means of breaking down global language barriers – are for us, a leading language specialist and provider of innovative language learning software, particularly dear to our heart. 3) Sustainability helping victims and children in need to help themselves. We are determined to continue our engagement in the future. Measurement of outcomes  Description of how the company monitors and evaluates performance.

Implementation  Description of concrete actions to implement environmental policies, reduce environmental risks and respond to environmental incidents As a language training platform that uses less energy, paper and ink and does not require learners or trainers to commute, Speexx is a truly green learning solution. When learning a language with Speexx, the classroom is the laptop: Learners work on their language improvement online and in a self-paced manner. They are supported and motivated by their personal online coach via email and the live training sessions take place via Virtual Classroom or via telephone. Traditional classrooms still rely heavily on paper. With the Speexx online platform, the entire communication is digital: assignments and feedback are sent to the learner and come with the solution as digital files. Speexx assignments can be completed entirely on the computer. Instead of printing out and handing in assignments on paper, learners simply e-mail them to their coach. Speexx students needn’t travel to go to class. They can study a language at their own pace at home, at work or at any other place in the world with the online solution. Learning a language with Speexx means entering the virtual classroom without causing CO2 emissions. The live sessions are broadcasted from the teacher’s home. The Speexx Virtual Classroom was developed to accommodate the specific needs of language learners; its excellent audio and clear video quality allows learners all over the world to easily communicate with their trainer. This makes Speexx a green language training solution compared to traditional classroom-based courses. Internally, we also embrace the environmental principles and prioritize environmentally friendly options wherever we can. Our Speexx offices around the world are powered by renewable energy – solar, wind and water. We switched from conventional power suppliers to environmentally friendly and sustainable ones, ensuring that the power we use is green. We enjoy frequent face-to-face meetings with our teams around the world – only, we do it virtually. With our corporate-wide virtual conferencing infrastructure, we meet, train and collaborate – and reduce our travel emissions to a minimum. We're green – down to our IT. Our IT Department prides itself on its green credentials, always choosing energy efficient computers and devices and ensuring that equipment across the board is consistently re-used, recycled or donated. Our staff adheres to the motto: being green means being mean – mean with fuel emissions, that is. The Speexx 'green travel policy' actively encourages the use of public transportation, bicycle power, video conferencing and telecommuting. Recycling and using recycled materials has been a standard practice at Speexx since the company's inception. All recyclables are recycled. And where paper is unavoidable, we make every sheet count – on both sides.
