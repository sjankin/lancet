Step by step, we are approaching our goal of becoming an efficient company that has attained public trust and is responsible for contributing to the formation of a business tradition based on sustainable development. I am glad to be able to tell you today that year 2012 saw improvement in LESTO's all key business indicators while our rating in terms of customer trust was 10 points ahead of the energy companies in Europe. In 2012, LESTO was recognized The Best Socially Oriented Company of the Year at the National Responsible Business Awards, took the fourth place in the Lithuanian independent survey on preferred employers, was identified one of the ten best companies representing Lithuania at the European Business Awards while its 2011 annual report was found third best among stock-listed companies across the Baltic’s. We accept with enormous appreciation the invitation of the United Nations Development Programme in Lithuania and of the National Network of Socially Responsible Business (NNSRB) to chair NNSRB in 2013. Alongside our goal to ensure efficient daily supply of electricity, we have been in constant search of more progressive ways to do business and to achieve more without increasing consumption. We want to share this message with our customers in educating them on how they can draw more benefits from each kilowatt-hour and save energy. We have always encouraged communities to watch and make a difference in the amount of energy they use and we have incentivized businesses to control their energy consumption and to improve and optimize their processes. The second conference on rational use of energy arranged in partnership with Verslo žinios daily received even greater attention and confirmed that improved energy efficiency creates a competitive advantage for business. As part of upgrading the electricity sector, in 2012 we built more than the usual number of power cable lines, which ensure not only safer transmission of electricity and prevention of the effects of natural disasters, but also preservation of untouched landscape. Reconstructed transformer substations, new power lines and modernised electricity networks bring good-quality electricity to thousands of people. With a view to sharing knowledge and competence, we have included long-term civic awareness initiatives in our responsible activity, are proactive in providing information on safe and rational use of electrical energy as well as offer advice and promote interest in promising technologies, for instance, electromobiles. To us, one of the crucial aspects of our social responsibility is volunteering of our staff and their personal contributions to the creation of a more sustainable society and environment as they join environmental projects and unite to help those in need, as we did in cooperation with the Caritas organisation. Our philosophy of socially responsible business is not only about reducing consumption of paper, water or other resources. What is important is the awareness that we must achieve our mission with minimum environmental impact, thus playing a due role in addressing the climate change problem. We view this as a challenge for business that brings new opportunities and creates real value for the society. For this reason we have included the principles of sustainable development into our strategic goals. Business, social and environmental interests, if combined responsibly, lead us directly towards the future based on the principles of sustainable development. The future where our grandchildren can enjoy the same opportunities as we used to have.

Environmentally-Friendly Technologies. Electric Cars In 2010, LESTO in the event Vilnius CO 2 Green Drive” has installed and switched on the first electric vehicle charging station and in 2011 it analyzed the models of electric vehicles on the market, the potential of charging decisions, and made forecasts of the development dynamics, energy consumption, income and infrastructure costs for Lithuania. In order to promote the use of environmentally friendly means of transport, AB LESTO invited a group of interested companies, public institutions and other organizations to develop the infrastructure for electric vehicles in Lithuania, to promote and support the development of environmentally friendly and energy-efficient technologies; there is no consensus on the subject in the country yet.

LESTO together with the Lithuanian Ornithological Society and the Institute of Ecology for the Nature Research Center and the partners implement the project of the European Union Financial Instrument for the Environment LIFE + “The White Stork Protection in Lithuania. The stork nests built on the electricity poles are not safe either to birds or to people. When the storks touch the electrical wires they often get fatally injured; and LESTO incur losses due to electrical leakage and breaks in wires. Therefore, the aim of the project is to ensure the protection of the white storks by installing special platforms on electric poles which were safe for birds and airlines. In 2012 LESTO installed 1,519 artificial stork nets on electricity poles, during the project LESTO installed a total of 3,260 artificial nets. MARKET and investors In the business environment, LESTO seeks to maintain transparent relationships with all market participants, i.e. customers, partners, contractors and investors. 10 Electrical network modernization Every year LESTO taking care of the security of energy supply and of economic and social benefits to the society, pays much attention to the development and modernization of the distribution network. An important aspect of the environmental protection is better conditions for energy conservation, more rational use of it. LESTO by modernizing and expanding the electricity sector, a large part of it being older than 30 years, invests in environmentally friendly modern technologies. During the reconstruction of old electrical substations there are installed wastewater and rainwater collection facilities which meet the highest quality standards that no pollutants enter to the environment. Outdated, worn out power transformers are replaced with quieter operating ones, and less overloaded transformers are replaced with lower power transformers, in order to use the existing assets more efficiently and reduce the power losses. LESTO pays much attention to electricity network development and updating. This helps to provide the society with economic and social benefits, to increase the reliability and quality of electricity supply, to facilitate more rational use of energy, all this contributes to the Company's environmental policy. In 2012, LESTO investments in electricity network expansion and modernization reached 322.8 million LTL. This was 9.3 per cent more compared to the investment in 2011. In 2012, the biggest increase (24.8 %) was in investment in the reconstruction and overhaul of 0.4 10 kV electricity network. Investment in the reconstruction of 110/35/10 kV transformer substations and 10 kV distribution subsections has increased by 2%. Electric meters LESTO replaces old induction electric meters with new electronic meters, which are twice as accurate. The installed electronic electric meters already make up 47 per cent of the total number of the meters installed. During 2012, further developing the electricity metering equipment automation, the Company has added 2,438 electrical metering devices of electricity consumption of the business customers to an automated reading system, and currently by means of remote data scanning it receives the information from 17,773 energy metering devices which record the electric energy consumption of the customers. Electricity metering equipment automation has enabled automatically submit bills for electricity consumption for the clients, eliminating a need for customers to declare electricity consumption. During 2012, LESTO in total installed 172 thousand of metering devices, of which 118 thousand units were for the replacement of outdated electricity meters. This is 4 per cent more in comparison with 2011. 95 per cent of the installed meters were electronic. In 2012, the company for the installation of one new metering device spent approximately 5 per cent less of the funding than in 2011. Cabling In order to avoid damage of power air lines and any detriment during natural disasters, LESTO purposefully changed the air lines to underground cable lines. During the reporting period 1,243 kilometers (2011. – 1012,9 km) of underground (cable) lines were laid. Cable lines significantly reduce the number of failures during the operation, their maintenance is less expensive. Moreover having changed the airlines to the cables the landscape becomes more attractive. Since 2003, overhead power lines are consistently replaced with cables. Currently, the underground cable lines make up already 24 per cent of the electricity distribution network. Connection of Gardeners’ Community Networks In 2012, LESTO continued the redemption of gardeners community networks in order to meet the rising demands of gardeners electricity consumption and infrastructure maintenance needs, and ensure reliable, secure electricity supply and network modernization which is especially true when people permanently settle in gardeners communities. Electricity metering, network maintenance and repair works, especially after the storms, were quite a burden for the gardeners communities. All networks have been redeemed in their current state and the customers got individual metering devices installed. During 2012, LESTO redeemed 33 electrical networks from the gardeners communities. Since the beginning of the redemption process in 2003, LESTO redeemed 915 (882 in 2011) or 94.8 per cent (91 per cent in 2011) of the power networks of the gardeners communities.
