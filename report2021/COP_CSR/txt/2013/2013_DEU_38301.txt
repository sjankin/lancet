GRI Report 2012 and UN Global Compact Communication on Progress GRI Report 2012 2 About This Report In this document, Continental AG presents its sustainability report for the year 2012. This report is aimed at investors, analysts, customers, employees, suppliers, politicians, and public authorities, as well as all other stakeholders that have relations with the company and want to know the values and principles that define our actions. The report aims to create transparency and therefore present – alongside our wide range of activities and achievements – all those areas in which there is a certain need for improvement, at least as regards verifiable proof. In evaluating the situation and compiling content for this report, we used the third-generation (G3) Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines as a framework. Founded in the 1990s, the aim of this initiative is to establish a framework accepted around the world as a means of facilitating comparison and enhancing the credibility of the achievements reported by the respective companies and organizations. These guidelines require information on our values, our organization, and our strategy, as well as information on our key performance indicators in the Economic, Environment, and Social categories. While we do not have the answer to every single question, we do believe that our reporting satisfies the requirements for the middle GRI Application Level B, even if we cannot fully report some of the required indicators. We are striving to reach GRI Level A in the medium term. We consider the associated systematic approach a useful guide to help us continuously improve ourselves in accordance with the growing requirements of our customers, employees, and society. 3 Continental Corporation: Key Performance Indicators in € miilions 2012 2011 ∆ in % Sales 32,736.2 30,504.9 7.9 EBITDA 4,854.6 4,228.0 14.8 in % of sales 14.8 13.9 EBIT 3,073.4 2,596.9 18.3 in % of sales 9.4 8.5 Net income attributable to the shareholders of the parent 1,883.5 1,242.2 51.6 Earnings per share in € 9.42 6.21 51.6 Adjusted sales1 32,551.7 30,504.9 6.7 Adjusted operating result (adjusted EBIT)2 3,522.4 3,040.9 15.8 in % of adjusted sales 10.8 10 Free cash flow 1,652.5 490.5 236.9 Ne indebtedness 5,319.9 6,772.1 -21.4 Gearing ratio in % 58.2 89.8 Total equity 9,144.8 7,543.3 21.2 Equity ratio in % 33.5 29.0 Number of employees as at December 313 169,639 163,788 3.6 Dividend per share in € 2.254 1.50 Share price at year-end 5 in € 87.59 48.10 Share price 5 (high) in € 87.95 76.28 Share price 5 (low) in € 48.10 39.44 1 Before changes in the scope of consolidation. 2 Before amortization of intangible assets from the purchase price allocation (PPA), changes in the scope of consolidation, and the special effects. 3 Excluding trainees.. 4 Subject to the approval of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 15, 2013. 5 Price quotations of the Continental share in the XETRA system of Deutsche Börse AG.

In the past few years, we have managed to reduce the weight of our brake components substantially while at the same time enhancing braking performance. We aim to continuously lower the average rolling resistance of our tires – without restricting any of the tires’ safety features. Our piezo injection valves for conventional gasoline and diesel engines reduce CO2 emissions by up to 20 percent. What is more, our telematics systems and optimized hose lines reduce climate-relevant emissions. Our products for the automotive industry shall continue to help reduce CO2 emissions from cars and trucks. Hybrid drives for cars can lower CO2 emissions by 10 to 25 percent, depending on the hybrid type and application conditions. Continental products also contribute to climate protection in non-automotive applications. For example, our conveyor belts with optimized rolling resistance (energy-optimized conveyor belts or EOBs) significantly reduce the energy required for open-cast coal mining.
