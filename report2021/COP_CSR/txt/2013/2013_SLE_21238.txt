THE UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2012 HUMAN RIGHTS LABOUR RIGHTS ENVIRONMENT ANTI-CORRUPTION UN GLOBAL COMPACT – COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2012 MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Kjaer Group A/S is committed to the principles articulated in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), which we joined November 2003. In 2007 Kjaer Group A/S further confirmed our support for a cleaner environment by joining UN’s environmental initiative, Caring for the Climate. The UN’s principles for sustainability (the UN Global Compact) are an important point of reference for all activities and are incorporated in the company’s governance framework: The Kjaer Group Way of Management (KWOM). The Kjaer Group Way of Management was introduced in 2008, and hereby also the principles of the “Triple Bottom Line” whereby social and environmental targets and results are pursued in the same way as financial targets. In 2012, the main focus was the implementation of international HSEQ standards and subsequent certification of business-critical areas. Further, a new external assessment was conducted: The HiPO (High Performance Organization) survey. The survey measures areas that are essential drivers for developing the organization and the people and it is therefore closely connected with the Group’s activities in the area of CSR and the UN Global Compact commitment. Thus, on behalf of Kjaer Group’s 300 employees, I reaffirm our commitment to compliance with the 10 Principles of the Global Compact. I hope you will find this Communication on Progress informative and I invite you to view the Kjaer Group website www.kjaergroup.com and our Annual Report 2012. Per S.
