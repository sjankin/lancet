Development of this process may be seen in the following projects: Year Projects 2010-2011 The Tamil Nadu Wind Power Project: This project involves the The Tieling Coal Mine Methane Capture Project The purpose construction of 27 new wind turbines in India. The total emissions of this project is to capture methane from coal mines and reductions are estimated to be 115 Ktons CO2 equivalent. use it as an energy source to supply gas to homes and local Located at a number of sites in the Erode district of Tamil Nadu, industries. Located across six coal mines in the Northwestern this project generates approximately 22MW of clean electricity Province of Lianing in China, this project prevents the which is delivered to the Southern Regional grid. This displaces potent greenhouse gas, methane, from being released into electricity that would otherwise have been derived from fossil fuel the atmosphere. Methane is a by-product of coal formation fired power stations, avoiding CO2 emissions, local air pollutants which is released during mining. On each of the sites involved and solid waste associated with the combustion of coal. in the project, specific equipment was installed to capture, then mix, the methane. Once the proper concentration is obtained, it can be used as fuel. This is a unique initiative as is it is currently the only project in China to use CMM as fuel for gas supply. 2011-2012 The Thar Desert Wind Project: located in the Jaisalmer district The Yugur Run-of-the-River Hydraulic Project: by using the of Rajasthan, India, this project consists of 75,800-kW wind natural properties of a portion of the 800-km Heihe River turbines, with a total capacity of 60MW, that are part of one in the Chinese province of Gansu, this run-of-the-river of the first wind farms to be commissioned in the Thar Desert project uses two 6.5MW turbines to provide zero-emissions of Rajasthan. The project provides renewable electricity to the electricity to the electricity grid of Northwest China. The Northern regional electricity grid, reducing CO2 emissions by project is validated to the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) replacing electricity generated from fossil-fuel based plants. and is now also registered with the Clean Development The project is verified to the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) Mechanism (CDM). and is now also registered with the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Management of the supply chain Waste Management In January 2012, Steria joined a group of more than 50 multinational Several subsidiaries around the world have already implemented a companies that have become members of the Carbon Disclosure Project process to monitor waste management (mainly for computers and servers to identify strategies and best environmental practices that could be for internal use). However, due to the absence of central reporting in this applied to the entire supply chain. Steria regularly participates in events to area, Steria is not, as of yet, able to provide reliable consolidated figures. exchange new ideas and agree on changes to supply chain management Nevertheless, several important steps have been taken by Group entities: in the light of climate change and sustainable development.

About two tons of electronic waste were destroyed in this way in 2012. (1) Carbon offsetting consists of credits bought for greenhouse gas reductions at another site (for example, India or China) by using eco-friendly technologies such as wind farms, which generate electricity from a renewable source, therefore reducing the need for energy from fossil fuels. Carbon offsets are quantified and sold in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2). The purchase of a credit of one tonne of carbon dioxide provides the necessary funds to reduce/avoid the emission of a tonne of carbon dioxide (or equivalent) into the atmosphere. 90 Steria Registration Document 2012 www.steria.com Corporate responsibility Environmental policy 3 Ordinary waste: For buildings and facilities that Steria controls, local solutions are complemented by our proven IT-enabled and consultancy policies aimed at reducing the amount of ordinary waste generated services and technology solutions that give you the agility you need to have been put in place.

The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account balances, transactions or disclosures. This report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the Group’s management report. This report should be read in conjunction with and construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Annual General Meetings, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2012, on: z the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Groupe Steria SCA; z the justification of our assessments; z the specific verification required by law. These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the General Manager. Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. I. Opinion on the consolidated financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2012 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. II. Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of Article L 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: z Note 1.14 to the consolidated financial statements describes the accounting method for revenue recognition and costs related to service contracts. As part of our assessment, we ensured that the abovementioned accounting principles adopted by your Group were properly applied by reviewing existing procedures within your Group and we also obtained assurance that the estimates used were reasonable. 5 z Your group performed at year-end an impairment test on goodwill and also assessed whether there was any indication of impairment of other intangible and tangible fixed assets, as describes in note 1.5 to the consolidated financial statements. As part of our assessment of the accounting principles and estimates used by your Group, we obtained assurance that the estimates used in future discounted cash-flows and forecasts and the resulting goodwill valuation were reasonable. We also verified that note 4.1 to the consolidated financial statements gives the appropriate information. z Note 1.10 to the consolidated financial statements describes the methods used to calculate the value of deferred tax assets. As part of our assessments, we verified the overall consistency of the information and assumptions used to perform these calculations. z Your Group recognizes a provision for post-employment benefits based on the projected credit unit method, as indicated in note 1.15 to the consolidated financial statements. As part of our assessments, we examined the data used, assessed the actuarial assumptions used, verified the overall consistency of these assumptions and the resulting measurements, as well as the appropriateness of the information provided in the note 4.12 to the consolidated financial statements. As stated in the note 1.2 to the consolidated financial statements, several matters mentioned in the paragraphs above are based on estimates and assumptions which are uncertain by nature, and for which the final outcome may significantly differ from the initial forward looking data used, in particular given the current economical and financial environment. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. III. Specific verification As required by law we have also verified, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the information presented in the Group’s management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

Opinion on the financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2012 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. 214 Steria Registration Document 2012 www.steria.com Review of financial position and results Statutory auditors’ report on the financial statements 5 II.

Valuation of its equity interests is performed using the consolidation accounting policies used to the consolidated financial statements of the Group. As part of our assessment of the accounting rules and methods used by your company, we verified the appropriateness of the accounting methods used and the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. We also verified the correct application of the methods describe. To appreciate the “equity method valuation”, we relied on results of our work performed in the context of the audit of the Group consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2012. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.

Prevention, reduction or correction of air, water and soil As a result, the air, water and soil emissions likely to harm the environment emissions that seriously harm the environment are considered minimum. Noise pollution taken into account and, where appropriate, any other form of pollution related to an activity Same reasons as above The business of the Company is focused on IT services and BPO (Business Process Outsourcing), these business activities do not require water consumption. This aspect is negligible. Nevertheless, in the context of our ISO 14001 EMS certification, measures are taken to conserve and reuse water to the extent Water consumption and sourcing subject to local constraints possible Consumption of raw materials and measures Not considered relevant for our business activity for more efficient use (our production cycle does not involve the consumption of raw materials) Not considered relevant for our business activity Land use (our production cycle does not change land use) Measures taken to protect biodiversity and mitigate attacks against biological balance, natural areas, protected animal Not considered relevant for our business activity and plant species, and, if applicable, their development (our production cycle has no effect on biodiversity) OTHER INFORMATION Measures taken to ensure consumer health and safety as part of its activities, the Company targets only businesses, not consumers Management reporting tools and processes For the increased long-term reliability of our CR reports, the following z Environmental information: this information is primarily contained elements are gradually being introduced: in Excel files (based on documents corresponding to the greenhouse z reports from systems; gas emissions protocol) and a specialized system (SystemLink Energy Manager), currently installed in the UK, India and Poland; z manual controls and applications; z Information on markets and local populations: most of the z archiving rules. information related to these CR components is collected through To date, most sources of CR data are the following: online questionnaires because of their qualitative nature. z Social information: for the reporting of quantitative information, A CR reporting protocol (that meets the requirements of the annual Steria primarily uses data from its HR mainframe (PeopleSoft), report and the Global reporting Initiative report) was also created.

Qualitative information is collected annually primarily through online questionnaires; 252 Steria Registration Document 2012 www.steria.com Cross-reference table Social, environmental and corporate social information 7 Indicator calculation methods The table below explains the calculation methods used for this report. Any subsequent changes will be explained in this section of the document. Quantitative indicator (French legislation) Calculation method SOCIAL INFORMATION Employees with permanent and fixed-term employment contracts as of December 31st, i.e., excluding trainees, subcontractors and temporary workers. This figure represents the number of individuals present to Total workforce and distribution by sex, date, not FTE. The average age is calculated based on the workforce number above. The gender distribution age and geographical area is based on the number above. The figure for each sex corresponds to the total figure above. Hires: Number of employees (workforce) hired with permanent and fixed-term employment contracts at Steria between January 1 and December 31, i.e., excluding trainees, subcontractors and temporary workers. Transfers of employees made in the UK under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations, or “TUPE”, are not considered new hires. Additional information is provided on the number of young hires, according to age. It is indicated whether they have obtained their university degree during the previous two years. The number of new hires is expressed as a percentage of new hires. Employees classified as “temporary” include persons employed under fixed-term employment contracts. Global rate of voluntary departure: This is the total number of voluntary departures during the year divided by the workforce as of December 31 of the previous year. These employees have permanent or fixed-term employment contracts, thus trainees, subcontractors and temporary workers are excluded. Departure for disciplineor performance-related reasons: This is the total number of employees dismissed during the year for disciplineor performance-related reasons divided by the workforce as of December 31 of the previous year. These employees have permanent or fixed-term employment contracts, thus trainees, Hiring and firing subcontractors and temporary workers are excluded. To calculate this figure, the total working days per employee reported as sick leave (special lines in our timesheets) is divided by the average workforce in the country in terms of working days. This gives the Sick leave average number of days off per employee. As of the publication date of the Registration Document, we cannot provide reliable figures relating to Frequency and severity of accidents at accidents/occupational diseases because relevant data have not been compiled into our systems (for work and occupational diseases example, work accidents/occupational diseases are included in the sick leave figures; see above). Time devoted to employee training is identified by a specific line in our timesheets. It is expressed in working days. This gives the total days of training per country, which is then divided by the average workforce (working days) of the country to get the average days of training per employee. For conversion into hours, Total hours/days of training the basis is the number of hours per day normative for each country. ENVIRONMENTAL DATA Energy consumption is calculated by reviewing invoices, counters and/or building owner estimates. Energy consumption Our measurement unit is kWh, except for diesel, which is measured in liters. The greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) protocol is applied to calculate emissions (see http://www.ghgprotocol.org/). The Group uses the protocol’s stationary combustion tool for calculating Scope 1 emissions. For Scope 2, emission factors are applied to estimate greenhouse gas emissions, by multiplying figures for the activity (e.g., kWh of electricity consumed by a site) by the emission factor (expressed as equivalent grams of CO2 per kWh consumed) depending on the area (usually a country) where the activity takes place. In the case of electricity consumption, emission factors for the greenhouse gas emissions protocol “greenhouse gas emissions associated with the purchase of electricity” tool are used; emissions factors come from the CEA database (India). For urban heating, the emissions factors corresponding to the site are used, if available; Greenhouse gas emissions otherwise the Group uses the country’s emissions factors. 7 Steria Registration Document 2012 253 8 “Articles of association of Groupe Steria SCA (Last updated on December 20, 2012) 254 Steria Registration Document 2012 www.steria.com Articles of association of Groupe Steria SCA (Last updated on December 20, 2012) 8 TITLE I THE COMPANY Article 1 Legal form z and, in general, all commercial, industrial, financial, securities or real estate transactions which are related, even indirectly, to the The public limited company (société anonyme) “Groupe Steria”, aforementioned objects, and which can contribute to its development. having its registered office at Vélizy-Villacoublay (78140) – 12, rue Paul-Dautier, incorporated by private deed on February 18, 1988, was transformed into a limited joint stock company (“SCA”), on the decision Article 3 Company name of the Extraordinary General Meeting of July 18, 1996.
