Launch of WWL’s proactive four stream approach for Committed to the U.N. Global Compact sulphur regulation compliance. We are committed to the notion that a sustainable supply chain means minimal environmental impacts and risks, and that progress and accountability require that we declare our objectives and measure our performance. This report details our results over the past year, and declares our commitment to the ten principles of the U.N. Global Compact. Stepping up to sustainability With the long foreseen stepping up of global ECA regulations limiting the sulphur emissions from commercial vessels, much of the 350 million tons of ordinary bunker consumed every year by the shipping industry will have to be either replaced with other fuels or used in conjunction with abatement systems. The potential solutions available are still evolving, which presents uncertainty and risk to the industry. We naturally seek to minimize these impacts. By exploring a number of solutions we make sure that in the future we have access to adequate amounts of fuel or other solutions to be compliant with the regulations. There will be no one solution for the future; technologies develop and mature in a fluid way, availability and prices of fuels will fluctuate, regulatory limits will differ around the world, and our fleet will always contain several generations of vessels. Therefore, to ensure that we can always find the most cost effective solution for our customers, WWL is working along four different streams and leveraging our 9-year experience using low-sulphur bunker across the globe to find the most sustainable compliance solution. While this work will help us identify the most cost effective route to compliance, it does not address the commercial risk that exists from today’s generally weak enforcement. Without a meaningful level of enforcement of regulations, including significant disincentives, the unscrupulous operator will get away with using cheaper, dirty fuel, and gain an advantage over more honourable competitors in the process. In this regard the authorities, as well as ship operators, have their work cut out for them. Arild B. Iversen, CEO Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics Delivering Results As an environmental frontrunner, we believe in setting goals, tracking performance and delivering results. Reducing emissions from our ocean fleet is the single greatest way to improve our environmental performance today. To achieve this we operate our vessels with low sulphur fuel at sea, and invest in advanced technology that improves the fuelefficiency and emissions performance of our fleet. We also believe in accountability. We use state of the art systems to measure the performance of our fleet, and publicly report the externally verified results. CO2 Emissions in grams/tonne km 45 WWL’s objective is to reduce our relative CO2 emissions 30% by 2015 compared to 2005. 40 In 2012, relative CO2 emissions were reduced 35 by 2% compared to 2011 as a result of improved utilization, energy efficiency and new buildings 30 entering the fleet. 25 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 CO2 Emissions in total tonne 3000 Total tonnes of CO2 emissions increased by CO2 emissions in thousands of tonnes 13% based on increased business volume in 2500 2012 versus 2011. 2000 1500 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Average Global Sulphur Content 3.0 % For the 9th year in a row, we have maintained our 1.5% global fleet average sulphur policy. 2.5 % WWL’s target of 1.5% 2.0 % 1.5 % 1.0 % 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 195000 Sulphur Emissions Savings 180000 Compared to industry average sulphur in fuel 165000 Sulphur Emissions Accumulated savings since 2001 150000 Our 1.5% global low sulphur fuel policy has saved 135000 186,500 tonnes of sulphur from being emitted over 120000 the last 12 years. 105000 90000 75000 60000 45000 30000 15000 0 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 NOX Emissions in grams/kilowatt 20 hour 19 Average NOx emissions in g/kWh were reduced 18 by 2% as a result of the rejuvenation of the fleet. 17 Newer vessels with more modern engines emit less NOx than older vessels. 16 15 14 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Delivering Working towards a sustainable solution Worldwide Sulphur Regulations A four-stream approach <0.5% Bunker Oil Determine if a viable supply of <0.5% bunker oil can become available WWL believes that <0.5% low sulphur bunker oil could become a viable long-term compliance solution. As an upstream solution, the sulphur is taken care of at source, where it is more easily managed. Upstream solutions also virtually guarantee compliance. Distillates Examine medium to long-term pricing and availability Another route to compliance would be to switch to a distillate fuel, such as Marine Gas Oil (MGO). Using distillate requires some onboard adjustments but these are relatively minor. The bigger issue concerns the medium to long term pricing and availability of this type of fuel. • Global sulphur regulations pose a risks arising from volatile costs as well as solutions from the four different streams. significant cost and compliance challenge supply uncertainty. We need to look at what the right “mix” of to the industry. WWL is exploring • Technology in these areas is evolving at solutions should be. several avenues in order to find the most various paces, and working on several • There are several other environmental sustainable solutions for our customers. fronts in parallel will enable us to deploy risks and regulations that need to be • Pricing and availability of low sulphur fuels solutions as they mature. managed in coordination with the sulphur or alternative energy sources is difficult • The WWL fleet will always contain issue. We need to ensure we are not to predict. A broad approach, evaluating different generations of vessels, with creating a new problem through our several options, will help us to mitigate the varying capabilities for implementing solution. Other Energy Sources Decouple from bunker fuels Alternative energy sources will be explored through research and development projects. WWL is working together with our owners to explore the possibilities presented by alternatives such as LNG, biodiesel, solar power and others. The objective is to develop a potential competitive advantage for WWL in terms of price stability, availability and the possibility of decoupling from fossil fuels in the future. Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems Install and run pilot project to gain early experience Work with stakeholders in global operating environment to evaluate risks and costs Scrubbers (abatement systems) are a technical approach to compliance. They work by removing sulphur from the vessel’s exhaust gasses. There is no operational experience with the size and type of installation required for our type of vessels. So in line with our continuous effort to explore new technology, we are conducting a pilot project over 2012-2014 to evaluate the design, technical, operational, safety, environmental and regulatory matters related to scrubber installations.
