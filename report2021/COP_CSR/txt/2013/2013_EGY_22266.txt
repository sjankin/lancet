Page 9 9. BAG AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS Sustainable development of business is possible only in socially favourable environment. From its part, the society quite understandably demands from business to adhere to human values (environmental protection, legitimate forms of ownership, positive economic and social impact of enterprises, etc.), and not to sidetrack difficult issues. The stakeholders the society groups, with which a business organization interacts either directly or indirectly form those demands and demonstrate increasing activity in setting up channels of communicating and cooperating with business. In order to conduct successful and efficient CSR policy, it is fundamentally essential for us to determine the stakeholders and influence groups of priority importance for BAG, clarify their expectations and suggest efficient forms of interaction within the range from dialogue to possible joint actions and programmes. In particular, the key stakeholders are the following target groups, which share common interests with us: Shareholders and investors are directly interested in long-term and sustainable growth of BAG’s value, in its proven ability to manage and mitigate risks, as well as in openness and ethic principles and practice of corporate governance. Customers are interested in the quality of products, improvement of legal mechanisms for protection of their own rights, growth of investment and better customer management before and after sales. Employees expect full compliance with legislative regulations in respect to labour relations, and provisions of individual and collective labour agreements; management’s respect for individual rights and human dignity; daily concern of BAG for minimizing health and environmental harmful impacts of operations; dedicated assistance to the development of their qualification and direct influence of the business success upon labour remuneration and amount/nature of social package. Business partners are interested in the widest possible application of the principles of transparency, impartiality and fairness, adherence to moral standards supported by legal acts and corporate ethics codes. \ Page 10 10.AREAS AND DIRECTION OF BAG CSR POLICY When setting up the framework and lines of its social responsibility, BAG is guided by global compact principles which are implemented in BAG’s activities in such areas as corporate governance, business ethics, health and safety, labour relations, charity, etc. 10.1 Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights.
