Scenario analysis on potential impact Achieved Roll-out 5-Year Energy Master Plan from carbon taxation Development of greenhouse gas accounting in line with international Feasibility study in carbon reduction Achieved Develop green house gas emission standards opportunities reduction plan by aligning with energy efficiency target and plan of the Thaioil has monitored greenhouse gas emission continuously since 2004 by using Shell Group HSE Company. Performance Monitoring and External Reporting Guide. Currently, we are working on improving our greenhouse gas accounting system to be in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Energy reduction target setting Achieved Conduct feasibility study on improving water efficiency in the refinery Energy efficiency management Thaioil manages energy efficiency through Energy and Loss Committee which consists of representatives 4.1 Energy Efficiency and from all relevant departments including operation and supporting functions. The committee is responsible for development of Energy Master Plan, identifying energy conservation measures and prevention of Climate Change Mitigation hydrocarbon loss and monitor energy consumption and hydrocarbon loss against identified target. In 2012, Thaioil implemented numbers of energy conservation projects and activities namely Thaioil commits to refine energy for society while minimizes potential impact on climate change from Improving heat transfer efficiency of Convection Bank in furnace HDT-1 and CDU-1 units; our operation through efficient processes. Thaioil has developed a plan to reduce direct and indirect Cleaning up operating furnace in refining unit 2 to reduce fuel consumption; greenhouse gas emission generated by electricity and steam purchased from other entities. This will Steam Air Decoking at furnace of HVU-1 to reduce temperature of furnace shell resulting in allow Thaioil to be 100 years organization and leading companies in the region in sustainable manner. heat loss reduction and fuel saving; Replacing insulation in furnace CDU-2 unit with the result from in-house innovation of double Climate change or global warming is a result of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. There insulation; and are several type of greenhouse gases; the most well-known is carbon dioxide, typically generated Optimizing Furnace Cross-over Steam at furnace in refining unit 3 to maximize from combustion activities. It is also believed that higher sea level from ice melting at the Antarctica the usage of steam. and more frequent natural disasters are the results of climate change. Therefore, climate change awareness has become a global agenda as demonstrated by the 2012 United Nations Climate Results from energy conservation and hydrocarbon loss prevention projects account for 315,000 GJ Change Conference (COP 18), an international collaboration to control the global temperature increase. energy savings, or equivalent to 200 million Baht of saving. Such projects reduce greenhouse gas Recently, there are many nations applying economic measures to control or manage greenhouse gas emission by 24,400 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent. emission into the atmosphere, for example carbon taxation in Australia, initiative on carbon crediting in China and several states in the United States of America and the European Union. Therefore, it Climate change risk assessment can be expected that economic or legal measures will be applied to control greenhouse gas emission in the industrial sector in the near future. In addition to risk management in terms of climate change risks, energy price fluctuation and physical risks associated with natural disasters, Thaioil has also analyzed various scenarios assuming different pricing levels of carbon taxation are to be implemented by Thai government. Our Commitment To optimize natural resource usage and to minimize greenhouse gas emission from our combustion, Thaioil has set Energy Intensity Index (EII) target to reduce EII for 1 – 1.5 per year in order Thaioil to achieve top quartile in energy efficiency in 2018. page 30 page 31 Absolute volume of greenhouse gas emission and greenhouse gas index per ton production in 2012 Performance Highlight increased slightly from 2011 due to several core production units entering steady state after major turnaround. However, Thaioil is in the process to study and set a long term greenhouse gas target. Overall performance regarding climate change can be monitored through many indicators, for example Energy Intensity Index as methodology of Solomon Associates to reflect actual energy CO2 Emission efficiency on a refinery, and Corrected Energy and Loss Index. 4.90 4.73 In 2012, Energy Intensity Index (EII) of Thaioil was 81.6 which is 3.3 points higher than the EII 4.54 in 2011. This is a result from major turnarounds in many core units including the Crude Distillation Unit (CDU), High Vacuum Unit (HVU) and Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU). 3.31 0.36 0.35 0.28 0.33 Therefore, refinery intake volume was reduced which resulted in running the process at a lower efficiency. In addition, Thaioil shutdown the main power generator for maintenance whereby smaller power generators were used to supply electricity and steam 2009 2010 2011 2012 over the shutdown period. This also resulted in higher energy consumption. Absolute volume of CO2 equivalent (million tons) Considering Corrected Energy and Loss Index (CEL Index) which is another Greenhouse gas intensity index (tons per ton of crude oil) key performance indicator. CEL Index in 2012 was slightly higher than 2011 but was still within the defined target range. The reason was Thaioil could control hydrocarbon loss at very low levels. Ethanol Business of Thaioil The use of biofuel from renewable raw materials contributes to a reduction in non-renewable high carbon Energy Intensity Index (EII) footprint fossil fuel extraction. Thaioil has monitored the world energy situation and considers that crude oil prices to be fluctuated and continuously increasing. This opens opportunites for renewable energy especially biofuel in which ethanol is a biofuel that Thailand has good potential from the abundance of 84.7 raw materials. Therefore, Thaioil has established Thaioil Ethanol Ltd to capture opportunities from such 84.7 factors that contribute to national energy security and respond to government policy promoting the use 82.1 of alternative fuels. The Ethanol business of Thaioil is pure ethanol production to blend with base gasoline 82.1 for the production of gasohol. Thaioil engages in ethanol business by joint venturing with business partners 81.6 in three ethanol production plants with the combined production capacity from sugarcane and cassava 78.3 of 800,000 liters per day. Demand in alternative energy of Thailand nowadays depends on government 78.3 policy. However, the trend in alternative energy use has been rapidly growing in the past couple of years 2009 2010 2011 2012 and this trend is expected to continue into the future. Energy Intensity Index : EII Target The Sustainability factor of ethanol business mainly rely on raw material procurement which Thaioil has procurement criteria that requires raw materials to be harvested from agriculture land areas as opposed to Corrected Energy and Loss Index (CEL Index) bio-diversified areas. In addition, Thaioil has been working with farmers on knowledge sharing for energy 99.5 crop growing technique and harvesting plan to ensure the quality of raw materials feeding into our facilities. 96 Blending of ethanol in base gasoline is roughly estimated to reduce gasoline consumption in Thailand 97.3 94.7 95.7 by about 10 percent or 25 million liters per month. This saving is equivalent to reducing the volume of imported fossil fuel by approximately 4,000 million Baht. Furthermore both direct and indirect economic distribution in agriculture communities is also another direct result of transfering knowledge and experience in producing and the commercialization of ethanol. The knowledge and experience is 2009 2010 2011 2012 expected to play a significant role when the proportion of alternative energy use is larger in the world Corrected Energy and Loss Index energy mix. Target page 32 page 33 4.2 Climate Change g Adaptation p case, Thaioil is still able to use emergency waste supply from our internal holding basin, rain water holding pond and treated wastewater from Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). This amount of water including contribution from all desalination units could sustain production processes for Thaioil’s climate change adaptation is focusing on water resource management in normal condition and drought approximately 3 months. to ensure continuity of our business. Performance Highlight Our Commitment 3R Strategy was initially projectied as being successful in reducing absolute water consumption and Thaioil focuses on mitigating risk and reducing potential impact from water supply to our operation. water intensity index. In 2012, Thaioil Group consumed 13.91 million cubic meters. 58 percent of water comes from surface water whilst the remainder comes from seawater. Water consumption in 2012 was 300,000 cubic meters less than the consumption in 2011, while water intensity per Management Approach production unit improves from 0.67 in 2011 to 0.66 in 2012. Currently, Thaioil receives raw water from 2 sources located in Chonburi including 1) Bang-pra Reservoir under the management of the Royal Irrigation Department and 2) Nong-kor Reservoir under the management of East Water Plc. Water sourced from the two reservoirs accounts for about 50 percent of overall water consumption, which is then utilized as Boiler Feed Water for producing steam and use in utility systems. Another portion of water consumption comes from 6 desalination units, which also supply water to the boilers. Thaioil runs 4 desalination units under normal circumstances. Water Consumption In order to prevent and minimize the impacts of insufficient water for production process, Thaioil has 14.10 14.22 implemented water management strategy by involving with PTT Plc, government agencies such as 13.91 Royal Irrigation Department Area 9, and water supplier (East Water) to: 11.26 Coordinate in water supply planning and monitoring of water availability to ensure sufficiency of water supply; 0.80 Implement a 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle ) strategy to reduce water usage and wastewater discharge; 0.67 Conduct feasibility study on improving water efficiency and other activities for 0.63 0.66 the benefits of company and local communities such as watering green areas with treated wastewater. To ensure Thaioil has sufficient water supply for production processes, Thaioil has engaged the working 2009 2010 2011 2012 committee of PTT Group water management since 2005 with representatives from companies in PTT Water Consumption (million m ) 3 Group and a representative from PTT as acting chairman. Water Consumption Intensity (m3 per ton of crude oil) Thaioil is also involved with Provincial Waterworks Authority, Royal Irrigation Department Area 9 and East Water Plc to set up a quarterly war-room to monitor and estimate water availability in reservoirs and develop a water management plan as Bang-pra reservoir is an important source of water supply in Chonburi Province. Apart from coordinating efforts with government agencies, communities and companies in water management outside of our operation, Thaioil also has an emergency response plan in case of a drought affecting the volume of water in the reservoirs. Thaioil conducted multiple scenario analysis in case of insufficient water supply which generated the result that Thaioil could continue normal operation even at 30 percent of industrial water supply due to our 6 desalination units that can supplement the lost volume. The desalination units alone could not sufficiently supply water for the production process if 50 percent of industrial water supply is unavailable.

Apart from the issue of volume, management of water resources also includes the cost community and environment. Currently, Thaioil has applied the environmental management standard management in order to reduce the impact on operating costs due to the high cost of supplying water. ISO 14001, for managing the environment in the area of operations. We also developed the Environmental Master Plan for the year 2012-2016 as an operational guidance tool to strengthen Effectiveness of the Environmental Performance the operational efficiency. In recent years, Thaioil achieved a decrease in the overall emissions rate. In addition to complete compliance with the mitigation and monitoring measures as defined in the EIA report and environmental laws, Thaioil also takes into account the enhancement of various Thaioil’s oil refinery and its affiliates are located in an area surrounded by natural resources and production processes that improve environment quality. In 2012, Thaioil has undertaken actions to communities including Khao Phu Bai, coastal zones and seven communities in close proximity. Hence, reduce the air pollution by implementing major projects designed to control sulfur content in the fuel Thaioil has committed to preserve natural resource and environment in these areas in order to minimize from the original source and the improvement of benzene tanks to reduce emissions of volatile organic the impacts on natural resources, environment and communities. compounds. For the improvements to reduce water pollution in this year, Thaioil has explored the reuse of water from the wastewater treatment process using Reverse Osmosis (RO). In terms of reduction of the industrial waste, Thaioil has implemented the reuse project by setting a target for Our Commitment the year 2012 related to the proportion of waste to landfill that must not exceed 5% of the total industrial waste of the company. This will lead to Zero Waste to Landfill, which is our long-term goal Thaioil Group is committed to manage impacts in order to protect the environment and communities in the next 5 years. by monitoring the operations to comply with the law and improving our environmental operations continuously. Biodiversity Thaioil recognizes the impact of wildlife habitats and natural resources around the refinery. Therefore, Management Approach the company has implemented a few projects and use study results to develop an ecosystem management plan such as a study project on macaque monkey behavior, the exploration of the ecology of Khao Phu The preparation of the environment master plan from 2012-2016 is obtained from a study on the Bai, the improvement of the landscape and building the atmosphere around the office to be in harmony trends of the industry, law, discussions with stakeholders and the consideration of universal best practices. with nature and motivate the consciousness of the nature among employees. Moreover, Thaioil has also applied these key issues in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and the environmental indicators from Global Report Initiative (GRI) to be used to determine the direction of Plan for managing partners and contractors the environmental management of Thaioil Group. Thaioil Group’s environmental management consists of; is the operation expressing social responsibility in managing social and environmental impacts from the operations of partners and contractors by promoting and encouraging partners and contractors to participate in the CSR-DIW continuously in order to express a clear intention towards social responsibility. page 40 page 41 Environmental audit SO2 Emission is the assessment under the environmental management framework (ISO 14001) that Thaioil has implemented with high priority. As a result, it found no major non-compliance in the most recent 8.76 8.35 assessment in 2012. 6.27 Driving the environmental plans through information systems is the operation to place environmental information to continue to support environmental management 0.53 4.74 standards, which is currently under development including a preparation of Greenhouse Gas Inventory 0.51 and Environmental Dashboard. 0.42 0.35 2009 2010 2011 2012 SO2 Emission (thousand tons) Performance Highlight SO2 Emission Intensity (ton per thousand tons crude) In 2012, no non-compliance against environmental legislations and monitoring measures from Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report was identified during the compliance audit conducted Sulfur dioxide from the flue gases emitted in 2012 were significantly lower than 2011 both in the by the licensed consultant. The results also showed that all pollution emissions and discharges were terms of net quantity and quantity per unit of production, due to in 2012, Thaioil increased the in compliance with environmental standards of Thailand, which can be summarized as follows. proportion of natural gas usage as a fuel. In 2012, Thaioil changed measurement methods for VOCs (Volatile Organic Compound) from the calculation of Emission Factor to the actual measurements. Therefore, it has not been presented a comparison with the past results, but will continue to present the amount of volatile organic compounds NO x Emission by the actual measurement method. For the amount of volatile organic compounds that are detected, the company will request for certification by an outside agency in the future in order to ensure that 3.48 3.02 the information is accurate and reliable. 2.87 2.66 Effluent Volume 4.26 0.12 0.11 4.20 0.10 0.09 4.09 4.04 0.20 2009 2010 2011 2012 0.17 0.16 0.17 NO x Emission (thousand tons) NO x Emission Intensity (ton per thousand tons crude) 2009 2010 2011 2012 Volume of Effluent (milion m3) Effluent Intensity (m3 per ton crude) The amount of nitrogen oxide was continuously reduce both in the terms of absolute volume and The wastewater volume through the treatment system of Thaioil in 2012 was about 4.04 million intensity per unit of production. In 2012, nitrogen dioxide emission was 2.66 thousand tons and the cubic meters, a decrease from the previous year (4.09 million cubic meters). This was consistent intensity was 0.09 tons per thousand tons of crude oil, due to the investment in the modification of with a decrease in amount of water use as well. (Details on water risk management are shown in Heat Exchangers and Burners to Ultra Low NOx Burners. chapter 4.) However, the amount of wastewater treated per unit of production increased due to the major turnaround in 2012, resulting in a decrease in the intake availability. page 42 page 43 Hazardous Waste to Landfill Our Commitment 300 The most important thing for the Thaioil business is to be free from injury or death caused by operational procedures. Therefore, the company has committed to take a step forward to be the organization where no one is injured or killed from their work and to be a petroleum and petrochemical 256 industry leader in safety and occupational health operational effectiveness. 246 Management Approach 149 149 Thaioil Group has a special unit to control and drive the implementation of occupational health and safety programs as well as designate a committee for occupational health, safety and environment in the workplace.

to solve the problem of wasted water from rubber sheet production process, thus, we went on a field trip in Nakhon Sri Thammarat. We found that the waste water, when treated in the process, then become clean, no smell, and can produce gas. We saw the biogas production from household wastes, so we would like to follow. At first, we began by building a biogas system from kitchen waste using the budget of the local residents. We saw the dedication of the villagers, thus we seek for funding from other organization/foundation. Many families would like to do, but don’t have sufficient saving. This coincides with Thaioil’s policy to develop alternative energy for communities. We found that Koh Mak Noi is appropriate project site because of the power shortage in the area, the enthusiasm of local residents and the previous attempt of similar projects.” Assistant Professor Dr. Usa Onthong, Faculty of Science, Lecturer Wikanda Thongnueykang, Thanksin University Faculty of Science, Thaksin University (Patthalung Campus) (Patthalung Campus) “Thaksin University and Thaioil expect that we will bring energy security to Mak Noi Island as well as food security from toxic-free farming. We do not provide 100% of materials, we instead transfer the best knowledge that we can, and request local residents to corporate in every step of the project. Villagers have to understand the system development in order to build, to extend, to maintain and to have the sense of ownership.” Mak Noi Island is regarded as a strong community that well collaborate and is capable of improving the system. At first, when I had seen the project, I thought it “I am so proud to be part of this project. We can never works. But when we came back and save energy, save money, and do not need to developed, it turned out a success. I still use the dispose waste somewhere else. It is one of the system, and will continue to use in the future. waste disposal methods. Our family has 3 My house is the first one that succeed the members, we cook every day.

I cannot wait to join the next event.” suggesting, transferring, and fixing. When I knew that Thaioil would come support our village, I invited the villagers to learn about the system at my house. They gained more understanding when seeing what I did. It is quite easy. I am very happy that Thaioil supports this project and thank Thaioil on behalf of all villagers.

Thaioil’s strategy is to utilize our energy knowledge gained throughout 50 years of operation to optimize the resource management. We transferred knowledge in engineering, technology of the survey equipment to measure the canal depth, we deployed GPS technology to identify the canal location to the community. It is the first Thaioil CSR project in the “northeastern” region with the concept “key focus of the development is to build capacity of local residents, especially community leaders.” In the project, we transfer knowledge of management which leads to the irrigation system for community. This year, we built a 2.2-km-long canal (3-m width x 3.5-m depth) and build 9 ponds, which bring benefits to more than 395 villagers of 102 households. This has been completed with the collaboration from Nong Takien villagers, Thaioil engineers, the Foundation staff, and local government agencies. The project supervisor, the community leader and villager share their view as followed: “Farmers face difficult living conditions. They “I am very happy that Thaioil and the alliances have endurance and capability, but with limited bring the project to Nong Takien Village. It brings opportunities. Our foundation tries to bring good success to us, especially all farmers in the opportunities, and we found that people in these north side of the village that own arid lands. They communities are great human. They all contribute did not have sufficient access to water. This to develop their own village and other nearby project builds small pond to contain water for villages. We are thankful for Thaioil to come and summer usage. I am thankful for all parties that help community to be self-dependent and helpful collaborate and support budget for the project. to other communities.” Local farmers can cultivate better now.” Bangkok Chow-kwanyun, Manager of Education and Mr.Seksan Sirimongkhon, Public Welfare Foundation Leader of Nong Takien Viallage “In the past, before the canal was built, we could cultivate only once a year. Once the canal was built, we can cultivate up to 2 times a year. We can grow vegetable and others. Thank you very much for bringing good economic prosperity to Non Takien Village. We are very happy. I am willing to dedicate my own land to develop the canal, and never regret for this. They asked for my land, to build pathway for local residents. For the benefits of the public, I donated the land. Now when canal was built, irrigation in the area has improved, we can grow just about anything including vegetable, rice, tomatoes, etc.” Mrs. Ord Nedmanee, Farmer from Nong Takien Village Thaioil and our alliances continue to develop alternative energy prototype projects that provide economic benefits to remote areas.
