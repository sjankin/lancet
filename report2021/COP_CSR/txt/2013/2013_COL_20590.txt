2012 SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT Welcome The Global Collaboratory to ™ Leading with Innovation. As a world leader in science and innovation, DuPont is creating solutions to address global challenges of the future DuPont has reported our sustainability progress for the last twenty years. During this time our sustainability focus has grown from managing our operational footprint to helping our customers lighten their environmental footprint across the value chain. Our long-standing commitment is to sustainable growth — creating shareholder and societal value while reducing the environmental footprint in the value chains in which we operate. Today, we are looking toward the future and asking ourselves the question: How can we meet the challenges that accompany a growing population? We are working together with customers, partners, academics, governments, NGOs and other organizations to find new and better ways to provide for the world’s food, energy and protection needs. DuPont brings science and the collective ingenuity of collaboration to the table to create scalable solutions for complex global challenges. FOOD ENERGY PROTECTION Together, we can Together, we can Together, we can feed the world. build a secure energy future. protect what matters most. DuPont is pioneering innovation in DuPont is aggressively working DuPont is committed to protecting food science, devoting 62 percent to find ways of helping the world people and the environment. of our research and development consume energy more efficiently. We work with customers, local budget to unlocking solutions to This will mean steadily reducing government and industry to help end hunger. We are invested our use of fossil fuels and using develop materials and services in getting more food to more them more cleanly, while producing that conserve the environment and people, and providing healthier energy from alternative sources. keep people safe at home, at work, food options, to more people, for and while traveling. a better tomorrow. 2 This has been an exciting year for DuPont, with dynamic progress made in our commitment to create sustainable solutions the world needs through science and innovation. Our strategy is driven by the DuPont mission of sustainable growth, creating shareholder and societal value while reducing our environmental footprint along the value chains in which we operate. In this way we are embedding sustainability into the way we do business and considering the long term livelihood of people and the environment as we make business decisions today. This approach is working. Setting ambitious sustainability goals helps us advance our performance both financially and environmentally, and results in positive impacts up and down our value chains. Today we are proud to see excellent performance on many of our corporate sustainability goals. We are exceeding targets ahead of schedule in three of the four market-driven commitments including our investment in sustainability-focused R&D, the number of products that help make people safer, and revenue from non-depletable resources. This is our first year reporting against our new 2020 energy goal and we are already seeing strong progress. The momentum of this progress against our sustainability goals is strong and will continue, but there is more to be done. We are focused on addressing the “Setting ambitious key challenges of the future related to global population growth and looking sustainability goals for opportunities to innovate sustainable solutions. We have identified three specific global areas that come with a growing population: feeding the world, helps us advance reducing dependence on fossil fuels and protecting people and the environment. our performance Recognizing the unique expertise we bring to the challenges of feeding the both financially and growing global population, we announced in February 2012 a new set of goals environmentally, and specifically targeting needs in the areas of food and agriculture. We made commitments to produce more food, enhance nutrition and improve farming results in positive sustainability worldwide with a $10 billion investment in R&D and 4,000 new impacts up and down products planned for launch by the end of 2020. Because sustainable solutions our value chains.” to agricultural challenges rely on engagement, we also announced goals around youth and rural development. At DuPont, in all our very diverse businesses, sustainability is a powerful engine of growth. We recognize that we cannot do this alone. In 2011 we acquired Danisco, a sustainability leader, which strengthens our presence in nutrition and biosciences and brings exciting new bio-based products to market to help increase access to food. We also believe that strategic inclusive innovation with customers, governments, NGOs, and key thought leaders will be necessary to provide enough healthy food for people everywhere, decrease dependence on fossil fuels, and protect people and the environment for generations to come. Our work remains grounded in the core values of safety and health, environmental stewardship, highest ethical behavior and respect for people. Consistent with these core values, DuPont is proud to have been one of the first U.S.-based signatories to the United Nations Global Compact in 2001, and we continue to recognize the importance of the 10 Principles of the Global Compact today. While we have made progress, we recognize that there is more to do. Science and innovation are about designing a better future, and we are determined to continue on this journey through sustainable growth. Ellen Kullman Chair of the Board & Chief Executive Officer 3 Each year, societal expectations for corporations like DuPont continue to evolve. The conversation that began largely between the NGO community and companies has taken on a new dynamic as more and more companies engage their supply chain partners around issues of sustainability. Here at DuPont we continue to evolve our own thinking on sustainability and have been actively engaged in shaping the broader discussion, rather than just reacting to it. Our first sustainability progress report was written in 1992, at a time when society was asking questions about pollution and environmental responsibility. There was no precedent for corporate responsibility, no best practices to follow. We learned by listening to our stakeholders and the issues that mattered most to them, and responded proactively by publicly establishing some of the first corporate environmental goals. In 2006, we broadened our vision of sustainability to include bringing products to market that help our customers be more sustainable. At that time we announced our 2015 market-facing goals, while building on our footprint reduction targets. “The issue of providing This year we are reporting very strong progress in the market-facing goals, as food that is healthy, well as improvements against many, though not all, of our footprint goals. We accessible and loware currently ahead of our commitments to hold water use flat and reduce air impact demonstrates carcinogens, and we are tracking well for our 2015 goals regarding an energy the interconnectedness efficient, off-site automotive fleet and ISO 14001 certifications for our global plant sites. Our greenhouse gas emissions increased from 2010 to 2011, and we will of these challenges be examining opportunities to manage and reduce our emissions. Because we with sustainability. ” see water as a looming societal issue, we are also looking for creative solutions to reduce water consumption to help mitigate water shortages in scarce or stressed areas. The next step in our sustainability journey is to prepare for tomorrow’s global population growth, focusing our efforts on solving major societal and environmental challenges in food, energy and protection. In this way, we are committed to helping future generations meet their needs in the areas where science can play a role. The issue of providing food that has a low impact on the environment and is both healthy and accessible demonstrates the interconnectedness of these challenges with sustainability. Food is connected to the planet that bears it, the water that nurtures it, the ecosystems that coexist with it, and the people who need access to it. We have taken very specific steps in responding to the challenge of global food security and are already seeing the impact of this progress. We continue to collaborate with value chain partners and other stakeholders to determine specific commitments that DuPont can make to drive progress in the areas of energy security and protecting people and the environment. We see all three of the challenges representing opportunities for long-term thinking and for sustainable solutions to be implemented on a global scale. Our journey has given us a breadth of experience. We look forward to continuing on this path using the power of science and innovation to develop solutions for tomorrow’s challenges. Linda J.
