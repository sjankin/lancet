MOL Group’s traditional core area is the CEE region with 75 years’ continuous oil and gas industry presence and accumulated experience. At the same time, increasing focus is now being given to our international assets where we have over 2 decades European Solar Prize 2012 “The Largest Social Impact” of presence. In the past few years, MOL Group has devoted significant efforts to expanding this asset base to deliver growth. In 2012, in the category of Transportation Price was given to MOL Talent we acquired new blocks in Russia, Kazakhstan, Oman and Egypt as well as entering Romanian blocks next to the border with Hungary thereby exploiting our considerable Pannonian Basin experience.

As a result of intensive exploration activities, MOL, once again, achieved an outstanding for Renewable Energy Hungarian Donors Forum drilling success ratio of 64%, thus delivering success in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Kazakhstan, Pakistan and in the CEE region. These successes will certainly help us to achieve our ambitious production target of 170-180 mboepd in 5 years’ time. The Downstream segment operates 5 refineries, 2 petrochemicals units and a very up-to-date retail filling station network supplied by The Best Employer a region-wide logistics system, all optimised by very effective supply chain management.

MOL Group is firmly committed to maintaining its strong financial position, hence any capital expenditures should be financed from operating cash-flow as a general rule, as in previous years. MOL continuously monitors both growth opportunities and the external environment so as to be able to react in a flexible way in CAPEX spending. 2013 could be just as challenging as 2012, taking into account slow economic growth in Europe or the tightening regulatory environment in many countries. However, we strive to overcome these challenges and capitalise on the strong foundations of MOL Group that we have built up over the years. One of our main goals is to unlock the value of our exploration portfolio so as to increase our reserve base which would then serve as the solid basis of our mid-term production growth targets. The main focus will be on the Kurdistan Region of Iraq where we have already made three discoveries. We shall continue our appraisal program in the Bijeel field while the Shaikan field could already deliver the first visible barrels from the region in 2013. In addition, we aim to continue active portfolio management so as to renew our asset mix. In Another successful year for MOL Group, which was even able to counterbalance the lack of Syrian Downstream, the main goal of 2013 is to achieve a further USD 250mn in improvements as part of revenues in its P&L statement in a noteworthy extent, clearly demonstrating the Group’s strength our New Downstream Program. Further more, we intend to strengthen our captive markets through and diversified portfolio. further extension and rationalisation of our Retail portfolio. Finally, we will have to finetune our biggest ever organizational transformation process, carried out in 2012, which aimed to answer Upstream was able to operate in a still favourable price environment whilst one could see some internal challanges after the Group had changed so significantly, over the last few years, through improvement in the external conditions of Downstream operations.

Our In 2012, MOL Group continued to achieve its long-term sustainability goal i.e. to be one of the strong operating results are mainly attributable to our diversified, international-focused Upstream top 20% best-performing companies according to global and local SD/CSR rankings. Based on the Division which delivered roughly 2/3 of Group EBITDA. None the less, we are very proud of our assessment by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, our sustainability performance slightly improved achievements in efficiency improvements in the Downstream Division. In line with previous years’ compared to 2011, allowing us to stay in the top quintile of industry performers. This achievement trends, around half of Group earnings came from outside Hungary. indicates that we are on the right path to cementing our place among the top-performing companies in sustainability and to implementing the principles of the UN Global Compact, which we continue The Upstream Division remained MOL Group’s main profit contributor and we laid even more to support. emphasis on exploration operations and on active portfolio management. On behalf of MOL Group Management, we would like to thank all our employees for their dedication, hard work and commitment and our shareholders for their solid support. We are certain that all our 2012 was another year of intensive exploration activity with yet again a really outstanding drilling efforts in 2012, undertaken in a mixed and challenging environment, have further strengthened the success ratio of above 60%. Beyond that, we acquired new licences in Russia, Kazakhstan, Oman basis for MOL Group’s organic development over the coming years. and Egypt which together significantly increased our recoverable resource potential to 1.6 Bboe. In our home base, the CEE region, the focus remained on early cash generation development projects, maximisation of recovery rates as well as continuing exploration of remaining CEE upside. In Downstream, MOL lauched its New Downstream Program which aims to deliver USD 500-550mn in cost savings and revenue increases by 2014, versus the 2011 base figures. The first USD 150mn was already achieved in 2012. Though our smaller, subscale assets place a drag on results, MOL Group was able to deliver better figures than most of our peers in terms of unit EBITDA generation which clearly demonstrates the Zsolt Hernádi József Molnár strength of our complex assets and the early success of our efficiency improvement measures.

Moreover, it will more effectively meet the Bratislava refinery’s full electricity and heat demands. MOL intends to investigate the energy utilisation potential of gas reserves with high inert content in a pilot project. The experience gained from operating a small scale pilot power plant, with a capacity of 0.6 MW, which started operations in April 2012, has met expectations to the fullest degree. A number of similar investments aimed at utilising low calorific value gases are now under preparation on a much larger scale than the pilot project. Design works of a small scale power plant with capacity of cc. 5 MW is now in progress. In 2012, MOL’s geothermal project development proceeded according to preliminary business plans and focused on geological surveys and thermo-hydraulic modeling. Relevant legislation changed in a positive way and the complex environmental impact and sensitivity analyses of geothermal energy utilization territories were finalized and published. However the announcement of geothermal concession tenders required to start project implementation has delayed the process. 38 mol gRoup annual RepoRt 2012 39 Financial and Operating Performance 40 MOL Group Annual Report 2012 41 manaGEmEnt diScuSSion and analYSiS summaRY of 2012 Results In 2012, MOL Group generated a clean CCS-based EBITDA of HUF • Gas Midstream: EBITDA, excluding special items, decreased iture in Downstream.

Benefits from a 4% YoY increase in the average realised price and a stronger USD (by 12% and 9% against the HUF and HRK, respectively) were more than offset by the following negative factors. Firstly, the Group has not received any revenues from Syria since October 2011; excluding the Syrian contribution of HUF 75 bn in 2011, EBITDA before special items slightly increased in 2012. Secondly, production excluding the Syrian contribution fell 9% YoY to 115 mboepd, driven by the natural depletion of mature CEE and Russian fields as well as the encroachment of water in Croatian offshore fields. Thirdly, EBITDA was adversely affected by the new residential gas price regulation in Hungary. • Downstream: The clean CCS-based EBITDA of Refining & Marketing amounted to HUF 168bn, the highest since 2008 and more than twice that of 2011. Our performance benefited from a favourable crack spread environment, especially for gasoline, a stronger US dollar, the Group’s improving product slate moving towards white products and the Group’s efficiency improvement efforts in the New Downstream ProgramProgram which delivered USD 150mn in savings compared with the prior period.

The main reason behind driver of EBITDA in 2012 the drop was the lack of Syrian revenues since October 2011. INA ceased operations, declaring ‘force majeure’ on February 26th, 2012. Beyond that, Group performance was negatively affected by lower production, mainly in the CEE region, which was partially offset by the positive effects of: main Reasons behind pRoduction changes: • higher crude oil sales to the Sisak refinery in current period since: o there were no sales during Q3 2011 due to a fire at the refinery • Hungarian hydrocarbon production decreased as a consequence of natural depletion. In 2012, o at the beginning of 2012, stocks accumulated during the previous year’s refinery shutdown the company fully completed an oil production optimisation project in Algyő to further increase were sold oil recovery. Intensive field development was carried out in the southern part of Békés county, • increased average realized hydrocarbon price putting new gas wells into production which partly compensated for decreasing production. • favourable changes in FX rates • In 2012, total Croatian production decreased by 8.8 mboepd or 17% versus prior year. The Excluding the Syrian contribution (HUF 75bn) in 2011, EBITDA, excluding special items, slightly inmajor part came from offshore gas (-6.0 mboepd or 28 %) as a result of natural decline, water cut creased in 2012. and decreased INA share due to the start of recording decommissioning costs, maintenance work on the Aiza Laura Contract Area (INAgip) and the postponed start-up of the Izabela field (EdINA) EBITDA deteriorated by HUF 15bn in special items, the majority of which related to an additional which therefore could not compensate for the natural decline.

However, at some locations there were significant drops in customer satisfaction. 82% satisfaction was recorded at Slovnaft (-8% since 2011) and an 80% satisfaction level at IES (-4% since 2011). However, the customer loyalty level at Petrochemicals increased from SuStainabilitY Duna Refinery, 16.6% to 19.3% (the scale is different from Wholesale so the results are not comparable). Hungary At Retail the main communication channel is the network of filling stations itself while customer loyalty is encouraged in the form of two loyalty card systems as well. Besides maintaining personal contact with customers, it is essential that we also operate a centralised customer service which is responsible for handling all of the claims and complaints related to or generated at our filling stations. The customer service centre provides information to clients and customers about products, services and activities through personal contact or via phone. In 2012 we had 1764 legitimate complaints from a total of 63.4 million transactions (this means that for every 35941 sales one legitimate complaint was made). MOL Group naturally finds it important to pay attention to the slight increase in the number of legitimate complaints as we see these customer reactions as being useful feedback for improving our processes and practices. Click here to read more information about this topic. To maintain and increase our customer satisfaction we have several activities at Group level. One of the most important of these is our plan to use internal trainers at INA to improve the customer management skills of externally-operated retail station managers. In Hungary we successfully launched an e-invoicing system for MOL fleet card customers which not only makes communication simpler but is also more resource efficient. Fuel Pricing Besides their satisfaction with our services, we have to keep in mind that our most direct impact on our customers (and the most interesting and sensitive topic for them) is the price of fuel and how it is calculated. The main factors which influence the domestic wholesale price of the fuel are the following: the acquisition price of crude oil and refined products, the exchange rate between the currencies of trading countries and the host currency on the acquisition market, local excise duties and other taxes, logistics costs, the supply and demand balance and the quality of each grade of fuel. 206 mol gRoup annual RepoRt 2012 207 At retail level, an international micro-pricing approach is used in accordance with international practice.
