Tax increases, beyond the price index, only boost inflation further. Infrastructure The company must note that despite intense dialogue with Naalakkersuisut, various committees from Inatsisartut, the Ministry of Housing, Infrastructure and Transport, and municipalities, it has failed to get clarification of the future transport infrastructure. The recommendations of the Transport Commission has not resulted in clear priorities that Air Greenland can use as a basis for the coming years investments in the aircraft and helicopter fleet. Especially when it comes to helicopters for operating the service contract areas and this vacuum is a challenge, because it is difficult to invest without having clear plans to work with. Therefore, Air Greenland would like to see infrastructure planning clarified with a minimum time horizon of 10 years, so that the necessary investments can be made in time. 9 Name Depart Date Date Arrive Flight Flight Gate Gate Seat Seat PNR Baggage tags PNR Seq Seq Figure 2 Air Greenland is dedicated to continuing to tions can cause disruption to normal flights. clarify the quality and value creation by having This B212 helicopter will be based in Qaqortoq. the company as a supplier.

Domestic traffic From 2012, the DHC-8 has been the primary aircraft on domestic routes, and the aircraft has proved to be a worthy successor to the DHC-7.

Air Greenland has an annual cost in the region of DKK 15-20 million for passenger irregularities, where costs are incurred for meals, ground transportation and accommodation, and in some cases compensation under EU rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) 261/04. The Regulation only applies to travel from Denmark/Iceland to Greenland, but not return or internally in Greenland. Air Greenland will also have costs for meals, accommodation and land transportation on the other routes, even though the company is not legally obliged to do so. 32 The Regulation gives passengers a number of rights, but also often makes an expectation of the payment of compensation. This has led to aviation authorities in general experiencing an increasing number of complaints related to the Regulation and the airlines’ interpretation. Air Greenland is also experiencing an increasing number of complaints, because in many respects the Regulation is very unclear and rather than building on the written word, it is based more on changes through case law (verdicts/ decisions). Regulation interpretation becomes increasingly more stringent and detrimental to the airlines. With the current knowledge of the legal situation it is not expected to incur more costs in 2013, but in line with the Regulation getting more and more publicity, we can expect a continued increase in the number of complaints. The Regulation is expected to be updated in 2014-15. Fuel/Dollar Aviation fuel is a very weighty cost, so an increase in world prices of aviation fuel in dollars is the single biggest factor affecting Air Greenland’s costs. Air Greenland tries to counter this with a conservative hedging policy, which guarantees against cost and price increases of at least 50% of fuel consumption for the transatlantic aircraft over the year, while aviation fuel for the domestic and charter fleet is dependent on the price policy from the exclusive distributor of fuel, KNI Polaroil that is obviously also influenced by world prices. Insurance In 2012, the company’s fixed wing fleet was insured collectively in a pooling cooperation with SAS and TAP, mediated through SAS’ coownership of Air Greenland. Since 1 December 2011, the helicopter fleet has been insured separately. This construction has increased costs compared to the years before 2011, when the entire fleet was part of a pool, which has not been possible to continue. 33 Report on Corporate Social Responsibility Air Greenland supports the UN Global ComStakeholder dialogue pact’s ten principles for responsible running of a Air Greenland’s image in Greenland has previcompany.

There is a particular focus on the classes where there are also students from settlements. Air Greenland has chosen to engage specifically in this project, as it harmonises perfectly with the CSR’s prioritising of education and development. In addition, the project is suitable for the involvement of employees who feel that their efforts are making a difference to young people. Specifically, both in Nuuk and Qaqortoq open house events have been held for the Sapiik project’s youngsters, who on a guided tour of the hangar, were told about training opportunities and presented with different types of work tasks. There are plans for follow-up in 2013 of those students who wanted to gain more insight into the company through a work experience day. In Ilulissat, it is Hotel Arctic’s young chefs who have been instrumental in the Group’s commitment, by arranging, in cooperation with the project staff from the Association of Greenlandic Children, more baking and cooking evenings at one of the town’s schools. Air Greenland continues its commitment to the Sapiik project in 2013 and wants to expand cooperation with the Association of Greenlandic Children to include students from the east coast. Figure 15 35 a higher priority is given to use resources to In 2012, Air Greenland initiated a close coopmotivate employees to get engaged.

Figure 15. It has been a natural extension of the company’s desire for increased focus on education in its community involvement. Both sides are ready to strengthen and develop this partnership in the future, and it is our ambition for 2013 to also involve students from the east coast of Greenland, where Air Greenland would like to engage further in connection with our service contract in the area that the company has for the next two years.

Renovation of the ing policy and purchasing rules. The purpose administration building is estimated to result in of the purchasing policy is to ensure that Air an increase in the year to come. Greenland can implement the best and cheapest purchasing for the benefit of the purchasing unit and the Group as a whole. When asking for quotes and inviting tenders or supply of goods and services, Air Greenland’s requirement for CSR must be evident. It can either be made as minimum requirements in that part of the tender process, which deals with the selection of suitable bidders that must commit suppliers to respect fundamental social, environmental and ethical guidelines, or they can be included as a sub-criterion in relation to the final choice of supplier. The decision on where in the process requirements are enforced is taken in each case on the basis of a discussion between the purchasing department and the relevant business area. 40 Purchasing has to take into account reducing the company’s environmental impact and to promote the development and use of cleaner products for the benefit of the surrounding environment and the working environment. Appropriate and recognised recommendations are used for environmental and energy efficient purchases by the preparation of requirement specifications to establish minimum requirements, and choose products that as far as possible have an eco-label and/or are energyfriendly, as well as products which are intended to reduce waste, and where the products are packed appropriately for transport. In addition, the focus is on changing purchasing habits that are suitable for supply by ship rather than plane. So far the focus has been on local businesses and competitiveness, which has led to several purchasing areas being relocated from abroad to Greenland, both large and small. Production of business cards and purchase of consumables for domestic flights will be purchased in Greenland, even with remarkable cash savings as a result, in addition to a significant service improvement. The key element is supply chain management and the purchasing department has therefore prepared a supplier evaluation procedure used to compare suppliers, as well as develop supplier relationships on several parameters, where CSR in total counts for 25%. 41 The Fleet Airbus 330-200 Number: 1 DHC-8 (DASH 8) Number: 5 DHC-7 (DASH 7) Number: 3 Beech Super King Air B200 Number: 1 Sikorsky S-61N Number: 2 Bell 212 Number: 8 AS 350 B2/B3 Ecureuil Number: 12 42 43 Accounting Policies This annual report has been prepared in acConsolidated financial statements cordance with the provisions of the Greenlandic The consolidated financial statements comprise Financial Statements Act governing reporting Air Greenland A/S (Parent) and the group enterclass C enterprises (large). prises (subsidiaries) that are controlled by the Parent, in accordance with the group overview The accounting policies applied for these fion page 12.
