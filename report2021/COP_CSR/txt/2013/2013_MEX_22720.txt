General Shareholders’ Meeting Dear Shareholders: Since the IPO, Alsea, like other companies in the national business community, has considered the implementation of best practices in matters of corporate governance as one of its most important goals. Is not just talking about its obligation to comply with applicable laws on the matter, but rather of building greater safety and trust among its shareholders, which in turn generates greater efficiency in its operations and decision making, and that makes it more competitive. Public companies directed by someone other than the person presiding over the Board of Administration are becoming more and more frequent. This shows great progress in institutionalization, as well as a commitment to form and adopt better practices for the benefit of all shareholders. At Alsea, our Board of Members has the invaluable support of various Committees, which are solely made up of independent advisors. This ensures that its composition is optimally balanced, and this has been reflected in its high level of professionalism, efficiency, and neutrality, which each day brings greater benefits to society and consequently to its shareholders. Alsea has a methodology for selecting and evaluating independent Members, with orientation procedures and formulas for renewing positions that are in accordance with the highest international standards of corporate governance. Through this, we seek at all times to comply with the company’s own goals, and carry them out with great efficiency, and achieve the highest professionalism and institutionalization in making the decisions that the greatest administration board of the Company is in charge of making, meaning the Board of Directors. Current markets and shareholders, meaning all of you, seek greater efficiency in asset management, but you also want to contribute to a healthy market development and its long-term sustainability. Therefore, you seek public companies to invest in that not only fulfill your economic expectations, but above all, that contribute to the elevation of social, community, and cultural values, with a genuine concern for protecting the environment. This can only be achieved through a clear strategy like the one Alsea has, which includes developing and maintaining high levels of responsibility and good practices of corporate governance. Sincerely, Alberto Torrado Martínez Chairman of the Board 35 For us, Social Responsibility is an attitude Additionally, the actions generated in these that is incorporated in all aspects of our commissions are supervised and approved business planning and operation.

Inventories Inventory increased from 403.1 million pesos at December 31, 2011, to 550.4 million pesos at December 31, 2012.

Inventory also increased because of the increase of units in operation. Other Current Assets The decrease in the Other Current Assets account of 2,184.2 million pesos at December 31, 2012, is mainly due to the fact that at the end of 2011 there was a deposit made to an escrow as part of the process for the acquisition of Italianni’s, completed in February 2012. Taxes Payable – Net The increase in the account Taxes Payable– Net of Taxes Recoverable, of 89.5 million pesos at December 31, 2012, can be attributed mainly to the increase in income tax payable, partially offset by a higher VAT recoverable. Deferred Income Tax Deferred income tax increased from 692.4 million pesos at December 31, 2011, to 778.8 million pesos at December 31, 2012. This increase of 86.4 million pesos occurred mainly as a consequence of the effect of the differences in financial depreciation rates and tax rates, and to recognition of tax losses. Suppliers Suppliers increased from 1,021.4 million pesos at December 31, 2011, to 1,129.6 million pesos at December 31, 2012. This variation of 108.2 million pesos was 2 days created principally as a consequence of better negotiating conditions, which of suppliers translates into an increase of 2 payable days, which rose from 43 to 45 days over the last twelve months and to a lesser extent, by a larger number of units in operation. 62 MD&A Bank Debt and Local Bonds Debt structure At December 31, 2012, Alsea’s total debt had decreased by 1,582.0 million pesos, closing at 2,474.5 million pesos, in comparison with 4,056.5 million pesos on the same date of the previous year.

It was recommended to take it to the Board of Directors for approval; Lastly, I would like to mention as part of our activities, including the preparation of this report, the fact that at all times we have listened and taken into account the viewpoint of the relevant executives, without any notable difference of opinion. Sincerely , Chairman of the Corporate Governance Committee Julio Gutierrez Mercadillo 65 Audit Committee´s Annual Report To the Board of Directors of Alsea, S.A.B. de C.V: February 18, 2013 In fulfillment of the provisions of Articles 42 and 43 of the Stock Market Law and the Rules of the Audit Committee, I hereby inform you of our activities during the year ending December 31, 2012. During the performance of our work, we kept in mind the recommendations set out in the Code of Best Corporate Practices and, in accordance with a work program developed from the Committee Rules, we met at least once every quarter to perform the following activities: I. RISK ASSESSMENT We reviewed, with the Administration and the External and Internal Auditors, the critical risk factors that could affect Company operations, and determined that they had been appropriately identified and managed. II. INTERNAL CONTROL We ensured that the Administration, in fulfillment of its responsibilities regarding internal control, had established the appropriate policies and procedures. In addition, we followed up on the comments and observations in this respect developed by the External and Internal Auditors in the performance of their work. III. EXTERNAL AUDIT We recommended that the Board of Directors hire some external auditors for the Group and subsidiaries for fiscal year 2012. To this end, we made sure of their independence and compliance with the requirements of the law. Together with them we analyzed their approach and work program. We maintained constant and direct communication with them to stay informed on the progress of their work, their observations, and to take note of their comments on the review of the annual financial statement. We were promptly informed of their conclusions and reports on the annual financial statement and followed up on the implementation of the observations and recommendations that arose from their work. We authorized the fees paid to the external auditors for auditing services and other permitted services, ensuring that this would not interfere with their independence from the company. Taking account of the Administration’s point of view, we performed the evaluation of its services for the previous year, and began the process of evaluation for the year 2012. IV. INTERNAL AUDIT To maintain its independence and objectivity, the Internal Audit area reports functionally to the Audit Committee. In due course, we revised and approved its annual program of activities. To produce this, Internal Auditing participated in the risk identification process, the establishment of controls, and their verification. We received periodic reports regarding the progress of the approved work program, changes that might have occurred, and the reasons for the same. We followed up on the observations and suggestions that arose and their appropriate implementation. V. FINANCIAL INFORMATION, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND THIRD PARTY REPORTS We reviewed, together with the persons responsible, the process of preparation of the quarterly and annual financial statements for the Company, and recommended to the Board of Directors that it approve and authorize them for publication. As part of this process, we took into consideration the opinion and observations of the external auditors and ensured that the criteria, accounting policies, and information used by the Administration to prepare the financial information were adequate and sufficient and had been applied consistently with those for the previous year. As a consequence, the information presented by the Administration reasonably reflects the Company’s financial situation, operational results, and changes in financial situation for the year ending December 31, 2012. We also revised the quarterly reports prepared by the Administration to be presented to the shareholders and the general public, verifying that they were prepared using the same accounting criteria used to prepare the annual information. We verified that there was a comprehensive process that provides reasonable security for its contents. In conclusion, we recommend that the Board authorize its publication. 66 Our review also includes the reports and any other financial information required by the Mexican Regulatory Bodies. We reviewed and confirmed that the Company, starting from 2012, adopted and implemented for the preparation of its Financial Statements the accounting framework set out in the International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS and IASB, respectively), considering as part of this process the opinion and observations of the external auditors. Therefore we conclude from the foregoing that the Company has fulfilled the requirements set out by the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission. VI. COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS, LEGAL ASPECTS, AND CONTINGENCIES We confirmed the existence and reliability of the controls established by the company to ensure compliance with the various legal requirements to which it is subject, ensuring that they were properly disclosed in the financial information. We periodically reviewed the various legal, fiscal, and labor contingencies existent within the company, monitoring the efficacy of the procedure established for their identification and tracking, as well as their proper disclosure and recording. VII. ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS We held regular meetings with the Administration to keep ourselves informed on the functioning of the Company and relevant or unusual activities or events. We also met with the external and internal auditors to discuss the progress of their work and any constraints they might have encountered, and to facilitate any private communication they wished to have with the Committee. In cases where we deemed it appropriate, we sought the support and opinion of independent experts. Similarly, we had no knowledge of any significant non-compliances in operational policies, internal control systems, or accounting records policies. We held executive meetings with the exclusive participation of Committee members, during which we established agreements and recommendations for the Administration. The President of the Audit Committee reported our activities to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Our work was duly documented in records prepared for each meeting, which were appropriately reviewed and approved by the members of the Committee. Sincerely, Chairman of the Audit Committee Ivan Moguel Kuri 67 68 Letter to shareholders Financial statements ALSEA, S.A.B. DE C.V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, and Independent Auditors’ Report Dated March 29, 2013 Independent auditor´s report 70 Consolidated financial statements of financial position 72 Consolidated Statements of Income 74 Consolidated statements of comprehensive income 75 Consolidated statements of changes in stockholders´equity 76 Consolidated statements of cash flows 78 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 80 69 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Alsea, S. A. B. de C. V. (Thousands of Mexican pesos) We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Alsea, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as at December, 2011, the consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Management’s Responsibility for the consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Alsea, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries as at December 31, 2011, and the consolidated results of their operations and the consolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Emphasis of Matter Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to the following: As described in note 1(e) and as a result of court rulings issued in December 2009; November 2010, and at December 31, 2011, Alsea has established the necessary arrangements to finalize the acquisition of Italcafé, S. A. C. V., thus ending the legal disputes faced in previous years with no detriment to the parties involved. On the other hand, in February 2012, the acquisition was finalized amounting $1,765,000 plus other additional costs, which means that as of that date control over the assets and liabilities acquired was duly transferred to the Group. As mentioned in note 1(b), in May 2011, Alsea finalized the placement of debt stock in the amount of $1,000,000 on the Mexican market. In December, 2012, Alsea amortized in advance the total amount of said debt instrument through the resources obtained from the issued stock by Alsea in December, 2012, amounting $1,150,000. KPMG CARDENAS DOSAL, S. C. Jaime Sánchez Mejorada March 29, 2013 70 Independent auditors’ report to the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Alsea, S.A.B. de C.V.

Management responsibility for the consolidated financial statements The Entity’s Management is responsible for preparing and providing a fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards, and the internal control considered necessary by the Entity to prepare consolidated financial statements that are free of material misstatement due to fraud or error. Responsibility of the Independent auditors Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with International Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessment, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates prepared by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alsea, S. A.B. de C. V. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards. Other matters The financial statements of Alsea, S.A.B. de C.V. and Subsidiaries for the year ended on December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2011 were audited by other auditors that expressed an unqualified opinion on said consolidated financial statements on March 29, 2013.

The Entity’s domicile is Paseo de la Reforma No. 222, tercer piso, Col. Juárez, Delegación Cuauhtémoc C.P. 06600, México, D.F. For disclosure purposes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, reference made to pesos, “$” or MXP is for thousands of Mexican pesos and reference made to dollars is for US dollars. Operations Alsea is mainly engaged in operating fast food restaurants “QSR”, cafeteria and casual dining units “Casual Dining”. In Mexico, the Entity operates the brands Domino’s Pizza, Starbucks, Burger King, Chili’s Grill & Bar, California Pizza Kitchen, P.F Chang’s China Bistro and Pei Wei Asian Diner, and began operating the Italianni’s brand in March 2012. In order to operate its multi-units, the Entity has the support of its shared service center, which includes the supply chain through Distribuidora e Importadora Alsea, S.A. de C.V. (DIA), real property and development services, as well as administrative services (financial, human resources and technology). In Chile and Argentina, it operates the Burger King brand and beginning in 2007 it began operating Starbucks in association with Starbucks International. In Colombia, it has operated the Domino’s Pizza and Burger King brands since 2008. In May 2011, Alsea signed an agreement with PFCCB International, Inc. for the exclusive development and operation of P.F. Chang’s China bistro in Argentina, Colombia and Chile, the latter country in which it opened its first P.F. Chang’s unit in 2012. Main operations a. Agreement to purchase the Burger King master franchise in Mexico.In December 2012, Alsea signed a Strategic Association Agreement with Burger King Worldwide, Inc. (“BKW”) to acquire the master franchise of the BURGER KING® brand in Mexico for a 20-year exclusivity. Under the Strategic Association Agreement signed by Alsea and BKW, the BKW subsidiary will merge with Operadora de Franquicias Alsea S.A. de C.V. (“OFA”), a subsidiary of Alsea, with the latter as the surviving company and operator of 203 BURGER KING® restaurants in Mexico. Once the merger goes into effect, BKW will sell the OFA shares to Alsea, which means that after the transactions in question are finalized, Alsea will retain 80% of OFA and BKW will retain the remaining 20%. This merger is subject to the approval of the Federal Competition Commission (CFC). The most important rights and responsibilities acquired by Alsea through OFA are: i.Operating control over the BURGER KING® brand throughout Mexico, ii.The acquisition of 97 BURGER KING® restaurants for operation of a total of 203 units, iii.Exclusivity in Mexico for a 20-year period, iv.Collection of royalties from its sub-franchisees; and v.A development plan that contemplates new BURGER KING® corporate stores and sub-franchisees for the following 20 years. b. Early amortization of the total “ALSEA 11” debt instrument.In May 2011, Alsea finished placing debt instruments for a total of $1,000 million pesos in the Mexican market. The resources obtained from that issuance were used mainly to prepay the debt instruments issued in December 2009 and March 2010 for $300 and $400 million pesos, respectively. In December 2012, Alsea amortized in advance the total amount of said debt instrument “ALSEA11”. The payment was for approximately $1,004.7 million pesos, which included interest accrued. Said issue was settled with part of the resources obtained from the capital issue performed by the Entity, which helped to improve the cost of the debt and the maturity profile. (Note 16) 80 c. Capital issue.In December 2012, Alsea issued stock worth 1,150 million pesos, which included the over-allotment option. The issue was carried out in the Mexican market through the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV for its initials in Spanish) and the foreign market through a private offer in accordance with Regulation “S” of the US Securities Act of 1933. The final placement price according to the books was 21.50 pesos per share, which resulted in the placement of approximately 53.49 million shares. As a result of the issue and the exercise of the over-allotment option, Alsea’s subscribed and paid in capital will be comprised of 687’759,054 (six hundred and eighty seven million , seven hundred and fifty nine thousand, fifty four) Class I, sole series, common shares, with no par value. The Entity used the resources derived from this issue to prepay the debt instrument with ticker code ALSEA’11, which matures in 2014, as a result of which the leverage level for this transaction decreases (Net Debt to EBITDA) from 1.9x to 1.2x with figures at September 2012. (Note 24) d. Acquisition of 35% of Grupo Calpik, S.A.P.I. de C.V. and 10.64 % of Panadería y Alimentos para Food Service, S.A de C.V..In June 2012, the Entity finalized the acquisition of the remaining 35% shares of Grupo Calpik, a company that holds the exclusive rights to develop and operate California Pizza Kitchen restaurants in Mexico. The book entry for that acquisition gave rise to a charge to stockholders’ equity of $15,262. Additionally, in October 2012, the Entity acquired the remaining 10.64% shares of Panadería y Alimentos para Food Service, a company that distributes food brands mainly to Café Sirena, S de R.L. de C.V. , which operates Starbucks in Mexico. The book entry for said acquisitions gave rise to a decrease in the Entity’s non-controlling interest of $15,172 and $11,748, respectively. (Note 24) e. Agreement to acquire Italianni’s restaurants and the exclusive rights to develop and operate that brand of restaurants in Mexico.The process for the Italianni’s acquisition concluded in February 2012 at a final price of $1,765 million pesos. Italianni’s is a leading Italian food chain in Mexico with more than 52 units in over 20 states. The brand is known for offering top quality products and services thanks to its experienced operating team and a philosophy based on high service values. (Note 14) f. Acquisition of the master license and exclusive development rights for operating the Pei Wei Asian Dinner (Pei Wei) brand in Mexico.As part of its expansion plan, in October 2011, Alsea signed an exclusive development and master license agreement to operate the Pei Wei brand in the entire Mexican territory. The agreement stipulates the obligation to open three units in the first 18 months and the right to a 10-year exclusivity agreement, with a commitment to open 50 units and the right to extend the term. The first restaurant commenced operations in December 2011. The concept behind the brand is an Asian food menu operating in Mexico under a business model of sit-down, to go and home delivery service, thus adding value to the brand. Pei Wei is the leading Asian food brand in the US under the “Fast Casual” category, which means that by signing the agreement, Alsea becomes the pioneer in Mexico operating under this concept. g. New agreements signed with Starbucks Coffee International (SCI) for Mexico, Argentina and Chile.In October 2011, Alsea established new accords with SCI to develop the brand. Alsea currently holds 82% shareholding over the Starbucks Mexico and Starbucks Argentina subsidiaries and SCI holds the remaining 18%. Shareholding over the subsidiary in Chile is 82% for SCI and 18% for Alsea. 81 Under the initial agreements, SCI has the option to increase its shareholding in the Mexico and Argentina subsidiaries by up to 50% and for the Chilean subsidiary Alsea has the option to increase its shareholding by up to 49%. In light of the new agreements signed with SCI to develop the brand, Alsea has committed to develop more than 300 new units for the Mexico and Argentina markets in the next five years. If the proposed openings plan is achieved and all the agreed terms are met, SCI will waive its right to increase its shareholding in the Mexico and Argentina subsidiaries. The agreements also include an extension of Alsea’s rights to develop the brand in Mexico for an additional five years, which means that they could extend to February 2027. h. Agreement for development and exclusive operation of the brand P.F. Chang’s China Bistro in Argentina, Chile and Colombia In May 2011, Alsea signed the exclusive development agreement and it bought a franchise to operate and develop P.F. Chang’s brand restaurants in Argentina, Chile and Colombia. As part of the agreement, Alsea will open 7 restaurants in Argentina and 5 in Chile and Colombia over the next ten years. i. Incorporation of Panadería y Alimentos para Food Service, S. A. de C. V.Panadería y Alimentos para Food Service, S. A. de C. V. was incorporated in November 2010 and started operating in September 2011 to continue the vertical development of the Entity. Alsea invested in the incorporation and development of a new plant that produces sandwiches and bread that is supplied to Starbucks and the other Alsea brands. The business model contemplates the central plant located in Lerma, State of Mexico, where 100% of Pastry and Bakery goods are to be produced and 65% of sandwiches will be assembled. In addition to that plant, there are three regional assembly centers located in the DIA Monterrey, Cancun and Hermosillo facilities for assembly of the regional sandwiches. Significant subsequent events Acquisition of the exclusive rights to develop the P.F. Chang’s China Bistro brand in Brazil. In January 2013, the Entity signed a Development and Operation agreement for the exclusive development of the P.F. Chang’s China Bistro brand in Brazil. The agreements contemplate the opening of 30 units in the next 10 years. P.F. Chang’s is the leading brand in the Casual Asian Food segment in the US with more than 225 operating units. It currently has points of sale in Mexico, Puerto Rico, Canada, Kuwait, Beirut, Chile, Hawaii, the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates. In order to introduce P.F. Chang’s into the Brazilian market, a development and expansion strategy was designed based on the successful business model used to operate the brand portfolio in South America. That model has made it possible to position Alsea as the leading Casual and Fast-food operator in Latin America. With Brazil operations as the new path for growth, the Entity will work towards generating greater diversification and profitability of its portfolio. Alsea signs the rights to the exclusive development and operation of The Cheesecake Factory® restaurants in Mexico. Alsea signed an agreement to be the exclusive developer and operator of The Cheesecake Factory® restaurants in Mexico and Chile, which also contemplates the option for Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Peru, thus becoming the strategic partner of the prestigious brand in the entire region. The agreement initially contemplates the development of 12 openings between Mexico and Chile in the following eight years with 10-year agreements per restaurant, and a right to extend that period to an additional 10 years. The Cheesecake Factory® chain is considered the best seller per unit in its category. The brand focuses on providing customers with top quality products and services. Its operations include 162 restaurants under the The Cheesecake Factory® brand in over 35 states of the United States of America operating under a franchise license. 82 2. Bases for presentation a. Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. As of January 1, 2012, the Entity adopted the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the amendments and interpretations thereto issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in effect as of December 31, 2012. Therefore, it applied IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the standards and interpretations issued and enacted at the date of their issuance. Transition to IFRS The consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2011 were the last statements prepared in accordance with Mexican Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS). Those reports differ in certain areas in relation to the IFRS. In preparing the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2012 and 2011 and for the years ended on those dates, the Entity’s Management has changed certain methods of accounting presentation and valuation applied under the MFRS accounting standards to comply with the IFRS. The comparative figures at December 31, 2011 and for the year ended on that date were modified to reflect adoption of said standards. The Entity’s date of transition, which is defined as the beginning of the earliest period for which the Entity is presenting comparative information, is January 1, 2011. (“date of transition”) The reconciliations and descriptions of the effects of transition from MFRS to IFRS on the statements of financial position, of income and of other comprehensive income are explained in Note 32. b. Bases for presentation The Entity’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments that are valued at fair value, as explained in further detail in the section on accounting policies. i. Historical cost The historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration paid in exchange for assets. ii. Fair value The fair value is defined as the price to be received from the sale of an asset, or to be paid on the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between participants of the market at valuation date. 83 c. Bases for consolidation of the financial statements The consolidated financial statements include those of the Entity and the subsidiaries over which it holds control. Control is obtained when the Entity has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity in order to benefit from its operations. The shareholding in its capital stock is as follows: Shareholding percentage (%) Date of Subsidiary and/or associate Operations 2012 2011 transition Panadería y Alimentos para Food Service Distribution of Alsea brand foods 100.00% 89.36% 89.36% Café Sirena, S. de R.L de C.V.

The results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and other comprehensive income as of the date of acquisition. The non-controlling interest in subsidiaries is identified separately from the Entity’s investments in them. The non-controlling interests may be initially value either at their fair value or at the proportional equity of non-controlling interests on the fair value of the identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. The selection of the valuation base is done individually for each operation. After the acquisition takes place, the book value of the controlling interests represents the amount of those interests upon initial recognition, plus the portion of subsequent non-controlling interests of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. The comprehensive income is attributable to non-controlling interests, even if it results in a deficit. i. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities SPEs) over which the Entity has the power to govern the operating and financial policies, generally as a result of holding more than half of their voting rights. The existence and effects of potential voting rights that can be presently exercised or are convertible, are considered when evaluating whether or not the Entity controls the other entity. The subsidiaries consolidate as from the date on which control thereof is transferred to the Entity, and they stop consolidating as from the date on which said control is lost. In accordance with the previous Standards Interpretations Committee (SIC) SIC 12, SPEs are deemed to consolidate when the substance of the relationship between the Entity and the SPEs indicate that they are controlled by the Entity. The accounting policies of the subsidiaries have been modified to the extent necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Entity. ii. Associates Associates are all entities over which the Entity exercises significant influence but not control. Generally speaking, those are entities over which shareholding is between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are initially recorded at historical cost and subsequently through the equity method. The Entity’s investment in associates includes goodwill (net of accrued impairment loss, if any) identified at the time of acquisition. Changes in the Entity’s equity in existing subsidiaries The changes in investments in the Entity’s subsidiaries that do not give rise to loss of control are recorded as stockholders’ equity transactions. The book value of the Entity’s investments and non-controlling interests is adjusted to reflect the changes in investments in subsidiaries. Any differences between the amount for which non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received are recorded directly in capital and are attributed to the Entity’s owners. When the Entity losses control over a subsidiary, the related gain or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the sum of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any interest retained and (ii) the prior book value of assets (including goodwill) and the subsidiary’s liabilities and any non-controlling interest. Amounts previously recorded under other comprehensive income related to the subsidiary are recorded in the same manner as disposals of relevant assets and liabilities (i.e. they are reclassified to income or are directly transferred to retained earnings). The fair value of any investments retained in the former subsidiary at the date of control loss is considered the fair value of initial recognition for subsequent accounting treatment, as established in IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, or, when applicable, the cost of initial recognition of an investment in an associate or an entity under joint control. 85 3. Summary of the main accounting policies The enclosed accompanying consolidated financial statements comply with the IFRS issued by the IASB. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Entity’s Management to prepare certain estimates and use certain assumptions to value different consolidated financial statement line items and to make the necessary disclosures. However, actual results could differ from those estimates. After applying its professional judgment, the Entity’s Management considers that the estimates and assumptions used were appropriate under the circumstances (see Note 4). The main accounting policies followed by the Entity are described below: a. Reclassifications The consolidated financial statements for the year ended on December 31, 2011 have been reclassified under certain captions to adjust their presentation to that for 2012. b. Financial instruments i) Financial assets Initial recognition The financial assets covered by IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value with changes in income, loans and accounts receivable, investments held to maturity, financial investments available for sale, or as derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as the case may be. The Entity determines the classification of financial assets at the time of their initial recognition. All financial assets are initially recognized at their fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not accounted for at fair value with changes in income, the transaction costs that are directly attributable. Fixed asset purchases or sales that require delivering the related assets in a period of time specified by a standard or market convention (conventional purchases-sales or regular way trades) are recognized at the date of the purchase-sale, i.e., the date on which the Entity agrees to purchase or sell the asset. After their initial recognition, financial assets or liabilities are valued at each balance sheet date according to their classification, either as assets measured at fair value or at amortized cost. Subsequent measurement Loans and accounts receivable are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market. After their initial recognition, those financial assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment in value. The amortized cost is calculated considering any discounts or premiums on acquisition, and any commissions or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Amortization of the effective interest rate is recognized in the consolidated statements of income as financial income. Any losses resulting from impairment in value are recognized in the consolidated statements of income as part of the financial cost. Cancellation of accounts A financial asset (or, if applicable, part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is canceled from the accounts when: a) The contractual rights to receive cash flows generated by the asset have expired; 86 b) The contractual rights over cash flows generated by the asset have been transferred, or an obligation to pay a third party the entirety of such cash flows without a significant delay through a pass through arrangement has been assumed, and i. All risks and benefits inherent to ownership of the asset have been substantially transferred; or ii. All risks and benefits inherent to ownership of the assets have not been transferred or retained substantially, but control thereof has been transferred. When the contractual rights to receive cash flows generated by an asset have been transferred, or a transfer agreement has been signed, but not all risks and benefits inherent to ownership of the asset have been substantially transferred or retained, nor has control thereof been transferred, the asset must continue to be recognized to the degree of the continued involvement of the Entity in regard to the asset. In that case, the Entity must also recognize the related liability. The transferred asset and related liability must be measured in a way that reflects the rights and responsibilities retained by the Entity. Continuous involvement that takes on the form of a guaranty over the transferred asset must be measured at the lower of the original book value of the asset and the maximum amount of the consideration that the Entity is required to return. Impairment in the value of financial assets At the close of each period being reported, the Entity evaluates whether or not there is objective evidence that the value of a financial asset or a group of financial assets has deteriorated. The value of a financial asset or group of financial assets is considered to have been impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment in said value resulting from one or more events occurring after initial recognition of said assets (an “event that causes an impairment loss”), and when the impairment causing event has an effect on estimated future cash flows arising from the financial asset or group thereof and said effect can be reasonably estimated. Evidence of impairment in value could include, among others, signs such as debtors or a group of debtors experiencing significant financial difficulties, default or late payment of amounts owed on the capital or interest, the probability of entities filing for bankruptcy or adopting another form of financial reorganization, or observable data indicating a measurable decrease in expected future cash flows, as well as adverse changes in the status of late payments, or in economic conditions correlated to default. In the case of financial assets accounted for at amortized cost, the Entity first evaluates whether or not there is objective evidence of impairment in their value, individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If the Entity determines that there is no objective evidence of impairment in the value of a financial asset evaluated individually, irrespective of its materiality, it includes said asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk features, and it evaluates them collectively to determine the existence of impairment in their value. Assets that are evaluated individually to determine the existence of impairment in their value, and for which an impairment loss has been or continues to be recognized, are not included in the evaluation of impairment in value collectively. If there is objective evidence that there has been a loss due to impairment in value, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the book value of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows (not including expected future loan losses that have not yet been incurred). The present value of estimated future cash flows is discounted at the original effective interest rate of the financial assets. If a loan is subject to a variable interest rate, the discount rate used to measure impairment losses is the present effective interest rate. The book value of the asset is reduced through a provision account and the amount of the loss is recognized in income for the period. Interest earned continues to accrue on the reduced book value of the asset, using the interest rate for discounting future cash flows from the result of measuring the impairment loss in value. Interest earned is recorded as financial income in income for the year. The loans and the respective provision are canceled when there are no realistic expectations of recovering the amount in the future and all existing guarantees have been exercised or transferred to the Entity. If in a subsequent year the estimated amount of the impairment loss increases or decreases due to an event occurring after the impairment is 87 recognized, the loss for impairment in value recognized previously is increased or reduced adjusting the reserve account. If an item attributed to the loss is recovered subsequently, the recovery is credited in the account in which the reserve was recorded under operating expenses for the period. (Note 17) ii) Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement The financial liabilities covered by IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value with changes in income, loans and accounts payable, or as derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as the case may be. The Entity determines the classification of financial liabilities at the time of their initial recognition. All financial liabilities are initially recognized at their fair value plus, in the case of loans and accounts payable accounted for at amortized cost, the transaction costs that are directly attributable. The Entity’s financial liabilities include accounts payable to suppliers, other accounts payable, and short and long-term debts, and they are accounted for as financial liabilities measured at their amortized cost. Subsequent measurement After their initial recognition, accounts payable and debts are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognized in income for the period when liabilities are canceled by the amortization process, using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is calculated considering any discounts or premiums on acquisition and any commissions or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Amortization of the effective interest rate is recognized in the consolidated statements of income as financial cost. Cancellation of accounts A financial liability is canceled when an obligation specified in the respective agreement has been paid or canceled, or when it is due. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another liability from the same lender under substantially different conditions, or if the conditions of an existing liability change substantially, said change is treated as a cancellation of the original liability and a new liability is recognized, and the difference in the respective book values is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. iii) Financial instrument compensation Financial assets and financial liabilities are compensated by reporting the net amount in the consolidated statements of financial position, only if there is a legal right of offset the amounts recognized and if there is an intention to settle the net amount or to realize said assets and cancel the liabilities simultaneously. b. Derivative financial instruments Alsea uses derivative financial instruments (DFI) known as forwards or swaps, in order to a) mitigate present and future risks of adverse fluctuations in exchange and interest rates, b) avoid distracting resources from its operations and the expansion plan, and c) have certainty over its future flows, which also helps to maintain a cost of debt strategy. DFIs used are only held for economic hedge purposes, through which the Entity agrees to trade cash flows at future fixed dates, at the nominal or reference value, and they are valued at fair value. 88 Entity must define monthly the price levels at which the Corporate Treasury must operate the different derivative financial instruments. Under no circumstances should amounts above the monthly resource requirements be operated, thus ensuring that there is always a position at risk to hedge and that the derivative instruments are not held for speculation. Given the variety of derivative instruments available to cover risks, Management is empowered to define the operations for which said instruments are contracted, provided they are held for economic hedging and not for speculative purposes. Operations with DFI are carried out under a master agreement on an ISDA (International Swap Dealers Association) form, which must be standardized and duly formalized by the legal representatives of the Entity and the financial institutions. In certain cases, the Entity and the financial institutions have signed an agreement enclosed to the ISDA master agreement, which stipulates conditions that require them to offer guarantees for margin calls in the event that the mark-to-market exceeds certain established credit limits. The Entity has the policy of monitoring the volume of operations contracted with each institution, in order to avoid margin calls as much as possible and diversify the risk for the counterparty. Derivative financial instruments are contracted in the local market under the over the counter (OTC) mode. Following are the financial entities that are eligible to close operations related to the Entity’s risk management: BBVA Bancomer S.A., Banco Nacional de México, S. A., Banco Santander, S. A., Barclays Bank México S. A., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman, Sachs Paris Inc. Etcie., HSBC México S. A., Merril Lynch Capital Services Inc., Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc., and UBS AG. The Entity may choose other entities, provided that they are regulated and authorized to carry out that type of operations. Valuation DFIs are initially recorded at fair value, which is represented by the transaction cost. After their initial recognition, DFIs are valued at market value at each balance sheet date and any changes in value are recognized in the statement of income, except when said derivatives have been formally designated and they meet the requirements to be considered as hedging instruments associated to a hedge. In the case of cash flow hedges, the effective portion of gains or losses of the hedging instrument are recognized under other items of comprehensive gain or loss, and they are reclassified to income in the same period or periods in which the projected hedged transaction affects them. The ineffective portions and any exclusion are immediately recorded in income for the year. Identified risks are those related to variations in exchange rate and interest rate. Derivative instruments are contracted under Entity policies and no risks are expected to occur that differ from the purpose for which those instruments are contracted. c. Embedded derivatives The Entity reviews all signed contracts to identify the existence of embedded derivatives. Identified embedded derivatives are subject to evaluation to determine whether or not they comply with the provisions of the applicable regulations; if so, they are separated from the host contract and are valued at fair value. If an embedded derivative is classified for trade, the appreciation or depreciation of fair value is recognized in income for the period. Implicit derivatives designated for hedging are recorded in changes in valuation based on the type of hedging: (1) when they relate to fair value, fluctuations in the embedded derivative and in the hedged item are valued at fair value and are recorded in income; (2) when they relate to cash flow, the effective portion of the embedded derivative is temporarily recorded under comprehensive income, and it is recycled to income when the hedged item affects them. The ineffective portion is immediately recorded in income. 89 d. Inventories and cost of sales Inventories are valued at cost or at net realizable value, the lower of the two. Costs, including a portion of fixed and variable indirect costs, are assigned to inventories through the most appropriate method for the specific type of inventory. In assigning the unit cost of inventories, the Entity uses the average cost method (AC). The sales cost represents the cost of inventories at the time of sale, increased, when applicable, by reductions in the net realization value of inventories during the year. The Entity records the necessary estimations to recognize reductions in the value of its inventories due to impairment, obsolescence, slow movement and other causes that indicate that utilization or realization of the items comprising the inventories will be below the recorded value. (Note 8) e. Business combinations Business acquisitions are accounted using the purchase method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of fair values of the assets transferred by the Entity, less liabilities incurred by the Entity with the former owners of the purchased company and the interests in capital issued by the Entity in exchange for control over the acquired company at acquisition date. Costs related to an acquisition are generally recorded in the consolidated statements of income as they are incurred. At the date of acquisition, identifiable assets acquired and assumed liabilities are recognized at fair value, with the exception of: Deferred tax assets or liabilities and assets and liabilities related to employee benefits recognized and measured in accordance with IAS 12, Income Taxes, and IAS 19, Employee Benefits, respectively. Liabilities or equity securities related to payment agreements based on shares of the purchased company or payment agreements based on shares of the Entity entered into to replace payment agreements based on shares of the acquired company are measured in accordance with IFRS 2, Share Based Payments, at the date of acquisition; and Assets (or a group of assets for disposal) classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, that are measured in accordance with that standard. Goodwill is measured as the surplus of the amount of the transferred consideration, the amount of any non-controlling interest of the acquired company, and the fair value of previous shareholding of the purchaser in the acquired company (if any) over the net amount of identifiable acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the date of acquisition. If after a revaluation, the net amount of identifiable acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the date of acquisition exceeds the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired company and the fair value of previous shareholding of the purchaser in the acquired company (if any), the surplus is recognized immediately in the consolidated statements of income as a gain on a good purchase opportunity. Non-controlling interests that represent current shareholdings and that offer their holders a proportional interest in the net assets of the entity in the event of liquidation can be initially measured either at fair value or at the value of the proportional interest of the non-controlling interest in the amounts recognized for net identifiable assets of the acquired company. The measurement option is based on each transaction. Other types of non-controlling interests are measured at fair value, or, when applicable, based on the provisions of another IFRS. When the consideration transferred by the Entity in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration agreement, the contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition and it is included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration qualifying as adjustments for the measurement period are retrospectively adjusted along with the respective adjustments vs. goodwill. Adjustments in measurement period are adjustments that arise from the additional information 90 obtained in the measurement period (which cannot exceed one year as from the acquisition date) in relation to existing facts and circumstances at acquisition date. The accounting treatment for changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as adjustments of the measurement period depend on the manner in which the contingent consideration is classified. The contingent consideration classified as capital is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent liquidation is accounted for under capital. A contingent consideration classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39 or IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, recognizing the respective gain or loss in the consolidated statements of income. When a business combination is developed in stages, the Entity’s previous shareholding in the acquired company is remeasured at fair value at acquisition date (i.e., the date on which the Entity obtains control), and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Amounts resulting from equity in the acquired company prior to the date of acquisition, which have been previously recognized in other comprehensive income, are reclassified to the consolidated statements of income. If the initial accounting treatment of a business combination is incomplete at the end of the reporting period in which the combination takes place, the Entity reports the provisional amounts of the items for which book recording is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted in the measurement period (see above), or instead additional assets or liabilities are recognized to reflect new information obtained on the existing facts and circumstances at the acquisition date and which, had it been known, would have affected the amounts recognized at that date. f. Store equipment, leasehold improvements and property Store equipment, leasehold improvements and property are recorded at acquisition cost. Depreciation in store equipment, leasehold improvements and property is calculated by the straight line method, based on the useful lives estimated by the Entity’s Management. Annual depreciation rates of the main groups of assets is as follows: Rates Store equipment 5% to 30% Transportation equipment 25% Production equipment 10% to 20% Buildings 5% Leasehold improvements 7% to 20% Computer equipment 30% Office furniture and equipment 10% Any significant components of store equipment, leasehold improvements and property that must be replaced periodically are canceled by the Entity and the new component is recognized with its respective useful life and depreciation. Likewise, when major maintenance is performed, the cost is recognized as a replacement of a component to the extent that all recognition requirements are met. All other routine repair and maintenance costs are recorded as an expense in income for the period as they are incurred. 91 Financing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily requires a substantial period of time to be in use condition or ready for sale are capitalized as part of the cost of the respective asset. All other financing costs are accounted for as expenses for the period in which they are incurred. Financing costs include interest and other costs incurred in relation to loan agreements signed by the Entity. The Entity does not have the policy of selling fixed assets at the end of their useful lives, since in order to protect its image and the Alsea brands, they are destructed an in some cases sold as waste. Use or lease of equipment outside the provisions of franchise agreements is subject to sanctions. Additionally, given the high costs of maintenance or storage required, those assets are not used as spare parts for other brand stores. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Entity has not capitalized financing costs under the value of assets, since its lacks ratable assets or financing for purchase of construction of assets. g. Intangible assets. Goodwill represents future economic benefits arising from business acquisitions that are not individually identifiable or recognized separately Goodwill is subject to impairment tests at least once a year. In order to test impairment, goodwill is assigned to each of the Entity’s cash generating units (or groups of cash generating units) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Other intangible assets represent payments made to third parties for rights to use brands through which the Entity operates its establishments under the respective franchise or association agreements. Amortization is calculated by the straight line method based on the use period of each brand, including renewals considered certain for the next 10 to 20 years. The terms of brand rights are as follows: Brands Country Year of expiration Domino’s Pizza Mexico 2025 Colombia 2016 Starbucks Coffee Mexico (1) 2027 Argentina 2027 Burger King Mexico, Argentina, Depending on Chile and Colombia opening dates Chili’s Grill & Bar Mexico 2015 California Pizza Kitchen Mexico 2017 P.F. Chang’s China Bistro Mexico, 2019 Argentina, Chile and 2021 Colombia (3) Pei Wei Mexico (4) 2021 Italianni´s Mexico (2) 2031 (1) Contemplates a five-year extension to the rights for developing the brand resulting from the agreements signed in 2011. (2) The term for each store under this brand is 20 years as of the opening date, with the right to a 10 year extension (Note 1e). (3) The term for each store under this brand is 10 years as of the opening date, with the right to an additional 10 year extension. (4) Term of 10 years with the right to an extension. 92 The Entity has obligations to do and refrain from doing under the aforementioned agreements, the most important of which are carrying out capital investments and opening establishments. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, and at January 1, 2011, those obligations have been met. Amortization of intangible assets is included in the depreciation and amortization accounts in the consolidated statements of income. h. Leases Determination of whether an agreement constitutes or includes a lease is based on the essence of the agreement at the date on which it is signed, if compliance of said agreement depends on the use of one or more specific assets, or if the agreement awards the right to use said assets, even when said right is not explicitly specified in the agreement. Financial leases whereby substantially all risks and benefits inherent to ownership of the leased good are transferred to the Entity are capitalized at the start of the lease period, either on the fair value of the leased property, or on the present value of the minimum lease payments, the lower of the two. Lease payments are distributed between the financial charges and the reduction of debt so that a constant ratio of interest over left-over debt balance can be determined. Financial charges are recognized as financial costs in the consolidated statements of income. Leased assets are depreciated over their useful lives. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Entity will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over its estimated useful life or over the lease term, the lower of the two. Operating lease payments are recognized as operating expenses using the straight line method over the lease term, except when another systematic apportionment base is more appropriate for showing the pattern of lease benefits for the user. Contingent leases are recognized as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. (Note 13) i. Advance payments Advance payments include advances for purchase of inventories, property, store equipment, leasehold improvements and services that are received in the twelve months after the date of the statement on financial position and over the course of regular operations. j. Impairment in the recovery value of long-lived assets, equipment, leasehold improvements, properties, goodwill and other intangible assets At the end of the year being reported, the Entity periodically evaluates the book values of its long-lived assets, store equipment, leasehold improvements, properties, goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether or not those values exceed their recoverable value. The recoverable value represents the value of potential net income that is reasonably expected to be incurred as a result of using or selling said assets. If it is determined that the book values exceed the recoverable value, the Entity records the necessary allowances to reduce them to their recoverable value. When assets qualify as held for sale, they are shown in the consolidated financial statements at their book value or fair value less selling expenses, the lower of the two. Assets and liabilities of a group classified as held for sale are shown separately in the consolidated statements of financial position. k. Provisions Provisions are recorded when the Entity has a present obligation (be it legal or assumed) as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Entity will have to settle the obligation and it is possible to prepare a reliable estimation of the total amount. 93 The amount recorded as a provision is the best estimation of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the end of the period being reported, considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When a provision is valued using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, the book value is shown at the present value of those cash flows. When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered by a third party, an account receivable is recorded as an asset provided that it is virtually certain that the payment will be received and the amount of the account receivable can be reliably valued. Provisions are classified as current or non-current based on the estimated period of time estimated for addressing the obligations covered. l. Employee benefits Direct employee benefits are valued in proportion to the services rendered, considering current salaries, and they are recognized under liabilities as they accrue. This item includes mainly ESPS payable, paid absences, such as vacations and vacation premium, and incentives. Seniority premiums to which employees are entitled are recognized in income for each year based on actuarial calculations prepared under the projected unit credit method, considering projected balances or the projected cost of benefits. The actuarial gain or losses are recognized directly in income for the year as they are incurred. Other compensation to which personnel is entitled is recognized in income for the year in which it accrues. ESPS is recorded in income for the year in which it accrues and it is shown under other income and expenses in the consolidated statements of income. ESPS is determined based on the tax profit in accordance with Section I of article 10 of the Income Tax Law. m. Income taxes.The expense for income taxes represents the sum of income taxes incurred and deferred income taxes. Incurred income taxes In Mexico, income tax (IT) and flat tax (IETU) are recorded in income in the years in which they are incurred. In Chile, in April 2010, the Chilean government announced the 2010-2013 financing plan for the reconstruction of Chile after the February 2010 earthquake. Said financing plan includes a temporary increase in the First Category Interest rate of the historical rate of 17% to 20% in 2011, 18.5% in 2012 and reduces it back to 17% in 2013. The change in the First Category Tax was pronounced in July 2010. In Colombia, income tax is determined on the basis of tax income. The percentage for determining presumptive income is 3% of the liquid equity of the preceding year. In Argentina, i.Income taxes, the Entity applies the deferred tax method to recognize the accounting effect of taxes on profits . ii.Taxes on minimum presumptive income (TMPI), the Entity determines TMPI applying the current 1% rate to computable assets at each year end closing. iii.Tax on personal goods belonging to individuals or business entities resident abroad, it is determined applying the 0.5% factor to the proportional equity value at the yearend closing and its considered a lump sum payment. 94 Deferred income taxes In recognizing deferred taxes, the Entity determines whether or not, based on its financial projections, it will incur IT or flat tax and it recognizes deferred tax on the tax payable in the future. Deferred income taxes are recorded based on temporary differences between the book value of assets and liabilities included in the consolidated financial statements and the respective tax bases used to determine the tax result, applying the respective rates to said differences and including any benefits from unamortized tax losses and tax credits. A deferred taxes on profits liability is recognized usually for all tax temporary differences . A deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that the entity will accrue future tax profits against which to apply those deductible temporary differences . Those assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary differences arise from the goodwill or from initial recognition (other than that of the business combination) of other assets and liabilities in an operation not affecting the book or tax result. A deferred tax liability is recognized for taxable temporary differences associated to investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint businesses, except when the Entity is capable of controlling reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the timing difference will not be reversed in a foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences associated to said investments and interests are recognized only to the extent that it is probable for sufficient future tax profits to arise against which to offset those temporary differences and they are expected be reversed in the near future. The book value of a deferred tax asset must undergo a review at the end of each period being reported and it must be reduced in proportion to the likelihood of an insufficiency in taxable income with which to recover all or part of the asset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued using the tax rates expected to be applied in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is sold, based on the rates (and tax laws) approved or substantially approved at the end of the period being reported. Valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflects the tax consequences that would derive from the manner in which the Entity expects to recover or settle the book value of its assets and liabilities at the end of the period being reported. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are compensated when there is a legal right to offset short-term assets vs. short-term liabilities and when they relate to the same taxes on profits and the Entity has the intention of liquidating its assets and liabilities on net bases. Incurred and deferred taxes Taxes incurred and deferred are recorded in income as income or expenses, except when they relate to items that are recorded in a caption other than income, either under other comprehensive income or directly under stockholders’ equity, in which case the tax is also recognized in a caption other than income; or when they arise from initial recognition of a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is included in the recognition of the business combination. n. Revenue recognition Income generated from common operations is recorded to the extent that future economic benefits are likely to flow into the Entity and income can be measured reliably, irrespective of the moment in which payment is made. Income is measured based on the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, bearing in mind the payment conditions specified in the respective agreement, without including taxes or tariffs. Sale of goods Income from the sale of goods and beverages is recognized when they are delivered to and/or consumed by customers. 95 Provision of services Income is recorded based on the percentage of completion. Percentage of completion is determined when the services have been rendered and accepted by customers. Interest earned For all financial instruments measured at amortized cost, interest earned or paid is recorded using the effective interest method, which is the interest rate used to discount future payment or collection flows in cash over the expected life of the financial instrument, or a lesser period, as the case may be, with respect to the net book amount of the financial asset or liability. Interest earned is included in the interest income line in the consolidated statements of income. Dividends Income is recognized when the Entity’s right to collect dividends materializes. Royalties Royalty income is recorded as it is incurred, based on a fixed percentage of sub-franchise sales. o. Foreign currency transactions. In order to consolidate the financial statements of foreign operations carried out independently from the Entity (located in Argentina, Chile and Colombia) and that comprise 25% and 23% of consolidated net income and 16% and 17% of the total consolidated assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, companies apply the policies followed by the Entity. The financial statements of consolidating foreign operations are converted to the reporting currency by initially identifying whether or not the functional and recording currency of foreign operations are different, and subsequently converting the functional currency to the reporting currency. In order to convert the financial statements of subsidiaries resident abroad from the functional currency to the reporting currency at the reporting date, the following steps are carried out: Assets and liabilities, both monetary and non-monetary, are converted at the closing exchange rates in effect at the reporting date of each consolidated statement of financial position. Income, cost and expense items of the consolidated statements of income are converted at the average exchange rates for the period, unless those exchange rates will fluctuate significantly over the year, in which case operations are converted at the exchange rates prevailing at the date on which the related operations were carried out. Stockholders’ equity is converted at historical exchange rates, i.e., at the rates in effect on the date on which capital contributions were made or earnings were incurred. All conversion differences are recognized as a separate component under stockholders’ equity and form part of other comprehensive income items. 4. Critical accounting judgments and key sources for estimating uncertainties In applying the Entity’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, Management is required to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions on the amounts of the book value of assets and liabilities included in the consolidated financial statements. The related estimates and assumptions are based on experience and other factors considered to be relevant. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Estimations and assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis. Changes to the accounting estimations are recognized in the period in which changes are made, or in future periods if the changes affect the current period and other subsequent periods. 96 Following is an analysis of the basic assumptions regarding the future and other key sources of uncertainty contemplated in the year-end estimations for the period being reported, which involve a significant risk of giving rise to important adjustments in the book value of assets and liabilities for the following year. Impairment of long-lived assets The Entity annually evaluates whether or not there is indication of impairment in long-lived assets and it calculates the recoverable amount when said indication is present. Impairment occurs when the net book value of a long-lived asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair value of the asset less selling costs and the in-use book value. Calculation of the in-use value is based on the discounted cash flow model, using the Entity’s projections of its operating results for the near future. The recoverable amount of long-lived assets is subject to uncertainties inherent to the preparation of projections and the discount rate used for the calculation. Useful life of store equipment, leasehold improvements and properties Fixed assets acquired separately are recognized at cost less accrued amortization and accrued losses for impairment. Depreciation is calculated based the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. The estimated useful life and the depreciation method are reviewed at each year-end closing, and the effect of any changes in the estimation recorded is recognized prospectively. Income tax valuation The Entity recognizes the net future tax benefit related to deferred income tax assets depending on the likelihood of temporary differences reversing in the foreseeable future. Evaluating the recoverability of deferred income tax assets requires the Entity to prepare significant estimates related to the possibility of incurring future taxable income. Future taxable income estimates are based on projected cash flows from the Entity’s operations and the application of the existing tax laws in Mexico. The Entity’s capacity to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded at reporting date could be negatively affected to the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from the Entity’s estimates. Additionally, future changes in Mexico’s tax laws could limit the capacity to obtain tax deductions in future periods. Intangible assets The period and amortization method of an intangible asset with a defined life is reviewed at least at the date of the consolidated statements of financial position. Changes to the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits are made changing the period or amortization method, as the case may be, and are treated as changes in the accounting estimations. Amortization expenses of an intangible asset with a defined useful life are recorded in income under the expense caption in accordance with the function of the intangible asset. Contingencies Given their nature, contingencies are only resolved when one or more future events occur or stop occurring. The evaluation of contingencies inherently includes the use of significant criteria and estimations of the result of future events. 5. Non-monetary transactions In the year, the Entity carried out the following financial activities and non-monetary investments that are not shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows: As mentioned in Note 24, in April 2012, Alsea declared share dividends of $308,902 through the capitalization of that amount in the after-tax earnings account. 97 6. Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the cash and cash equivalents caption includes cash, banks and investments in money market instruments. The cash and cash equivalents balance included in the consolidated statements of financial position and the consolidated statements of cash flows at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and at January 1, 2011 is comprised as follows: 2012 2011 Date of transition Cash $ 329,841 $ 316,938 $ 284,306 Investments payable on demand with original maturities of under three months 602,753 422,441 355,897 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 932,594 $ 739,379 $ 640,203 The Entity keeps its cash and cash equivalents with accepted financial entities and it has historically experienced no losses due to credit risk concentration. 7. Customers The accounts receivable from customers disclosed in the consolidated statements of financial position are classified as loans and accounts receivable and therefore they are valued at their amortized cost. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, and at January 1, 2011, the customer balance is comprised as follows: 2012 2011 2010 Franchises 164,053 116,460 106,939 Credit card 101,310 48,800 20,229 Other 100,442 63,359 83,861 Total portfolio 365,805 228,619 211,029 The average credit term for the sale of foods, beverages, containers, packagings, royalties and other items to owners of sub-franchises is from eight to 14 days. No interest charges are made on accounts receivable to customers in the first 14 days after billing is issued. After that date, the Entity charges the TIIE rate+5 points x2 % a year on unpaid balances. The Entity has generally not recognized an estimation for doubtful accounts because customers are governed by master franchise agreements whereby they are required to follow the conditions stipulated in those agreements in relation to services and supply of production materials. Following is the seniority of accounts receivable outstanding but no deemed irrecoverable: 2012 2011 Date of transition 60-90 days $ 7,118 $ 18,484 $ 43,301 More than 90-120 days 55,844 49,410 42,765 Total $ 62,962 $ 67,894 $ 86,066 Average seniority (days) 93 51 67 98 The estimates shown in the consolidated statements of financial position refer to possible differences between income and accounts receivable from the general public in the regular course of operations of the different brands. Estimates recorded mainly for this item total $26,324 in 2012, and $9,269 and $3,805 at December 31 and January 1, 2011, respectively. Credit risk concentration is limited because the customer base is large and independent, and the risk of customers in relation to services and supply of foods is controlled and supported by a service and/or master franchise agreement. 8. Inventories At December 31, 2012 and 2011, and at January 1, 2011, inventories are as follows: 2012 2011 Date of transition Foods and beverages $ 455,960 $ 336,517 $ 230,983 Containers and packagings 46,265 39,280 98,854 Other 56,251 36,203 30,808 Obsolescence allowance (8,082) (8,870) (8,320) Total $ 550,394 $ 403,130 $ 352,325 9. Advance payments Advance payments were made for the acquisition of: 2012 2011 Date of transition Insurance and other services $ 50,990 $ 54,044 $ 38,008 Inventories 102,821 49,826 31,702 Lease of locales 30,390 24,761 25,523 Total $ 184,201 $ 128,631 $ 95,233 10. Current and non-current guarantee deposits Guarantee deposits are comprised as follows: 2012 2011 Date of transition Guarantee deposit acquisition of Italcafé $ $ 2,262,800 $ Guarantee deposits for non-current leased properties 110,020 86,991 78,168 99 11.

Leases The locales housing the stores of Alsea are leased from third parties. In general terms, lease agreements entered into to operate the Entity’s establishments are for a term of five to ten years, with fixed payments set in pesos. Lease payments are generally revised annually and they increase on the basis of inflation. As an exception, lease payments for certain establishments are agreed in US dollars, and in some cases, they may include a variable component, which is determined on the basis of net sales of the respective establishment. Alsea considers that it depends on no specific lessor and there are no restrictions for the entity as a result of having signed said agreements. Some of the Entity’s subsidiaries have signed operating leases for utilitarian cars and sundry computer equipment. In the event of breach of any of the straight-lease agreements, the Entity is required to settle in advance all its obligations, including payments and penalties for early termination, and it must immediately return all vehicles to a location specified by the lessor. Amounts of lease payments derived from operating lease agreements related to the locales housing the stores of the different Alsea brands are as follows: Year Amount 2011 $ 827,370 2012 1,066,583 14. Business combinations The process for the acquisition of Italianni’s concluded in February 2012. The final price was $1,765 million pesos. Alsea acquired, 8,168,161 shares comprising 100% of the capital stock of Italcafé, S.A. de C.V., which owns: i.Eight Italianni’s units, as well as the exclusive rights to develop, expand and sub-franchise the Italianni’s brand throughout Mexico, and ii.89.7682% of the capital stock of Grupo Amigos de San Ángel S.A. de C.V. (“GASA”), a company that owns 34 Italianni’s units. The purpose of the acquisition is to consolidate the plans for expansion of the Casual Dinning segment. 102 Franchise license agreements, other rights and assets assigned to third parties as a result of the transition were paid to the holders of those rights and goods. Additionally, the final agreement contemplates the following, among other matters: a) The exclusive operation of the Italianni’s brand restaurants in Mexico for a maximum term of 30 years. b) Alsea will pay no royalties, opening fees or commissions for the use of brand or the franchise model. c) There is no obligation to comply with an openings plan. d) The assignment of franchise agreements to existing third parties. e) The power to award new franchises to third parties. f) The rights to distribute all raw materials to the brand’s restaurants. The period for measuring the acquisition concluded in February 2013. Following is an analysis of the preliminary assignment of the acquisition cost of fixed assets expressed at fair value at the date of acquisition. Item February 2012 Current assets: $ 173,961 Store equipment and properties, net 242,241 Intangible assets, net 740,619 Short-term and long-term debts (204,063) Fair value of acquired net assets 952,758 Amount paid 1,765,000 Non-controlling interest (26,426) Goodwill $ 785,816 As from the acquisition date, Italinanni’s has contributed $742,466 in income and $43,622 in pretax profit for the period to the Entity’s earnings. If the combination had occurred at the start of 2012, the consolidated net gain for the period would have been $413,001 and the income from continuous operations would have been $13,652,912. Transition costs of $3,234 were recognized in income for the period and are part of cash flows arising from operations recorded in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 103 15. Long-term debts The long-term debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and at January 1, 2011 is comprised of two unsecured loans, as shown below: Average annual Date of Maturities interest rate 2012 2011 transition Straight loans 4.50% 2013-2016 6.50% $ 2,474,480 $ 3,063,000 $ 897,524 Less current maturities 396,647 185,333 229,524 Long-term maturities $ 2,077,833 $ 2,877,667 $ 668,000 Annual long-term debt maturities at December 31, 2012 are as follows: Year Amount 2013 $ 396,647 2014 513,242 2015 676,757 2016 887,834 Bank loans include certain obligations to do and refrain from doing, such as keeping certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, and at January 1, 2011, all such obligations have been met. 16. Debt instruments Based on the debt instrument program established by Alsea, in May 2011, the Entity concluded the placement of debt instruments for a total of $1,000 million pesos on the Mexican market (Alsea11). The intermediaries that participated in placing the offer were HSBC Casa de Bolsa, S. A. de C. V., Grupo Financiero HSBC, Actinver Casa de Bolsa, S. A. de C. V. and Grupo Financiero Actinver. The debt instruments in question are for a term of three years as from their issue date, they mature in May 2014 and are subject to the 28-day TIIE (Average Interbank Interest Rate) rate plus 1.30 percentage points. In December 2012, the Entity decided to amortize in advance the entirety of the debt instrument with ticker code Alsea11. Therefore, at December 31, 2012, the Entity has no debt instruments. At December 2012, the balance of expenses related to said issue, such as legal fees, issue costs, and printing and placement expenses, were recognized in consolidated income statement for the year after the early amortization of the debt instrument. 17. Derivative financial instruments At December 31, 2012 and 2011, a total of 387 and 288 derivative financial instrument operations (forwards and options) were carried out, respectively, for a total of 103.4 and 86.2 million US dollars, respectively. The absolute value of the fair value of the derivative financial instruments used per quarter over the year does not comprise more than 5% of assets, liabilities or total consolidated capital, or otherwise 3% of the total consolidated sales for the last quarter. Therefore, the risk for the Entity of exchange rate fluctuations will have no negative effects, nor will it affect its capacity to carry out derivative financial instrument operations. 104 At December 31, 2012 and 2011, and at January 1, 2011, Alsea has contracted DFIs for the purchase of dollars in 2013 of approximately 45, 6.3 and 51.5 million USD at the average exchange rate of $12.84, $12.46 and $12.14 peso to the dollar, respectively. At December 31, 2012, the Entity’s debt instruments include a variable/fixed interest rate swap for a total of $400 million pesos, which amount covers payment of 28-day coupons maturing in May 2014. The Entity signed two interest rate options known as “Knock Out Swap” and “Limited Swap”, each for a notional $150 million Mexican pesos, both related to a bank loan maturing in December 2016. At January 1, 2011, the Entity has acquired a variable rate/ fixed rate swap for economic interest rate hedging purposes. That strategy has been applied to a loan contracted by Alsea (balance to date is $56.3 million pesos) of which only 20% is under a 7.98% fixed interest rate swap, plus a 10 bps spread. The loan is payable monthly and matures in June 2011. The type of derivative products and the hedged amounts are in line with the internal policy for risk management defined by the Entity’s Corporate Practices Committee, which contemplates an approach to cover foreign currency needs without the possibility to carry out speculative operations. Despite the fact that the Entity does not operated DFIs for speculation purposes, those instruments have not been formally designated as accounting hedging instruments, and therefore the effects are recognized in income for the period under the expense accounts and interest income accounts. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, and at January 1, 2011, the Entity had contracted the following financial instruments: 2012 Thousands of dollars Average payment Institution (notional) exchange rate Maturity Banamex 13,750 12.88 2013 Barclays 8,500 13.05 2013 Deutsche Bank 10,250 12.73 2013 HSBC 6,250 12.61 2013 Santander 5,500 12.89 2013 UBS 500 13.29 2013 2011 Average payment Institution Thousands of dollars exchange rate Maturity Deutsche Bank 3,250 12.33 2012 Banamex 3,000 12.59 2012 105 Date of transition Average payment Institution Thousands of dollars exchange rate Maturity Banamex 6,350 12.13 2011 Barclays 1,000 12.78 2011 Deutsche Bank 27,150 12.24 2011 Morgan Stanley 2,750 11.79 2011 Santander 6,750 11.92 2011 UBS 7,500 11.98 2011 The following interest rate financial instruments had been contracted at December 31, 2012 and 2011: 2012 Notional thousands Institution Instrument of MXP Maturity Santander Plain Vanilla Swap 200,000 2014 Banamex Plain Vanilla Swap 100,000 2014 HSBC Plain Vanilla Swap 100,000 2014 Banamex Knock Out Swap 150,000 2016 Banamex Limited Swap 150,000 2016 2011 Notional thousands Institution Instrument of MXP Maturity Santander Plain Vanilla Swap 200,000 2014 Banamex Plain Vanilla Swap 100,000 2014 HSBC Plain Vanilla Swap 100,000 2014 At January 1, 2011, the Entity had not contracted financial instruments for interest rate hedging. Following is a detailed list of the fair value of derivative financial instruments held in the Entity’s portfolio, which receive the accounting treatment of instruments held for economic hedging or trade purposes: 106 Fair values* 2012 2011 Date of transition Interest rate swap $ 442 $ 447 $ 130 Forwards and options $ (569) $ (8,811) $ 1,380 Total $ (127) $ (8,365) $ 1,510 * Fair value from the viewpoint of banks, a negative amount represents an amount in favor to Alsea. At December 31, 2011, the Entity had contracted DFIs to purchase US dollars in 2012 for a total $6.2 million dollars at the $12.46 exchange rate. At that same date, the fair value receivable by the Entity is $8.3 million pesos. In order to quantitatively measure the credit risk of the counterparties, following is the Credit Default Swap (CDS) for the international counterparty and the notional amount to be covered. Notional Counterparty CDS (thousands of USD) Deutsche Bank AG London 199 3,250 Risk measurement of the local counterparty that lacks a CDS is done in relation to its counterparty risk spread for the same period, plus the 28-day TIIE reference rate. Counterparty Spread (thousands of USD) Banamex SA 0.0% 3,000 In the preceding case, only the TIIE rate is considered to be the cost of credit risk contracted with Banco Nacional de México. Exposure to other counterparties is not material. The amount disclosed comprises 85% of exposure. The Entity monitors the counterparty’s exposure to credit risk through a CDS, which makes it possible for hedging to exist in the event of default when a counterparty is at risk of liability exposure by the Entity. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, and at January 1, 2011, the Entity has had no margin calls and it has not breached the agreements signed with the different financial entities. Strategy for contracting DFIs: Every month, the Corporate Finance Director’s office must define the price levels at which the Corporate Treasury must operate the different derivative instruments. Under no circumstances should amounts above the monthly resource requirements be operated, thus ensuring that there is always a position to be hedged and that DFI are not held for speculation purposes. Processes and authorization levels: The Corporate Treasury Manager must quantify and report to the Financial Director the monthly requirements of operating resources. The Corporate Financial Director may operate at his discretion up to 50% of the resource requirements being covered, and the Administration and Finance Director’s office may hedge up to 75% of the related exposure. Under no circumstances may amounts above the limits authorized by the Entity’s General Management be operated, in order to ensure that operations are always for hedging and not for speculation purposes. The foregoing is applicable to interest rates with respect to the amount of debt contracted at variable rates and the exchange rate with respect to currency requirements. If it becomes necessary to sell positions for the purpose of making a profit and/or incurring a “stop loss”, the Administration and Finance Director must authorize the operation. 107 Internal control processes: With the assistance of the Corporate Treasury Manager, the Corporate Finance Director must issue a report the following working day, specifying the Entity’s resource requirements for the period and the percentage covered by the Administration and Finance Manager. Every month, the Corporate Treasury Manager will provide the Accounting department with the necessary documentation to properly record said operations. The Administration and Finance Director will submit to the Corporate Practices Committee a quarterly report on the balance of positions taken. The actions to be taken in the event that the identified risks associated to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations materialize are carried out by the Internal Risk Management and Investment Committee, of which the Alsea General Director and the main Entity’s directors form part. Markets and counterparties Derivative financial instruments are contracted in the local market under the over the counter (OTC) mode. Following are the financial entities that are eligible to close operations with regard to the Entity’s risk management: Banco Nacional de México S.A., Banco Santander S.A., Barclays Bank México S.A., Deutsche Bank México S.A., Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. Et Cie., HSBC México S.A., Morgan Stanley Capital Services INC., and UBS Bank México. The Corporate Financial Director is empowered to select other participants, provided that they are regulated institutions authorized to carry out this type of operations, and that they can offer the guarantees required by the Entity. Main terms and conditions of the agreements All operations with DFIs are carried out under a master agreement through an ISDA form (International Swap Dealers Association), which must be standardized and duly formalized by the legal representatives of the Entity and the financial institutions. Polices for designating calculation and valuation agents The fair value of DFIs is revised monthly. The calculation or valuation agent used is the same counterparty or financial entity with whom the instrument is contracted, who is asked to issue the respective reports at the month-end closing dates specified by the Entity. Likewise, as established in the master agreements (ISDA) that cover derivative financial operations, the respective calculations and valuations are presented in the quarterly report. The designated calculation agents are the corresponding counterparties. Nevertheless, the Entity validates all calculations and valuations received by each counterparty. Margins, collateral and credit line policies In certain cases, the Entity and the financial institutions have signed an agreement enclosed to the ISDA master agreement, which stipulates conditions that require them to offer guarantees for margin calls in the event that the mark-to-market exceeds certain established credit limits. The Entity has the policy of monitoring the volume of operations contracted with each institution, in order to avoid margin calls. Valuation a) Description of valuation techniques, policies and frequency: The derivative financial instruments used by Alsea (forwards and swaps) are contracted to reduce the risk of adverse fluctuations in exchange and interest rates. Those instruments require the Entity to trade cash flows at future fixed dates on the face value or reference value and are valued at fair value. 108 b) Method for measuring the effectiveness of hedges: In the case of cash flow hedges, the effective portion of gains or losses generated by the hedging instrument are recognized under comprehensive gain or loss in stockholders’ equity, and they are reclassified to income in the same period or periods in which the projected transaction affects them. The ineffective portion is immediately recorded in income for the year. The valuation of the effective and ineffective portion generated from the aforementioned instruments is recorded monthly in the Entity’s consolidated financial statements. A valuation analysis was performed to determine the result of the instruments in question, That valuation meets the objective of mitigating the risk and therefore the hedge is effective. c) Liquidity in Derivative Financial Operations: 1. Internal sources of liquidity: Every month, the Corporate Finance Director’s office must define the price levels at which the Corporate Treasury must operate the different hedging instruments. Under no circumstances should amounts above the requirements be operated, thus ensuring that operations are always for hedging and not for speculation purposes. The resources used to address financial instrument requirements will derive from the resources generated by the issuer. 2. External sources of liquidity: No external sources of financing will be used to address requirements pertaining to derivative financial instruments. 18.

Following is a summary of the actuarial calculations.

Reference for establishing the parameters used to determine interest rates are taken from long-term, low risk financial instruments that are representative of the market, using a long-term interest curve and considering the bond rate issued by the federal government. 111 Benefits 2012 2011 Date of transition Discount rate 7% 7% 8% Salary increase rate 5.8% 5.7% 5.9% Average expected labor life (years) 5.3 5.3 5.3 * Includes the expected career salary increase assumption 23. Income taxes The Entity is subject to income tax and flat tax. Income taxes (IT) The rate is 30% for 2013, 2012 and 2011, and will be 29% for 2014 and 28% subsequent years. The entity consolidates with its subsidiaries for IT purposes. The amendments to the Income Tax Law applicable as from 2010 were published on December 7, 2009, and establish that: IT payment pertaining to the tax consolidation benefits arising from 1999 to 2004 must be made in installments from 2010 to 2014 and b) IT payment pertaining to the tax consolidation benefits arising in 2005 and subsequent years must be paid from the sixth to the 10th year following that in which the benefit arises. Tax payment on tax consolidation benefits arising from 1982 (year of tax consolidation startup) to 1998 may be demanded in certain cases specified in the tax provisions. Flat tax (IETU) Income, deductions and certain tax debts are determined on the basis of cash flows for each period. The rate is 17.5% as from 2010. The Asset Tax Law was annulled when the Flat Tax Law came into effect, which allows, under certain circumstances, recovery of that tax paid in the 10 years immediately preceding that in which IT is first paid, in the terms of the tax provisions. Furthermore, unlike IT, IETU is incurred individually by the controlling company and its subsidiaries. The tax on profits is the higher of IT and IETU. On the basis of financial projections, the Entity has determined that it will essentially be paying IT; therefore, the Entity recognizes deferred IT. a. Income taxes 2012 2011 IT (tax basis) $ 326,795 $ 275,064 Deferred IT (107,648) (168,047) $ 219,147 $ 107,017 112 The tax expense attributable to income before IT was different from that arrived at by applying the 30% rate in 2012 and 2011, as a result of the following items: 2012 2011 Expected IT rate 30% 30% Nondeductible expenses, effects of inflation and others 10% 4% Change in the reserve for valuation of tax losses (5%) (3%) Effective consolidated IT rate 35% 31% b. Deferred taxes – balance sheet Following is an analysis of deferred tax (assets) liabilities shown in the consolidated statements of financial position: 2012 2011 Transition Date Deferred (assets) liabilities: Estimation for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence $ (5,997) (5,351) $ (2,164) Liability provisions (220,682) (151,786) (93,795) Advances from customers (30,072) (29,756) (10,945) Unamortized tax losses, net of the valuation reserve (201,465) (170,115) (172,426) Recoverable asset tax (12,269) (22,802) (22,802) Store equipment, leasehold improvements and property (380,473) (327,214) (255,020) Other assets 807 (41) (1,277) Advance payments 21,186 14,645 13,955 $ (828,965) (692,420) $ (544,474) Temporary differences 2012 2011 Beginning balance $ (692,420) $ (544,474) Recognized in income (107,648) (168,047) Procurement (24,628) Recognized directly in capital (4,269) 20,101 $ (828,965) $ (692,420) Deferred assets not recognized at December 31, 2012 and 2011 and at January 1, 2011 totaled $159,594, $190,220 and $200,245, respectively. The net change in deferred assets not recognized at December 31, 2012 and 2011 and at January 1, 2011 was a decrease of $30,626 and $10,025 and an increase of $21,603, respectively, arising mainly from accrued tax losses. 113 At December 31, 2012, unamortized tax losses expire as shown below Year of maturity Amortizable losses 2014 $ 29,187 2016 62,843 2017 44,825 2018 169,980 2019 102,740 2020 68,368 2021 41,962 2022 43,615 The Entity has recognized no liability for deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries arising in 2012 and preceding years, as it currently does not expect those undistributed profits to be reversed or become taxable in the near future. That deferred liability will be recognized when the Entity expects to receive those undistributed profits and they become taxable, such as in the case of sales or the disposal of investments in shares. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 and at January 1, 2011, IT balances related to the Entity’s consolidated tax regime before and after the 2009 tax amendments came into effect correspond to unamortized tax losses arising under consolidation at the controlling and the controlled companies amounting to $193,454, $169,813 and $130,326 respectively. Following is the yearly schedule of payments contemplated by the Entity to cover income tax liabilities arising under tax consolidation resulting from the 2009 tax amendments: Year of maturity Payment 2013 $ 6,885 2014 11,407 2015 22,976 2016 27,912 2017 32,926 2018 33,501 2019 27,132 2020 16,194 2021 9,965 2022 4,556 $ 193,454 114 24. Stockholders’ equity Following is a description of the principal features of the stockholders’ equity accounts: a. Capital stock structure Following are the movements in the capital stock and the premium on the issuance of shares: Thousands of pesos Number of Premium on shares Capital stock the issuance of shares Figures at January 1, 2011 605,240,724 $ 362,080 $ 1,086,415 Repurchased shares 761,200 381 Premium on share subscription 5,632 Figures at December 31, 2011 606,001,924 362,461 1,092,047 Repurchased shares 11,802,800 5,901 Dividends declared in shares 16,465,957 8,233 300,669 Repurchased shares, net 1,090 Purchase of the non-controlling portion (15,262) Placement of shares 53,488,373 26,744 1,088,278 Figures at December 31, 2012 687,759,054 403,339 2,466,822 In December 2012, Alsea issued 46,511,628 shares with an overallotment of 6,976,745 shares, which was exercised at an offering price of 21.50 (twenty one pesos and fifty centavos) per share. The issue was recorded net of placement expenses. (Note 1d) In April 2012, Alsea declared dividends of $308,902 by capitalizing that amount from the after-tax earnings account in order to cover the subscription value of 16,465,957 shares issued and used as payment of the declared dividend at a rate of $37.52 pesos per share. Authorization was issued for the factor used in determining the number of shares necessary to cover the dividend declared to be the closing quotation price for the date of the stockholders’ meeting, that is to say, $18.76 (eighteen pesos and 76 centavos), of which $0.50 (zero pesos fifty centavos) corresponds to the theoretical value, and the remainder to a premium on share subscription. In April 2011, cash dividends were declared in the amount of $122,648. The fixed minimum capital with no withdrawal rights is represented by Class I shares, while the variable portion is represented by Class II shares, and must in no case exceed 10 times the value of the minimum capital with no withdrawal rights. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, and at January 1, 2011, the fixed and variable subscribed capital stock is represented by 687,759,054, 606,001,924 and 605,240,724 common nominative shares, respectively, with no par value, as shown below: 115 Description Number of shares Amount Fixed portion of the capital stock at December 31, 2012 687,759,054 $ 403,339 Fixed capital stock 489,157,480 $ 304,038 Variable capital stock 128,647,244 64,324 Repurchased shares (par value) (11,802,800) (5,901) Capital stock at December 31, 2011 606,001,924 $ 362,461 Fixed capital stock 489,157,480 $ 304,038 Variable capital stock 128,647,244 64,324 Repurchased shares (par value) (12,564,000) (6,282) Capital stock at January 1, 2011 605,240,724 $ 362,080 The National Banking and Securities Commission has established a procedure that allows the Entity to acquire its own shares on the market, for which purpose, a reserve for repurchase of own shares must be created and charged to retained earnings. Alsea has applied that procedure at December 31, 2012. Total repurchased shares must not exceed 5% of total released shares; they must be re-placed in no more than one year, and are not considered in the payment of dividends. The premium on the issuance of shares is the difference between the payment for subscribed shares and the par value of those same shares, or their theoretical value (paid-in capital stock divided by the number of outstanding shares) in the case of shares with no par value, plus restatement at December 31, 2012. Repurchased own shares available are reclassified to contributed capital. In January 2012, Café Sirena, S. de R.L. de C.V. declared a cash dividend of $150,000, calculated on the value of each of the equity units into which the company’s capital stock is divided. The amount corresponding to the uncontrolled portion was $27,000. In August 2012, it was agreed to convert the variable capital stock to fixed minimum capital stock, with the resulting reduction in the variable portion of the capital stock and an increase in the minimum fixed portion, which was effected by converting 145,113,201 Class II shares currently representing the variable portion of the capital stock for the same number of shares, while Class I shares remained unchanged, representing the minimum fixed portion, after which, the shareholders continue to hold the same number of shares. (a) Executives stock option plan Alsea has established a stock option plan for its executives. The plan was set up in 2005 and concluded on December 31, 2009. It consisted of providing the executives the right to receive the surplus (difference) on certain shares determined between the price of the shares at the outset of the plan and the exercise price of the option (market value) payable in cash. The assignment of 5,886,524 shares for this plan was approved at a stockholders’ meeting and those shares were administered by a trust. At the close of the 2006 period, the executives exercised 20% of the rights acquired so far, and the remaining 80% was exercised in the 2009 period, for which a payment of a $14,306 premium on share subscription was recognized. At December 31, 2011, institution administering the trust authorized its total termination. 116 (b) Stockholders’ equity restrictions I. Five percent of net earnings for the period must be set aside for the legal reserve until it reaches 20 percent of the capital stock. At December 31, 2012, the legal reserve amounted to $100,735, which has not yet reached the required 20%. II. Dividends paid from retained earnings are not subject to IT if paid from the after-tax earnings account (CUFIN), and 30% must be paid on the excess, i.e., the result arrived at by multiplying the dividend paid by a factor of 1.4286. The tax on the dividend payment not arising from the CUFIN must be paid by the Entity and may be credited against corporate IT in the following years. 25. Profit per share The basic profit per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to the holders of the ordinary capital of the controlling company by the average weighted number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. The amount of diluted profits per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to the holders of the ordinary capital of the controlling company (after adjusting for interest on the convertible preferential shares) by average weighted ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus average weighted ordinary shares issued when converting all potential ordinary diluted shares to ordinary shares. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Entity has no diluted profits per share. The following table shows information on income and shares used in calculating basic and diluted profits per share. 2012 2011 Net profit (in thousands of pesos) attributable to the stockholders $ 364,918 $ 209,643 Shares (in thousands of shares): Average weighted outstanding shares 637,329 609,342 Basic profit per share $ 0.57 $ 0.34 26. Related party balances and transactions Other compensation and benefits Total compensation paid by the Entity to directors and the principal officers for the period ended on December 31, 2012 and 2011 was approximately $109 and $108 million pesos, respectively. That includes compensation determined at a stockholders’ meeting for discharging their duties in that period, as well as salaries and wages. The Entity constantly reviews salaries, bonuses and other compensation plans so as to offer its personnel competitive remuneration conditions. 117 Compensation plans for retaining executive talent Deferred compensation programs were implemented in 2003 in order to bring the interests of the Issuing Entity’s executives in line with those of the stockholders and make it more likely that they will remain with the Entity. Bond plans were implemented in 2003 and 2004, which have now been settled. Subsequently, a stock option plan was established in 2005, which concluded on December 31, 2009. It consisted of providing the executives the right to receive the surplus (difference) on certain shares determined between the price of the shares at the outset of the plan and the exercise price of the option (market value) payable in cash (Note 24 a). 27. Commitments and contingent liabilities Commitments: a) The Entity rents certain equipment and the facilities housing its stores and distribution centers under leasing agreements for specific periods (see Note 13). The estimation for future minimum operating lease payments for the facilities housing the different Alsea trademarks is shown below: Year Amount 2013 $ 1,049,809 2014 983,604 2015 921,575 2016 863,458 2017 $ 809,006 b. The Entity has a number of commitments pertaining to the agreements established in the contracts for trademarks acquired. c. During the normal course of operations, the Entity acquires commitments under production material supply contracts which in certain cases establish conventional penalties in the event of noncompliance. Contingent liabilities: At the date of the financial statement, Alsea is involved in no judicial, administrative or arbitration procedures that could affect the Entity or its subsidiaries. 28. Financial information per segment The Entity is divided into three large operating divisions, i.e., food and beverages in Mexico, food and beverages in LATAM and distribution services, all run by the same management. The Food and Beverage segments in which we participate in Mexico and Latin America (LATAM) are defined as follows: Fast food: The features of this segment are as follows: i) fixed and restricted menu, ii) food for immediate consumption, iii) strict control of individual portions for each ingredient and finished product, iv) individual wrapping, among others. This type of segment has easy access and can therefore penetrate any location. 118 Coffee shops: Specialized outlets principally selling coffee. The principal difference is the quality service together with a competitive price; the image/environment is focused on attracting all types of customers. Casual dining: This is a segment of service restaurants at which an order is taken, aside from take-out service and home delivery service, offering quality service together with a competitive price; the image/environment is focused on attracting all types of customers. This segment includes fast food establishments and gourmet restaurants. The principal features of casual dining restaurants are i) easy access, ii) informal dress code, iii) casual environment, iv) modernity, v) simple décor, vi) high-quality service and vii) accessible prices. Alcoholic beverages are generally sold at those establishments. Fast casual dining: This is a combination of the fast food and casual dining segments: The distribution and production segment is defined as follows: Distribuidora e Importadora Alsea, S.A. de C.V (DIA). Specializes in the purchase, importation, transportation, storage and distribution throughout Mexico of frozen, refrigerated and try food products to supply all Domino’s Pizza, Burger King, Starbucks, Chilis Grill & Bar and P.F. Chang’s China Bistro, Pei Wei e Italianni´s establishments in Mexico. Additionally, DIA handles the preparation and distribution of pizza dough for the entire Domino’s Pizza system in Mexico. Panadería y Alimentos para Food Service, S.A. de C.V. produces sandwiches and bread to supply Starbucks and other Alsea trademarks. The business model contemplates the central plant located in Lerma, where pastries, bread and sandwiches are prepared. The definition of the operating segments is based on the financial information provided to the General Management, and is reported on the same basis used internally by each operating segment. Performance at the different operating segments is evaluated on the same basis. The information pertaining to segments for the year ended on December 31, 2012 and 2011 is as follows: (Figures in millions of pesos) 119 Figures in millions of pesos at December 31, 2012 Food and Distribution and Beverage LATAM Production Division Division Division Eliminations Consolidated 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 Income From third parties $ 8,752 $ 7,084 $ 3,416 $ 2,402 $ 1,332 $ 1,166 $ 19 $ 18 $ 13,519 $ 10,669 Intersegment 2,701 2,230 (2,701) (2,230) Income 8,752 7,084 3,416 2,402 4,033 3,396 (2,682) (2,212) 13,519 10,669 Costs 2,957 2,372 1,129 809 3,383 2,824 (2,697) (2,217) 4,772 3,788 Operating costs and expenses 4,488 3,872 2,074 1,394 588 541 7 (40) 7,157 5,766 Depreciation and amortization 558 478 168 130 35 22 33 31 794 661 Interest paid 122 72 28 17 9 12 85 51 244 152 Interest earned (76) (49) (6) (3) (1) 36 33 (46) (20) Other financial expenses 13 (19) 2 34 26 (58) (20) (9) (13) 59 4 24 14 43 37 63 64 189 119 Equity in associates 13 9 13 9 Income taxes 182 79 49 31 (8) (9) (4) 6 219 107 Segment income 508 279 (15) 33 (8) (19) (84) (56) Other components of income 37 27 Majority net profit $ 364 210 Assets: $ 8,496 $ 7,332 $ 1,274 $ 1,148 $ 1,533 $ 1,347 $ (2,538) $ (1,679) $ 8,765 $ 8,148 Investment in productive assets (Investment in associates) 40 30 40 30 (Investment in fixed and 608 568 277 428 34 203 47 (3) 966 1,196 intangible assets) Total assets $ 9,104 $ 7,900 $ 1,591 $ 1,606 $ 1,567 $ 1,550 $ (2,491) $ (1,682) $ 9,771 $ 9,374 Total liabilities $ 5,070 $ 3,481 $ 1,137 $ 1,138 $ 960 $ 891 $ (2,198) $ 571 $ 4,969 $ 6,081 120 29.

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities • Fair value of financial instruments recorded at amortized cost The Entity’s principal financial instruments are valued at amortized cost, as they generally consist of accounts receivable and liabilities at amortized cost. With the exception of debt and debt instruments, the Entity’s management considers that the book value of said financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair value, given their nature and the fact that they are short term. The fair value of the debt at December 31, 2012 is estimated to be approximately $2,753 million pesos. The fair value of the debt and debt instruments at December 31, 2011 is estimated to be approximately $3,591 and $1,147 million pesos, respectively. • Valuation techniques and assumptions applied in determining fair value The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is determined as follows: • The fair value of financial assets and liabilities with standard terms and conditions and negotiated in liquid asset markets is determined on the basis of prices quoted in the market. • The fair value of other assets and liabilities is determined as per models for the determination of generally accepted prices, which are based on the analysis of discounted cash flow. Fair value hierarchy: The Entity classifies valuations at fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position on three levels of hierarchy, in accordance with the data used for the valuation. When a valuation uses data from different levels, the overall valuation is classified on the lowest level for classification of any relevant figure. • Level I fair value valuations are those derived from prices quoted (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 fair value valuations are those derived from indicators other than quoted prices included in Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and 122 • Level 3 fair value valuations are those derived from valuation techniques that include indicators for assets and liabilities not based on observable market information (non-observable indicators).

Financial risk policies and managementSignificant accounting policies The details of significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including recognition criteria, bases for valuation and bases for recognition of income and disbursements) for each type of financial asset, financial liability and capital instrument are disclosed in Note 3. Categories of financial instruments The principal categories of financial instruments are: Transition 2012 2011 date Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 932,594 $ 739,379 $ 640,203 Accounts and other receivables: Customers – less estimation for doubtful accounts 339,481 219,350 207,224 Value added tax and other recoverable taxes 272,254 243,736 218,037 Other accounts receivable 196,450 166,228 39,482 Short-term guarantee deposits 2,262,800 Long-term guarantee deposits 110,020 86,991 78,168 Transition 2012 2011 date Financial liabilities At amortized cost: Long-term debt 2,474,480 3,063,000 897,524 Debt instruments 993,531 694,834 Accounts payable to suppliers 1,129,612 1,021,424 710,548 Other accounts payable 175,637 67,068 25,042 For negotiation Derivative financial instruments 8,365 (3,391) The objectives of financial risk management Alsea is principally exposed to the following financial risks: (i) market (foreign currency and interest rate), (ii) credit and (iii) liquidity. The Entity seeks to minimize the potential negative effects of the aforementioned risks on its financial performance by applying different strategies. The first involves securing risk coverage through derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are negotiated only with entities with recognized solvency, and limits have been established for each entity. It is the policy of the Entity not to conduct operations with derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 124 Market risk The Entity is exposed to market risks arising from variations in exchange and interest rates. Variations in exchange and interest rates may arise as a result of changes in domestic and international economic conditions, tax and monetary policies, market liquidity, political events and natural catastrophes and disasters, among others. Exchange fluctuations and the devaluation or depreciation of local currency in the countries in which Alsea participates could limit the Entity’s capacity to convert local currency to dollars or other foreign currency, thus affecting its operations, operating results and financial position. The Entity currently has a risk management policy aimed at mitigating present and future risks involving those variables, which arise mainly from the purchase of inventories, payments in foreign currency and the bank and stock exchange debt contracted at a floating rate. The contracting of derivative financial instruments is intended to cover or mitigate a primary position representing some type of identified or associated risk for the Entity. Instruments used are merely for economic coverage purposes, not for speculation or negotiation. The types of derivative financial instruments approved by the Entity for the purpose of mitigating exchange fluctuation and interest rate risks are as follows: USD/MXN exchange-rate forwards contracts USD/MXN exchange-rate options Interest Rate Swaps Cross-Currency Swaps Given the variety of possible derivative financial instruments for covering the risks identified by the Entity, the Director of Corporate Finance is authorized to select said instruments and determine how they are to be operated. Exchange risk management USD coverage and the respective requirements are determined on the basis of cash flow budgeted by the Entity, and are in line with the current risk management policy approved by the Business Practices Committee, General Management and the Director of Administration and Finance. The policy is monitored by the Director of Internal Audit. The exchange risk denominated in foreign currency (USD) is monitored internally on a weekly basis based on unexpired positions or coverage at the market exchange rate. In all cases, the table for calculation or valuation of derivative financial instruments is the table specified in the master contract. The internal review is intended to spot significant variations in exchange rates that could give rise to a risk or result in some type of noncompliance by the Entity. In the event that a significant and representative risk position is encountered, it is reported to the Director of Corporate Finances by the Corporate Treasury Manager. The following table contains quantitative details of the exchange risk exposure based on USD/MXN foreign currency forwards and options contracts entered into by the Entity and in effect at December 31, 2012. 125 Value of the underlying Notional amount/ asset/reference Nominal amount Fair value Type of variable (USD) (USD) derivative, Purpose Maturities security or of the Current Previous Current Previous Current Previous (USD) contract Position coverage quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter 13.1 12.85 Forwards Long Economic USD/MXN USD/MXN 18,250 18,500 $ 19 $ 251 $ 18,250 13.1 12.85 Options Long Economic USD/MXN USD/MXN 26,500 43,500 $ (63) $ 332 $ 26,500 Note 29 shows foreign currency positions at December 31, 2012 and 2011 and January 1, 2011. It also shows the exchange rates in effect on those dates and transactions for the year ended on December 31, 2011. As concerns the sensitivity analysis, because the fair value of the derivative financial instrument (DFI) position at December 31, 2012 and 2011 is not material, any change in the risk factors pertaining to the interest rate or the peso/dollar exchange rate would not significantly impact their fair value. On that basis, Entity management concluded that the payment capacity and liquidity for handling obligations contracted are not affected and show no significant impact. Likewise, as mentioned, DFIs used by the Entity are intended to mitigate USD interest rate and exchange rate risks. Any devaluation/revaluation of the peso against the dollar, which represents management’s evaluation of a possible reasonable change in the parity of those currencies, would result in an increase/decrease in income and stockholders’ equity of approximately $55 and $25 million pesos for the years ended on December 31, 2012 and 2011, considering that not all foreign currency financial instruments are covered by derivative financial instruments. The sensitivity analysis is determined on the basis of the US dollar financial instrument position at December 31, 2012 and 2011 and may not be representative of the exchange risk during the period due to variations in the net position in that currency. Interest rate risk management The Entity faces certain exposure to the volatility of interest rates as a result of contracting bank and stock exchange debt at fixed and variable interest rates. The respective risks are monitored and evaluated monthly on the basis of: Cash flow requirements A budget review Observation of the market and interest rate trends in the local market and in the countries in which Alsea operates (Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Colombia). Differences between negative and positive market rates The aforementioned evaluation is intended to mitigate the Entity’s risk concerning debt subject to floating rates or indicators, to streamline the respective price and to determine the most advisable mix of fixed and variable rates. At the date of the consolidated financial statements, the Entity has an interest rate swap at variable and fixed interest rates amounting to a total of $400 million pesos, maturing in May 2014. In addition to the plain vanilla IT, two interest rate options have been contracted, known as a knockout swap and a limited swap, each for a notional amount of $150 million pesos, both applied to a bank loan expiring in 2016. 126 According to the swap contract, the Entity agrees to exchange the difference between the fixed and floating interest rates calculated on the agreed notional amounts of capital, which makes it possible to reduce, mitigate and control the exchange risk on interest rates on the fair value of debt issued at a fixed interest rate and exposures to the risk of cash flow on debt issued at a variable interest rate. The following table contains quantitative details of the exchange risk exposure based on forwards and options contracts entered into by the Entity and in effect at December 31, 2012. Value of the Type of underlying asset Notional amount Fair value derivative, Purpose reference variable Nominal amount (USD) (USD) Maturities security or of the Current Previous Current TPrevious Current TPrevious (USD) contract Position coverage quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter Interest Rate 4.84 4.81 Swap Long Economic TIIE 28 d TIIE d 30,888 31,008 $ 151 $ 167 30,888 Knock Out 4.84 4.81 swap Long Economic TIIE 28 d TIIE d 11,583 11,628 $ (48) $ (173) 11,583 Limited 4.84 4.81 Swap Long Economic TIIE 28 d TIIE d 11,583 11,628 $ (70) $ 150 11,583 The Corporate Treasury Manager is responsible for monitoring and reporting to the Director of Administration and Finance any significant event or contingency that could affect the coverage, liquidity, maturities, etc. of the DFIs. The Director of Administration and Finance reports any such situation to the Alsea General Director if the identified risks could materialize. Note 15 and 16 contain details of loans from financial institutions and the issuance of debt instruments, respectively, at December 31, 2012 and 2011 and January 1, 2011. Credit risk management In order to minimize the credit risk associated with the counterparty, Entity contracts its financial instruments with institutions both in Mexico and abroad authorized to engage in that type of operation. As concerns derivative financial instruments, a standard contract approved by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. is signed, as well as standard confirmation forms for each operation. Bilateral guarantee contracts are also signed with the counterparty, which specify policies on margins, collateral and the credit lines to be granted. Those contracts, usually known as Credit Support Annexes, establish the credit limits granted to the Entity by financial institutions, which apply in the event of negative scenarios or fluctuations that affect the fair value of the open positions in derivative financial instruments. Those contracts establish margin calls in the event that credit line limits are exceeded. In addition to the Credit Support Annexes (CSA) attached to the master contract, the Entity monitors the positive or negative fair value on a monthly basis. If a significant positive result arises, a credit default swap (CDS) can be contracted to lower the risk of noncompliance by any of the counterparties. It is the policy of the Entity to monitor the volume of operations contracted with each of those institutions in order to avoid margin calls and mitigate the credit risk with counterparties. 127 The Entity’s maximum credit risk arises from the book value of financial assets, which amount to $1,845,897 at December 31, 2012. Liquidity risk The Entity’s principal source of liquidity is cash generated by operations. The Director of Finance holds final responsibility for liquidity management, for which purpose, policies have been established for control of and follow-up on working capital, which makes it possible to manage short, medium and long-term financing requirements. Periodic cash flow projections are prepared in order to manage the risk and ensure adequate reserves, credit lines are contracted and investments are planned. Notes 15, 16 and 17 provide the details of the financing contracted by the Entity and the respective maturities. The following table shows contractual maturities of the Entity’s financial liabilities. The table is based on undiscounted flows based on the first date on which payment can be demanded of the Entity, and includes payments of principal and interest. Less than Over 1 year and Over 3 years December 31, 2012 a year less than 3 and less than 5 Total Loans from financial institutions $ 496,553 $ 1,395,753 $ 860,763 $ 2,753,069 Accounts payable to suppliers 1,129,612 1,129,612 Other accounts payable 175,637 175,637 Total $ 1,801,802 $ 1,395,753 $ 860,763 $ 4,058,318 Less than Over 1 year and Over 3 years December 31, 2012 a year less than 3 and less than 5 Total Loans from financial institutions $ 510,113 $ 1,346,175 $ 1,735,168 $ 3,591,456 Debt instruments 61,592 1,085,400 1,146,992 Accounts payable to suppliers 1,021,424 1,021,424 Other accounts payable 67,068 67,068 Total $ 1,660,197 $ 2,431,575 $ 1,735,168 $ 5,826,940 Less than Over 1 year and Over 3 years January 1, 2011 a year less than 3 and less than 5 Total Loans from financial institutions $ 284,993 $ 336,243 $ 442,993 $ 1,064,229 Debt instruments 50,535 757,199 807,734 Accounts payable to suppliers 710,548 710,548 Other accounts payable 25,042 25,042 Total $ 1,071,118 $ 1,093,442 $ 442,993 $ 2,607,553 128 Management of capital The main purpose of managing capital is to ensure that the Entity maintains strong credit ratings and healthy capital ratios in support of its business and to ensure maximum value for the stockholders. The Entity manages is capital structure and makes any necessary adjustments required by changes in economic conditions. With a view to maintaining and adjusting its capital structure, the Entity may modify dividend payments, reimburse capital or issue new shares. In the periods ended on December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no modifications to the objectives, policies or processes pertaining to capital management. The following ratio is used by the Entity and by different rating agencies and banks to measure credit risk. Net debt to EBITDA = Net debt/EBITDA Itm At December 31, 2012 and 2011, and at January 1, 2011, the financial restrictions established in the Entity’s loan agreements are as follows: the Net debt to EBITDA ratio for the last twelve months was slightly under 1.0 times, 2.6 times and 0.96 times. 32. Explanation of the transition to IFRS In January 2009, the National Banking and Securities Commission (NBSC) amended the respective regulations to require certain entities disclosing financial information to the public through the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) (including the Entity) to prepare and disclose their financial information on the basis of the IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). On that basis, on January 1, 2012, the Entity adopted the accounting framework established in the IFRS for preparing its consolidated financial statements in order to comply with the provisions of the NBSC. Following is a description of the principal changes in accounting policies resulting from the initial adoption of the IFRS. The Entity’s consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2012 and for the year ended on that date will be the first annual consolidated financial statements that comply with IFRS. The period ended on December 31, 2011 is the comparative period, and the transition date was January 1, 2011. The Entity applied the significant obligatory exemptions and certain optional exemptions for retrospective application of the IFRS. The following reconciliations show quantification of the effects of transition and the impact on stockholders’ equity at the transition date (January 1, 2011) and at December 31, 2011 and on the comprehensive net profit for the transition period (January 1, 2011) and at December 31, 2011: 129 I) Equity a) Reconciliation of stockholders’ equity at January 1, 2011 (date of transition to the IFRS) Figures under MFRS Adjustments and Equity Nota at January 1, 2011 reclassifications Figures per IFRS Capital stock $ 527,657 $ (165,577) $ 362,080 Premium on share subscription i 1,241,208 (154,793) 1,086,415 Legal reserve i 92,108 (6,057) 86,051 Retained earnings ii, iii 636,262 309,459 945,721 Effects of conversion v (23,340) 23,340 Reserve for repurchase of shares i 391,433 (27,600) 363,833 Total capital attributable to the owners of the controlling 2,865,328 (21,228) 2,844,100 company Non-controlling interest 245,641 (471) 245,170 Total stockholders’ equity $ 3,110,969 $ (21,699) $ 3,089,270 Reconciliation of stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2011 Adjustments and Figures under MFRS reclassifications Equity at January 1, 2011 (Note 32(III)) Figures per IFRS Capital stock $ 528,038 $ (165,577) $ 362,461 Premium on share subscription 1,246,840 (154,793) 1,092,047 Legal reserve 99,667 (6,056) 93,611 Financial instrument valuation 9,166 9,166 Retained earnings 712,460 312,696 1,025,156 Effects of conversion 4,244 23,340 27,584 Reserve for repurchase of shares 411,503 (27,600) 383,903 Total capital attributable to the owners 3,011,918 (17,990) 2,993,928 of the controlling company Non-controlling interest 299,274 (471) 298,803 Total stockholders’ equity $ 3,311,192 $ (18,461) $ 3,292,731 130 II) Comprehensive income Reconciliation of net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 Net consolidated income per MFRS $ 233,523 Financial instrument valuation 9,166 Conversion of foreign operations 27,584 Comprehensive consolidated income per MFRS 270,273 Cancellation of the liability at the end of the period 3,238 Comprehensive income under IFRS at December 31, 2011 $ 273,511 III The different items included in the aforementioned reconciliations are explained below: i) Capital stock Under MFRS, capital stock accounts, the premium on share subscription, the legal reserve, the reserve for the repurchase of shares and retained earnings were restated up to December 31, 2007 on the basis of National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) factors. Under the IFRS, the effects of inflation are recognized only in hyperinflationary economies, that is to say, when the inflation rate accrued over a three-year period approximate or exceeds 100%. The most recent three-year period in which Mexico showed those figures was from 1996 to 1998. Therefore, the effects of inflation recognized after that date under capital stock, the capital reserve, the reserve for the repurchase of own shares and retained earnings were eliminated; the net effect was $533,768. ii) Deferred taxes The adjustment corresponds to the recalculation of deferred taxes, principally the adjustments resulting from adoption of IFRS, which affected the book value of assets and liabilities. The overall net effect on deferred taxes was $9,299 and $6,436 at the transition date and at December 31, 2011, respectively. iii) Employee benefits The differences in labor obligations between MFRS and the IFRS arise principally as concerns the valuation for adjustments in actuarial assumptions. Under IFRS, the benefits from termination of employment are recognized only if the company can demonstrate its commitment to terminate employment by means of a detailed dismissal plan as per NIC 19 Employee Benefits. Therefore, the termination liability recognized on the basis of MFRS was eliminated for IFRS purposes at the transition date. The amount eliminated was $9,686. iv) Reclassification of debt instrument issuance expenses The cost of issuing debt instruments was reclassified to the respective long-term debt. Adjustments at the transition date and at December 31, 2011 totaled $9,685 and $14,311, respectively. v) Effects of conversion Under IFRS, an entity adopting IFRS for the first time is not required to comply with the requirements concerning accrued conversion differences existing at the transition date. However, when applying that exemption, the Entity must not consider the accumulated conversion differences recognized under MFRS and may not consider those differences when 131 determining the gain or loss on the subsequent disposal of any business abroad. At the transition date, the accumulated result of converting foreign currency was ($24,757), which was canceled against retained earnings. The Entity considers that it has no material adjustments in the consolidated statements of cash flows, which is why no such reconciliation is presented. Exceptions and exemptions in adopting IFRS IFRS 1 now in force, provides certain exceptions and exemptions from the general requirement to apply IFRS retrospectively to the transition date. IFRS 1 establishes four obligatory exceptions and fourteen optional exemptions for not applying IFRS retrospectively in the consolidated statements of financial position at the transition date. Alsea is applying the obligatory exceptions pertaining to 1) determination of estimations at the transition date, 2) prospective application, as from that date, of the regulatory requirements of International Accounting Standards (IAS) 27, Consolidated and Individual Financial Statements, applicable to the non-controlling interest, 3) an entity need not provide a list of coverages of a type that does not comply with the coverage conditions specified in IAS 39 and 4) prospective application of the disposal in books of financial assets and liabilities. Optional exemptions applicable to Alsea are: Fair value or revaluationUnder IFRS 1, on the transition date, the Entity may opt to measure property, plant and equipment at fair value, and use that fair value as the attributed cost at that date. An entity adopting IFRS for the first time may opt to use the revaluation method as per its previous accounting principles for store equipment, leasehold improvements, real property and intangibles, either at the transition date or some previous date, as the attributed cost at the revaluation date, if it was substantially comparable at that date. • At fair value, or • At cost or at depreciated cost as per IFRS, adjusted to reflect, for example, changes in the general or specific price index. Alsea has decided that its attributed cost at the date of transition is to be the revalued depreciated cost of its store equipment, leasehold improvements and real property, determined as per MFRS at December 31, 2010 (which includes the effects of inflation up to December 31, 2007 and current pesos for movements as from that date). Business combinationsAn entity adopting IFRS for the first time may opt not to apply IFRS 3, Business Combinations, retroactively to business combinations carried out in the past (prior to the transition date to IFRS). Alsea has decided that their consolidated financial statements will show business combinations up to the transition date as they were recognized under MFRS, i.e., by the purchase method, including acquisitions in stages. All acquisitions made as from the transition date, which is January 1, 2011, are recognized in accordance with IFRS 3, which among other things, makes it necessary to: • Specify that the item acquired qualifies as a business • Specify the acquiring party • Determine the acquisition date • Recognize identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and the non-controlled interest in the wired entity. • Value the price • Recognize goodwill acquired or a profit on the purchase, after certain considerations. 132 Accumulated conversion effects of foreign entities IAS 21, Effects of Variations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, requires the Entity to: • Recognize certain differences of the effects of conversion in comprehensive income and include them in a separate stockhol ders’ equity component and • Reclassify the accumulated conversion difference arising from the disposal of a business abroad (including, if applicable, the results of the respective coverage) from stockholders’ equity to income as part of the profit or loss arising from the disposal. However, an entity adopting IFRS for the first time need not comply with this requirement as concerns accumulated conversion differences existing at the transition date. If an entity adopting IFRS for the first time makes use of this exemption: • Accumulated conversion differences for all businesses located abroad are considered to be nil on the transition date and • The profit or loss on the subsequent disposal of any business abroad must exclude any conversion differences arising prior to the transition to IFRS and must include conversion differences arising subsequent to that date. Alsea applied that exemption in their consolidated financial statements at the transition date, and therefore reclassified the accumulated effect of conversion of foreign entities as per MFRS to retained earnings. As from January 1, 2011, Alsea determined the effects of conversion in accordance with IAS 21. 33. New accounting standards The entity has not applied the following new and revised IFRS, which have been analyzed but not yet implemented: IFRS 9, Financial Instruments3 IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements 1 IFRS 11, Joint Agreements 1 IFRS 12, Information to be disclosed concerning equity in other entities 1 IFRS 13, Measurement of Fair Value 1 Modifications to IFRS 7, Disclosures– Compensation for financial assets and liabilities 1 Modifications to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7, Effective date for IFRS 9 and Transition Disclosures3 Modifications to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12, Consolidated financial statements, Joint Agreements and Disclosures Concerning Equity in Other Entities: Transition guidelines IAS 19 (revised in 2011), Employee benefits 1 IAS 27 (revised in 2011), Individual Financial Statements 1 IAS 28 (revised in 2011), Investments in Associates and Joint Agreements 1 Modifications to IAS 32, Disclosures Compensation for Financial Assets and Liabilities 2 Modifications to IFRS, Annual improvements to IFRS 2009-2011 cycle, except for modifications to IAS 1 1 Effective for annual periods beginning as from January 1, 2013. 2 Effective for annual periods beginning as from January 1, 2014. 3 Effective for annual periods beginning as from January 1, 2015. 34.
