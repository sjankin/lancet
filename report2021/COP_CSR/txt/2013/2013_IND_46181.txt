Our Commitment to UN Global Compact “Communication on Progress” November, 2013 Communication on Progress Introduction Tata International Limited has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2002. We are committed to the ten principles of the Compact which foster better corporate responsibility in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. This Communication on Progress provides an insight into our recent activities in support of the Global Compact’s objectives. Statement of Continued Support As a member of the Tata group we follow the principles of corporate governance and a code of ethics (called the Tata Code of Conduct) very similar to the Global Compact. This Code of conduct is signed by all our employees and has been shared with our suppliers and customers. It is also translated into local Indian languages as relevant as well as in Mandarin Chinese and Portuguese in the relevant geographies. The triple bottom line – economic, environmental and social is today a prerequisite with stakeholders across the globe. Fortunately, Tata International, being a part of the Tata Group, whose values since the 1860s have mandated that no achievement in financial terms is worthwhile unless it improves the quality of life of the people and meets national aspirations, have always believed in it. In order to meet the national objective of earning foreign exchange, Tata International was incorporated as a trading house in 1962. Today, as an international trading and distribution company dealing in metals, minerals, distribution, agro and leather products it serves this same purpose in countries as wide apart as Cambodia and Brazil, by contributing to their foreign exchange earnings. Similarly, in response to a government request to develop the then backward areas of the country our leather manufacturing facility was set up in Dewas, in Madhya Pradesh, today it is the global hub for our leather business, and Tata International is India’s largest exporter of leather and leather products. We are pleased that we continue to receive encouraging external feedback on our environment initiatives at our leather manufacturing facility at Dewas which was recognized by the Ministry of Environment & Forest, Government of India with the ‘National Award for Prevention of Pollution’ and the ‘Rajiv Gandhi Environmental Award for Clean Technology’, by the Council of Leather Exports for being the first leather manufacturing facility in India to have ISO 14001 certification, and by TERI with Corporate Environmental Award. At the leather factory in Dewas our patented technology for gainful utilization of solid waste through biomethanation and our research and development efforts for chrome-free leathers are world class. The Leather Complex at Dewas has been awarded Eco-Labelling License by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) (now termed as Corporate Sustainability CS) programs we undertake address the Human Development Goals and we measure our CSR process using the Tata Index for Sustainable Human Development, which has been developed by the Tata Council for Community Initiatives, Tata Quality Management Services and the UNDP. We are also signatories to the India Business Alliance to Stop TB catalyzed by the Global Health Initiative of the World Economic Forum. We have undertaken an initiative in 2006 to create women self help groups in the Kancheepuram district who will cater to our leather products factories. During 2007, we as a part of the TATA Group initiative have supported Affirmative Action to support the economically disadvantaged sections of society. Since 2007, we have commenced a new initiative for training economically disadvantaged women from Dewas village (near our Leather Manufacturing Unit) in the footwear manufacturing skills and also provided then employment opportunities in our Ladies Footwear Plant. Today we have over 1000 women working in our state of the art ladies footwear plant. Some promising women have been sponsored by the Company for higher learning and training at Taiwan during April/May,2009. Effective , 1st April,2010 , the Leather Footwear and Leather Garments businesses of the Company located at Dewas and Chennai have received SA 8000 accreditation from TUV Nord initially valid for 3 years and now renewed for a further period of 3 years, effective 1st April, 2013. The Company has put in place a Social Accountability Policy and Affirmative Action Policy and practices positive discrimination. During 2012-13, the Company has trained rural artisans under the Government of India’s ‘Support the Artisan’ initiatives. The Company has facilitated setting up about women self-help groups with emphasis on supporting women artisans in shoe making. UN Global Compact – Communication on Progress – November, 2013 Our strategy recognizes sustainable development as a means for achieving long term growth, while keeping in mind that we hold our business in trust for our stakeholders and this planet in trust for future generations. We also recognize that we still have a long way to go and we invite any individual or organization to share their views with us. So that, in so doing we can learn from each other. Ajay M.
