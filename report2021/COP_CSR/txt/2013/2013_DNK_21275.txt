Responsibility 2012 Reporting on progress GRI and UN Global Compact Preface from the CEO Responsibility 2012 /2 The world is facing serious resource and climate challenges. The global population is expected to increase by more than 2 billion by 2050 and the global middle class is expected to increase by approximately 3 billion. With more people on the planet and a rapidly expanding consumer middle class, global resources and ecosystems are put under strain. Global energy consumption has already more than tripled since 1950 This development is supported by an ambition to make DONG Stakeholder dialogue and it will continue to grow. The same is expected for the amount of Energy’s operations even safer and healthier. With a record-low injury DONG Energy is fully committed to support and be guided by the CO2 in the atmosphere. If we are to cope with these pressures, we frequency (LTIF) of 3.6 in 2012, we have a lower injury frequency than UN Global Compact’s ten principles, and we continue to seek dialogue need to utilise our resources better and generate much more of our the average for industrial companies, but we want to improve further. with our stakeholders on our most important social issues. As an energy from renewable sources. Our target is to have an LTIF below 2.5 by 2016 and below 1.5 by 2020. example, in 2012 we invited NGOs to participate in a round-table discussion about DONG Energy’s activities, with topics including In the world of energy, the fundamental challenge we face is to Well on track future flexible energy demand and sustainable biomass.

This will make us less dependent on fossil of coal in heat and electricity generation, we have already reduced fuels and much more efficient in the way we consume energy. our CO2 emissions by 31% compared with 2006. We hope that the way we work and the responses and solutions we develop can contribute to a more sustainable global energy system. Leading the energy transformation In 2012, on the back of a record-low injury frequency, we adopted a DONG Energy wants to be among the leaders of the energy transnew safety strategy with a new set of initiatives to be implemented in Henrik Poulsen formation.

Electricity generators must therefore buy the allowances needed to cover their emissions. Each year, external assurance providers verify emissions. Based on actual emissions for Danish plants, a corresponding number of allowances and/or credits is returned DONG Energy is making dedicated efforts to reduce its CO2 emissions per kWh to the Danish Energy Authority in March of the following year. Allowances are generated. This means that it will need fewer allowances. To ensure that actual allocated each year in February for that year.

In 2012, we improved our overall energy efficiency by 0.5% compared increasing demand for energy. This calls for intelligent production, supply and use. with 2010. DONG Energy wants to supply reliable energy that is greener while reducing its own consumption. DONG Energy’s energy consumption depends very much on its activity level, which in most cases depends on the level of production or pipeline transportation Increasing global demand for energy and diminishing availability of fossil energy of energy products. The higher our production, the higher our energy consumption. resources, coupled with climate change, call for a transformation of the energy Therefore, both energy savings and energy efficiency are continuous areas of supply sector. DONG Energy on its own cannot ensure that global energy supply improvement. undergoes the necessary change in the years ahead to limit climate change. But with initiatives such as our 85/15 plan for reducing CO2 emissions and our energy In 2011 and 2012, we focused on finding energy-saving projects or finding solutions efficiency strategy we hope to help show the way. that require less energy. In 2012, we improved our energy efficiency by reducing the need and thus also the energy consumption for desulphurisation pumps. In 2012, Increasing energy efficiency we also lowered oil pipe pressure and modified kettle and circulation pumps in our From a climate perspective, the cleanest energy is energy that is not produced at gas distribution, both of which have increased our energy efficiency. all. DONG Energy therefore believes that increasing energy efficiency is just as important in curbing climate change as changing energy supply. To that end, DONG Measures in administration buildings have also led to a large reduction in our Energy works both internally and with customers, for example through our climate kWh consumption per m2 of office capacity since 2010. Activities in 2012 included partnerships, to increase energy efficiency. introducing sensor control of lighting in buildings and offices. Among other things, we also optimised our use of electricity in data centres and reduced energy DONG Energy considers energy efficiency to be a good business case and a good consumption for circulation pumps. way of demonstrating responsible behaviour. Furthermore, it is a way to increase the value and diminish the vulnerability of our business in the light of rising energy Reductions in CO2 emissions prices. Increased energy efficiency also helps cut dependence on fossil fuels. The reduction in DONG Energy’s CO2 emission per generated energy unit (electricity and heat) is a result of efforts to provide cleaner and reliable energy. Each year, DONG Energy will prioritise and continuously improve energy efficiency at its the environmental performance of our generation capacity improves as we move offices and facilities to contribute to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases while towards more CO2-efficient generation (see EN16/EN20 on air emissions for more supporting financially sound operations. details on the target for CO2 efficiency in generation). Each process is optimised so that it uses less energy relative to the level of activity. In the EU, energy use in buildings accounts for 40% of total energy use. Although DONG Energy’s use of energy in buildings is less significant, we need to optimise and continuously improve the intensity of our energy use. Environmental indicators Responsibility 2012 /35 Indicator EN6 Energy-efficient or renewable energy-based products and The lower total energy savings in 2012 compared with 2011 reflected the fact that, services in 2012, we came to the end of a contract period (2010-2012) during which we had more than reached our goals for energy savings – we actually overperformed and DONG Energy has an extensive investment programme to increase the share of therefore scaled down energy saving efforts.

Greenhouse gases As an energy company, emission of greenhouse gases is an important action area for 24,053 DONG Energy. The figure below shows that direct CO2 emissions constitute the largest percentage of DONG Energy’s greenhouse gas emissions by far. Direct CO2 emissions Carbon dioxide (CO2), direct emission Nitrous oxide (N2O) are made up of both CO2 emissions from facilities that are subject to the European CO2 Carbon dioxide (CO2), indirect emission Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) and CO2 emissions from other process facilities, of Methane (CH4) Carbon monooxide (CO) which EU ETS CO2 emissions represent 99%. Indirect CO2 emissions only include CO2 NMVOC emissions from electricity and heat consumption. Indirect emissions do not include emissions from electricity and heat consumption at the electricity and heat-generating stations, as these emissions are considered to be direct emissions.

Venting process materials and packaging materials used to manufacture the company’s does not include natural gas emitted to the atmosphere through pipes opened in products. connection with maintenance work etc., because such venting is deemed to be negligible. The GRI distinction between direct and indirect material consumption, according to which direct consumption is defined as the use of materials that are part of the final Total consumption of fossil raw materials is calculated as the sum of coal, oil and product, is not applied, as this would not make sense in relation to DONG Energy’s natural gas consumption based on energy content. products. DONG Energy distinguishes between the consumption of raw materials, Compilation method overview Responsibility 2012 /80 EN1/EN2/ For oil and gas production, the consumption of raw materials is calculated either as Energy consumption EN3/EN4 the fired volumes of natural gas, the amount of diesel oil supplied to a platform or DONG Energy buys, sells and generates primary energy. DONG Energy’s total direct Continued the volume of natural gas flaring measured ultrasonically. energy consumption equals the energy purchased and generated less the amount of energy sold. DONG Energy primarily uses direct energy for generating electricity For power stations, consumption is, as a rule, determined as incinerated volume. and heat. The consumption of direct energy therefore depends on consumer demand Some facilities calculate biomass and waste as materials supplied to the plant. The for electricity and heat. The interesting aspect in relation to direct energy consumpcalculation principles for the power stations that account for most of the materials tion is the ratio between renewable and fossil energy sources and thus the focus on consumed have been approved by the Danish tax authorities. more sustainable energy consumption. The amount of renewable energy sources is calculated as the share of fuels burned The volume of fossil energy sources is calculated as the consumption of coal, oil at power stations that are considered to be CO2-neutral. This includes biomass and and natural gas, excluding consumption relating to transportation. waste that are considered to be CO2-neutral under the Danish CO2 Allowances Act. The volume of renewable energy sources is calculated as the share of fuels burned For gas distribution, the consumption of natural gas is calculated based on meter at power stations that are considered to be CO2-neutral. This includes biomass and readings. Gas flaring volumes are calculated based on pressure and dimension of waste that are considered to be CO2-neutral under the Danish CO2 Allowances Act. the emptied process plant. For consumption related to administration and other processes, DONG Energy calculates direct consumption on the basis of settlements. The consumption of energy (electricity and heat) at power stations is calculated based on technical readings. Consumption of associated process materials is not calculated, as it is not currently possible to determine the consumption of chemicals at Group level. The volumes of The consumption of electricity for electricity distribution is calculated based on the associated process materials are therefore not included in the Group’s overall Danish public meter reading system, Elvis, at the facilities where meters have been reporting of responsibility data. installed. For meter and regulator stations in the gas distribution network, a rough estimate is provided. Recycled input materials DONG Energy classifies domestic and industrial waste used as fuel at waste For the remainder of DONG Energy, direct consumption is calculated based on incineration plants as recycled input materials. Waste incinerated at waste settlements. incineration plants is recycled material that replaces other raw materials in the generation of electricity and heat. Waste incineration generates energy that has DONG Energy’s indirect energy consumption is calculated as electricity and heat first priority in the grid and as such it replaces the potential consumption of other consumption in administration buildings, at pumping stations, gas installations, sources of energy, such as coal, oil and gas. This is normally called waste recovery. etc., i.e. electricity consumption purchased from the grid. Therefore, DONG Energy considers waste recovery as the most significant contribution in terms of reporting on the GRI indicator. The purpose of the GRI indicator is Indirect electricity and heat consumption entails usage of primary energy sources, to show the extent to which the enterprise seeks to avoid the use of virgin natural including renewable sources. Consumption is translated into usage of these sources resources. The level of recycling at DONG Energy has been calculated on the basis based on knowledge of the composition of the electricity and heat sources in the of the consumption of raw materials and not the total consumption of materials regions in which DONG Energy operates. The translation into primary sources is only (raw materials and chemicals). carried out for administration and facilities that do not generate electricity and heat, as the resource usage for electricity and heat generation is included in the direct The volume of recycled raw materials has been calculated as total waste in relation consumption of raw materials. to total consumption of raw materials by weight. Compilation method overview Responsibility 2012 /81 EN1/EN2/ In the preparation of a breakdown of electricity consumption in Denmark by used. This applies, for instance, to locations that use ‘Wind Power’ (‘Vindstrøm’), EN3/EN4 primary energy source, the electricity declaration for Denmark from Energinet.dk is which is generated exclusively from wind energy. Continued used. As Energinet.dk’s declaration for 2012 was not available in time for inclusion in this reporting, the declaration from 2011 has been applied. The same ‘displaceThe breakdown by primary energy source for heat consumption and electricity ment’ also applies to previous years. If there is a specific composition of electricity consumption outside Denmark is based on 2007 statistics from the International supply sources for a location, a specific declaration suitable for that location is Energy Agency (IEA). EN5/EN18 Energy savings and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions The target comprises facilities and buildings that are either operated by DONG Energy or more than 50%-owned by DONG Energy. It includes activities such as DONG Energy measures energy efficiency as the consumption of energy relative electricity and heat generation, gas treatment and storage, electricity and gas to the activity performed, i.e. production, energy flow or, in case of buildings, the distribution and facility management. Leased buildings and buildings in which 1% building capacity at each facility. It is this relative measure that we want to improve or less of DONG Energy total number of employees work are not included. Power by 10% for DONG Energy overall by 2015 compared with 2010. stations sold since 2010, international power stations, waste incineration plants, peak-load stations, facilities with few or no operational hours are not included Energy consumption is also calculated relative to the activity performed. The either. performance indicator is energy use at a given time divided by the relevant activity measure (e.g. oil flow). The improvement in energy efficiency is then calculated as For power stations, own electricity consumption and non-boiler related process the improvement in the indicator at a given time compared with the indicator for losses are included in the calculation of energy consumption. For all other facilities, 2010 and weighted across sites and business units against the energy consumption the calculation includes all significant energy consumption. for 2010. EN8/EN21 Water consumption and water discharges For DONG Energy’s onshore facilities and administration, groundwater consumption is measured based on whether the withdrawal is direct (from own source) or For most locations, water consumption and wastewater discharge are reported indirect (from waterworks), as this total reflects the impact on drinking water based on meter readings and calculations. For offshore operations, water for resources. Other forms of water consumption, such as cooling water and rainwater, consumption is loaded directly at the docks. This consumption is not measured. are not reported, as they are considered to have less significant environmental For facilities, wastewater discharges are recorded based on meter readings or, where impacts. wastewater is removed by road tanker, based on invoices. For offices and warehouses, wastewater discharges are deemed to be equivalent to water consumption. Compilation method overview Responsibility 2012 /82 EN16/EN20 Air emissions (‘Vindstrøm’), which is generated exclusively from wind energy and is therefore considered to have no CO2 emission. CO2 emissions that are not subject to emissions allowances, methane (CH4), other volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), NOx and SO2 emissions from processes at For locations outside Denmark, country-specific emission factors from the IEA’s offshore oil and gas production installations, electricity and gas distribution, etc, report on CO2 emissions from fuel consumption 2009 have been used. are determined using emissions factors from the National Environmental Research Institute in Denmark (DMU) for stationary sources. Data are based on the consumpFor power stations, a number of significant emissions of trace elements and metals tion of natural gas and oil products. Emissions of other greenhouse gases besides are calculated using a model developed by DONG Energy. CO2 are calculated for power stations, using National Environmental Research Institute in Denmark (DMU) standard factors. SF6 gas used in the electricity distribution network is calculated on filling as discharged emissions. CO2 emissions from electricity and heat consumption are reported separately from direct emissions as indirect CO2 emissions. Fugitive emissions from, for example, coal bunkers, are not included, as such emissions are considered to be less significant. According to the IPCC guidelines for For Danish locations, CO2 emissions from electricity and heat consumption are National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, fugitive emissions of methane from stocks of determined using Energinet.dk’s electricity declaration for Denmark and the Danish coal should be included in the country in which the mining takes place. Therefore, Energy Agency’s standard factor for emissions from heat respectively. As both they are not relevant to DONG Energy, as the company’s activities do not include reports for 2012 were not available in time for inclusion in this reporting, the reports mining. However, fugitive emissions of methane and NMVOC from oil tanks at from 2011 have been applied. The same ‘displacement’ applies to previous years. If Fredericia crude oil terminal are included, as DONG Energy regards these emissions there is a specific electricity composition for a location, the specific declaration for as significant. that location is used. This applies to, for example, locations that use ‘Wind Power’ LA1 Workforce by employment type, employment contract, The category ‘supervised workers’ is not used in Denmark. Furthermore, the term is and region not defined by GRI. The category is therefore not included in the indicator. All own employees are included in LA1, except for CT Offshore A/S employees, corresponding to 176 FTE. The CT Offshore A/S employees are included in total FTE in DONG Energy’s Annual Report 2012, which explains the difference between reported FTEs in this report and the Annual Report 2012. LA7 Rates of occupational injuries and absenteeism ‘Days’ refers to calendar days. The lost day count begins the day after the injury has happened. Injuries are recorded and reported using a corporate procedure based on guidelines from the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers, OGP.
