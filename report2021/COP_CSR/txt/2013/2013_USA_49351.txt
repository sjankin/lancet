This, our second annual COP report, replaces the previous report submitted in November 2012. The United Nations Global Compact is the largest voluntary initiative in the world which unites corporations and other organizations in support of a set of principles which underpin the responsibility of companies to behave in a way which protects people, society and communities and the environment, and their accountability to all. In supporting these principles, we commit to ensuring our business activities are conducted in accordance with these principles and in a way which advances awareness and adherence around the world. The Ten Principles of the Global Compact are: Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. Principle 2: Businesses should make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. Principle 4: Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor. Principle 5: Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labor. Principle 6: Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.

Internally, this Communication on Progress is available on the company's global intranet site for all employees and is communicated to them through different channels. Global Reporting Initiative Guidelines version 4 (GRI G4) Furthermore, this report is presented in accordance with the core principles of the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. This is our first report prepared using the G4 Guidelines. Please see the GRI Index on page 2 of this report. Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 5 __________________________________________ As this is our first reporting initiative in accordance with the G4 GRI Core Guidelines, we have elected not to seek external assurance at this time. We believe an external assessment and subsequent assurance will be most meaningful after baseline criteria have been established and year-over-year improvements (or degradations) can be measured and reported. Engaging Stakeholders The telecommunications industry has been a champion of sustainability initiatives for many years, including the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). As a key supplier to this industry, we are a recipient of numerous external stakeholder requests for information via our customers’ supply chain expectations and reporting initiatives. Our customers and their stakeholders have communicated various expectations in the areas of environmental responsibility, human rights advocacy, labor law compliance, and prevention of corruption. We have incorporated those expectations in preparing this report. Boundaries and Scope Limitations This report covers Comverse, Inc., including all its wholly-owned subsidiaries worldwide. There are no limitations as to scope or functions or operations included in the assessment.

Comverse's products and services are used by more than 450 wireless, wireline and cable network Communications Service Provider customers in more than 125 countries, including the majority of the world's 100 largest wireless network operators.

Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 11 __________________________________________ We are proud to be considered an innovator in our field and a leader in our market with over 450 customers worldwide. Through our customers, Comverse's technology reaches over 750 million people in developed and emerging markets, enabling each of them the opportunity to participate in the telecommunications revolution, and transform the way they connect and communicate. We lead the market in voicemail, SMS and MMS technologies, the most commonly used low-cost methods of real-time communication that allow people to connect and share experiences. Our customers are the leading Communications Service Providers in the world. By utilizing a range of advanced communications technology options, Comverse's products allow our customers to offer products and services tailored to the needs and financial capabilities of their end-users, and to provide both cost and energy-efficient services. Making Communications Technology Affordable and Accessible Everyone wants to connect! Everyone wants to be part of our new fast and interactive community around the world. Both in developed countries, where communications infrastructures are highly developed, and in emerging markets, where urbanization and the growth of a new middle class have heightened the need for rapid infrastructure development, the tipping point of communications technologies has been reached. Our customers, major Communications Service Providers, are facing vast growth opportunities which we can help them realize. However, in a recessionary Western world and bottom-of-the-pyramid emerging economies, where disposable income is inadequate or unstable, new creative solutions must be found to make communications technology available at an affordable price and in consumer-friendly packages. This is the competitive edge that communications providers seek. Comverse's Prepaid Billing provides a solution. Prepaid Billing enables providers to offer communications services paid for in advance to consumers that require no financial collateral, as well as offering Western consumers an opportunity to limit usage of communications services to a pre-defined level, prevent surprise charges and allow them control over what they, their families, or employees spend. Prepaid Billing removes financial risks for the service provider and for the consumer, while expanding availability at an affordable price to millions of consumers. The Convergence Revolution – the Ultimate Smart Solution A key contribution of Comverse to the communications and connectivity landscape is our expertise in the development of convergence solutions which enable Communications Service Providers to migrate multiple communications services into a single network and offer endusers a more efficient, integrated, compatible and lower-cost service, with many different benefits. Specifically this involves convergence of previously distinct services such as prepaid and postpaid voice, messaging and mobile Internet in tailored bundles with converged billing. Our technology enables Communications Service Providers to take their platforms forward by gradually moving from old technologies (telephony) to new ones (IP), while enabling smooth communications between the old and the new. Comverse installs new products on top of old ones, without replacing the whole system, but providing incremental improvements, saving customers significant investment in large scale preparation and enabling more rapid market presences and expansion. Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 12 __________________________________________ Convergence enables Communications Service Providers to integrate technologies in order to optimize loading on broadband networks for best energy-efficiency. At the same time, convergence enables end-users to utilize broadband-based technologies in a more efficient manner, with choices that best fit their needs and result in less waste and burden on broadband infrastructures. This means that, overall, not only do converged solutions provide greater choice, lower cost and more extensive connectivity options for end-users, they also decrease the environmental impact of communications services, making convergence the ultimate in smarter business delivering smarter impacts. In June 2012, the prominent telecommunications market research firm Infonetics Research named Comverse as the global leader in the convergent charging segment. This #1 ranking reflects the migration of existing customers to convergence, as well as new projects in several regions. The Comverse ONE convergence solution is being leveraged around the world to meet the diverse needs of a broad range of Communications Service Providers, from supporting full business transformation to entry into new businesses, such as MVNO/MVNE, M2M, cloud-based services and beyond. For more information, see www.infonetics.com MVNO: Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) is a mobile operator that does not own its own wireless network infrastructure. Instead, MVNO's have business arrangements with traditional mobile operators to buy minutes of use (MOU) for sale to their own customers. MVNE: Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (MVNE) is a company that provides services to Mobile Virtual Network Operators to enable provision of mobile network services. M2M: Machine-to-machine (M2M) refers to technologies that enable automated wired or wireless communication between mechanical or electronic devices. M2M allows networked machines to exchange information and perform actions without the manual assistance of humans. Cloud-based services: The use of computing resources (hardware and software) that are delivered as a service over a network (typically the Internet), eliminating the need to own local servers. A Top Priority – Customer Satisfaction Comverse strives to provide flawless customer service and ensure that customer needs are met in a way which enables them to compete effectively in dynamic and rapidly changing market conditions. Comverse believes that the cornerstone of customer satisfaction and the key to its commitment to deliver added value to customers is uninterrupted service availability. Thus, Comverse is committed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to helping its customers meet the challenge of total availability through its Global Services BU. In order to understand and ensure customer satisfaction, we perform two kinds of Customer Feedback Surveys:  Ongoing Survey: post-service surveys conducted online or by phone, to gain real-time insight from customers.  Annual Survey: includes all active customers and all areas of service, conducted online and in some cases, in meetings. Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 13 __________________________________________ Results from these surveys help managers define opportunities to improve our service. A Smarter Way of Life – our Approach to Quality Comverse is focused on total quality performance as a core activity for successful long-term customer relationships. We develop and maintain organizational focus on quality, performance excellence, and customer satisfaction. Guided by a globally accountable Quality Department, Quality Managers at Comverse are embedded within each business unit and support all the quality aspects of products and services from development stage to implementation. The Quality Department is also responsible for educating all employees about the importance of quality in all processes. Quality Management System: Comverse operates in accordance with a defined Quality Management System (QMS) which encompasses: “Marketing, design, development, production, delivery, installation, and service of solutions for telecommunications providers, including hardware and software developed by our product divisions.” The purpose of the QMS is to ensure that we consistently provide products that meet our customers' needs as well as applicable regulatory requirements. Our aim is to enhance customer satisfaction through the effective application of the system, including processes for continuous improvement. The QMS includes several components:  Quality Management System (QMS), which is compliant with ISO 9001:2008, ensures that customer expectations and commitments about products and services are consistently met and exceeded, and company goals are achieved.  Information Security Management System (InfoSec MS), which is compliant with ISO 27001:2005, protects information from a wide range of threats to ensure business continuity, minimize business damage, and maximize return on investment.  Environmental Management System (EMS), which is compliant with ISO 14001:2004, ensures that the company continually minimizes its effect on the environment and that environmental goals are achieved.  Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS), which is compliant with OHSAS 18001:2007, ensures safeguarding of health and safety of employees, customers, and the public. A comprehensive Quality Manual describes these quality subsystems and their compliance with the relevant international standard requirements. Cost of Quality Program: As part of an initiative to reduce operational costs and improve quality, we initiated our Cost of Quality Program in 2011. The program was led by the Global Quality Team, using the VAS Division as a first area of focus, mapping all quality aspects of the entire VAS global operations in order to identify opportunities to improve quality. Following the initial study, results and conclusions relating to the cost of quality were identified, and several changes were implemented as a result, including:  Improved decision-gateway mechanism, including higher management approval requirements.  Enhanced handover between R&D and Delivery, to improve quality, time, and cost.  Improved team communication, with several units reporting directly to the Product Manager.

Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 15 __________________________________________ Comverse commits to conducting its business in a way that is respectful of human rights. We are guided by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose principles are embedded in our global Code of Conduct and include guidance with regard to labor relations, employment practices, relationships with suppliers, and business conduct. We aim to engage with the communities in the areas in which we operate, targeting to support them in advancing their quality of life and ensuring respect for their rights. Human Rights and Labor Policy Our Human Rights and Labor Policy refers to our conduct within our operations and to our responsibility for protecting human rights throughout our supply chain. The policy covers four main areas: Our People: Our first priority is the health and safety of our people no matter where in the world they work. We apply employee health, safety, and emergency preparedness standards that meet or exceed regulatory requirements. Our Customers: Comverse is mindful of doing business with customers who are also respectful of human rights. We have high standards for how we conduct our business to ensure interactions with all customers are based on ethics and integrity. Our Supply Chain and Distribution Channels: The productivity of our business model is increasingly dependent on working with external partners and suppliers. As globalization increases, our ability to compete more effectively in the marketplace adds a heightened responsibility to ensure that third parties act on behalf of Comverse in a manner consistent with our human rights ideals, respect for the environment and ethical business practices. Our Communities: Corporate citizenship and human rights extend into the communities where Comverse people work and live and where our brand is represented. We respect laws, labor practices, and customers in the countries in which we operate and ensure alignment with our high standards, policies and Code of Conduct. We strive to be a positive influence in communities, demonstrating that respect for human rights fosters successful businesses and successful people. We ensure our compliance with this policy through periodic operation-wide risk management reviews, internal audits and supplier assessments. For our full Human Rights and Labor policy, see: www.comverse.com/corporate_responsibility Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 16 __________________________________________ Code of Business Conduct Expectations for Suppliers and Other Third Party Business Partners In order to help ensure that we are not complicit in human rights abuses throughout our supply chain, we have deployed a Code of Business Conduct Expectations for Suppliers and Other Third Party Business Partners in which we outline our expectations for ethical behavior and legal compliance of all those with whom we do business. The Expectations specifically refer to legal compliance and decency standards with regard to working conditions, working environment and workplace conduct. The Code references Comverse's general I ACT @ Comverse and other leading standards as follows:  I ACT @ Comverse (www.comverse.com/corporate_responsibility)  Global e-Sustainability Initiative (www.gesi.org)  International Labor Standards (www.ilo.org)  United Nations Global Compact Principles (www.unglobalcompact.org) For our full Code of Business Conduct Expectations for Suppliers and Other Third Party Business Partners, see: www.comverse.com/supply_chain_responsibility Safety Standards at Suppliers: We also demand that our suppliers demonstrate compliance with safety standards and include a contract provision requiring suppliers to maintain an EH&S management system. We conduct periodic audits at selected suppliers to ensure implementation of EH&S standards. Responsible Sourcing: In 2013, we adopted a comprehensive policy to build upon the existing practices we had relative to various environmental and human rights initiatives that affect our role in the information technology supply chain. Our policy addresses proper disposition of electronic waste, restricting the use of hazardous substances, and ensuring that materials are not obtained in a way that violates human rights. We are committed to source conflict-free minerals and require our suppliers to present documentation certifying that minerals are from a conflict-free source. Comverse does not engage with suppliers who cannot provide such certification. Supply Chain Data Transparency In 2013, Comverse transitioned to EcoVadis– a web-based electronic tracking system for environment, labor, health, safety and ethics-related practices – in response to customer requirements. The system requires ongoing input of all relevant data, and it collates scores to form a scorecard which identifies high to low risk issues. Our scores for 2013 are as follows: 2013 Rating CSR Category (out of 100) Primary Opportunities for Improvement Environment 60  No endorsement of GRI Principles  EHS certification, actions and metrics are not global Labor Practices 60  No endorsement of GRI Principles  OHSAS certification, actions and metrics are not global Fair Business 60  No endorsement of GRI Principles Practices  Lack of supporting documentation for business ethics metrics Suppliers 50  No monitoring on % of suppliers covered by sustainable procurement measures (e.g. assessments, audits) Overall 58 “Silver” recognition status on EcoVadis rating scale Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 17 __________________________________________ Engaging in our Communities to Advance Human Rights We believe that our involvement in local communities creates benefits for our employees, our business and a more equitable society in the communities in which we operate. Around the world, Comverse country offices make donations and advance locally-relevant community activities with employee volunteers, for example, organizing fundraising events and participating in different activities to advance social causes and offer disaster relief. Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 18 __________________________________________ Making Our Work Environment Nicer Special Enhancement Activities From Around the World La Défense, France – Serious Fun on EHS Day The La Défense employees took EHS Day (Environment, Health & Safety) to heart, following up the documentary film with intensive discussions about topics including “There Is No Planet B” and “Green Is the New Black.” India – Birthday Bash More than 100 employees got together in the India office cafeteria to celebrate and enjoy a birthday bash for the Q2 birthday celebrations. One highlight of the activities included “Mummy Wrap,” a game in which the “birthday babies of the quarter” had one minute had to roll their partners with kitchen paper. Whoever did the best was the winner (winners were awarded gift vouchers). The games were followed by a delicious lunch including the famous Indian chaat (Indian snacks). Music, laughter and food contributed to a fun atmosphere in which everybody had a good time. India – Diwali Celebrations Diwali, popularly known as the festival of lights, is a national holiday in India. The India team celebrated the ‘Diwali’ festival in November with lots of decoration in the office. One of the ways that employees got into the holiday spirit was by dressing in traditional Indian attire. The best-dressed gentlemen and ladies were awarded shopping vouchers. The day featured the Puja ceremony, done by Pankaj Lamba, Site Leader for India, and this was followed by a sumptuous Indian lunch. Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 19 __________________________________________ India – Mumbai Outing The Annual Mumbai team outing was an action-packed day with a variety of games and activities – including water park sports and cricket. The Annual Family Picnic is a much awaited event for the Mumbai Team. This year, the office headed out to the outskirts of Mumbai, Khandala, always a beautiful location, but especially so this year. It was lush green and scenic, due to the timing of rainy season. The day started with spirited singing in the bus while on the way to the resort at Khandala. Upon arrival, breakfast was arranged and was followed by a cricket match. After cricket, it was time to hit the swimming facilities and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the water activities. Malaysia – Breezy Fun The Malaysia team had great fun on their recent team kite-flying outing. The excursion took place at the popular and scenic Morib Beach. The day was sunny and windy – perfect beach and kite weather. The concept of the trip was to fly dragon kites at the Beach shore. The entire team had lots of fun flying the kites and playing Frisbee. Picnic lunch was packed for all, which gave everyone a chance to take a break, catch their breath – and get ready for another burst of activity. Singapore – Recycling with a GRIN The Singapore office launched a recycling program with a GRIN – followed by a fun education session and a healthy salad lunch. GRIN (Grow your Recycling Incentives Now) is an organization that encourages environmental sensitivity, rewarding households and communities based on the amount of recyclables collected. GRIN points earned for every kg of recyclables earns points can be redeemed online for privileges and gifts. A GRIN representative, along with an adorable live dummy, educated employees about the program and the necessity of going GREEN. Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 20 __________________________________________ Japan – Extending a Warm Welcome The Japan office had a special team get together in to give a warm welcome to the new employees there. The happening took place at the renowned Pizza Salvatore – the authentic Neapolitan pizzeria – a trendy and spacious restaurant in Tokyo. The event provided an excellent opportunity for the new beginners to get acquainted with the team, and everyone had a great time! Japan – Aid in the Wake of the Earthquake/ Tsunami The Japan office also scheduled a volunteer activity in Sendai in the Tohoku area, which was affected by the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan last year. The Comverse team harvested buckwheat. The area was originally a rice paddy, but the post-tsunami soil, damaged by sea salt, can now only support buckwheat. As harvesting buckwheat is significantly more strenuous than working at a computer keyboard, the team accomplished much – and was exhausted after a few hours. After the activity, they toured the area, examining some of the damaged houses still needing repair, and realized that there is much that can be done in future activities in the area. Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 21 __________________________________________ Israel – Kid Invasion As the summer vacation reached its end, the Tel Aviv campus was invaded by the joyful presence of dozens of employees’ children. The children watched movies in the auditorium, which was converted into a real cinema theater, replete with popcorn, ice cream and other treats. In addition, parents and kids could finish some necessary shopping in the backto-school fair that was held throughout the day. It was a lovely day, full of smiles – we hope the same could be said for the first day of school that came after it. Israel – Coming of Age Bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah are coming of age rituals; when Jewish girls become 12 (boys 13), they become full-fledged responsible members of the Jewish community, accountable for their actions. Eighty-five children and their parents (Comverse employees) participated in the successful “Bar and Bat Mitzvah 2012”event, which included building rafts and sailing on the Sea of Galilee, a Jeep ride up the Arbel mountain for a spectacular view (including a sudden rain and massive rainbow), and dinner at a special ancient cave. Mazal tov! Israel – Building and Reaping On October 14, 2012, more than 150 Tel Aviv employees took part in activities to benefit others. About 100 volunteers from the Global Operations Unit renovated a disused building at the Renanim Boarding School and created a magnificent garden, giving the children who live there an attractive, warm club in which to spend some of their leisure time. On the same day, 50 employees from the Finance Group worked hard harvesting agricultural products as part of the gleaning initiative of “Leket Israel” (the country's National Food Bank ), with the produce going to the benefit of the poor. Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 22 __________________________________________ Australia – Christmas in July Fun was augmented with elements of mystery and surprise at the Winter and Autumn Birthday celebrations in the Sydney office. One recent Friday afternoon the team got together to celebrate the season’s birthdays (for employees with birthdays in June, July & August). The theme of the event was “Christmas in July”. The venue was decorated secretly to surprise all the employees. The boardroom was festooned with red and green decorations and tinsel while Christmas music played in background. Australia – Starlight, Star Bright, I Wish I May… The Starlight Children's Foundation brightens the lives of seriously ill and hospitalized children, and their families, throughout Australia. While health professionals focus on treating the illness, Starlight is there to lift the spirits of the children, giving them opportunities to laugh, play and be a child again. A team of 20 employees from Comverse Australia packed 200 craft packs to donate to the Starlight Foundation for the children sick with cancer in hospitals. Each pack is individually portioned to make it easy for “Captain Starlight” to hand out on ward rounds so that they can be utilized for enjoyment at the child’s bedside. Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 23 __________________________________________ Diversity Lunch in Wakefield We had a great diversity lunch in Wakefield. Folks brought food from all around the world and we raised $300 for the Jimmy Fund in the process. Mt. Laurel – Sea Cruise At the tail end of the summer before the cold weather set in, the Mt. Laurel office set off on a sea cruise on the impressive “Spirit of Philadelphia” vessel. Not only did participants enjoy spectacular maritime views of the river, of ships, and of the city from an unusual riverside angle, but there was also music, dancing, food and a variety of additional special activities. We were relieved to learn that nobody had to walk the plank and everyone returned home safely.

Philippe Tartavull President and Chief Executive Officer Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 30 __________________________________________ Our Environmentally Impacts Energy Consumption Our energy consumption is primarily electricity which is purchased from local national grid providers for powering our office operations, and fuel for travel and logistics. As a result of our consistent efforts to improve our energy footprint, we have reduced our electricity consumption per employee by 5% due to awareness activities. Tel Aviv, Israel Activities which have contributed to our improved energy performance include:  Setting office lighting, air conditioning and electronic equipment to switch off automatically when idle, or at pre-set times.  Adding motion-sensor lighting in parking areas outside office hours.  Increasing server visualization that reduces server energy requirements.  Replacing equipment with more energy-efficient alternatives. Mt. Laurel, USA Our office center at Mt Laurel, in which we have 270 employees, is one of the largest Comverse centers outside of Israel. This location is an example of a successful local effort to reduce electricity consumption, including installing automatic shutoff systems for lighting, air conditioning and other electrical appliances. These efforts contributed to a continue reduction in office electricity consumption. Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 31 __________________________________________ Wakefield (Boston), USA Comverse headquarters in Wakefield is a major site in the U.S., where we have 250 employees. Due to contract and infrastructure reasons we could not actually assess our electricity consumption. In the past two years we have succeeded to arrange all needed information in order to have a separated electricity meter and to actually assess our consumption. The following graph show Wakefield site consumption in previous year divided per Sqm. (information is in KWh). Environment—Energy Consumption For the sake of our environment we have initiated an energy conservation and usage awareness campaign that also promotes personal fitness. These posters are visible throughout our major sites worldwide. Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 32 __________________________________________ Water Consumption In June 2011 Comverse Tel-Aviv provided reduced lunch in a dining room located in Tel-Aviv office. Due to the full catering service water consumption has raised per employee. Waste Management Our main labs site is in Israel. Our waste is from our production facilities. All our waste goes to recycling or re-use and includes mixed electronic waste, plastic, cardboard, aluminum and wood. In 2012 we recycled 54 tons of waste. In addition, in our offices worldwide we have paper, plastic bottles, cans and glass recycling provided by the building management in our lease offices. Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 33 __________________________________________ Environment—Paper Consumption We continue to reduce the volumes of paper we purchase each year, while striving to increase the volume of paper recycled. In 2011, for the first time, we achieved a level of recycling which was higher than the volume of paper purchased, mainly due to use of old stocks from 2011. In 2012 we succeeded to increase recycling while purchasing remain the same. This success is a direct result of a deep environmental approach of our employees. Activities which contributed to our improved paper performance include:  Reduced levels of printing and conversion to double-sided printing for all requirements.  High visibility in our offices, including signs next to trash cans and placement of recycling bins in office locations. Employee Travel We encourage our employees to use low-carbon transportation alternatives to travel to and from work. Most of our offices around the world are situated within easy reach of public transportation and are equipped with showers for those who walk or bike to work. In Israel, we provide a regular shuttle service between the Comverse HQ and three local train stations which is used by around 700 employees. In 2012, we continued to encourage initiatives that will reduce the impact of employees' travel in Israel and in worldwide offices. In 2012 we continued the trend of reducing gasoline consumption in company cars. Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 34 __________________________________________ Our New Green HQ Comverse plans to move its Israel HQ to a new green building at the end of 2014. This move provides an opportunity to design an office that illustrates how energy efficiency can be put into practice. The design includes features such as energy-efficient lighting, smart electricity meters, a recycling center and recycling infrastructure. Comverse believes that workplaces can contribute to reduced impact on climate change. Our aim is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and our activities’ ecological footprint. Sharpening Our Focus on the Environment, Health and Safety Save the Earth – It's the Only Planet with Chocolate The popular refrigerator magnet Save the Earth – It's the Only Planet with Chocolate is a bit whimsical, but it makes a good point: the environment is a very serious topic. The Corporate Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Department has begun to implement major EHS processes globally. In line with the understanding that employee commitment and involvement are essential for a successful EHS implementation, September 2012 saw a strong focus on the environment, health and safety (EHS) at Comverse. Green Is the New Black The first week of September was designated EHS Week globally, with special activities held in ten Comverse offices worldwide: Tel-Aviv, Adelphi/UK, Madrid, La-Defense/France, Caen/France, Lannion/France, Wakefield, Singapore and Gurgaon ND/India. More offices will be added in 2013. Activities focusing employee attention on EHS included emails, stickers (Green Is the New Black and There is No Planet B), activities (environmental film, presentations, Wii games, ergonomic survey, prizes, wearing green), and healthy refreshment (fruits, yogurt, granola – but no chocolate). Improving the Work Environment Providing employees with a bit of fun and thoughtful relaxation at the office was a successful kickoff for ongoing efforts to improve the work environment through safe work conditions, a reduced environmental footprint of our operations and more. A key focus in 2013 is to continue providing safety and environmental management systems to better facilitate business integration of EHS and to demonstrate world-class performance to our stakeholders. To close with the words of a second environmentally conscious refrigerator magnet: Save the World – Someone Else May Want to Use It! Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 35 __________________________________________ Environment, Health and Safety Day at Comverse: EHS day is intended to increase awareness in regards to our environmental responsibilities and our health and safety in the workplace. FRANCE SINGAPORE UNITED KINGDOM ISRAEL Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 36 __________________________________________ Reducing our Carbon Footprint in our Supply Chain As part of our service to our customers, we deliver communications cabinets to locations all over the world. We constantly work to develop solutions for more efficient transportation of this equipment. Communication cabinets are around two meters high, weigh close to one ton, and are typically shipped upright to prevent in-transit damage. We transport more than 700 such cabinets every year and, working with our vendor, identified a horizontal shipment solution that eliminates significant dead space and improves both the cost and environmental efficiency of our transportation. In order to enable horizontal shipment, we developed an innovative method of reinforcing the cabinets so that they would withstand damage in a horizontal position, as well as a suitable method of reverting them to an upright position upon delivery, avoiding any damage. Our unique solution for horizontal transportation enabled double the number of cabinets to be aggregated in one shipment: by improving the engineering of packaging design and reducing the height from 92 cm to 80 cm, six communications cabinets can now be shipped on one pallet, compared to three in a vertical position. This more compact cabinet design also requires less packaging, generating additional environmental benefits. Another benefit of horizontal shipping is that it enables the utilization of different types of wide-body planes, including passenger planes and not just freight aircraft as previously. This allows for more shipping alternatives, reduces the need for special transit flights and unnecessary in-land transport, and saves about 50% in fuel costs and resulting carbon emissions. Currently, Comverse is the only company in the world that transports communications cabinets horizontally, and we have been successful in reducing the volume of our shipments by 60%. Comverse's largest customers now use this solution. Furthermore, in order to optimize performance and reduce costs, we have worked with our vendors to define and deliver specific internal configurations for the blade servers and storage devices to reduce the amount of work in our production line. Another example of increased efficiency is in the area of internal cables. Our cabinets consist of hundreds of communication cables in different types and lengths. We have moved to on-demand production per each unique customer project, which reduces cable inventory and scrap and saves time. Our Environmentally-Friendly Technologies The Role of Broadband in Generating Environmental Benefits As a technology company whose core activity is creating innovative solutions, we place great importance on utilizing the advantages of broadband to enhance our service offering and create more efficient options for our customers, so that they can lower their costs and reduce their own environmental impacts. A broadband network can support higher capacity and traffic volume with reduced equipment requirements. Utilization of this technology lowers expenses for CSPs through more efficient power consumption and lower daily operation and maintenance, providing not only cost benefits but also enabling lower environmental impacts of the services they offer to their customers. Generally, use of broadband networks has a major impact on the way work is done, enabling connectivity while reducing travel needs, printing, transportation and more. Comverse Inc. | Communication on Progress | November 2013 | page 37 __________________________________________ Optimization of Broadband for Greater Energy Efficiency Maximum network utilization enables transferring more data at a higher rate and convergence enables the use of a single network solution for multiple services. Comverse's convergence solutions enable service providers to offer several services, such as prepaid and postpaid voice, messaging, and mobile Internet in a single network and under one bill – saving on costs while providing end-users with convenient communications solutions, and reducing operational costs for the Communications Service Provider. Our Environmentally-Friendly Solutions We provide our customers with efficient, smart communications technologies and systems which offer optimum utilization and lower energy consumption, enabling them to manage and reduce their own environmental impacts. Our solutions include:  Utilizing virtualization and cloud technologies to reduce the size and amount of servers needed, which helps save energy and reduce floor space. In recent years we were able to reduce the average number of communications cabinets that Communications Service Providers need by about 70% (from 80 to 25)  On demand reallocation technology which allocates broadband capacity wherever needed, enabling servers to go into sleep mode or switch off when not in use.  Using new hardware providing more capacity per unit with reduced power consumption. Reducing Waste for our Customers Designing with the environment in mind, we try to ensure that our customers face minimum problems relating to waste at the end-of life of Comverse products or at replacement time. All our components are 100% recyclable so our customers are never left with a waste problem. Furthermore, we commit to taking back Comverse products which are replaced with newer technologies, and ensure they are recycled in an environmentally acceptable manner. Production Process Improvements Our internal lab equipment consumes about 70% of the total power consumption of the Company. Part of our efficiency and energy reduction strategy has been to move many of our applications to external cloud environments where the most energy-efficient and technologically-advanced servers are deployed and the servers are able to be fully utilized in the most efficient manner. We currently run more than 2,000 servers virtually. This, and other process improvements, has enabled us to reduce internal server cabinets by 700, reducing floor space needs and power consumption. Process improvements and prioritized operating protocols have allowed us to manage our servers in a manner that turns them off when not actively engaged. All new equipment requests pass through a qualification review by lab experts that includes specific focus on reduced power consumption alternatives. Finally, we have located and re-located lab equipment in our facilities in a configuration that allows for the most efficient cooling processes.
