Greenhouse gases are namely Carbon dioxide, Methane, Nitrous oxide, Hydroflurocarbons, Perflurocarbons and Sulphur hexafluoride. In order to determine the Carbon Foot Print of Chemanaex PLC, the National Cleaner Production Center was retained to conduct an assessment at the organisation with the objective of measuring the overall carbon footprint including the identification of emissions from each of the sections of the organisation, means of decreasing carbon dioxide emissions and recommending measures through which carbon footprint of the whole organisation could be reduced. Assessment Focus This assessment was mainly focused on production facility of Chemanex PLC with the following being taken into account: zz Production process, zz Transport of raw materials, zz Transport of finished products, zz Transport of materials within the factory premises zz Business related other transport, zz Staff transport zz Electricity, Diesel & LPG consumption and water consumption. Methodology adopted and the conclusion Carbon footprint of greenhouse gases of Chemanex PLC was calculated based on IPCC guidelines. All the baseline data were gathered from company records. Carbon footprint of the factory for 2011/12 was 380 MT of carbon dioxide equivalents, which equates to 0.071 MT of CO2 per MT of Product Manufactured. Electricity usage for the production facility was the main contributor to the GHG emissions being 51% from the total emissions. 47 Chemanex PLC Annual Report 2011/12 Human Capital It is better to invest in an Team Chemanex procedures executed by external The bond between each member of resource personnel in order to increase A person with a B product the Chemanex team, along with their overall knowledge and skill levels.
