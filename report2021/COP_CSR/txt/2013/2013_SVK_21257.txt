In this annual Communication on Progress, we provide description of our actions we took to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. Sincerely yours, Daniel Kollár, CEO of Ceskoslovenská obchodná banka Human Rights  Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights  Principle 2 Make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses Assessment, policy and goals Ceskoslovenska obchodna banka (CSOB) fully respects, supports and has implemented principles underlying universal human rights, including the right to equal opportunity and non-discrimination, the right to the security of persons, the right of employees (including opposition to any forms of compulsory of child labor, the right to a safe and healthy working place, the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining), respect for national sovereignty and obligations with regard to consumer protection and environmental protection.

The issue was adopted by the official KBC Group´s statement on human rights. CSOB specifically defines its respect on human rights in written policies such as KBC Group– wide employee stakeholder policy ( policy applies on Slovak republic), Code of Conduct (generalized document) and Collective Contract (special agreement concluded between the company as an employer and Trade Union of the company). Explicit statement on respecting human rights is included also in the Code of Conduct, generalized document adopted from KBC Group. The Group´s managers monitor compliance with the Code of Conduct and regularly evaluate the individual conduct of staff against group values. Failure to comply with the Code of Conduct can lead to the imposition of sanctions foreseen in the applicable rules, on the basis of which the local working relationship is regulated and will be applied after impartial, sensitive and fair examination. Code of Conduct is based on the group values, and forms the basis for the development of specific codes for specific target groups, Group Compliance Rules, Group Standards, etc. Other important document defying the elimination or interdiction of discrimination is the Collective Contract. CSOB is obliged to ensure equal treatment of all employees regarding their working conditions, including remuneration and other monetary transactions and monetary value, training and opportunity to achieve post or other promotion. The unequal treatment is not a distinction to be determined by the Labor Code or by special legislation or if it is the real reason inherent in the nature of work the employee performs and which is necessary for this exercise. Relating to the labor, prohibited is direct and indirect discrimination on ground of sex, sexual orientation, race or ethnic origin, nationality, national or social origin, gender, language, disability, age, religion or belief, property, marital and family status or political or other opinion, membership and activity in political parties or political movements, trade union or employer organizations; discrimination because of pregnancy or maternity is considered sex discrimination. Discrimination is also considered deal involving incitement, inducement or coercion leading to the induction of discrimination.

The high of percentage depends on the number of employees of a particular company. If company is not able to follow this condition based in law, it should either pay a penalty to the state or have a possibility to use services or buy goods from some sheltered workshops employing handicapped people. CSOB also uses this possibility because CSOB hasn´t been able to employ the exact number of handicapped people, but the company order central security services from the sheltered workshop.

Under a risk-based approach tests on the functioning of these controls are performed. The program then results in structural recommendations or concrete action plans. Follow-up and final reporting is also ensured.
