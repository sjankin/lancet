Each resulted in an action plan that is monitored on a monthly basis by local teams and the Company's quality assurance department. The department focuses on all aspects of quality assurance, and particularly those related to people. The goal of very high customer satisfaction is consistent with the Company's values and is an integral part of its expansion plans. Registration Document 2012 | Essilor 193 4 Social, environmental and societal reporting Social information 4.2 Social information Essilor’s policy seeks to contribute to the personal development and fulfillment of its employees by offering them career opportunities in a global, multi-cultural and decentralized organization; providing a working environment that respects their physical and moral integrity, whatever their origins; treating all employees fairly, in all circumstances; enhancing their employability, inside and outside the organization by facilitating their access to training throughout their career, as well as by increasing their empowerment and responsibilities in order to deepen their experience; and helping them become Company shareholders by implementing a responsible employee stock ownership policy. Essilor’s shareholder structure is a key characteristic of the Group’s social policy. It is not only of benefit to employees but also shareholders by aligning their common interests regarding the Company’s performance and the value created as a result. It brings the Group a particularly positive “affectio societatis” which goes well beyond a simple sense of pride or of belonging. Essilor’s social policies have followed the Group’s international orientation. They were implemented in its early decades by expatriate French executives. They then followed, and continue to follow, the Group’s ongoing globalization thanks to a more comprehensive approach to human resource management generally applied by local executives who are responsible for running operations in their respective countries. 4.2.1 Employment Total workforce and breakdown of employees by gender, age and geographical area As of December 31, 2012, Essilor had 50,668 employees worldwide (including 100% of the workforce of proportionately consolidated companies).

The Group is committed to participating in sustainable development initiatives by helping to protect the environment and promoting recyclable products, and to complying fully with all applicable environmental regulations in all host countries throughout the world. By its very nature, Essilor’s business has only a limited impact on the environment. Nevertheless, a voluntary process has long been in place to accurately determine the environmental impact, however slight, of its activities. Essilor manages several hundred thousand stock-keeping units and its products must be kept immaculately clean throughout the production process. By optimizing the use of natural resources (water and energy, for example) on an ongoing basis, and by keeping premises clean and orderly, the Group’s environmental management systems contribute significantly to plant efficiency. Essilor’s “green revolution” began in the middle of last century with the introduction of the famous ORMA® (ORganic MAterial) lens as a replacement for mineral lenses. This technological breakthrough paved the way to the abandonment of traditional manufacturing methods which consisted of extracting silica, treating it with heavy minerals (potash, soda, metal oxides, etc.) and melting it in high-temperature furnaces. Today this substitution is almost complete in mature markets but requires further encouragement in most emerging markets if the same levels of success are to be achieved. To convince eyeglass wearers of the benefits of this single procedure to the integrity, health and safety of the eye, Essilor is now promoting only the lightest, most resistant and most environmentally-friendly corrective lenses made of thermoset resins or thermoplastics. In this context, the Group is still steadily reducing its energy consumption per corrective lens produced and delivered, and working hard to make even further improvement in this area. 4.3.1 General environmental policy 4 Organization of the Company to take into account ratio of the Environmental Management Systems of the Group’s environmental issues and, where appropriate, upstream production facilities remains at its maximum level of 100% (13/13). processes for environmental assessment or certification In 2012, inspection audits were carried out.

For reasons of quality, the use of this recycle and extent of impact mitigation material is not possible in the manufacture of new lenses. Such materials are used for other products. The objectives and targets regularly defined in the environmental management systems are essentially designed to reduce the environmental impacts, particularly to reduce, recycle and reuse resources as much as possible.

The program has led to solid strategies, especially concerning the development of human capital, relationships and partnerships with customers, and environmental safeguarding. In relation to this, in 2012 the plant in Dijon received the CAP in-house award for the largest reductions in electricity and water consumption over recent years. The Group has initiated permanent measures to reduce, reuse and recycle its packaging materials. All of Essilor’s ranges of ophthalmic lenses are delivered to eye care professionals in cardboard boxes or envelopes made of recycled paper.

In 2012, the first two categories were calculated and translated into tonnes of CO2 equivalent emitted, which are provided under EN17. A second assessment of emissions of CO2 equivalent from tertiary transportation, of the order of a thousand tonnes, was performed in 2012. Its reporting perimeter included measuring flows directly to the end customers of six high-volume global prescription laboratories plus the flows from the last kilometer of prescription laboratories in France and the United States. Emissions related to professional travel recorded for a population group of 1,385, of whom 800 are considered “major travelers,” are also reported in EN17. Because of geographical and infrastructure differences between countries and continents, partial results thus obtained cannot be extrapolated over a broader perimeter with sufficient reliability.
