Human Rights Principles Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; Principle 2: Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses; Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. Overview The Compass Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics underpin our social, ethical and environmental responsibilities as a global organisation and sends a powerful message to all our stakeholders of the Group’s commitment to responsible business practice. The 10 principles of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, to which we are a signatory, are integral to our own Code of Ethics. This UN initiative encourages companies to commit to make human rights, labour standards, environmental responsibility and anti-corruption part of the business agenda, whilst maintaining a competitive advantage. Our structure is underpinned by the highest levels of corporate governance. This empowers our local management teams to manage their businesses to be competitive in their marketplace while operating within a strict corporate framework with clearly defined parameters. Our Code of Ethics sets out our social, ethical and environmental commitment towards each of our stakeholders and the communities in which we operate. Every individual employee shares a responsibility to uphold these standards and to conduct our business in a professional, safe, ethical and responsible manner. Our Code of Ethics, developed in consultation with our European Works Council and the Institute of Business Ethics, sets out the clear standards of behaviour that we expect all of our people to demonstrate in dealing with colleagues and those outside the company such as customers, suppliers, shareholders and external stakeholders. Our Policy (relevant extracts from our published Code of Ethics) http://www.compass-group.com/1124.htm http://www.compass-group.com/cr-code-of-ethics.htm Success in business is dependent on compliance with legal constraints, together with sensitivity to local customs and conventions governing business relationships. The communities in which we operate (and from which we draw our employees) are important to us. Compass Group UNGC COP January 2013 4 We are committed to making a positive contribution to the sustainable development of the communities in which we operate. We take into account the concerns of the wider community – including national and local interests – in all our operations. We use our expertise to contribute to the wellbeing of the community in a manner appropriate to our business objectives. We endeavour to ensure that we are not exploited for the purpose of money laundering, drug trafficking or tax evasion. We support the rights of human beings as set out in the UN Declaration of Human Rights. We consider carefully before doing business in countries that do not adhere to the UN Declaration. We do not make donations to political party funds or candidates. We respect the law, traditions and cultures of the countries in which we operate. However, in some countries where there is limited or no human rights protected by legislation, the higher standards set out in the Group’s Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics will prevail. We are committed to doing our business in a way that limits our impact on the environment. The Group's Environmental Policy and Guidelines include standards on waste reduction and recycling, and the conservation of water and energy. As a service company, our people are key to the success of our business. We respect and value the individuality and diversity that every employee brings to the business and seek to create a positive, open, working environment wherever we operate. We are committed to basing relations with our employees on respect for the dignity of the individual and fair treatment for all. We aim to recruit and promote employees on the basis of their suitability for the job, without discrimination. We aim to foster effective communication to enable all our employees to perform their work effectively and help and encourage employees to develop relevant skills to progress their careers within our organisation. We place the highest priority on the health and safety of our employees and the safety of the environment in which they work. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination or sexual, physical, mental or other harassment of any kind toward our employees, whether from our own staff or others. We operate fair and just remuneration policies that comply with employment regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We require any employee with a potential conflict of interest to disclose it to their line manager. We operate in an environment of trust and as such we do not tolerate any fraudulent or dishonest behaviour by our employees either within the Group or in dealing with other stakeholders. Implementation We have a Group-wide whistle-blowing programme called ‘Speak Up’ which is managed by an independent company. This enables our employees globally to raise, in confidence, any concerns that they may have about how we conduct our business. Work continues throughout our business to maintain employee awareness of ‘Speak Up’ and regular progress reports are provided to the Audit Committee of the Board. In 2011-2012, we had 2,823 calls referred to the ‘Speak Up’ helpline by employees globally. Details of all of the concerns reported to the confidential helpline were passed to the Group’s Internal Audit department. There is a clear escalation process in place to consider each concern raised. Where appropriate, a full investigation and remedial actions were taken. Compass Group UNGC COP January 2013 5 Associated Policies Compass Codes of Business Conduct & Ethics Compass Diversity & Equal Opportunities Policy Compass Purchasing and Supply Chain Policy 2012 Actions We continue to embed our Code of Business Conduct (the ‘Code’), which brings together in one place all relevant Group policies on ethical business practice. The Company remains committed to the highest standards of business conduct and expects all of its employees to act accordingly. The Code, which has been translated into in 40 languages to meet the needs of our businesses, is underpinned by our Code of Ethics and is communicated to our employees through a range of channels including, for example, global and country specific intranets, at induction of new employees and face to face presentations. The Group’s on-line Competition Law and Ethics Toolkits continue to be rolled out across the Group’s businesses and as at 30 November 2012, 85% and 92% of the current populations eligible to complete the online Toolkits have successfully completed the courses. New employees are required to acknowledge that they will comply with the principles of the Code and senior management will continue to self-certify their compliance with the Code and the Group’s Code of Ethics at the end of each financial year. We have also continued with our annual self-certification initiative whereby 1,991 employees were required to self-certify that they have complied with the ‘Code’ and Code of Ethics during the year ended 30 September 2012. To date, 99% of employees have responded versus a 97% response rate in 2011. The Code which incorporates all of the Group’s internal control policies including the Code of Ethics is now available on the Group website at http://www.compass-group.com/cr-code-of-ethics.htm and has been translated into multiple languages. We made good progress in rolling out our updated Compass Supply Chain Standards which include the assessment of potential supply chain partners on their own human rights practices and those of their partners down the supply chain. This updated template is progressively being rolled-out across our countries, with initial emphasis on compliance across our Top Twenty countries which equate to around 93% of total Group revenue. We proactively monitor the Code, to ensure that countries are taking the positive action required to embed it. Monitoring initiatives include: o Internal audit visits to countries to review practices and procedures o Business Review Updates with country Leadership Teams to ensure effective compliance is in place Compass Group UNGC COP January 2013 6 4. Labour Practices Principle 4: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective; Principle 5: Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labour; Principle 6: Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Overview As a service company, our people are key to the success of our business. We respect and value the individuality and diversity that every employee brings to the business and seek to create a positive, open, working environment wherever we operate. We are committed to basing relations with our employees on respect for the dignity of the individual and fair treatment for all. We aim to recruit and promote employees on the basis of their suitability for the job, without discrimination. We aim to foster effective communication to enable all our employees to perform their work effectively. This will include encouraging and helping employees to develop relevant skills to progress their careers. We place the highest priority on the health and safety of our employees and the safety of the environment in which they work. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination or sexual, physical, mental or other harassment of any kind toward our employees, whether from our own staff or others. We operate fair and just remuneration policies that comply with employment regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We require any employee with a potential conflict of interest to disclose it to their line manager. We operate in an environment of trust and as such we do not tolerate any fraudulent or dishonest behaviour by our employees either within the Group or in dealing with other stakeholders. Policies Compass Codes of Business Conduct & Ethics Compass Diversity & Equal Opportunities Policy Compass Purchasing and Supply Chain Policy Compass Group UNGC COP January 2013 7 2012 Actions We are progressively rolling out the Compass Supply Chain Standards, updated in 2011 to include an assessment of our potential supply chain partners’ human rights practices and those of their partners down the supply chain. This updated template is progressively being rolled-out across our countries, with initial emphasis on our Top Twenty countries. Our standard terms and conditions of purchase for international suppliers also contain express provisions dealing with compliance with Compass Group policies which must be met so as to maintain preferred supplier status. The global HR Forum which consists of HR professionals from across the Compass business globally works throughout the year to ensure that our HR policies are reviewed on an annual basis and are updated as required to meet regulatory or best practice requirements. Country operational compliance with such policies is required as part of the People MAP Framework. We continue to make good progress with our employee diversity metric and have increased the proportion of global leadership team positions held by women to 22%. Great examples of our continuing efforts in terms of supporting increasing employee diversity can be viewed online in our 2011 CR Report – www.compassgroup.com/CR112 One such example: Moving up the diversity list Compass Group North America is listed among the Top 100 Largest Employers nationwide of college graduates by Diversity Employers magazine. This year, our business in North America moved up the list to number 28. Looking ahead, they plan to employ over 450 more graduates this year. The Diversity and Inclusion department has a long-standing partnership with Resource Network RN, the internal recruitment team. Together, for well over a decade, they have focused on Compass Group's diversity strategy in North America to develop, attract, retain, and engage a workforce filled with associates from a variety of backgrounds where each individual has the opportunity to shine. They have also implemented a talent acquisition strategy that develops relationships and partnerships with a number of colleges and universities. Compass Group UNGC COP January 2013 8 5. Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Overview A key driver towards our success is the degree of autonomy which is afforded to local management teams, allowing them to serve local markets in the most appropriate manner. To support their activities, we have developed an environmental policy supported by a minimum operating standard and a set of behaviours that are being introduced into all our operations. 2012 represented our fifth year of implementing a web-based reporting tool to consistently track and report globally on our greenhouse gas emissions. We are pleased that our ability to report our environmental performance accurately, including the quality of data, continues to improve and, as a result, we have increased the scope of our reporting countries from our ‘Top Ten’ to our ‘Top Twenty’ countries which account for around 93% of total Group revenue. Although we have made good progress in collating data relating to our own business operations, we are aware that we have more work to do in terms of improving the quality of data provided by our suppliers. To help us build a greater awareness of their activities, we have refreshed our supplier assurance programme to include additional focus on environmental practices within our global supply chain. This refreshed programme is gradually being phased in across our businesses with initial focus on our ‘Top Twenty’ countries. In the majority of our locations where we are not directly responsible for the procurement of utilities, equipment, fuel etc., we are working closely with our clients to consider how best to improve the environmental performance of our operations. Environmental management Policies system – as demonstrated by the drafting of our policies, we are committed to ensuring that Compass Environmental Policy environmental minimum standards are implemented Compass Purchasing & Supply Chain Policy across our business including our supply chain. We review our policies annually to support company compliance and to raise awareness. Compass Group UNGC COP January 2013 9 2012 Actions To help us build a greater awareness of their activities, we have refreshed our supplier assurance programme to include additional focus on environmental practices within our global supply chain. We believe that everyone at Compass has a moral obligation to safeguard each other, our customers and the environment by operating a safe, injury free and healthy workplace, serving food that is always safe to eat, nutritional and which minimises our impact on the environment. In 2007, to ensure best practice, we developed a set of policies, minimum operating standards and behaviours and these have been steadily rolled-out across our businesses. We are pleased to report that in the year to 30 September 2012, the first phase of the programme had been successfully implemented in 99% (2010: 98%) of our countries. Our standards are based on the strictest regulatory requirements and industry best practice. World-class performance continues to be our aim, seeking over the shortto medium-term to set the benchmark for our industry. Great examples of our ongoing efforts to support responsible environmental practices can be viewed online in our 2012 CR Report – www.compass-group.com/CR12. One such example: Reducing food waste Across our business, numerous activities are being developed to raise consumer awareness of food waste, and the long-term effects this is having on the environment. Globally, one third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally, creating unnecessary depletion of available food stocks and increasing our impact on the environment. A great waste reduction example comes from our business in India, which has introduced a weekly Zero Wastage Day. This initiative aims to educate consumers on the amount of food they place on their plate, by monitoring the amount of food they eat versus the amount of food they throw away. Since its introduction, the programme has resulted in an impressive plate/food wastage reduction of 50% Compass Group UNGC COP January 2013 10 6. Bribery and Corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery Policy (extract from Compass Group Code of Ethics) http://www.compass-group.com/cr-code-of-ethics.htm We seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships with all our suppliers, and encourage them to match our high standards in respect of quality, food safety, working conditions, trading practices, health and safety and environmental protection. We treat our suppliers and subcontractors honestly and fairly. No employee may offer or receive – or influence others to offer or receive – any money or material gift that could be construed as a bribe or influence and we have implemented a Group Gifts and Hospitality policy to provide clear guidance to all of our employees and clients on this matter. We endeavour to ensure we are not exploited directly or indirectly by requests to make facilitation payments. All information concerning the Company and its suppliers is to be treated as confidential. We do not work with companies that infringe the law or endanger Compass Group’s reputation. Policies Compass Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics Internal documents: Compass Fraud Policy Group Gifts and Hospitality Policy Group Approvals Manual Compass Accounting Policies and Procedures Manual 2012 Actions Our Code of Business Conduct (the ‘Code’), brings together in one place all relevant Group policies on ethical business practice. The Company remains committed to the highest standards of business conduct and expects all of its employees to act accordingly. The Code is underpinned by our Code of Ethics with regard to minimising the risk of bribery and corruption in our business and contains specific information about Compass’s zero-tolerance approach to corrupt or unethical behaviour or business practices. Compass Group UNGC COP January 2013 11 We conducted our annual review of the Group’s internal control documents such as the Group Approvals Manual, Group Internal Controls Manual, Group Accounting Policies and Procedures Manual and Group Treasury Policies, to further minimise the risk of fraud. The purposes of these documents are to:set out clear levels of delegated authority for specific matters and to highlight those matters which require Group review and approval or notification and to ensure consistently high standards of review and evaluation are adopted and followed across the Group; cover the core internal controls relevant to Group companies as clearly as possible, including the identification of those core internal controls relevant to each level of the business i.e. unit, country, operating company and Group including, for example, dual control and segregation of duties; and provide a framework for banking, borrowing and investment requirements of the Group, so as to maintain the flow of essential finance to operations and for capital investment, in a manner that manages the risk inherent in these activities. We operate a Group Gifts and Hospitality policy, on a global basis. We have further developed a risk assessment to determine the potential level of risk of different parts of our business regarding bribery and corruption to ensure that the appropriate management processes are in place to mitigate any risks identified. Upon induction, all new Compass Group employees are required to read and confirm their adherence to the Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics. Senior employees are also required to certify their adherence to the Code annually thereafter. All Compass Group employees have access to the ‘Speak Up’ helpline, a 24-hour a day, confidential telephone advice line where they can share any concerns that they have. Procedures are in place for any bribery/anti-corruption whistle blowing allegations to be escalated directly to senior management. Compass Group UNGC COP January 2013 12 7.
