Report on Sustainable Development of the 3 LUKOIL Group in 2011–2012 << Address by the President and CEO of LUKOIL >> Vagit Alekperov President and CEO of LUKOIL We continue implementation of all our charity programs, both at production. I am confident that oil reserves will be sufficient for the federal and regional levels. We aim to provide the people living many years to come. The point here is not that we are facing in the regions of our presence as well as their children worthy a revolution, but that we need to implement cutting-edge living conditions. technologies to be able to develop complex fields. This is why we need a system-based framework of market incentives to encourage While producing oil and gas, it is today that we must start thinking high-tech projects in the oil and gas industry. Today, LUKOIL has about the future generations, who will have to live without oil to invest huge money into their development. and gas. Excellence and competition will help us to feel this reality. I also think that all kinds of energy need to be developed just Over the next two decades, we will have to increasingly think like all types of hydrocarbon reserves. We believe that the future and talk about integration for the sake of global energy security. energy sector will be based on brand new technologies supported Supporting competition and reasonable cost-efficiency of the by both conventional and new non-hydrocarbon sources. industry at the domestic level will help Russia to successfully advance to the brand new energy level.

The basis for LUKOIL Group’s gas production is represented By 2021 we plan to increase production of by the reserves of the Bolshekhetskaya Depression (YNAO). hydrocarbons by 44% compared to the level In 2017–2019, we plan to commission three more large of 2011. fields – the Pyakyakhinskoye, Yuzhno-Messoyakhskoye and Khalmerpayutinskoye. Western Siberia still remains the Company’s key resource base accounting for more than a half of proven hydrocarbon reserves The Company has a Master Agreement for strategic partnership and production. A major event in 2012 was the stabilization with Gazprom for 2005–2014 concerning gas supplies from of oil production in this region, including through utilization of the Bolshekhetskaya Depression and the Northern Caspian cutting-edge production technologies (hydrocarbon production fields. Supply volumes may vary depending on commissioning increased by 0.8%). of Bolshekhetskaya Depression fields, as well as on the rate of utilization of Gazprom’s gas transportation system. LUKOIL Group’s strategy includes further growth of production in this region (including due to development of the Pyakyakhinskoye Power Engineering and Imilorskoye fields, Bolshekhetskaya Depression). A major achievement in the reporting period was that the Group obtained Power Engineering business is assigned a major role access to federal subsoil areas – the Imilorskoye, West Imilorskoye in ensuring reliable supplies for both Company’s and Istochnoye fields. LUKOIL became the first ever private in-house facilities and for external consumers of heat company to obtain a permit like that. and electricity in the Southern Federal Okrug of the Russian Federation. Generation is the key business in this segment. The Company will continue increasing hydrocarbon production, We plan to invest significant funds into this business. At the mainly due to operations in the promising regions of legislative level investment return mechanisms were created Timano-Pechora province (oil), in the Northern Caspian Sea for such projects. Such mechanisms are represented by capacity (oil and gas), and in Western Siberia (oil and gas). We plan to supply agreements. ensure production growth through the following: The Company is planning to continue construction of combined • integration into new regions of operations; cycle plants (CCP1).

The difference from steam-power and gas turbine plants is in higher efficiency coefficient. 8 << Energy and Society: strategies and interaction >> Renewable Energy Sources use of TP’s is generation of 3 to 7 kW of heat energy per each kW of electricity consumed. The Company’s strategy includes further development of energy projects based on renewable energy sources (renewables). Filling stations have the best prospects among all other facilities to LUKOIL’s managers are confident that in future Russia is sure install such thermal pumps. Five projects have been implemented to face the challenge of wider use of renewable energy so far. The capacity of the TP’s utilized in such projects is in the conditioned by the need to diversify the energy sector. In view range of 10-30 kW. The results suggest that the use of TP’s offers of that, the Company is already implementing projects based great prospects, and therefore we plan to utilize them in new on renewables both abroad and in Russia, which will help to gain projects at LUKOIL Group’s filling stations and bulk plants. the experience required and train the workforce. The simplest and most effective way of utilization of solar energy is to use solar collectors (SC). In February 2012, We use solar energy OOO LUKOIL-Uralnefteprodukt implemented a project for the use of solar collectors at a filling station in Orenburg. The only In 2009 LUKOIL constructed: one installed solar collector with the surface area of 2.84 sq. m. and 1,500W heating capacity proved to be enough to supply heat • two photovoltaic power plants (PVPP) in Serbia and hot water for the filling station. The filling station’s staff will with the capacity of 4kW each; monitor operation of the heating system on a regular basis. At the same time, now we already can state that the use of • a 10 kW PVPP in Krasnaya Polyana settlement (Russia). the solar collector in the winter season, when the outer air temperature is below zero, for heating purposes is possible and efficient. Moreover, according to the preliminary efficiency estimates, the payback period of such systems may be as short In 2000, OOO LUKOIL-Ekoenergo was established to deal with as about three years, which is encouraging and offers prospects development of renewable energy projects. The priority areas of its for their use at many other Company’s facilities. activities include projects for utilization of hydro, wind, and solar energy. In Russia OOO LUKOIL-Ekoenergo manages Belorechensk, Krasnaya In October 2010, SC’s were installed on the roof of Polyana, Maykop and Tsimlyansk hydropower plants with the the booster pumping station (BPS) building of total capacity of 297.8 MW. Currently, hydropower plants are OOO LUKOIL-Perm in Kueda settlement (Perm Krai), being upgraded and operations are under way to improve their which were intended for hot water supply purposes. performance. In particular, ORU-110 (outdoor switchgear) was Their operation was monitored during 2011.

A system of solar collectors helps to In 2011, the organization commissioned a PVPP with 1.25 MW significantly reduce power consumption (by about 30% installed capacity. The plant occupies 2.5 hectares of the area of or possibly up to 50% per year). Moreover, during the LUKOIL Group’s refinery near Bulgarian Burgas. summer season (about 3 months) they almost completely did without electric water heating in the building. Renewable energy is one of the mechanisms to ensure environmental safety, reduce environmental impact, and save resources. In order to mitigate the Company’s risks, and given the fact that this business is quite new for both the Company, The LUKOIL Group enterprises have already accumulated positive and entire Russia, it is advisable to implement major projects experience in the use of low-potential sources of heat energy. jointly with a partner that has sufficient experience and For heat supply and conditioning purposes some production competence in this field. facilities use thermal pumps (TP). The geography of TP utilization is just about unlimited for as a source of low-potential heat we Today, LUKOIL’s key partner in the field of renewable energy can use ground, water and ambient air, as well as secondary is ERG Renew (Italy), a company of ERG Group specializing in thermal resources generated in the course of human activity. implementation of wind and solar energy projects.
