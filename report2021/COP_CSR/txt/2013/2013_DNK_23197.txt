Activities in Female leaders the recruitment process to reach the target have already been introduced and will be further intensified It is our goal that the percentage of female leaders in general should be minimum 25% in 2017. In 2012 – in 2013. Grundfos had 17% female leaders, which is status quo compared to the two previous years. Furthermore, Grundfos has stated targets for specific groups of female leaders: First, female leaders in Employees on special terms group and senior management positions should have a share of minimum 15% in 2017 and 25% by 2022.
