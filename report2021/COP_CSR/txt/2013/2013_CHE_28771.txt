Adherence to the reporting principles of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) has proven its worth to us. The associated high degree of transparency with regard to important key performance indicators of our company – both in a commercial sense and with regard to social, societal and ecological performance – has had nothing but positive effects to date. We continue to be convinced that a report of this kind makes sense for our company. · It improves the quality of our own management by compelling us to regularly examine certain factors and performances and to confront ourselves with the various interests of the different stakeholder groups. · It helps us to offer advice and support to companies who for a wide variety of reasons want to or have to draft a GRI-compliant annual report. For this advice to be as practically useful as possible, our advisers must be able to see things from the point of view of a GRI company. This is supported by our report. · We are thoroughly convinced of the benefits of sustainability reporting, which is perfectly in line with our corporate vision. For this very reason, we are also a member of the UN Global Compact and seek to put our own principles into practice at all times. The GRI compliant report allows us to communicate on this progress and provide this information to the UNGC. The report covers the financial year from 1.1.2012 until 31.12.2012. It is intended as a GRI report, as a management review report for our integrated management system as well as the Communication on Progress (COP) for the UN Global Compact. I would like to address our stakeholders directly and to emphasize: I am pleased to confirm that Neosys reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and AntiCorruption. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. We wish you an enjoyable read and look forward to receiving your comments.

Ø Our aim is the sustainable success of our customers. To achieve it, we combine technical know-how with management skills. Ø We work in Switzerland and world-wide for businesses, authorities and organisations. We assess, consult, plan, model, measure and serve as independent trustees. Ø Competence and objectivity are our highest goals. We are independent of manufacturers or service providers, bound only by statutory requirements, our ethical and professional standards, and the best interests of our clients. Ø We develop and improve our services on a continuous basis. The exchange of experiences between our different specialists is a key factor here. Ø We also continually improve our environmental performance and contribute to the protection of natural resources. Ø Our corporate culture is defined by acceptance, respect and belief as well as by a common commitment to success. It links us across the complexity of our projects, collaborators and stakeholders. Our employees are empowered with a high level of responsibility. 2.3 Importance of sustainability for Neosys AG Neosys AG sees itself as a service provider for the sustainability of its customers. By that we mean all aspects of ecological sustainability and a large number of social sustainability and economic sustainability aspects (in particular safety and risk analysis). We are convinced that in the present environment of globalisation and rapid technological and economic development, it will be necessary in the long term to recognise and correct deficits in the ecological and social sphere and in safety. We align our efforts to this benefit. Our vision is that we are able to accompany our clients towards ecological and social sustainability and thus also contribute to their economic competitiveness and sustainability. The benchmarks of sustainability that we want to convey to our customers also apply to ourselves. We are a member of the UN Global Compact Initiative. We operate a management system that is certified according to ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 and, as this report shows, we report in line with the GRI standard. 5 2.4 Chronicle of the year 2012 January 2012 Annual employee satisfaction survey undertaken by the Culture Group manager. February 2012 Contacts established with FoqusQuality and cooperation in the area of energy management (ISO 50001) defined. March 2012 In an evaluation of 158 SME reports from Germany, Austria and Switzerland (Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich), the first Neosys sustainability report reaches 20th place: the best sustainability report by a small Swiss company (< 50 employees). April 2012 Neosys publishes its second GRI report. 10 April 2012 The recertification audit by SQS is successfully carried out. April 2012 An MSC delegation visits the company UMCO in Hamburg, and cooperation on the further development of the legal database is discussed.

October 2012 Neosys becomes an organisational stakeholder of the GRI. November 2012 The second Neosys report achieves a good 45th place (fourth-best SME report) in the FHNW rating for the best-integrated company reports by Swiss companies. December 2012 Neosys enters the UN Global Compact Swiss Network. 14 Dec. 2012 Christmas dinner, organised by the CSR Business Unit in Bern. 6 2.5 Developments – Impact – Opportunities 2012 was an unspectacular year for Neosys AG, without any major changes or problems. The situation in the RisCare (RC) and Management Systems + Compliance (MSC) Business Units was stable and positive. Activity in the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Business Unit has been sustainably consolidated since the turnaround of 2011. The planned recovery of the capacities lost in 2011 has still not been achieved, but the Business Unit ended the period well above zero. The Technology-Environment (TU) Business Unit will remember 2012 for a series of failed acquisitions. Neosys participated in several large-scale, timeconsuming tenders/bids without any positive outcomes, which meant a poor account balance for the Business Unit and led to negative results for the year. But developments since have indicated that this was the kind of fluctuation that can arise in this business. In the case of Neosys’ foreign operations, unexpected problems with the Vietnamese authorities led to unbudgeted costs in the mid-four figure range. This made a substantial contribution to the somewhat weaker overall performance (EBIT) of Neosys AG. There has been a very unpleasant and unexpected tax dispute with the Canton of Solothurn. Reserves have had to be set aside to cover the disputed tax demands; these reserves have almost halved the final results for the year in comparison with the EBIT. 2012 was a year without any staff departures, but there were two new appointments and new strategic cooperation agreements, which enabled the target growth for the company to be comfortably achieved in 2012. Some prominent developments have presented opportunities and risks for future business activities: · The “energy transition” offers the opportunity to be much more active than previously in the fields of energy consultancy and energy management. Some interesting showcase projects were obtained for the products “ISO 50001” and “Operational Energy Management”; these show considerable potential for development. · The failure of the international climate policy and the associated expiry of the Kyoto Protocol without a replacement has meant an abrupt end to our activities relating to CDM audits for SQS. This is a great loss, not least as it has meant losing a five-figure turnover. On the other hand, the new Swiss CO2 Order offers opportunities to increase our activities in domestic climate-related projects. · The TU and RC Business Units have a solid and attractive mix of products, which, however, are mainly aimed at industrial customers. The deindustrialisation of Switzerland is progressing despite all assertions to the contrary by politicians. Every year customers are lost or take their industrial activities abroad, and this represents a significant risk to Neosys. · With the launch of the ‘MODULO’ product, a simple risk analysis at company level for SMEs, RisCare has made important progress in the area of non-technical risk services. The results of the RisCare Business Unit in 2013 will largely depend on the success or failure of this product. · A milestone was reached in Management Systems: Neosys has been involved in more than 100 customer projects for establishing environmental and/or occupational safety management systems, 100% of which have been successfully certified from the outset – a 7 measure of success to which we remain committed in future. The essential challenge for the immediate future facing the MSC Business Unit is the continued development and distribution of the “legal services” product. This is also the highest turnover generator for Neosys, and thus crucial to the company’s overall performance. · The continued development of the CSR products “sustainability strategy”, “ISO 26000” and “sustainable procurement” is encouraging. Successful involvement in organisations such as the SNV standards committees and IGöB, and cooperation with universities of applied sciences, has brought top-quality expertise to this Business Unit. In the course of both jobs for customers and implementation within our own company, the synergies between various management systems (ISO 14001, ISO 9001) and CSR standards (ISO 26000, GRI) have been demonstrated convincingly and implemented efficiently. It is a matter of achieving the breakthrough with the right instruments. · Neosys’ commitment over many years to international cooperation has been successfully continued. By focussing clearly on the Swiss institutions for development cooperation, Neosys is proving a reliable partner for the SECO and the SDC. During the current year new cohesion fund projects have been initiated in Eastern Europe and North Africa – a reference point for similar activities in future. 8 3 Economy 3.1 Company success Current status and indicators The overview table shows the key indicator values. The net turnover (CM1) is CHF 94,000, or 3%, below the budgeted expectations. The reason for this lies partly in the loss of turnover in Vietnam. This loss is not real but on paper. Orders are still coming in there, but for tax reasons they have to be accounted for directly through individuals and not through companies. Also, the TU Business Unit has achieved substantially lower turnover than predicted. The reason for this lay in an unusual accumulation of resource-intensive, but ultimately unsuccessful, acquisition projects. The lower yields were in part, but not fully, compensated for by higher yields in the MSC Business Unit. Despite the aforementioned turnover deficit the EBIT amounted to a satisfactory CHF 186,000, or 6.5% of the net turnover. This is above the lower acceptance level of 5.0%, but is clearly less than the previous year’s figure (8.0%). Staff productivity was slightly reduced by comparison with the previous year (1.46), standing at 1.44. It is still well below the long-term reference value of 1.50. The reason for this lies in the aforementioned poor account balance (acquisition projects that cannot be offset). However it should be also pointed out that two new staff members have been familiarising themselves with the company. With completely new people the offset levels are logically lower. The operating profits are hugely lower than the EBIT, with a disappointing CHF 113,000, or just 55% of the budgeted value. The reason for this lies in special reserves set aside for potential tax demands. These demands are disputed, but the amount must nevertheless be placed in reserve as a precautionary measure. These reserves were also deducted from the cash flow, which means that this figure is also much lower than budgeted. Unit of Actual Target Actual Actual Indicator measurement 2012 2012 2011 2010 Gross sales, all of Neosys kCHF 3,135 3,215 3,063 HR costs, all of Neosys kCHF 2,247 2,200 2,280 2,193 Net sales (CM1), only Bus kCHF 2,754 2,848 2,732 2,443 HR costs, only Bus kCHF 1,906 1,916 1,929 1,847 EBIT kCHF 186 214 226 113 Operating result kCHF 113 204 222 113 Cash flow kCHF 170 256 253 162 Dividends distributed kCHF 62 --74 38 EBIT rate of return % 6.8 7.5 8.0 4.6 Staff productivity 1.44 1.49 1.46 1.32 The following graphic shows the breakdown of costs. Although Neosys has everything required for state-of-the-art working, and although investments have always been written off at the maximum rates permitted, the material costs barely account for a fifth of costs. The remaining 80% are direct or indirect HR costs. This makes clear that the costs are dominated 9 by staff costs and that the performance of the company depends on a good staff return, that is, a high offsetable utilisation of the existing staff capacities. Composition of costs in 2012 1.03% 2.88% 2.12% 4.49% 0.86% 1.73% Wages and salaries 4.85% Social security contributions 0.75% Further training Rent and utilities Maintenance/Repairs 15.26% Property insurance Vehicles/Travel and representation 66.04% Office and administration Advertising costs Depreciation and amortisation Assessment After a rather difficult year, the operating profits were substantially below expectations. The net turnover and staff productivity are still below the budget values and further efforts are needed to move them into a positive range. Measures · Greater accountability through increasing the efficiency of non-productive activities · No introduction of additional unproductive activities · Further pay scale adjustments where possible · Examination of the introduction of a new pension fund model with defined contributions (measure adopted from the previous year; still in the course of implementation) 10 3.2 Customers Our customers are companies, authorities (departments and municipalities) and organisations (associations, international organisations, NGOs, etc.) in Switzerland and abroad. Our customer base has included a broad range of industries for many years. The trademark of Neosys is the provision of personal support and consulting services that are tailored to the clients and their requirements. Through personal contact, we receive direct feedback on customer satisfaction. We carry out systematic questionnaire-based customer satisfaction surveys. Current status and indicators 100% Table: Customer satisfaction 90% Average figures for the years 80% 2009 – 2012 Legend: 70% 100% = very good 60% 67% = good Expectations 33% = quite poor 50% Project management 0% = poor 40% Specialist expertise 30% 20% 10% 0% 2009 2010 2011 2012 The rate of questionnaires returned was 34% (157 questionnaires were sent out, 2011: 35%). 100% of the customers indicated that they would work with Neosys again or would recommend Neosys to others. Unit of Actual Target Actual Actual Indicator measurement 2012 2012 2011 2010 Complaints from customers Number 1 0 0 0 Feedback received from customers concerned issues such as difficulties in making appointments, excessive costs and the availability of employees. Assessment Neosys has had a high degree of customer satisfaction for many years. This was further increased during the last year, with ratings of very good or good virtually across the board. The lowest rating, although for the most part still very good, is given to the project management (primarily adherence to deadlines and budget). Clients particularly appreciate our specialist expertise. This assessment again increased substantially during the year, indicating that the new, younger employees have been able to increase their specialist skills appropriately. The new, detailed customer satisfaction survey, introduced in early 2011, has proven its worth and has been accepted by customers. 11 The training on presentation techniques planned for 2012 was not carried out and is now planned as a measure for 2013. The customer complaints registered were significant and instructive. They arose from misunderstandings between the services offered and customers’ expectations, in some cases exacerbated by language difficulties. Lessons were learned, and the issues dealt with to the customers’ satisfaction. Measures · Further monitoring of the trend · Monthly assessment by the company management of the feedback from the questionnaire and any complaints · Training courses on project and quality management, presentation techniques, etc. 3.3 Suppliers Current status and indicators Supplier management is of secondary importance for Neosys as most of the value chain comes from the work of the employees and only very little is contributed by suppliers. In the areas of IT, mobility, office material and laboratory services, there are important suppliers for operational functions. There are no negative incidents here. A service provider employed on the renovation of the premises was suspended due to defects. Neosys has defined a code of conduct that includes the locally valid environmental, occupational safety and occupational legislation, as well as the ILO core conventions and the payment of social security contributions and taxes. Service partners and suppliers with a purchase volume in excess of CHF 1000 per annum have been informed of this code and asked to confirm their compliance. With regard to products, Neosys has purchased fair-trade coffee and recycled paper for many years. Since last year, a fruit basket of organic products has been in place. In addition, IT products are used from a company that is considered as a leading player with regard to fair working conditions. The list of criteria for the consideration of ecological and social aspects when buying products is applied. In the area of cleaning products, the change-over is still being implemented, as low consumption means that products still in stock are being used up. Unit of Actual Target Actual Actual Indicator measurement 2012 2012 2011 2010 Suppliers/Service partners who have % 45 % 50 % 0% 0% been reviewed Exclusion of suppliers Number 1 --0 0 Assessment Supplier management is of secondary importance. We have been dealing for a long time with suppliers of certain products. The Code of Conduct was sent to the suppliers (those with a 12 purchase volume in excess of CHF 1000 per annum) and they were asked for a selfdeclaration; the response rate was 60% of those contacted. Measures · Re-send the self-declaration in respect of the Code of Conduct to those who have not responded. · Continued application of the list of criteria in Purchasing · Examine how and whether project partners abroad can be included 3.4 Innovation Current status and indicators There is an internal innovation process. New ideas for projects are reported by the employees and their status and progress discussed during the market meeting. At the end of 2012 there were 4 active innovation projects. No new ones were initiated, and one was completed in the course of the year. Unit of Actual Target Actual Actual Indicator measurement 2012 2012 2011 2010 Innovation projects handled (as at end Number 4 4 5 8 of the year) Working hours spent on innovation Hrs 49.3 --9.23 91.5 projects Assessment As part of the strategy for 2012 it was decided to promote innovation and set a minimum target of 1 development project per Business Unit (i.e. 4 for Neosys). This objective has just been achieved. The number of innovation projects fell last year, and the further development of existing projects occurred mainly within the scope of customer orders. One exception was a substantial legal services project. There is little excess capacity for development projects, except in connection with customer projects, if the workload from current projects is high. Last year, a measure decided upon was to check whether an indicator of the effectiveness and success of an innovation project can be developed. This measure was postponed to 2013. Measures · Check whether an indicator of the effectiveness and success of an innovation project can be developed. 13 3.5 Management system Current status and indicators Neosys AG has an integrated management system. The company's quality management has been ISO 9001-certified for many years. The management system is expedient and is regularly developed further. Instruments of the continuous improvement process are: customer surveys, employee surveys, internal audits, team meetings and improvement reports. In 2011 an EMS in accordance with ISO 14001 and sustainability reporting in accordance with the GRI were introduced. Assessment The integrated management system works well for day-to-day business; it is generally wellaccepted and is run efficiently. The introduction of an EMS and sustainability reporting has proven successful. The two sustainability reports for 2010 and 2011 proved particularly successful. In an evaluation of 158 SME reports from Germany, Austria and Switzerland as part of a Master’s thesis (Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich, March 2012), the Neosys sustainability report for 2010 reached 20th place, making it the best sustainability report by a small Swiss company (< 50 employees). With its report for 2011, Neosys achieved a good 45th place (fourth-best SME report) in the 2012 FHNW rating for the best-integrated company reports (including those by all major companies). Customer satisfaction is still high. Measures · Continually check potential for improvement of the IMS · Continue to use and improve existing instruments. · Regular holding of training courses on administrative and content aspects of project management. · Revision of the GRI report in line with Version 4 of the GRI standard, anticipated in 2013. 14 4 People and society 4.1 Corporate governance and stakeholders Current status and indicators The Board of Directors consists at present of four people, of whom two are major shareholders and two are external parties. In 2012 Prof. Dr. Ruedi Nützi of the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW) was elected as an external party to the Board of Directors. As an SME not listed on the stock exchange, it is our policy for the members of the Board of Directors to firstly be the major shareholders responsible and secondly selected external individuals who can support Neosys with their network of contacts. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is also the majority shareholder and the CEO. This constellation results from the management buyout in 2006 and is intended to help stabilise the company. It is reviewed at regular intervals. The company management consists of the five divisional heads (one is also the CEO and two jointly head up a division) and the Director of Finance and Administration. The market meeting which regulates the issues relating to product design, market development and the company presence has an important role to play in the management and organisation of the company. It comprises all employees with project manager status (excluding freelancers). The strategy committee reviews the corporate strategy on an annual basis. It has a new composition every year and at least the Board of Directors and the company management are represented in it. The Board of Directors decides on the annual composition. This flexibility makes it possible to adapt the participants to the current situation and to the form of the strategic meeting according to the specific situation. The most important stakeholders of Neosys are: a) Customers, i.e. private industry, public sector, international organisations b) Employees c) Suppliers, i.e. suppliers in the value chain, service providers to Neosys (banks, insurance companies, ...) d) Collaboration partners e) Media f) External market influencers g) Local community (neighbours, associations, municipality, canton) h) Competitors i) Nature and ecosystems Assessment The management processes have proven themselves to be effective. A systematic stakeholder analysis is still needed. Measures · No specific measures envisaged. The commitment to the GRI, however, will achieve enhanced awareness of this point 15 4.2 Business practices (incl. corruption) Current status and indicators Neosys is striving for ethical relationships with suppliers, customers, competitors, clients, beneficiaries, state organisations, employees and any other groups affected. As it is important for our credibility, many aspects have already of course been implicitly applied up to now. Complaints from customers, neighbours, society groups, employees, etc. are also taken up by the management system manager as required, and followed. Unit of Actual Target Actual Actual Indicator measurement 2012 2012 2011 2010 Employees who were given anti% of people 57% 50% 60% 0% corruption training Cases in which there was any suspected Number 0 --0 0 corruption Complaints from stakeholders with regard to environmental or social Number 0 --0 0 aspects Assessment On the domestic market, the risks of corruption can be rated as low. With projects abroad, there is an increased risk that the company could be confronted with it. A clear corporate policy, including integration into the provisions of the employment contracts, specifications for the tender phase and order processing, has not yet been formulated. This remains to be dealt with in 2013. A checklist for the recording and follow-up of situations where there is a risk of corruption has, however, been introduced. At present we can see three potential risk situations: a) Avoiding conflicts of interest where Neosys acts both as certification auditor and consultant b) Dishonest conduct of project partners abroad, e.g. through nepotism, payment of intermediaries, etc. c) Possible exertion of influence in projects where Neosys pays out project funds for development projects on behalf of public authorities. Potential risk situations of this kind are dealt with at company management meetings and followed up on the basis of the above list. The aforementioned processes should still be checked systematically for the integration of anti-corruption measures. Measures · Formulation of an explicit company policy regarding corruption and integration into the provisions of employment contracts and other processes. · Provision of training on the subject of “Corruption”, so that at least 75% of the workforce are trained in this (new target). 16 4.3 Employees Current status and indicators As per 31.12.2012, Neosys provides 15.9 full-time full time jobs with employment contracts pursuant to Swiss law shared by 22 people plus collaboration agreements with 6 other individuals that are not fixed for a particular period of time. Neosys offers modern employmentemployment conditions with potential for development and a relatively large degree of operational freedom and delegation of responsibility. Further increases in the headcount are planned. The breakdown of the workforce by age and gender can be found in the diagram diag ram and table below below.

There were no departures, only new appointments. One employee was on maternity leave during 2012. The person (intern) who temporarily took her place was able to remain in employment after her return. Employee satisfaction fell over the last year. The reasons for this are being investigated in the responses to the employee survey. Assessment The satisfaction of our employees is an important resource. Attempts to satisfy specific requirements were made with the development of a further training and development plan, the refurbishment/extension of the office premises in Gerlafingen and the rearrangement of the bimonthly market meetings. However the possibilities remain limited and certain requirements, such as the question of location, cannot be changed. Greater consideration should definitely be given to employee satisfaction. Salary equality between men and women is good and the wage spread is also low (< 3), which is typical for a Swiss SME. Measures · Intensive consideration of the responses from the employee survey. 4.4 Sponsoring, charity activities, etc. Current status and indicators It is part of our philosophy to be active in local sponsoring and to participate in all industry and specialist organisations relevant for our company. The annual budget for local sponsoring was not reached. On the other hand, employee contributions have increased by 8%. The reasons for this include membership of two new organisations: the GRI Organisational Stakeholder Network and the UN Global Compact Swiss Network. Indicator Unit Actual 2012 Target 2012 Actual 2011 Actual 2010 Sponsoring, donations CHF 3,700 4,500 4,450 4,550 Member contributions CHF 16,149 --14,948 10,942 In addition to financial contributions, Neosys AG is also active in a number of bodies and events without any reimbursement of expenses (e.g. ISO National Committee, the Interest Group for Ecological Purchasing [IGÖB] Office, Swiss Association of Independent Safety and Security Engineers and Consultants [SSI], Swiss Cleantech, etc.), which although they are advertising platforms also contribute to honing society's awareness of sustainability. Costs in this regard are not indicated separately. A number of employees are active as volunteers for social issues (NGOs, politics, churches, professional associations, etc.). Neosys AG welcomes charitable and political activities by its employees. These are not supported 18 financially or by granting work time off; however, any flexibility in working hours that this requires is granted. In 2012, one employee held a political office (mayor). Assessment The costs posted are around 10% of profits and therefore seem sufficient. Measures · Sponsoring as provided by the budget 19 5 Environment Since April 2011 Neosys AG has operated a certified environmental management system in accordance with ISO 14001. Environmental objectives for 2012 were specified and pursued accordingly. The environmental relevance was analysed for the first time in 2010 and is updated regularly. The company’s legal compliance is also checked regularly. No failures to comply have been found. 5.1 Operations-related related aspects Current status and indicators For 2012, the greenhouse gas footprint of Neosys AG is approx. 26.6 tonnes of CO 2, i.e. 35 tonnes, or 57%, less than the previous year. The comparison of the three source categories, heating, car use and air travel shows that emissions were reduced in all Business Units, but this is mainly due to fewer journeys by air (because of less activity abroad). The air travel undertaken by Neosys for SQS is neutralised (climate tickets) by SQS and not included in this statistic. The CO2 emissions from car travel were also reduced by 5.3 to 15.0 tonnes CO2. This is due to a deliberate travel policy which gives preference to rail journeys wherever possible. The reduction in emissions in connection with heating is not due to measures introduced, but to climatic conditions. conditions It should be anticipated that this figure will increase in 2013, as there is a greater gross area to be heated. At their meeting in March 2013, the company management decided to buy MyClimate certificates to compensate not only for air travel, tra but also for all stated CO2 emissions. This bringss the Neosys AG ‘chargeable’ CO2 emissions to zero. CO2 record of Neosys AG in tonnes of CO2 Air travel, 2.2 Heating, 9.4 Car travel, 15.0 The consumption of electricity for office operations and for rail travel is not calculated in the greenhouse gas footprint. This is in compliance with the method of calculation used by the 20 FOEN which uses the Swiss production mix, i.e. zero, for the emission factor of the Swiss grid electricity. The table of indicators below shows the further relevant values, and a comparison with the previous year. For indicator statements and objectives, the consumption is related to the number of posts.

The underlying objective of achieving a rail/car transport mode split above 50% has been achieved. However, the electricity consumption per full-time post increased by 21%. This is linked to the extension of the office premises in Gerlafingen and the expansion of the server. As the changes to the electricity supply contracts relating to the supply of green electricity were delayed, the proportion of green electricity could no longer be increased, which means we just failed to meet the “more than 50% green electricity” environmental objective. The environmental objective of achieving a climate-neutral operation has been achieved by substantial real reductions and the purchase of compensatory certificates. Neosys came substantially closer to its higherlevel objective of becoming a “1-tonne of CO2” company with an average of 1.7 tonnes per FTE in the workplace. The further (real) reduction by 2.1 tonnes from the previous year represents good progress. During the last year the measure of investigating/planning for in-house solar power production was decided upon. Enquiries were carried out accordingly, but no suitable solution has been found to date. Measures · The environmental objectives have been updated as follows for 2013: è Maintain climate-neutral operation (chargeable CO2 emissions = 0) • by as high a proportion as possible of rail travel • by offsetting the remaining emissions (e.g. purchasing emissions certificates or climate tickets) è Keep the transport mode split at a rail proportion > 60% è Increase the green electricity proportion to 100% 21 • by changing the contract with AEK accordingly è Continue to investigate/plan for in-house solar power production · Publish the environmental objectives and ensure internal staff motivation 5.2 Product-related aspects Actual status, assessment, measures It is obvious for a consulting company dealing in sustainability, such as Neosys AG, that the direct internal environmental effects are much smaller than those caused indirectly via our services. The mandates that have a particularly great leverage here are: · Introduction of environmental management systems · Legacy consulting and redevelopment · Environmental technology (waste air, noise, NIR, etc.) and CO2 projects · Waste management · Energy management It is, however, not possible to quantify these effects with any degree of precision as much depends on the customer. With regard to quality, our impact is all the greater the more and the bigger the mandates we have with highly environmentally relevant clients. This situation is certainly satisfactory today. Our aim to increase this impact further goes hand in hand with our growth activities. 22 6 Summary: Neosys 2012 in figures FINANCE Unit Actual 2012 Target 2012 Actual 2011 Actual 2010 Net sales (CM1), only BUs kCHF 2,754 2,848 2,823 2,443 HR costs, only BUs kCHF 1,906 1,916 1,929 1,847 EBIT kCHF 186 214 226 113 Operating result kCHF 113 204 222 113 Cash flow kCHF 170 256 253 162 EBIT return % 6.8 7.5 8.0 4.6 Staff productivity 1.44 1.49 1.46 1.32 QUALITY Unit Actual 2012 Target 2012 Actual 2011 Actual 2010 Complaints from customers Number 1 0 0 0 Reviewed suppliers/service partners % 45 50 0% --Exclusion of suppliers Number 1 --0 0 Innovation projects Number 4 4 5 8 Hours of work on innovation projects Hrs/yr 49.3 --9.3 91.5 EMPLOYEES Unit Actual 2012 Target 2012 Actual 2011 Actual 2010 Workforce FTE 31.12. 15.85 --15.2 15.7 Proportion of women among employees % FTE 30.6 --31.0 28.7 Proportion of women in the management % FTE 15.4 --15.4 0 Proportion of women on the Board % 0 --0 0 Wage spread 2.72 --2.74 2.84 Wage ratio w/m PL1 1.056 1 1.093 1.040 Wage ratio w/m PL3 0.954 1 0.998 1.040 Wage ratio w/m PL4 1.000 1 0.956 0.979 Fluctuation % FTE 0 <8 19.3 5.2 Occupational accidents/illnesses Number 0 0 0 Not calc.
