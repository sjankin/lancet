Executive Summary Face2Face Contact Limited continues to support the ten principles of the Global Compact with respect to human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption and continues to make improvements to ensure its policies, procedures and work ethics mirror the requirements set out by the Global Compact.

John Easden Chairman 2. Actions and Outcomes 2.1 Human Rights Principles 2.1.1 Policy and Goals We pride ourselves in our management of our employees and agents with an open, honest approach to recruitment, teamwork, continuous improvement and focus on self improvement. We promote our commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to all our stakeholders and openly communicate our objectives by publishing a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policy which is available to all. 2.1.2 Implementation Annually through our Quality Management System all employees and agents are reminded of our policies and procedures for all matters relating to CSR and existing employees have access to our comprehensive Staff Handbook which includes details regarding equal opportunities, flexible working, parental leave, work life balance and anti harassment amongst others. All new employees are taken through a robust induction programme which introduces them to the ethos of Face2Face. Face2Face very much operates an ‘open door’ culture and with the continued support from the HR department all employees are encouraged to participate in dialogue on any subject matter. In addition to this our monthly meetings for Safety, Health and Environmental matters means that all staff have an open forum to raise any issues. More recently Face2Face has employed an individual under the government’s apprenticeship scheme giving the opportunity for a school leaver to develop skills in their chosen arena. In addition to this all staff are now encouraged to attend monthly massages and fruit is provided twice weekly. CSR 002 17/06/2013 Company Confidential Page 3 of 6 Corporate Social Responsibility Communication on Progress 2.1.3 Measurement All policies are reviewed for suitability, sustainability and effectiveness on an annual basis or sooner should a significant change occur. These reviews are formally recorded. Minutes from Safety, Health and Environmental meetings are reviewed by the Managing Director and appropriate heads of department. 2.2 Labour Principles 2.2.1 Policy and Goals It is the Company’s policy to provide employment, training, promotion, pay, benefits and other conditions of employment without regard to race, colour, ethnic origin, nationality, national origin, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, gender reassignment, marital status, age and/or disability unrelated to an individual's ability to perform essential job functions. It is also the Company’s policy to conform to all employment standards required by law. Face2Face clearly sets out its policies to all employees by providing a contract of employment which makes reference to the Staff Handbook where additional information can be found regarding policies. In addition to this we provide detailed guidelines on Health and Safety items such as risk assessments, identified hazards and the procedures in place to reduce or eliminate any risks. 2.2.2 Implementation Face2Face maintains a comprehensive recruitment procedure and all records are maintained within the HR department. Meetings for Safety, Health and Environmental matters are held on a monthly basis for staff to raise any issues or concerns, these meetings are formally recorded and the minutes are made available for all to read. In addition to this a quarterly bulletin is issued which provides updates on our OHSAS 18001 accreditation. Face2Face continually monitor all areas concerning Labour Principles and aim to continually improve processes and policies and where new risks or hazards are identified which could impact on our employee’s health and safety additional work instructions are put in place. 2.2.3 Measurement  Recording of all Health and Safety Incidents  Reviewing of all Health and Safety incidents  Recording of minutes from Safety, Health and Environment Meetings  Recording of recruitment statistics  Audits as per ISO Conformance  Sickness records CSR 002 17/06/2013 Company Confidential Page 4 of 6 Corporate Social Responsibility Communication on Progress 2.3 Environmental Principles 2.3.1 Policy and Goals Having successfully maintained the ISO 14001 Environmental accreditation in May of this year Face2Face continue with its initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. Although our direct impact on the environment is relatively small Face2Face is keen to ensure continued commitment to its internal policies and controls. Our Environmental policy is made available to all stakeholders and to the public. 2.3.2 Implementation The environmental aspects and impacts are reviewed and audited annually and all staff are asked to sign up to the Environmental Policy annually. Targets have been set based on the company’s impact as follows:  Reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill  Reducing our paper consumption by the introduction of new technology  Reducing our ink and toner consumption  Continuing with our environmental purchasing policy  Managing our energy and water usage During the past twelve months awareness campaigns have been introduced and by using actual data captured Face2Face have been able to give comprehensive feedback to all staff detailing paper consumption, ink consumption and waste generated to further highlight our impact on the environment and reinforce our aims to become more environmentally friendly. We have also secured a new contract with a recycling company who will provide us with detail on the amount of waste that is being recycled. Face2Face also operate an emergency preparedness procedure. All suppliers are expected to support our aims for sustainability. 2.3.3 Measurement The Head of Compliance maintains records for:  Water usage  Electricity usage  Paper usage  Ink/Toner usage  Waste generation All of the data for these items is reported directly to the board and to all staff and measured against overall company objectives.

We have identified the risks for our company and ensure that all staff are aware of the risks and the procedures in place to mitigate them. During the past twelve months Face2Face has introduced further documented procedures within its finance department to eradicate any additional risks and has committed to increasing the number of procedures over the coming twelve months. 2.4.2 Implementation The Staff Handbook contains all relevant policies and procedures for staff to review and as part of the induction process staff are introduced to these. Our financial records are audited on a monthly basis by our chairman and are controlled by our Managing Director and on an annual basis our accounts are audited independently. 2.4.3 Measurement The measurement for corruption remains the responsibility of the Managing Director and is based on perception according to the information provided to him by the Finance Manager, Senior Management, staff and process owners. Areas where further investigation is required are passed to the Head of Compliance or any other body necessary to fulfil the requirements of a complete audit. Our recruitment procedure which is continually checked and audited by external bodies such as clients and ISO auditors, includes such checks as proof of citizenship and credit scoring which can reduce our exposure to risk of corruption.
