Since then, we have been a key development partner to the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) and the Swedish Armed Forces. Close cooperation with customers and rigorous customer requirements have contributed to our formation from the start. Important parts of the Swedish defence industry have been gathered and further developed in our group.

The customer was impressed with the results of flight evaluations with the system installed on the Blackhawk helicopter. The order was secured in cooperation with BAE Systems Inc., with whom we collaborate in North America with respect to the U.S. Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensor Directorate (NVEDS). The system‚Äôs excellent high resolution optical display provides the user with crisp, clear flight information and enhanced situational awareness. Further flight tests are being conducted using the system on the Blackhawk and other helicopter platforms. The goal is to improve safety while flying at low altitudes and during take-off and landing in degraded visual environments.

The latter is a competitive advantage Saab‚Äôs key markets. for Saab, which has provided us with support in our export efforts with the Gripen system. Competitiveness on a global market The challenge for countries with fiscal imbalances is to identify 2012 was an eventful year for Saab. It was the year we celebrated solutions that enable economic growth while reducing the overall 75 years as a Swedish defence materiel company and the year debt burden.

At that time, Sweden was in many ways a very differShifts in emphasis create new playing Ô¨Åeld ent country than it is today, and the world around us had agendas Defence investments are typically made with a minimum time different from ours. But there are also major similarities that make horizon of ten to twenty years. In a geopolitical perspective, Saab‚Äôs original strategy relevant even today. From the start, Saab shifts in emphasis have taken place economically, politically and was ahead of its time in some ways. I am thinking in particular of geographically during the past ten years. The USA has gradually the original goals of building technically advanced systems that shifted its focus from Europe and the Middle East to Asia and the could easily be integrated with others and of identifying smarter Pacific Region. This change will, over time, probably affect the solutions to make production and development more costway Sweden and its neighbouring countries act. The EU and NATO are discussing ways in which the defence industry can cooperate to achieve more efficient solutions. Even today, there is more international exchange in this area than would have been imaginable just a few decades ago. Under the 2010 Ghent Framework, EU defence ministers are working towards a systematic analysis of national military capacity for the purpose ‚ÄúSAAB IS A CLEAR of identifying solutions for interoperability.

During 2012 we received reports that the USA will be able to export some of its gas production in the not 4 SAAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 traffic. This presents some ambiguities ‚Äì the melting of polar ice caps is evidence of the increasing unhealthiness of the planet, but also shortens transport routes and thereby reduces future environmental impact. As global trade is gradually rerouted to the Arctic Ocean, the security policy map in our immediate environment will be redrawn. This is reinforced by the fact that an open Arctic Ocean will to a greater extent enable the extraction of raw materials, particularly previously inaccessible fossil resources. This is a development that Saab will have to monitor since it could influence the military strategic priorities in the Nordic markets where we have a strong position, particularly in Sweden. Towards a more market-oriented organisation As mentioned in the introduction, we at Saab believe in increasing our local presence with our own people on the ground. Only when an organisation can see and hear what is happening around the world with its own eyes and ears can it create an environment for producing a customised offering. This is the reason behind Saab‚Äôs establishment, as of January 1st 2013, of six market areas on five continents. With people on the ground in these markets, we are taking with us our values and approach for healthy, sustainable business practices with zero tolerance of all forms of corruption. We know that we operate in an industry in which strict regulations are and should be a fact of life ‚Äì in terms of companies‚Äô own principles, national legislation and international agreements. We therefore actively support the UN‚Äôs work to formulate global regulations for our industry. To clarify our position in terms of how we act in society, Saab adopted the UN Global Compact in 2011. Its ten principles are now incorporated into Saab‚Äôs framework for sustainability work that is being continuously developed throughout the company. Saab‚Äôs Code of Conduct is also based on these ten principles. We are thus ensuring that Saab can develop further as a sustainable, international company that is competitive in the long term. too distant future. This alteration of the energy map impacts security policy the world over and hence military strategic priorities and Stockholm, February 2013 investments.

Achieving this requires more than doing business only at home ‚Äì we also need to continue to increase our market shares have a clear need for competitive products, beyond Sweden‚Äôs borders.

When governments proud of the confidence placed in this unique fighter aircraft allocate fewer and fewer resources to various budget items, system, its development potential and defence capacity. Today, companies like Saab naturally find it more challenging to create Gripen is operational in six countries and we see continued strong growth. Global defence expenditures are expected to grow by 6 SAAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 a total of 10 per cent through 2017, although this trend varies in different parts of the world. Western countries are expected to cut defence spending, while areas such as China, Russia, India and South America are planning to allocate more resources for defence. During 2012 we also witnessed a shift in defence policy priorities in some countries. In January 2012 President Obama announced that the U.S. will modify its defence strategy by increasing focus on Asia and the Pacific Region. Accordingly, the U.S. will reduce its presence in Europe and the Middle East, and this imposes new requirements on the way we work together and take responsibility for shared security within Europe.

By curing the shell surface together with stringers and ribs, the inner structures of the wing can be secured entirely without rivets on the exterior. This reduces turbulent flow over the wing and provides the desired fuel savings. Weight is also reduced, which also helps to lower fuel consumption. This development is being conducted within the framework of the Smart art Fixed Wing Aircraft project, which is part of the EU‚Äôs Clean Sky initiative. The collaboration demonstrates Saab‚Äôs design and production capabilities es and reinforces Saab‚Äôs role as an important subcontractor. A major challenge is to scale up this technology and deliver a full-scale e wing while meeting the very aggressive schedule. In early 2015, Airbus will test an Airbus A340 with Saab‚Äôs 9x3 metre wing component to evaluate the technology. This is one of the main deliverables of the Clean Sky project..

With radar technology developed by Saab engineers, it can detect where a rocket, for example, comes from and where it will land ‚Äì all within a matter of a few seconds and with an extremely high degree of precision. This technology is used in the Arthur weapon locating system. Arthur is designed to monitor a specific sector, has a very large range and can extremely quickly and accurately detect where ballistic trajectory objects (i.e., RAMs ‚Äì Rocket Artillery Mortars) are fired from and where they will land. Giraffe AMB is a rotating radar that provides 360 degree coverage. The system provides sufficient range and precision to detect and warn of RAM threats. The system is used with great success in, for example, Afghanistan, where is used at bases to protect the troops living there. Many lives have been saved by the system. Sea Giraffe AMB is a naval variant of Giraffe AMB, though without a command and control system. The radar is integrated with the vessel‚Äôs CMS (Combat Management System). Arthur, Giraffe AMB and Sea Giraffe AMB share several common subsystems. Giraffe systems are unique, and there is not yet any other product on the market with the same level of functionality and reliability. According to customers who use it, the system achieves 98‚Äì99 per cent availability. agreements are part of the strategy to increase our presence in transactions to extensive counter-purchase requirements.

With a structured, concentrated procedure, we work company and that potential employees have a clear, accurate to identify and develop our talented people and prepare them for picture of Saab as an employer. the challenges and the exciting future ahead of them. Diversity efforts and talent management will continue to receive as much attention as they have done. Our employees have had their say ‚Äì Saab is an attractive employer with proud employees who believe strongly in the future. Nearly 90 per cent of Saab‚Äôs employees took the opportunity to respond to this year‚Äôs employee survey. This indicates commitment and the desire to contribute to positive development. The survey results show a strong improvement in areas related to Saab as an employer, belief in the future and satisfaction. The ‚Äúsatisfaction‚Äù result was 75, a full 8 point improvement over last year. Employees also feel that they contribute to Saab‚Äôs development and working climate. Employees want to see improvement primarily in the form of managers involving employees to a greater extent in the development of the business, as opposed to merely providing information. This will be a prioritised area in Saab‚Äôs leadership development. When using their own words to describe the qualities that make Saab a good employer, there is consensus among employees that they are proud of our products, our skilled employees and our long, compelling history. All in all, we have an excellent foundation that we will now expand upon in order to cultivate our valuable human capital. This includes all managers picking up on and following up on each individual employee‚Äôs development potential. 22 SAAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Engineer making a career at Saab Jessica √ñberg, Deputy Head of Land Division within the Support and Services business area, launched her career at Saab by moving to the U.S. to work as a consultant.

SAAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 23 OLD FAITHFUL AND INNOVATIONS A HIGH-TECH MASTERPIECE WITH MULTIPLE USES Sapphires is Saab‚Äôs autonomous underwater vehicle AUV 62, developed by Dynamics. The unmanned vehicle is used for everything from mine reconnaissance to locating accident victims. Sapphires is currently available in two configurations: one for locating mines on the sea bed and one for anti-submarine training operations with the Navy. The vehicle can be launched from submarines, surface vessels and ports, and its unique sonar technology provides highly detailed information on sea bed topography and any objects that may be resting on the ocean floor. Sapphires is also fully autonomous ‚Äì all data is processed directly in the vehicle, providing information on a search area and directions for operational depth. Sapphires then conducts the search entirely on its own. There are many possible future areas of application for Sapphires: it can be used in all marine patrol contexts, from environmental monitoring to monitoring gas and oil pipelines on the ocean floor. 24 SAAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 WHEN STABILITY IS VITAL Stability is vital for missiles, sights, antennas, radar and cameras so gyros are used to ensure stabilisation even under the toughest conditions. In simple terms, our applications generally measure how fast something is rotating, in order to be able to compensate for movement. Saab has over 40 years of experience in manufacturing gyros. The last ten years have focused on designing and manufacturing gyros based on fibre-optic technology, FOG (Fibre Optic Gyros). In total, Saab has produced over 350,000 gyro products for various applications. The gyro is a central and important part in the many of the products produced by Saab and others, including helicopters, aircraft, robotic systems, tanks and missiles. Saab‚Äôs gyro technology is also used in high-performance civilian applications, such as for advanced cleaning robots for swimming pools and waterslides. However, it is not the stabilisation that is most important, but navigation.

Aerial monitoring of coastal areas is a fast-growing market segment worldwide. 340 MSA will allow Saab to offer a cost effective solution with high capacity. Due to its ability to respond quickly to emerging maritime threats, Saab 340 MSA can monitor territorial waters. The aircraft has a long range and can easily take off from short runways. The on-board monitoring system with data links, a SATCOM system (satellite communication system) and radar give the aircraft a high mission capacity. Saab 340 MSA is a reliable surveillance aircraft that offers a number of abilities such as: surveillance, search and rescue, transportation and MEDEVAC (Medical Evacuation). The aircraft was displayed for the first time at the 2012 Aerospace Forum in Link√∂ping. It has also been demonstrated in London, at the Farnborough International Air Show, and at African Aerospace & Defence in South Africa in September 2012. 42 SAAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 ADMINISTRATION REPORT > BUSINESS AREAS MOBILE SYSTEM TRACES DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES Saab has extensive experience of CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) substance detection products. AWR (Automatic Warning and Reporting System) is a mobile system that both warns of dangerous substances and identifies the substance. The system makes it possible to quickly identify the source and make correct decisions, which is critical when dealing with CBRN. AWR consists of a number of mobile sensors that are connected to a common command and control system. If any of the sensors detect a dangerous substance, a warning signal is immediately sent to everyone who is connected to the system and to headquarters. The number of sensors allows you to quickly see which geographical areas are affected and which are safe. AWR has been developed on behalf of the Swedish Armed Forces, which are currently using three units in the field. Simplicity and flexibility have been the guiding principles in the development, and the system can be easily updated in line with technological developments. Negotiations are ongoing with several other markets, and ultimately there are many civil applications.

Soil remediation In accordance with the Group‚Äôs publicly announced environmental policy and applicable legal requirements, periodic estimates are made of Saab‚Äôs obligations to restore contaminated soil. Anticipated future payments are discounted to present value and recognised as an operating expense and a provision. SAAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 77 FINANCIAL INFORMATION > NOTES Financial assets and liabilities and other financial instruments The Parent Company carries financial fixed assets at cost less impairment and financial current assets according to the lowest value principle. If the reason for impairment has ceased, it is reversed. The Parent Company does not apply the rules for setting off financial assets and liabilities. Derivatives and hedge accounting Derivatives that are not used for hedging are carried by the Parent Company according to the lowest value principle. For derivatives used for hedging, recognition is determined by the hedged item. This means that the derivative is treated as an off balance sheet item as long as the hedged item is recognised at cost or is not included on the balance sheet. Receivables and liabilities in foreign currency hedged with forward contracts are valued at the forward rate. Employee benefits The Parent Company complies with the provisions of the Law on Safeguarding of Pension Commitments and the regulations of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, since this is a condition for tax deductibility. Untaxed reserves The amounts allocated to untaxed reserves constitute taxable temporary differences. Due to the connection between reporting and taxation, the deferred tax liability is recognised in the Parent Company as part of untaxed reserves. Group contributions and shareholders‚Äô contributions Shareholders‚Äô contributions are recognised directly in the equity of the recipient and capitalised in the shares and participating interests of the contributor, to the extent impairment is not required. Group contributions received and paid are recognised through profit or loss in financial income and expenses. 78 SAAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 FINANCIAL INFORMATION > NOTES NOTE 2 Assumptions in the Application of the NOTE 3 Revenue Distribution Accounting Principles Revenue by signiÔ¨Åcant source The Board of Directors and Group Management together have identified the following areas where estimates and assumptions in the application of the Group Parent Company accounting principles may have a siginificant impact on the accounting of the MSEK 2012 2011 2012 2011 Group‚Äôs results of operations and financial position and may result in signifiSale of goods 4,147 3,999 2,412 1,669 cant adjustments in subsequent financial reports.

Capitalised development costs are amortised over the estimated production volume or period of use, up to a maximum of 5 years, with the exception of acquired development costs, where the maximum period of use is 10 years. Projected production volumes and periods of use may later be reassessed, which could necessitate impairment. Impairment testing of goodwill In the calculation of cash-generating units to determine whether there is a need for impairment of goodwill, assumptions have been made with regard to the calculation of value in use, based on discounted cash flow projections. A significant deviation in the conditions could necessitate impairment of goodwill. The carrying amount for goodwill amounts to msek 4,581 (4,223). Pensions Saab has two types of pension plans: defined-benefit and defined-contribution. In defined-benefit plans, post-employment compensation is based on a percentage of the recipient‚Äôs salary. The present value of defined-benefit obligations amounts to msek 7,165 (6,541). The value of the pension obligation is determined through a number of actuarial assumptions, because of which the obligation can significantly increase or decrease if the actuarial assumptions change. Due to the revisions to the reporting standard ias 19, which enter into force in 2013, the so-called corridor approach will disappear. This means that changes in actuarial gains and losses directly affect the pension obligation and hence the Group‚Äôs financial position.
