COEVAL WITH THE TURKISH REPUBLIC, İŞBANK PLACES THE MONEY BOX AT THE CORE OF ITS CORPORATE VALUES. THE MONEY BOX ALSO SYMBOLIZES THE “SAVING HABITS” THAT WAS STRIVEN TO BE PROPAGATED ACROSS THE NATION CONCURRENTLY WITH THE ECONOMIC REFORMS AHEAD OF THE YOUNG TURKISH REPUBLIC. İŞBANK’S MONEY BOX PENETRATED OUR LIVES IN 1928 SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE COUNTRYWIDE EFFORTS SPENT TO BUILD THE FOUNDATIONS OF A MODERN LIFE IN EVERY ASPECT. THE MONEY BOX HAS EVER SINCE REMAINED AS A REFLECTION OF OUR BANK’S HISTORIC MISSION AND PRESERVED THE SOCIOCULTURAL MEANING IN THE COLLECTIVE MEMORY OF THE REPUBLIC GENERATIONS. HAVING TAKEN ON THE MISSION OF INCULCATING AN AWARENESS OF SAVINGS IN THE SOCIETY AND ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN EVER SINCE, THE MONEY BOX HAS BECOME AN INDISPENSABLE PART OF LIFE, AND A TRADITION THAT HAS BEEN PASSED DOWN FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT. IN LINE WITH THE GLOBAL INFLUENCES AND THE PROGRESSES IN OUR COUNTRY, İŞBANK’S MONEY BOX INSPIRED THE MONEY BOX FUND AND TURNED INTO A SUCCESS STORY. ON ANOTHER FRONT, IT HAS PRESERVED ITS PLACE IN SOCIAL LIFE AND HAS BECOME A “BRAND NAME” IN TURKEY, WITHOUT SIDETRACKING FROM ITS GOAL OF INSTILLING THE HABIT OF SAVING UP AND INVESTING FOR THE SAKE OF A BRIGHT FUTURE AND HEALTHY NEW GENERATIONS. THE ECONOMIC DISTRESSES OF GLOBAL SCALE IN THE RECENT YEARS HAVE ENHANCED THE IMPORTANCE OF SAVINGS. AS WE, WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS, INCREASE THE SAVING HABITS, WHICH HAS BEEN SYMBOLIZED IN İŞBANK’S MONEY BOX FOR 88 YEARS IN TURKEY, WE WILL KEEP MAKING OUR BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND OF OUR CHILDREN. WE EXTEND OUR THANKS TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT.

On the other hand, the Copenhagen Accord drafted in 2009 highlighted the necessity for a mechanism to reward sustainable land use and forestation initiatives. The offsetting projects realized in land use and forestation areas are clearly incorporated in the bills proposed in the USA. Calculation of carbon dioxide reduction from forestation activities has not been initiated in Turkey yet. The private sector began attaching increased importance to carbon management as a result of Turkey’s possible position as a participant in the new climate change regime after 2013 and the sustainability concept that gained the forefront in global competition. In brief, there has been a growing interest in offsetting carbon emissions through forestation activities in our country in the recent years. 82 İŞBANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 İŞBANK RECOGNIZES The table below presents the types of trees planted within the scope of İşbank’s “81 Forests in 81 Cities Project” as at year-end 2012, and the annual estimated carbon THAT OPTIMAL capturing capacities of the trees.
