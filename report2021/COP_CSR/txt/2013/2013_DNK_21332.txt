Subsequently we point out our intention to itself state specific environmental performance use energy, water and raw materials with care. criteria, but instead shows how the organisation can set its own environmental goals, taking into account the law and those aspects of environmental protection which it can influence. 6 3.2.2. Energy consumption (headquarter) The graph below shows a generally steady drop in energy consumption per unit of production since 1998. During 2009 and 2010 there were a small increase in energy use per unit because production fell during the recession; as a result, the fixed component of our energy consumption increased as a proportion of the total. The actual decrease of the graph is due to the increase of the production. In 2012 there was a small increase due to cold weather (heat) and new building activities (electricity). 3.2.3 Water comsumption (headquater) Our water consumption per employee has developed a similar way to that of the energy use curves above. In our production facilities the only water we use is for calibrating meters, and this is reused. The great majority of our water is therefore used as drinking water and for sanitary purposes. Most of our washrooms now have taps with sensors and variable-flush cisterns. 7 3.2.4. Air pollution, noise, smell a product through its entire life cycle.
