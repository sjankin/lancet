Annual Report 2013 19 Analysis of the ANA Group Corporate Strategy by President and Our goal is to be the world’s leading airline group. We will therefore further strengthen our operating fundamentals and make strategic investments to participate in economic growth in Asia to generate earnings growth and increase corporate value. Background for the Policies of ANA Group FY2013-2015 Corporate Strategy Steadily Moving Ahead with Initiatives to Achieve Our Next Phase of Growth I would like to begin with an explanation of the strategic progress we have made so that readers understand the current status of the ANA Group. We formulated ANA Group FY2012-2013 Corporate Strategy in February 2012 (years ending March 2013 and March 2014) to prevail in a global environment of intensifying competition. Our theme was renaissance as a competitive ANA Group, and our three pivot points were Group Reorganization, Multi-Brand Strategy and Cost Restructuring. We also obtained capital through a public offering in July 2012 to reinforce our financial position and fund our growth strategy. During the fiscal year ended March 2013, issues such as the grounding of Boeing 787 aircraft and the disputes over the Senkaku Islands and Takeshima Islands challenged the ANA Group. However, our steady strategic execution supported higher operating revenues and income, and we surpassed ¥100 billion in operating income for the first time. We achieved a record in operating income for the second consecutive fiscal year, which indicates that we have sufficiently enhanced our ability to generate earnings. However, we have not yet achieved our medium-term target for value creation, which is operating income of ¥150 billion or above and an operating margin of 10% or above. Ensuring that we have structured our operations to generate sufficient earnings even if event risks materialize in the future is an ongoing matter. Our financial position has benefited from the capital we obtained through the public offering. We now have a balance sheet that enables us to simultaneously make aircraft and strategic investments while our earnings during the fiscal year increase shareholders’ equity. From the fiscal year ending March 2014 onward, we will appropriately deploy the capital we obtained through the public offering to make strategic investments in growth that will begin generating returns. We will further strengthen 20 ANA HOLDINGS INC. Chief Executive Officer Shinichiro Ito our existing businesses with a focus on air transportation operations while expanding business segments as we aim to create an optimal business portfolio with new revenue platforms. Ensuring the Ability to Withstand Adverse Events and Prevail in an Era of Global Mega Competition Looking at our operating environment, demand in Japan has recovered to a certain extent in the wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake. Global airline demand is also solid, particularly in emerging countries in Asia and elsewhere. At the same time, demand trends give us little reason for optimism because the global economy is fraught with uncertainties centered on Europe, while demand on China routes has stagnated because of issues such as the disputes over the Senkaku Islands. In Japan, we expect LCCs to stimulate new demand, but at the same time, the competitive environment is getting tough. Meanwhile, deregulation in the airline industry continues apace, with international arrival and departure slots slated to increase at Haneda Airport in the year ending March 2015 and at Narita Airport in the year ending March 2016. Our experience has shown us that we need to establish strong operating fundamentals that can withstand the various and inevitable event risks to which we are exposed in the course of our business. At the same time, economic growth in Asia and the further expansion of arrival and departure slots at metropolitan-area airports give the ANA Group outstanding opportunities for growth, so we must prevail in the coming era of mega competition. Overview of ANA Group FY2013-2015 Corporate Strategy Executing a Consistent Management Strategy While Making Further Growth a Reality Against the background of our strategic progress from the start of the year ended March 2013 and the outlook for our operating environment, we announced ANA Group FY2013-2015 Corporate Strategy (years ending March 2014 to March 2016) as a phase in which we will accelerate our operations and make sustained medium-to-long-term growth a reality. Under this strategy, we will continue the Unit Cost Transition (Air Transportation) sustained and consistent implementation of the (¥) (2012=100) three pivot points of ANA Group FY2012-2013 12 140 Corporate Strategy.

Given the rapid pace of Domestic available seat-km + International available seat-km (excluding AirAsia Japan) (right scale) change in our operating environment, each Group Annual Report 2013 21 company will develop its business independently, which will include business with companies outside the Group. This will keep us closer to our markets and ensure rapid decision making, thus providing full support for enhancing the Group’s operating capabilities. The Multi-Brand Strategy covers the strategic positioning of the ANA brand and our LCC brands. We are working to increase Group value through networks tailored to the features of each business and the evolution of products and services. The ANA brand will expand its international route network as a full-service carrier and ensure its operating advantage on domestic routes. We have restructured our LCC brands and revised our business plan for them based on the termination of our joint venture with AirAsia Bhd. We will take a new approach to a low-cost business model adapted to the Japanese market to establish a business that can quickly contribute to earnings. Cost Restructuring entails raising the productivity of operating units completely and streamlining non-operating units to reduce costs by a cumulative ¥100.0 billion through the ﬁscal year ending March 2015, which is equivalent to a decrease of ¥1.0 in unit cost. Competition is intensifying in the domestic route market, and there are strong competitors in the international route market. Therefore, our goals are to be competitive at a global level and to ensure powerful resistance to adverse events such as the recent global recession and the Great East Japan Earthquake. To date, we have reduced costs at a faster pace than originally planned, with reductions of ¥11.0 billion in the year ended March 2012 and ¥21.0 billion in the year ended March 2013. Using the original plan in the year ended March 2012 as a standard of comparison, we reduced unit cost by ¥0.59 as of the year ended March 2013. Capacity expansion, primarily on international routes, has caused unit revenue to trend downward. We are making steady progress in reducing unit cost by more than the decrease in unit revenue, but we do not intend to lessen our focus on continuously strengthening our earnings structure. As an example of structural reform, ANA Group management has decided to reform the retirement beneﬁts system and has been discussing proposals with the labor unions for some time. We believe this will help reduce balance sheet risk and stabilize results, and intend to conduct serious discussions to implement reforms. Column: The Shift to a Holding Company Structure The ANA Group has implemented management reforms been eliminated by assigning them to either ANA Holdings that have reorganized seven Group airline companies as of April or ANA and using concurrent postings, which has helped to 2010 into three companies as of April 2012, and then four as of right-size the organization.

Taking full advantage of the benefits of reorganization and integration, we shifted to a Corporate Structure as of April 1, 2013 holding company system in April 2013 to further strengthen the ANA HOLDINGS INC. Group’s management structure and ensure flexible and efficient management. Given the rapid pace of change in our operating All Nippon Airways Co., Ltd. environment, our objective in making this transition is to create an even stronger ANA Group by separating management policy ANA WINGS CO., LTD. decision making from business execution and optimizing the Air Japan Co., Ltd. allocation of management resources.

Moreover, overlapping operations and functions have October 31, 2013). 22 ANA HOLDINGS INC. Analysis of the ANA Group Corporate Strategy by President and Chief Executive Officer Shinichiro Ito New Pivot Point Orientation Move to the Strategic Investment Phase to Take Part in Growth in Asia Demonstrating maturity, economic growth rates in Japan and other developed countries are stable at low levels. At the same time, economic growth remains strong in Asia and is forecast to continue. The ANA Group therefore needs to pursue opportunities to expand business segments in Asia to grow further. Moreover, stable cash ﬂow from record operating income for two consecutive ﬁscal years and the capital obtained through the public offering enable the ANA Group to maintain and enhance its ﬁnancial soundness while making strategic investments in Asia. Therefore, our management strategy involves the continued execution of existing policies in parallel with a shift to making strategic investments to diversify revenue domains and expand earnings. The airline business will be the first focus of strategic investments. We want to link economic growth in Asia directly to the ANA Group’s development, so we will consider investments in full-service carriers and LCCs that can generate synergies with our existing air transportation business while contributing to the progress of our Multi-Brand Strategy. Many countries currently have restrictions on foreign investment, so we may begin with minority investments. However, we also intend to acquire majority stakes if enabled by deregulation and airline liberalization over the near term. Another investment theme will be airline-related businesses, which draw support from the strong expansion in airline demand in Asia and are expected to grow in the future. We are aiming to effectively leverage our knowledge and human resources related to our airline business in order to expand earnings by providing services and transacting business outside the Group. The ﬂight crew training business we already operate in Japan and the aircraft maintenance business we are planning at Naha Airport exemplify this investment theme. Expansion and Diversiﬁcation of Business Segments includes studying the feasibility of participating in airline support businesses in which we can deploy the ANA Group’s expertise, even if these businesses do not have a pronounced connection with the airline business.

Business Portfolio Orientation Multi-Brand and Diversification Strategies to Contribute to Income Growth and Increased Corporate Value Optimum business portfolio management within the holding company structure is essential to generating further income growth and increasing corporate value with these strategies. Our business portfolio will be as follows. Domestic passenger operations are positioned as the core business for the Group as a whole, and we will maintain its proﬁtability. A key to doing so will be building on the powerful competitive position of our 47.8%* share of passengers. We will optimize route and aircraft plans and meticulously set fares to enhance efﬁciency and proﬁtability. International passenger operations will drive growth. We will take maximum advantage of the expansion of arrival and departure slots at metropolitan-area airports and strategically expand our network to energetically capture global demand. We will structure our network with an emphasis on long-haul international routes and connecting demand to capture non-Japanese passenger demand to Japan, third-country demand and high-end Japanese passenger demand. We will continue to leverage the Transpaciﬁc Joint Venture with United Airlines on Paciﬁc routes and the LH/NH Joint Venture with the Lufthansa Group on Europe–Japan routes to globally expand our catchment area. Cargo operations will steadily capture strong cargo distribution demand in Asia, which will enhance the cash ﬂow of this business.

Analysis of the ANA Group Corporate Strategy by President and Chief Executive Officer Shinichiro Ito to differentiate our products and increase added value. We will also expand our route network in ways such as adding freighters, using passenger ﬂights and chartering the aircraft of Nippon Cargo Airlines Co., Ltd. Our mission in the LCC business is to structure a new revenue model by creating new demand in segments that the ANA brand does not serve. The keys to fulﬁlling this mission are an intense focus on low-cost service and the ability to capture demand from other forms of transportation such as railroads and highway express buses. We dissolved our joint venture with AirAsia Bhd., but we have not changed our view that the LCC business has signiﬁcant growth potential in Japan. We ourselves will establish a new LCC brand that is appropriate for the Japanese market and make sure it is firmly rooted as a growth business. We will also generate further growth through the strategic investments in Asia, expansion and diversification of business segments I mentioned earlier. The key point of our strategy is that it will raise the probability that the ANA Group will achieve its medium-term value creation targets by increasing the Group’s revenue domains. Numerical Targets for the Year Ending March 2014 and Medium-Term Value Creation Targets Aiming for Growth of the Top Line and Profit through Steady Strategy Execution We decided to formulate our business plan in stages because delays in resuming Boeing 787 service and delivery were longer than we originally assumed. ANA Group FY2013-2015 Corporate Strategy therefore only has an earnings plan for the year ending March 2014. Boeing 787 aircraft resumed scheduled service from June 2013. However, our earnings plan for the year ending March 2014 assumed service would resume in July 2013. Incorporating factors such as depressed demand on China routes and the trend toward a weaker yen, we forecast that operating revenues will increase 8.5% compared with the year ended March 2013 to ¥1,610.0 billion, operating income will increase 5.9% to ¥110.0 billion, and net income will increase 4.3% to ¥45.0 billion. We have expanded capacity on both domestic and international routes, so we expect available seat-kilometers on domestic routes to increase 4.5%* year on year, on international routes to increase 13.8%,* and available ton-kilometers on international routes to increase 14.6%. We plan to update the details of our business and earnings plan for the year ending March 2015 onward once the Boeing 787 delivery schedule is settled and the allocation of international arrival and departure slots at Haneda Airport scheduled for 2014 is decided. The constant management reforms we implemented in the challenging operating environment of the past several years strengthened our ﬁnances. We therefore believe we should place additional emphasis on the distribution of proﬁts to shareholders. We will generate growth in earnings over the medium-to-long term and increase shareholder returns while making capital expenditures to ensure growth potential and future earnings and enhancing the internal capital resources that support stable operations. We paid cash dividends of ¥4.00 per share in the ﬁscal year ended March 2013, for a consolidated payout ratio of 29.6%, and plan to pay cash dividends of ¥4.00 per share in the ﬁscal year ending March 2014. Our medium-term value creation targets have not changed since we announced ANA Group FY2012-2013 Corporate Strategy: operating income of ¥150.0 billion or above, operating margin of 10.0% or above, ROA of 8% or above and ROE of 10% or above. Annual Report 2013 25 As I discussed earlier, we are holding off on announcing performance targets for the year ending March 2015 onward. However, we are already in range to achieve the above medium-term value creation targets during ANA Group FY2013-2015 Corporate Strategy. While we need to stay abreast of trends in the external environment and risks associated with ﬂuctuating conditions in the fuel and foreign exchange markets, by resolving the issues we are dealing with now and steadily executing the strategy I have outlined, we will achieve our targets by the year ending March 2016. * Including AirAsia Japan Cash Flow Management and Capital Expenditure Plan Generating Reliable Free Cash Flow While Continuing Investment in Aircraft We have not changed our commitment to ensuring that we produce free cash ﬂow by steadily generating cash from operations to fund ongoing capital expenditures that will support earnings growth over the medium and long term. The ANA Group had to revise some components of its former capital expenditure plan to accommodate changes in the Boeing 787 aircraft delivery schedule. We will concentrate on obtaining competitive aircraft by continuing with planned introductions and upgrades of highly economical aircraft. We plan to introduce a total of 17 aircraft during the year ending March 2014: 10 Boeing 787s, three Boeing 777-200ERs, three Boeing 737-800s and one Bombardier DHC-8-400. At the same time, we plan to retire a total of 16 aircraft, including all ﬁve of the Boeing 747-400s we own. Creating the Foundation to Ensure Success in Achieving Targets Promoting Enhanced Global CSR to Fulfill Our Mission Statement and Management Vision The ANA Group formulated a new Group Mission Statement and Group Management Vision in April 2013 given changes in our operating environment and our shift to a holding company structure. The ANA Group sees CSR as the achievement of its Mission Statement and Management Vision. We believe that we must put them into practice in the course of our daily corporate activities to help to create the society of the future by growing sustainably while earning the conﬁdence and trust of society. Above all, we are expanding our business globally, so we believe that we must promote global-level CSR that contributes to the creation of corporate value while guarding us against various risks in Japan and around the world. We have therefore formulated eight key CSR policies over the medium term for the priority issues we have identiﬁed. We then drew on the ISO26000 international guidance for social responsibility to collate a new set of the target vectors for each ANA Group company by clarifying what stakeholders expect from the ANA Group. We aim to strengthen our management fundamentals and increase the value of our brands with CSR policies at the core by deepening CSR management across the entire ANA Group. The grounding of Boeing 787 aircraft may have troubled our stakeholders, but we ﬁnally resumed service in June 2013 without incident. Naturally, we continue to maintain safe service within a highly competent organization centered on the Maintenance Division. Further, the ANA Group is fulﬁlling 26 ANA HOLDINGS INC. Analysis of the ANA Group Corporate Strategy by President and Chief Executive Officer Shinichiro Ito its responsibilities as the launch customer for the Boeing 787. We want to earn the conﬁdence of our customers, so our activities include safety publications and appropriately themed and timed presentations for interested parties. Moreover, we have speciﬁcally targeted positive evaluations of customer satisfaction and on-time performance by external institutions. This ongoing focus generated excellent results in the year ended March 2013. Among other honors, the ANA Group became the ﬁrst Japanese airline to receive SKYTRAX’s highest 5-Star Airline Rating. Moreover, FlightStats Inc. recognized the ANA Group as world number one for on-time arrival performance and lowest in global cancellations among network global airlines, and Air Transport World magazine gave the ANA Group the Airline of the Year Award. We are grateful for the support of our stakeholders, and proud of the ceaseless efforts of each and every employee. We are committed to devoting ourselves to succeeding at new challenges while valuing our people, who are the source of further international growth. Epilogue A Corporate Culture That Takes on Challenges and the Power to Execute Steadily Will Increase Corporate Value The ANA Group began making further signiﬁcant progress in April 2013 under a new management structure. Our efforts to date have established the foundation to move to the next stage in achieving further growth. We built this foundation by quickly accommodating changes in demand, working vigorously to transform ourselves, and completing all of our various reforms as planned while dealing with numerous event risks. Passenger and cargo ﬂows that are now global in scale, the globalization of the economy, astonishing growth in Asia, capacity expansion at metropolitan-area airports, and airline deregulation are bringing an era of mega competition to the airline industry. We must now take on the challenge of proving we can become one of the world’s leading airline groups and that we have the fundamental conﬁdence and trust of people to connect the world and contribute to its future. The ANA Group has a history of taking on challenges. We went into business 60 years ago with two helicopters, then began serving international routes as restrictions fell away and became the ﬁrst Japanese airline to join an alliance. We were ﬁrst in the world to introduce the Boeing 787, and the ﬁrst airline in Japan to enter the LCC business. The ANA Group will be able to achieve sustained growth and increase corporate value if we devote ourselves to executing ANA Group FY2013-2015 Corporate Strategy and unite in continuing to take on challenges. As we do so, we are counting on the continued goodwill of our stakeholders.

ANA’s first international flight was in 1986. We have been expanding our own operations, but at the same time, we have relied heavily on our partner airlines to cover a wider network and increase our revenue. Joining Star Alliance, the largest alliance in the world, was a big step forward for ANA. Since we became a member of Star Alliance, our strategy for international business has continued to evolve. This feature explores the background of the alliance in the airline industry and the progress and future of the ANA Group’s alliance strategy for its international business through an interview with Mio Yamamuro of the ANA Alliances & International Affairs Department, whose experience includes a secondment at Star Alliance headquarters.

Annual Report 2013 39 Business Overview Air Transportation By making sure to seize new opportunities while implementing cost restructuring, the ANA Group expects continued growth in operating revenues and income in the fiscal year ending March 2014. Among the world’s airlines, the ANA Group ranks 9th in the number of revenue passengers on domestic routes and 14th in the number of total revenue passengers. To deal with a wide range of passengers’ requirements while offering convenient air transportation, the various companies in the Group provide services related to the air transportation business, including operation of passenger and cargo flights by four Group airline companies (as of March 31, 2013), as well as aircraft maintenance, handling at airports and other services. During the fiscal year ended March 2013, demand for air transport continued to grow, backed by post-earthquake recovery and other factors, despite uncertainties Osamu Shinobe about economic conditions in Europe, China and elsewhere. The grounding of Member of the Board of Boeing 787 aircraft reduced operating revenues by approximately ¥7.0 billion, and Directors of ANA Holdings Inc., President & lost operating revenues resulting from the territorial disputes over the Senkaku Chief Executive Officer of Islands and Takeshima Islands was approximately ¥10.0 billion. Under these condiAll Nippon Airways Co., Ltd. tions, the ANA Group focused on capturing demand for business travel and conducting measures to stimulate demand for leisure travel. As a result, operating revenues of the air transportation business increased 4.8% compared with the previous fiscal year to ¥1,323.5 billion. Fuel and operation-linked expenses increased with the expansion of the scope of operations, but by promoting cost structure reforms that went beyond the initial plan, the ANA Group was able to hold down operating expenses to ¥1,229.4 billion, an increase of 4.7% from the previous fiscal year. As a result, operating income for the fiscal year ended March 2013 increased 6.3% year on year to ¥94.0 billion. In the fiscal year ending March 2014, while incorporating factors including the grounding of Boeing 787 aircraft* and slack demand centered on China routes, the ANA Group assumes that demand for air transport will increase in the second half in light of the recovery in business confidence. With regard to capacity, the Group will focus on expanding international passenger operations, and consequently forecasts air transportation operating revenues of ¥1,440.0 billion, an increase of 8.8% compared with the fiscal year ended March 2013, and operating income of ¥99.0 billion, an increase of 5.2%. * Although the resumption of operations was assumed to be in July 2013 when drawing up the plan for the fiscal year ending March 2014, regularly scheduled flights actually resumed in June 2013. 40 ANA HOLDINGS INC.

Environmental Initiatives Improving Flight Procedures The ANA Group has devised various flight procedures to reduce the impact of flight noise at ground level. ▶Primary Noise Abatement Procedures Implemented by ANA Procedure Overview Takeoff Steepest climb procedure Execute a steeper takeoff climb to a higher altitude than usual (to 3,000 feet), so as to keep noise contained within the airport as much as possible, while suppressing noise by attaining high altitudes in residential areas. Conventional path Residential area Runway Landing Delayed flap-down approach Delay flap-down and landing-gear-down operations to reduce air resistance to the airframe, so as to decrease the required engine thrust, thereby reducing noise. Low flap angle landing Set smaller flap angle for use during final approach to reduce air resistance to the airframe, so as to decrease the required engine thrust, thereby reducing noise. Landing and Takeoff Preferential runway If one side of the runway does not have a residential area, aircraft will take off and land from that direction, wind direction and velocity permitting. Residential area Runway Ocean Preferential flight path In the airport vicinity (at lower altitude), select flight paths that pass over rivers or that avoid residential areas as much as possible. River Residential area Runway Continuous descent using FMS1 This procedure uses the FMS VNAV function for VNAV2 function non-precision approaches. Higher altitude is maintained until reaching the vicinity of the airport, followed by continuous descent to reduce change in engine thrust, thereby abating noise. This procedure Conventional path can save fuel as well. Active runway Residential area RNAV3/LLZ4 flight Use RNAV/LLZ in the airport vicinity while avoiding residential areas and shortening flight path. In the case of late-night flights at Haneda, avoid passing over Kisarazu (land area) and approach for landing via shortcut over the water. 1. FMS: Flight Management System, which uses flight conditions to calculate optimum speed and course as the basis for automatically adjusting engine output and flight controls 2. VNAV: Vertical Navigation, a function that allows approach at a fixed angle of descent by registering information about the descent path in advance 3. RNAV: Area navigation, a navigation method that assures the scheduled flight path using radio-navigation facilities as well as satellite and on-board equipment 4. LLZ: Localizer, a system that indicates the horizontal deviation of landing aircraft from the runway centerline using electromagnetic waves Annual Report 2013 97 Promoting Reduced Use of Resources The ANA Group’s 3R Activities Recycling of Uniforms The ANA Group recycles trash generated in aircraft Used uniforms of cabin attendants, ground staff and and at airports and offices, and promotes resource flight crews are returned to their original fiber and reused conservation and recycling. as automotive acoustic absorption materials.
