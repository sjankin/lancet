Workplace Bullying Breakfast Dean & Ling Executive’s Managing Director, Ian Hackett attended a Workplace Bullying Breakfast (organised by En Masse in conjunction with Middletons Lawyers) in the middle of the year. Ian shared the seminar content with the Dean & Ling Executive group. UCOPEA The team at Dean & Ling Executive attended an introduction to UCOPEA seminar in the last quarter of 2012. En Masse developed UCOPEA, an innovative and unique, easy-to-follow coping skills and problem-solving model that allows managers and executives to effectively tackle the issues that commonly accompany a changing workplace environment. 3 D & L Continuous change is becoming a way of life for organisations, employees and managers alike. With organisational change occurring at a more rapid pace than ever before, the ability to identify, cope with, and capitalise on organisational change is becoming a requirement of effective managers, and has the potential to affect every level of organisational life. Some people view change positively, and see it as an exciting opportunity to learn and grow. Others see change negatively, as something to fear and to avoid. It’s important to know how to cope with change, because quite frankly, it is unavoidable. Organisations are continuously shifting, growing, downsizing, merging, and acquiring people and resources. The rapid development of technology means that we need to learn new ways of working and communicating. We also need to know how to cope with smaller changes, such as getting to know a new team member, or learning new standards in a particular industry. People who resist change will likely find themselves overlooked for important projects, passed over for promotions, or left behind entirely. The inability to cope with change can also lead to great stress, and other negative physical and psychological effects. A new and innovative coping model For people managers, coping with and assisting teams to cope with the stress of change, or indeed tackle everyday challenges can be a difficult road to navigate with frustrating twists, turns and roadblocks. 4 D & L UCOPEA is a six step framework that builds coping skills and ensures that workplace challenges are dealt with thoroughly, so that staff can move on and focus on the job at hand. UCOPEA is based on over 20 years of research evidence into how people tend to think and respond to workplace and broader issues, including significant breakthroughs in cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and positive psychology. UCOPEA can be used for:  workplace relationship issues  client problems  communication glitches  mental health issues; and  problems at home that impact workplace performance. 2.2 Environment Dean & Ling Executive is committed to a sustainable future through the adoption of environmentally responsible policies and practices. As part of this commitment, we acknowledge our responsibility to reduce the impact that our business operations will have on the environment. Earlier this year Dean & Ling Executive replaced its use of bottled water with a chilled water filter under the sink. Our other existing environmentally friendly policies are detailed below.  Recycling of consumables.  Recycling of in-house paper.  Double sided photocopying whenever possible.  Purchasing of recycled paper.  Turning off of equipment when not in use.  E-Xmas cards in lieu of sending paper cards and making a donation to charity. This year we are supporting Alzheimer’s Australia. 5 D & L 2.3 Anti-Corruption Background Checks Quality reference checking is an integral part of our recruitment process. It is Dean & Ling Executive’s policy and commitment to undertake a minimum of two reference checks for each placed candidate utilising a Reference Check Questionnaire. Our commitment to the undertaking of these reference checks and other checks such as academic checks and police checks support that a candidate is who they say they are and have done what they say they have done. 6
