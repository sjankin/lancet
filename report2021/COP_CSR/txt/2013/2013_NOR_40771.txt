To achieve this position the Board sanctioned investments in a feed plant in Norway and the acquisition of Morpol, the world’s leading processor of salmon. Low spot prices A 22% increase in the global supply of salmon resulted in a significant decline in the spot prices compared to 2011. Prices in Europe declined less than in other markets, with a reduction of 10% (NOS FCA Oslo). Corresponding reductions in the US reference prices (Urner Barry Miami and Seattle) were 29% and 26% respectively. Record high harvest volume A total of 392 306 tonnes gutted weight was harvested in 2012, which constituted an increase of 14% compared to 2011. The majority of the growth came from Norway, as a result of an ideal winter and summer for production, combined with good operations. Cost improvements in farming Compared to 2011, the full cost per kg of a standard gutted and boxed fish was down for Norwegian, Chilean, Canadian and Faroese salmon. Salmon of Scottish and Irish origin were disadvantaged by the effects of Amoebic Gill Disease (AGD). Operational improvements contributed to the cost reductions. Disappointing figures in VAP Europe 2012 was a disappointing year for VAP Europe, due to an unfavourable product mix and inefficiencies in production. To address the challenges, a new management structure was established and several actions have been taken to improve the performance going forward. Good cash flow and solidity Cash flow from operations was good, given the challenging market conditions, and amounted to NOK 1 553 million. The measures taken to protect the cash flow during 2011 and 2012 contributed significantly to the strong figure. Marine Harvest’s target for solidity is NIBD/equity below 0.5. At yearend 2012 the NIBD/equity ratio was 0.46. Progress on key sustainability measures Marine Harvest tracks key performance indicators for the 4 guiding principles; Profit, Planet, Product and People. In 2012, progress was reported in the key indicators for all areas. In the Planet area, the number of fish escaped and the use of antibiotics was reduced significantly by 96% and 70% respectively. In the People area the number of LTI’s per million hours worked was reduced by 27%. DEAR SHAREHOLDERS 7 DEAR SHAREHOLDERS 2012 was an eventful year for Marine Harvest. Profit absolute volume growth was in Norway. The Norwegian growth resulted from ideal winter and summer conditions for production with close to optimal seawater temperatures, wise we were challenged by low market prices which combined with good operations. In 2012 our business unit in Norway stands out as the resulted in a weak financial result for the Group. best performing unit, with region West doing particularly well. This was influenced in particular by the Americas, Operationally, most units improved with regards to growth, feed conversion, harvest volume and the quality of fish produced compared to previous years. Our operation in Canada where the main source of supply, Chile, increased showed good development throughout the year, which is a result of the improvement plan production by 65%. Operationally we continue to embarked on in 2011. We have concentrated our activity around the best performing sites and this has yielded positive results. Production cost and quality issues have been signifiimprove and through our effort to strengthen our cantly reduced and we are ahead of our target of being able to deliver Canadian salmon value added business with the acquisition of Morpol to Los Angeles at a cost below the level of salmon of Chilean origin. With regards to our Chilean operation, we remain cautious in our approach. The biological cost of Chilean and our greenfield investment into feed, we will be salmon increased in 2012 and the number of treatments for sea lice escalated. The survival able to deliver more stable earnings over time. of the fish remains good, but is, as expected, developing towards a slightly lower survival rate. The good news from Chile is the suggested, new regulations. If these are implemented and enforced they will, to a greater extent, secure the future for Chilean salmon farming. Supply surge resulting in price pressure In the Planet area, we achieved significant progress in reducing the number of escaped 2012 was a challenging year with regards to spot prices. The global supply of salmon fish. In 2012, 3 150 fish escaped from Marine Harvest sites compared to 71 515 in 2011. increased by 22%, which resulted in a temporary supply/demand imbalance and put The number of incidents was also reduced and we maintain our target of zero escapes pressure on prices. This was a particular challenge in the Americas, where the prices both going forward. Salmon lice continue to be a challenge in most operating countries and in the US and Brazil fell to a level well below production cost. The prices in Europe and several long term research projects are on-going to improve the situation. Our efforts Americas are currently diverging from a historic pattern of strong correlation. In 2012 the will continue in 2013. European market was able to handle the supply growth in a better way than its American counterpart, which underpins the very strong position of salmon in the European market. The main challenge with regards to disease in 2012 was Amoebic Gill Disease (AGD), Marine Harvest was prepared for this challenging market situation through the actions which affected us in both Scotland and Ireland. The disease resulted in increased mortaltaken in 2011 to preserve cash. ity in our stocks, but we gained significant knowledge from the incident which allows us to be prepared should it happen again. We now have good monitoring systems and Towards the end of the year there was a global uplift in salmon prices. This indicates an better treatment methods in place compared to 2012. improved balance between supply and demand and highlights the strength of our main product and the global demand for this healthy protein. The sustainability with regards to the use of fish oil is a field where we are applying substantial resources. We met our standards for EPA/DHA in our fish in 2012, but the set Growing downstream – investing in elaborated salmon capacity target levels are challenged from a sustainability point of view (availability of marine raw In 2012 Marine Harvest acquired 48.5 % of the world’s leading value added processor of materials) and will have to be reviewed going forward, and further research will be applied salmon, Morpol. This acquisition is in line with our strategy of developing the Group into to find the final solution. an integrated protein company based on healthy protein from the ocean. The acquisition will, subject to approval by the competition authorities, significantly strengthen our In the Product area, our ambition is to deliver assured healthy, tasty and responsibly downstream operations. Marine Harvest intends to continue to develop downstream to produced seafood to our customers. In 2012 we had one major incident resulting in a be able to supply our customers with user friendly and healthy products. voluntary recall of smoked products in the USA, involving products from our smokehouse in Chile. As a result of the incident we have improved our standards of operation. In line with the strategy to increase our capacity for elaborated seafood production, Marine Harvest in 2012 also opened a major new processing facility in Boulogne (France) The focus on employee safety – People remains firm in the organisation and in 2012 most with focus on modified atmosphere packaged products (MAP). In addition, we opened of our employees attended safety training. Our focus on safety resulted in a reduction in the a small processing line in the Czech Republic and a new greenfield factory in Osaka number of LTI’s (per million hours worked) of 27% (21% in numbers of LTI’s). Our goal was a (Japan) to produce value added products close to our customers. The Osaka plant is reduction of 35%. Safety will continue to be a focus area in Marine Harvest going forward. our second in Japan. Bright outlook Expanding upstream – greenfield in fish feed We expect the supply/demand situation in 2013 to be more balanced than in 2012 and Marine Harvest decided in 2012 to enter into feed production. Feed accounts for this is expected to contribute to improved profit. We will continue our focus on the end approximately 50 % of our cost base. Feed is essential with regards to the performance consumer and our emphasis will be on convenience and availability, to make our tasty of our fish and the quality of our end product. The positioning in feed is essential in and healthy products available for new markets. transforming our company from a production oriented farming company to an integrated protein company. Feed will be operated as a separate Business Area in Marine Harvest The industry’s environmental challenges still require new solutions. Throughout 2012 we but interlinked with our other Business Areas, farming and sales and marketing. Our first strengthened our R&D organisation and we have several on-going projects with promising feed plant (located in Bjugn, Region Mid, Norway) is a significant investment of NOK 800 preliminary results. We have seen a movement towards better regulations for the industry million. The plant will have a production capacity of 220 000 tonnes, which can easily be in the past year, especially in Chile. There is still room for improvement in most countries expanded at a later stage. and Marine Harvest will continue to advocate smarter and better regulations in the countries we operate. Our guiding principles and their development in 2012 With regards to the development of our 4 guiding principles ( Profit, Planet, Product and In March 2013 we launched a new vision – “leading the blue revolution”. By this we mean People) we were as expected challenged on profitability in 2012. As a result of the market that we want to be a leader in cultivating and growing food in the ocean. We want to make situation our earnings were hit and we significantly underperformed with regards to our a difference in the world through what we do and who we are. In accordance with the ROCE target of 10 %, achieving only 3.6%. This result was significantly impacted by the vision we will re-vitalise our corporate values. These will be launched later in the year, losses sustained by our Chilean and Canadian farming operations. building on our history of passion and pride, innovative ideas and sustainable development. Through the measures taken both late in 2011 and during 2012 to reduce investments, working capital and smolt transfers, we managed to achieve our target for solidity of NIBD/equity below 0.5. At year end our NIBD/equity ratio was 0.46. Alf-Helge Aarskog Our harvest volume in 2012 increased by 14% compared to the previous year.

To achieve the Economist wrote an article about the blue revolution, and the importance of this position, the Board sanctioned investments in a feed plant in Norway and the cultivating and growing food in the sea. As of today 2% of the world’s food supply acquisition of Morpol – the world’s leading processor of salmon. The feed plant comes from the ocean, but it is a clear understanding that more food needs to come will strengthen the Group’s production side, secure access to first class feed and from this source in the future for 3 reasons: improve traceability. The Morpol acquisition will, subject to approval by the relevant competition authorities, provide the Group access to state of the art processing Firstly, the wild fish supply is not expected to cover the increased demand from global technology and facilities, and provide market access to geographies where Marine population growth. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) projects Harvest currently has limited presence. that the world’s wild fish harvest will be down by 2% from 2011 to 2012. In absolute volume, the wild fish harvest has been relatively stable from the late eighties until Upstream integration Fish Feed: today, while the wild fish catch per person has dropped dramatically, from 17 kg per Feed is a central cost component in production of Atlantic salmon. Feed is also person at its height in 1988 to 13 kg in 2012—a 37-year low. While wild fish harvests important with regards to sustainability, and for the quality of the end product. have flattened out during this time, the output from fish farming has soared from Feed production is a new field of operation for Marine Harvest, and through 24 million tonnes in the mid-1990s to a projected 67 million tonnes in 2012. With a establishing our first factory, we will increase our knowledge with regards to feed global population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, the only way of securing ingredients, and more importantly how to adapt the feed to our fish. Initially, Marine access to fish proteins at affordable prices for an increased population, is by Harvest will invest in a plant located in Bjugn, Norway. The location, and the size of cultivating and growing food in ocean. the plant of 220 000 tonnes has been decided based on the location of the majority of Marine Harvest sea sites in Norway.

Great progress was recorded in feed efficiency in 2012 (reduced feed that our Norwegian operation now has positioned itself among the most cost conversion ratios) and the underlying performance of our Scottish salmon is good. efficient of the major salmon producers in Norway. Price and volume development Price and volume development The spot prices for fresh salmon of Scottish origin in general follow the development The European spot price for fresh salmon was significantly lower in 2012 than in in the Norwegian spot prices. A significant reduction in the price level was recorded 2011 as the supply/demand balance deteriorated. As a result, the achieved price was during 2012. As a result the achieved price was down by 5% compared to 2011. As down by 16% compared to 2011. Towards the end of the year, the market balance for salmon of Norwegian origin, prices increased significantly towards the end of the improved and prices started to increase. The overall price achieved was 7% higher year. The overall price achieved was 17% higher than the reference price. Both spot than the reference price. Both spot and contract sales contributed to the favourable and contract sales contributed to the favourable price achievement. The contract price achievement. The contract share for salmon of Norwegian origin was 31% in contribution was slightly higher in 2012 than in 2011. The contract share for salmon 2012 compared to 46% in 2011. The quality was good with a superior share of 90%. of Scottish origin was 60% in 2012 compared to 53% in 2011. The quality of Scottish salmon was excellent with a superior share of 96%. During 2012, we experienced high growth for fish in sea. This was due to a historically mild winter, combined with increased stocking in 2011. As a result, harvest volume During 2012, we experienced high growth rates for fish in sea, but due to temporary was record high, 17% above the 2011 level at 255 306 tonnes gutted weight (217 510 reduction in our smolt stocking in 2011 and AGD related challenges, the harvest tonnes). volume was reduced by 20% from 2011 to 40 261 tonnes gutted weight (50 174 tonnes). Costs and operations Costs and operations Compared to 2011, the overall cost level for our Norwegian salmon has been slightly Compared to 2011, the full cost level for our Scottish salmon increased by 13% reduced, despite an increase in the cost of feed and lice mitigation costs. Feed raw due to reduced volume, early harvest and additional costs due to AGD. Due to the material prices started to increase in the third quarter contributing to increased significant improvement in the feed conversion ratio, the feed cost for harvested feed cost. Improved biological feed conversion ratio and reduced mortality partially biomass was reduced from 2011, while labour, medication and other direct farming mitigated the effect of increasing feed prices during the year. The cost per kg for costs increased as a result of AGD. Scale disadvantages compared to 2011 further standing biomass at year end 2012 was in line with the cost at the end of 2011. contributed to increased cost per kg. Sea lice mitigation costs were high throughout the year as a result of numerous The AGD situation was calm during the fourth quarter due to reduced sea water treatments to maintain the sea lice load below the trigger limits. Continuous efforts temperatures and good treatment practices. Prevention plans have been implemented are required from the industry to find long-term solutions for this challenge. At including surveillance, site training and preparations for treatment, if the challenge yearend 2012, the sea lice count was lower than at the end of the previous 3 years. should rise again in 2013. At yearend 2012, the sea lice count was lower than at the end of 2011. During 2012 there were no sites diagnosed with PD in Scotland. For During 2012 the number of sites diagnosed with Pancras Disease (PD) increased biomass in sea, the cost per kg was lower at year end 2012 than at the end of 2011. compared to 2011. The disease spread north, but the recognised mortality has been Excepting the effect of AGD, the underlying mortality rate for our Scottish salmon significantly reduced from prior years as the virus has been less aggressive. As has been good. The average monthly mortality including AGD increased from 0.5% the underlying mortality for our Norwegian salmon has been higher than in other to 0.8% from 2011 to 2012.

The reduction in margin was a result of lower achieved prices, lower volume and increased costs. 30 PROFIT SALMON OF CHILEAN ORIGIN 2012 and the fourth quarter reference prices were also for salmon of Canadian origin 2012 became a challenging year for our salmon of Chilean origin due to an increasthe lowest observed for any quarter over the last 6 years. As a result, the achieved ing cost level and a very challenging market. Increased biological challenges (higher price was down by 21% compared to 2011. As for salmon of European origin, prices lice count and less favourable growth conditions) are causing concern. We believe started to increase towards the end of the year. Due to the effects of Kudoa (soft that the newly proposed regulations will restore the foundation for sustainable fish flesh) and an elevated share of downgraded products, the overall price achieved was farming in Chile, provided that they are enforced. 2% lower than the reference price in 2012.

The contract share for The spot prices in the American market continued to deteriorate throughout 2012 salmon of Canadian origin was 5% in the 2012 compared to 18% in 2011. and the fourth quarter reference prices were the lowest observed for any quarter over the last 6 years. As a result, the achieved price was down by 16% compared to During the year, the growth rates for fish in sea improved, which combined with 2011. As for salmon of European origin, prices increased towards the end of the year. stocking effects contributed to a 19% increase in harvested volume compared The overall price achieved was 10% higher than the reference price. Both spot and to 2011. The 2012 volume was 40 217 tonnes gutted weight (33 917 tonnes). contract sales contributed to the favourable price achievement. The contract contribution was higher in 2012 than in 2011. The contract share for salmon of Costs and operations Chilean origin was 30% in the 2012, which was the same as in 2011. The quality Compared to 2011, the full cost level for our Canadian salmon has been reduced of Chilean salmon was slightly lower than normal with a superior share of 90%. by 7% due to increased volume and operational cost reductions. The biological cost was reduced by 5% due to improved production efficiency.

Operational EBIT per kg harvested was NOK 1.40 (NOK 7.99). smoked product from Delifish. SALMON OF FAROESE ORIGIN SALMON OF CANADIAN ORIGIN At the beginning of the year, our Faroese fish was challenged by high sea lice levels, 2012 was operationally a year of good improvement for our Canadian operations affecting both the achieved price and the cost level. In the second half of the year, thanks to the efforts made to restructure the operation. Unfortunately the challenging US harvested fish was of excellent quality and as a result both the price achievement marked made 2012 a loss making year, as prices were significantly below a sustainable and the cost level developed favourably. Volume harvested during the year was level. The current cost per kg biomass in sea is significantly lower than at the end of 6 893 tonnes gutted weight (5 927 tonnes). Salmon of Faroese origin achieved an 2010 and 2011. operational EBIT of NOK 12 million in 2012 (NOK 61 million). Operational EBIT per kg harvested was NOK 1.76 (NOK 10.23). Price and volume development As indicated above, the spot prices in the American market deteriorated throughout PROFIT 31 VALUE ADDED PRODUCTION IN EUROPE 2012 was a disappointing year for our value added operations in Europe as our yield and efficiency was low, while an unfavourable product mix, with high sales of bulk products, contributed to further margin squeeze. Several actions to improve the performance of our VAP operations have been taken in 2012 and we are confident that the on-going processes will restore the operations to satisfactory returns. Price and volume development Marine Harvest VAP Europe’s operating revenues were NOK 3 944 million in 2012 (NOK 4 268 million). Volume sold was 2% higher than in 2011 while the average price achieved in EUR was 6% lower than in the previous year. The price reduction was due to the trend towards less elaborated products lower input prices and reduced sales of smoked products compared to 2011. There is fierce competition in the smoked market, which influenced both prices and margins achieved. The downturn in many European economies dampened the holiday sales of high priced smoked products, reducing the normal Christmas effect on sales. The salmon sales volume increased by 7% compared to 2011. Fresh salmon sales picked up during the year as a result of reduced consumer prices and high promotional activity, but market pressure and unfavourable mix negatively influenced the margins achieved. Sales of Atlantic salmon accounted for 66% of the total sales value in 2012 (67%). Costs and operations Raw material prices were reduced from 2011 due to the reduction in spot market prices for salmon. Extensive price pressure resulted in the raw material price reductions quickly being overtaken by the major retail chains looking for ways to compensate for losses in the seafood category in 2011, when the spot salmon prices were high. As a result, the reduction in spot prices for salmon, did not immediately contribute to increased sales volumes. The unfavourable mix further affected the unitary cost and margin structure. To address the increasing challenges, a new management was put in place in 2012. Several actions to improve the performance of our European VAP operations have been initiated and we expect these to return the operations to satisfactory returns going forward. On 28. May, Marine Harvest opened a new production plant in Boulogne, France. The plant focuses on fresh production, with extended capacity for modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) products. This is in line with our communicated strategy of expanded elaborated production capacity. Profit performance The achieved profit was significantly reduced compared to 2011 due to the less favourable mix and higher costs. Operational EBIT ended at NOK 6 million in 2012 (NOK 108 million). The margin contribution from salmon (mainly salmon of Norwegian origin) was NOK 5 million, while the contribution from other species was NOK 1 million in 2012. 32 PLANET PLANET � SUSTAINABLE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT All Marine Harvests operations and the long-term profitability ultimately depend on CARBON FOOTPRINT sustainable and environmentally responsible Measured as kg CO2/kg edible part at slaughter interactions with the natural environment. To maintain fish health, avoid escapes and minimise the environmental impact of the operations, the Group needs the best skilled people. CLIMATE FRIENDLY FOOD PRODUCTION 2.9 The opportunity: The world’s demand for protein is increasing as a result of rapid population growth combined with rising average income levels across the globe. Farmed fish is the most climate friendly protein source, and will thus become an important solution to providing the world with vitally important proteins while limiting climate change. When comparing the CO2 footprint of farmed salmon to traditional meat production, the CO2 footprint for the farmed salmon is 2.9 kg CO2 equivalents/kg of edible 5.9 product whereas corresponding numbers are 5.9 and 30 for pork and beef respectively (SINTEF, 2009). Three reasons why farming salmon is an efficient way of producing meat Firstly, the body temperature of a salmon is the same as its surroundings; it therefore does not need to spend energy in keeping the body temperature higher than the environment it lives in. Furthermore, salmon is almost weightless in water and does not need to build a strong skeleton nor spend a lot of energy to keep its body upright. Secondly, farmed salmon is an excellent protein and energy converter, 30 which means that the little energy it uses, it uses efficiently in terms of converting feed into edible meat. The percent protein retained in edible parts of the salmon GUIDING PRINCIPLE AMBITION 2012 ACHIEVEMENT Feed sustainability Only use marine feed Reduced the dependency ingredients certified as on marine raw materials sustainable and reduce (fish meal inclusion reduced dependency on marine for all farming countries proteins. except Ireland.

In other words, producing proteins by farming salmon with sustainably sourced feed During 2012 we have made efforts to establish a uniform data collection process is exceptionally good resource management. for greenhouse gas emissions throughout the Group, and as part of this we have worked to further improve the quality of our CO2 measurements and conversion The challenge: At the same time as fish farming may be part of a solution to reduce factors. From 2013 on we will aggregate data on direct and indirect CO2 emissions. greenhouse gas, climate change also poses a potential challenge to our industry. Fish farming is dependent on thriving aquatic ecosystems which are particularly While working to improve our internal reporting on greenhouse gases and indirect vulnerable to the effects of a warming planet.

In Marine Harvest we therefore see the focus on reducing global CO2 emissions as an important factor to ensure further growth of the industry, as well as an area where The methodology used in collection of climate gas information is according to the we have to focus and further improve. As climate change could potentially entail Greenhouse Gas (GHG) protocoll, scope 1 (direct emissions – generated energy) detrimental effects for our industry, it is important that we do our part to contribute and scope 2 (indirect emissions – purchased energy).

However, we estimate the margin of errors to be up to 15% for direct emissions, in particular for fuel oil consumption. Improving our data quality is among our top priorities for 2013. Measured in emission per tonne harvested, the figure has been further reduced as a result of a much higher volume in 2012 compared to 2011. The use of diesel and electricity 26 786 24 505 25 827 generates most of the emission. In order to reduce our CO2 emissions, we will focus on efficiency improvements in our packing and distribution, encourage customers Energy generation to order less ice in boxes, strive to reduce our use of petrol and diesel, and buy and install more energy efficient marine engines and machinery. Electricity 2010 2011 2012 Electricity is used at processing sites as well as at the sales and distribution centers, diesel is used for transportation of fish, while fuel oil and natural gas is used for heating. Priorities going forward TOTAL ENERGY USE Marine Harvest’s focus is to reduce our carbon footprint through optimising the energy we use throughout our value chain. 762 711 �TJ� 539 The efficient use of feed is a key priority when reducing our carbon footprint going forward. Feed is one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the fish farming value chain, and the cost of feed also represents 55% of the total cost of production. The efficient use of feed is therefore both key to profitability, as well as to improving our carbon footprint. 475 400 436 Another challenge affecting feed efficiency is fish mortality. Historically, fish mortality rates have been too high in salmon farming. From a business point of view feed fed to fish that do not reach the harvest stage represent economic losses, and from an Purchased electricity environmental point of view, it represents wasted energy use and livestock. Although several of our business units have reduced losses significantly to acceptable levels, 2010 2011 2012 Generated energy there is still room for improvement in Marine Harvest Norway. We therefore make great efforts to continue to reduce the loss. The project Biosecurity Generation Survival Excellence (BGSE – described in the R&D section of this report) has been launched to address this challenge.

Zero escapes during one calendar year is within reach. We vaccinate 100% of our fish against diseases relevant to each region. Biosecurity programmes and veterinary health plans are embedded in our daily farming operations. Further development and repetition of the Marintech testing is targeted in 2013. All our sites are subject to continuous monitoring by fish health professionals. These tests are providing the industry in-depth understanding and supports substantial improvement of farming equipment. During 2012 Marine Harvest also defined and implemented a new, global, standardised mortality categorisation system for recording causes of mortality.

PRODUCT 45 In fish farming, contamination can still potentially occur through polluted waters, poor processing hygiene and cross contamination during handling. Listeria monocytogenes is a potential food-borne bacteria that can grow at low temperatures and potentially cause disease if present in food products that are eaten without prior heat treatment. Since some of our products can be eaten uncooked (e.g. cold smoked products, sushi, sashimi) we give listeria control special attention. A group-wide best practice manual for listeria control has been developed and is used in addition to our other monitoring and control programmes. Further controls include ensuring excellent processing hygiene, including good temperature control from harvest through to customer delivery. This is supported by group wide microbiological monitoring of all classes of fish and products to ensure levels present are below legal limits both in the countries of production and in the markets where we sell our products. The methods of analysis, notification and response are all laid down in our standard operating procedures (SOPs). Incidents related to product quality and food safety: In 2012, all food safety incidents were handled according to our internal routines for incident management and no incidents led to any reported illness or negative impact for the consumers. During the year our internal system for reporting food safety incidents captured 269 reported incidents. 26 of these were defined as more serious cases. We define a food safety incident as a situation that requires specific actions to maintain the safety of our products. Typical Food Safety incidents may be labelling errors related to ingredients that may cause allergies in sensitive individuals or the product’s shelf life. One of the reported food safety incidents in 2012 concerned the detection of Listeria monocytogenes in cold smoked salmon, processed at our factory in Chile. In this case a voluntary recall was carried out in agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA). No illness was reported in relation to the incident and the recall was carried out as a precautionary measure to prevent any risk of food borne disease. The detection and resulting product recall resulted in inventory write-downs amounting to NOK 26 million. Actions have been taken to ensure that no products exceeding the legal limits for listeria will appear on the market going forward. Priorities going forward We will continue to implement and improve our quality systems. As part of this we will continue to invest in research and development projects and activities to improve product quality related parameters. Marine Harvest has activities in many countries and we believe that sharing best practice is an important tool for continuous improvement. The Food Safety & Quality network in Marine Harvest includes members from all our processing facilities and salmon producing units. This network will continue to share knowledge, identify common KPI’s, and ensure clear responsibilities for implementation of agreed actions in each unit. “ Working together – is key for continuous improvement in order to benefit our customers 46 PRODUCT HEALTHY SEAFOOD with sustainability aspects.

Marine Harvest considers for the promotion and defense of their occupational interests including the right to safety to be a value in the same way as money. We believe that if you invest in safety, engage in collective bargaining. The number of employees that are member of workers you actually “buy” additional time that can be well spent. Safety is not about protecting unions and participating in collective bargaining agreements varies across the employees against something, but to protect them for something.

The programme works with the mindset of employees, to develop a safety culture. In the BrainSafe model, three components interact to form this culture; Person, Practice and Work environment. The model distinguishes between controllable and non-controllable elements and the global training has focused on “my life” – the elements that each and every person can control and/or influence. Internally we measure our progress in the safety area through key indicators – Lost PERSON time incidents (LTI) per million hours worked and the rate of absenteeism. Both indicators are followed up monthly, in operational review meetings and by the Board as part of the monthly report review. LTI’s are reported in three categories of seriousness – low, medium and high depending on the number of days lost. Incidents are reported both for own employees and for contract workers. All incidents are analysed for cause and learning effects. Safety targets are included in the bonus MY LIFE agreements for all senior managers. Results in 2012: ENVIRONMENT PRACTICE In 2012, more than 90% of all employees have attended BrainSafe training. In 2013, remaining employees will be trained. We reported 114 lost time incidents for own employees in 2012, a reduction of 30 from 2011. 22 of the incidents were in the high seriousness category, a reduction of 2 from 2011. For contract workers we recorded 10 incidents, which is an increase of 7 50 PEOPLE from 2011.

COMMITMENT TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES In 2012, the Code of Conduct was updated to better describe what is required in Our efforts: situations where a potential conflict between work and personal interests could arise. In Marine Harvest, we are committed to developing the communities in which we operate. Testing in the updated Code was initiated for all employees late 2012. Two key areas receiving support are local schools and athletics teams.

AWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS RECEIVED Our efforts: In Marine Harvest we strive to do our bests and be a leader. Our ambition is to grow, and we believe that long term growth only can be achieved through thinking sustainability from all perspectives; environmental, social and economic. Our effort to develop Marine Harvest is from time to time also recognised by some of our stakeholder, which is highly appreciated throughout the organisation. Results in 2012 In 2012 we received the following rewards/recognitions: Marine Harvest Scotland was awarded the Benromach Award for Excellence in International Business at the 2012 SCDI Highlands & Islands Business Excellence Awards. The reward was associated with the export of salmon to China. In addition, Marine Harvest Scotland’s work with “the Outward Bound Trust” in Scotland was recognised by an invitation to a lunch hosted by HRH The Duke of York, Prince Andrew. “The Outward Bound Trust”, aims to help young people realise their potential through learning in the wild. They create a supportive and challenging environment in which young people can learn about themselves and see what they might truly be capable of achieving in life. HRH The Duke of York, is Chairman of the Trustees and devotes much time to it. Last year, over 26 000 young people went on an Outward Bound course, of which a third were financially supported. Marine Harvest Scotland supported 30 pupils from Lochaber High School on a 4 day course at Ullswater in the Lake District and two pupils from Kinlochleven High School on a 15 day course at Locheilside near Fort William. Marine Harvest Ireland was awarded “Highly commended” for best organic fresh seafood product at the National Organic Food Awards from Bord Bia (Irish Food Board). Marine Harvest Chile was recognised by the Technological University INACAP for its permanent investment in human capital, and the school Eduardo Frey in Palqui gave recognition to the Palqui site for its work with the school in the community. On the personal side, our Chilean HR director, Vilma Cavieres, was awarded “Executive woman of the year” in the tenth region. The objective of this reward is to recognise and visualise the career made by women who have developed an entrepreneurial career on the basis of overcoming difficulties, innovative abilities, social responsibility and entrepreneurial skills in order to inspire and motivate other women to do the same, and participate in the economic development of the region. Priorities going forward: Our efforts are not carried out with the ambition of receiving an award, we simply do what we believe is right to develop and grow our operations. We therefore consider any award received as recognition of the work we do.

RESPONSIBLE CONTACT POINTS FOR PROFIT, PLANET, PEOPLE AND PRODUCT Profit Ivan Vindheim, Chief Financial Officer Planet and Product Øyvind Oaland, Global Director R&D People Anne Lorgen Riise, Global Director HR MARINE HARVEST STRATEGY AND OPERATIONAL APPROACH 55 MARINE HARVEST GROUP RESULTS 2012 56 BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT Harvested volume in 2012 was the highest recorded in Marine Harvest’s history at 392 306 tonnes gutted weight. The Group’s profitability was challenged by an imbalanced market, driven by the supply surge from Chile leaving the US market overflowed with salmon, especially in the second half of the year. The prices in the US bottomed out in the fourth quarter at a level that was the lowest recorded in 6 years. As a consequence, the Group recorded losses in its’ Chilean and Canadian farming operations for the year. Operational cost improvements were recorded in several units, mitigating some of the price effect and overall, Marine Harvest’s competitive position improved during the year. Despite the challenging market conditions, the Group’s solidity target was met at year end as a result of the actions taken to preserve cash. THE MARINE HARVEST GROUP Marine Harvest is the world’s leading seafood company offering farmed salmon and processed seafood to customers in more than 50 countries. In 2012, the Group employed 6 400 people and had operations in 22 countries worldwide. The Group was in 2012 organised in two Business Areas; Farming and Sales and Marketing, with Business Area Sales and Marketing constituting the two segments Markets and VAP Europe. Marine Harvest has salmon farming and processing activities in Norway, Scotland, Canada, Chile, Ireland and the Faroes. Value adding processing activities take place in the US, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, the Czech Republic, Japan and Chile. In addition Marine Harvest has several sales offices worldwide. In 2012, the Board decided to start transforming Marine Harvest from being a production driven framing company, to become an integrated protein producer. To achieve this position the Board sanctioned investments in a feed plant in Norway and the acquisition of Morpol, the world’s leading processor of salmon. Subject to approval of the acquisition from the relevant competition authorities, the combined operations Marine Harvest + Morpol will employ approximately 10 000 people and be able to serve a wider market with high quality, elaborated seafood products. 2012 � A YEAR OF CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES From the perspective of the Group’s 4 guiding principles, the 2012 challenges and results can be summarized as follows: 58 BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT Profit: The 22% increase in the global supply of salmon resulted in a significant decline in the spot prices compared to 2011. The price drop was most severe in the US market, which resulted in reported losses in the Group’s Chilean and Canadian farming operations. Through dedicated efforts to reduce operational costs, several entities were in 2012 able to reduce their cost level compared to 2011. The Board therefore considers the achieved results in the Farming operations in 2012 as good, given the challenging market conditions. ATTRACTIVE FINANCIAL In Business Area Sales and Marketing, the performance of VAP Europe was disappointing RESULTS in 2012 and actions have been taken to restore the profitability in this segment. The sales PROFIT organisations grouped as MH Market, in general improved their performance compared to 2011 measured as improved margin on spot sales compared to the reference price. The Group’s financial position was strong at year end as a result of the measures taken to protect cash flow during 2011 and 2012. The decision to build the feed plant and acquire Morpol will contribute to increased and more stable earnings going forward. Planet: The main focus areas in 2012 were lice and escape management, fish health and sustainable management of scarce marine feed raw materials. In the area of fish health, the Scottish and Irish industry experienced an increase in the prevalence and incidence of Amoebic Gill Disease (AGD), resulting in escalating mortality and increased treatment costs. To address the AGD challenge, the Group’s technical and operational network has worked together to develop good treatment practices and surveillance systems to be well prepared if the density of the amoeba should constitute a challenge in 2013. Through SUSTAINABLE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY increased and dedicated R&D effort and sharing of best practice, significant progress RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT has been made in the areas of escape management and antibiotics use, as well as the PLANET further developments in the use of non-medicinal methods to manage sea lice (cleaner fish). During the year R&D studies also indicated that Marine Harvest’s own strain of Atlantic salmon – Mowi – possesses genetic resistance to certain common diseases in farmed salmon. Further effort will be put into documenting these findings and verifying if the strain also could be resistant to a broader range of diseases, which would help in the Group’s effort to increase the survival and performance of fish. Product: In Marine Harvest, the objective is to produce delicious, tasty, nutritious and documented safe products. Through customer surveys, information is systematically collected to track the development in customer satisfaction. In the 2012 survey, the overall customer satisfaction level was 79 on a 0 – 100 scale, which is considered a respectable score and an improvement from the previous survey of 1 point. The Group’s procedures for control with undesirable substances in feed and medicine residues, did TASTY AND HEALTHY SEAFOOD not detect any instances of values above the limits set by the representative Food Safety PROVIDING CUSTOMER VALUE Authorities in 2012. One major food safety incident was reported during the year, where PRODUCT the bacteria Listeria moncytogenes was detected in cold smoked salmon processed in Delifish, Chile. In this case, a voluntary recall was carried out in agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration. No illness was reported in relation to the incident and the recall was carried out as a precautionary measure. Going forward, high and sustained value creation in Marine Harvest will come from continuous supply of delicious, healthy and documented safe products based on deep customer insight, and the Group will therefore intensify the efforts put into product innovation going forward. The Morpol acquisition will contribute in this regard. People: The Group’s ambition is to be among the best, independent of industry, with regards to employee safety. In 2012 more than 90% of all employees were trained in safety through the Brainsafe global safety programme. Compared to 2011, the number of lost time incidents per million hours worked has been reduced by 27%. Safety is one of Marine SAFE AND Harvest’s core values, but unfortunately the Group experienced a fatal accident involving MEANINGFUL JOBS a contract diver in the fourth quarter. The accident underlines the importance of continuous PEOPLE focus and priority towards this area and Marine Harvest will review all processes and procedures with sub-contractors to evaluate if changes are required. In 2013, the Brainsafe BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT 59 training will be offered to selected sub-contractors. New initiatives will also be taken to unfavourable product mix and inefficiencies in production. To address the challenges, a further reduce the number and severity of lost time incidents going forward. new management was put in place during the year and several actions have been taken to improve the performance going forward.

For a thorough review of Marine Harvest’s CO2 footprint and efforts to further reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases, reference is made to Part II and the Financial Risks: section on climate friendly food production. Currency risks: Marine Harvest is engaged in substantial international activities and is exposed to changes in the currency exchange rates as a natural part of its business The use of feed for animal protein production operations. Fluctuations in the currency exchange rates will therefore continuously Long term access to sustainably managed feed raw materials is a pre-requisite for the influence Marine Harvest’s financial statements and cash flows.

For further discussion of efforts and priorities in this area, reference is made to Part II and the sustainable feed section. Interest rate risks: With exception of the EUR 225 million convertible bond, the Group is generally financed using floating interest rates for debts to financing institutions and Group activities that might have negative impact on the environment leasing debts. To minimise the risk related to fluctuations in floating interest rates, Marine The Group’s activities may have negative impact on the environment, and Marine Harvest Harvest ASA shall at all times hedge 100% of the Group’s non-current interest-bearing is determined to work to secure the capability for sustainable growth. In fish farming the debt in its main financing currencies (EUR, USD and GBP). At the initiation of this policy, main challenges relate to escapes, sea lice and the use of medication. From 2011 to 2012 the interest rate hedges had duration of 5 years. Early 2012, the Board amended the the number of escaped fish from Marine Harvest sites was reduced by 68 365 to 3 150 policy to allow for hedging 50% of the exposure for year 6 through 10. fish. The number of incidents was also reduced and the Group maintains the target of zero escapes going forward. Liquidity risks: The single largest factor influencing liquidity risks is fluctuation in salmon prices. Other key liquidity risks are fluctuations in production and harvest volumes, bioSea lice management remains a challenge in most regions of the world. The Group logical issues, and changes in the feed price, which is the most important individual factor focuses on continuous improvement and the goal is to ensure that sea lice from Marine on the cost side. Feed prices are correlated to the marine and agricultural commodity Harvest farms do not have a negative impact on wild salmonid stocks. The overall prices of its ingredients. Feed prices increased on a unit basis through 2012. strategy is that sea lice should be managed mainly based on non-medicinal measures. In this regard the use of own grown cleaner fish was successfully increased in 2012, but the BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT 61 Group still rely on heavy use of medicinal alternatives. In addition to the medicine use, Marine Harvest tracks the development in the lice load per site through the number of sites above the locally defined trigger level at month end. Although the ambition is to maintain the sea lice count below the trigger level, it could at times be exceeded for example in situations with high temperatures when the lice levels change rapidly. The percentage of sites that exceeded the locally set trigger limits at month end in 2012 was stable compared to 2011 at 12% (average monthly basis). R&D effort has been directed towards this issue and it is expected that the research will deliver new solutions over time. The use of medication could potentially impact wild fish in the surroundings of treated sites. Marine Harvest primary treat fish for two reasons – bacterial disease requiring antibiotics treatment and the sea lice load requiring lice medication. The use of antibiotics was reduced from 40 g per tonne produced in 2011 to 12 g per tonne produced in 2012, a reduction of 70%. For lice management, the use of hydrogen peroxide was significantly increased in 2012 while the use of oral treatment was reduced. Annual fluctuation in medicine use reflects changes in use and rotation of products based on their suitability to target a specific infection pattern. For more information about the Group’s escape and sea lice management efforts and the use of medication, reference is made to Part II and the relevant Planet sections of this report. The Group’s processing activities may influence the environment in two areas; potential environmental impact, like pollution from water discharged into a municipal sewage system, and potential community impacts, like odour and noise. The continuous evaluations of potential negative impacts are based on own experience as well as dialogue with Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO’s), regulators, customers and the scientific community. Being aware of the potential negative effects the activities could have on the environment and the communities, the Group has incorporated measures to monitor and manage these in the Qmarine global quality programme. Marine Harvest continues to work actively with regulators, industry partners and the scientific community to promote environmental responsibility in the industry. For more information on how the Group works to understand and address stakeholder concerns, reference is made to Part II of this report. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Marine Harvest emphasize R&D, seeing it as crucial to further develop and strengthen the relatively young salmon farming industry. The Group’s main research priorities are within the areas of fish performance, food safety and product quality, as well as fish health and welfare. In 2012, R&D expenditures were approximately NOK 40 million, representing more than a doubling from the 2006 level. In addition, a fee of 0.3% of Marine Harvest Norway export value is paid to The Norwegian Seafood Research Fund. For Marine Harvest this represented NOK 19.4 million in 2012. The Group has taken the initiative to increase the R&D efforts, to enable further growth and profitability of the industry, grounded on a solid sustainability framework. For further information about Marine Harvest’s R&D efforts and results in 2012, reference is made to Part II, section R&D in this report. PEOPLE Health and safety Employee safety and a healthy working environment is top priority on the Board’s agenda. “People” is one of four guiding principles in the Group, and defined targets are linked to employee safety. Marine Harvest’s ambition is to be among the best, independent of industry, with regard to employee safety. First and foremost, this means providing an accident-free workplace. A mandatory global safety programme, Brainsafe, was launched in 2011, and more than 90% of all employees have been given Brainsafe training during 62 BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT 2012. In 2012, the Group reported 114 lost time incidents for own employees a reduction of 30 from 2011. As stated above, safety is one of Marine Harvest’s core values, but unfortunately the Group experienced a fatal accident involving a contract diver in the fourth quarter. The accident underlines the importance of continuous focus and priority towards this area and Marine Harvest will review all processes and procedures with subcontractors to evaluate if changes are required. Measured as LTIs per million hours worked it was recorded a reduction of 27% from 12.5 in 2011 to 9.1 in 2012 for own employees, which is considered an encouraging development, even though there is still significant room for improvement. The ambition is to reduce the number of LTIs per million hours worked by 20% from 2012 to 2013. To achieve this, attention at all levels is required. Safety is an important component in incentive systems throughout the Group. The absenteeism has remained low for several years compared to the industry level, and a further reduction was recorded from 2011 to 2012. Total absenteeism in 2012 was 3.4% with a 50/50 split between long term and short term absenteeism. The positive development follows the sustained effort to raise awareness in this area, as well as systematic competence development, job rotation and alternative work schemes where appropriate. The Board will continue to emphasise the imperative of improved health and safety performance going forward. For more information about health and safety in Marine Harvest, reference is made to the People section in Part II of this report. People and organisation At the end of 2012, the Group had 5 054 permanent, and 1 335 temporary employees. The total number of employees was 6 389, which is an increase of 54 employees compared to year end 2011. In general, there has been a reduction in the number of employees in Farming, while the Sales and Marketing units have strengthened their organisation throughout the year.

Marine Harvest is committed to ensuring diversity in the Group and the ambition is in accordance with the Norwegian Discrimination Act. The Group is working actively in the areas of recruitment, salary and working conditions, promotion, development opportunities and protection against harassment, to reach this target.

When estimating the biomass value a normal, expected size distribution is applied. Estimates are applied to the following factors: biomass volume, the quality of the biomass, the size distribution and market prices.

The value in use has been determined been assumed. based on the assumptions stated above, considering the expected development in both macroeconomic and company related conditions. Sensitivity analysis has been EBIT(DA)/Margins: performed for all CGUs. The key profit target for Salmon farming and sales is EBIT per kg, while value added operations are measured in terms of EBIT/EBITDA in % of sales. EBIT per Based on the forecasted figures, the calculated net present value for most CGUs is kg is highly volatile due to the fluctuations in the price of salmon. Costs can under robust. Excluding Sterling White Halibut, the farming entities require an EBIT per kg normal circumstances be forecasted with a relatively high level of accuracy. As in the terminal value ranging from below NOK 1 to NOK 4.35 per kg harvested, which Marine Harvest has entered into long term sales contracts for a share of the volume is below the long term historic average. Chile has the highest break even value in to be harvested in 2013, the margin for 2013 can be forecasted with a higher level of this calculation, all other units require an operational EBIT in the residual of less than accuracy than the margin for the years beyond (2014-2017). The budgeted margin NOK 3 per kg. Sensitivity for farming entities can also be expressed through the net for 2013 is higher than the historic average for all EU farming CGU’s as the prices are present value of future cash flows divided by capacity/harvest volume in the end expected to be good in Europe in 2013. Prices in the American market are expected year (2017). The breakeven level in terms of net present value per kg capacity is to increase, but remain at a relatively low level in 2013 due to the continuous supply between 20 and 57, with the Faroes representing the high end. surge from Chile. For the years 2014 – 2016, EBIT per kg is expected to increase to reflect the foreseen market development. From 2017 a long term steady state For VAP Europe the breakeven EBIT margin is 2.6% in the terminal value, which is return has been forecasted. For the sales and value added operations, the forecasted lower than the historic average for this operation and also below the expected return margins are aligned with historic averages, and market and internal expectations. for value added processing unit. Committed operational efficiency programmes are taken into consideration in the calculations. Changes in the outcome of these initiatives may affect future For Marine Harvest Chile the excess value compared to the invested capital in the estimated EBIT(DA) margins. 2012 impairment test amounts to NOK 920 million compared to NOK 342 million in 2011, as a result of the Group’s decision to increase the smolt stocking.

The rebuilding of the Chilean operation is subject to risk and uncertainty, ed growth in revenue and profit is taken into consideration. The capital expenditure but since the bottom level in 2009, the unit has been able to deliver good results, level for 2013 is high to grow the operations. Beyond 2013, capital expenditures are both with regards to biological and financial performance. Mortality is low and the aligned with the growth and replacement plans.

Capex related to committed and sufficient to support the recognised asset values at year end 2012. approved efficiency improvement programmes has also been included to support the inclusion of the benefits in the applied margin. The Sterling White Halibut operation reported a profit of NOK 5 million in 2012. The impairment test indicates that the excess value is limited. The invested capital Changes in applicable laws and regulations may affect future estimated capital in this unit is NOK 130 million and consists mainly of biological assets.
