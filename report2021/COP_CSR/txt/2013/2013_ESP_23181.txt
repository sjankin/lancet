This can be seen yet another year in the Sustainability Report that you now have before you. Corporate Social Responsibility is our management model. 6 Consum_Sustainability Report 2012 7 Letter from the President (1.1, 2.10, ES 1.1) Francesc Llobell Once again we are here to appraise the accounting year that has just ended, through this seventh Sustainability Report, which expresses our firm commitment to Corporate SoThe President cial Responsibility (CSR). At Consum we are committed to people and to society through an efficient and responsible management guaranteeing sustainability, as covered in this report. After joining the United Nations Global Compact in 2011 yet another year our Cooperative undertakes to respect its ten principles, whose aim is the defence of human, employment and environmental rights and ethics at businesses. These are principles which Consum has assumed since its incorporation as a cooperative. These principles are doubtlessly the ones which have led us to win nine awards in 2012. In May, Consum’s Purchasing Director, Agustín Delicado, received the Dirigente award 2012 from the magazine Aral, in the Commercial Management category. In the same month, Consum received the ‘Best Shopper Marketing action at the point of sale’ second prize for its ‘Punto Oferta’ project. In late September, the Cooperative received the Gastur 2012 award given every year by the Asociación Gastronómica y Turística (GASTUR) to relevant companies for the Valencian economy. In October, the Asociación Valenciana de Agricultores recognised the contribution made by Consum to generating wealth and local employment. Late that same month, the Markets magazine also upheld the Cooperative’s work through the II Conecta Price for the best product treatment. Lastly, Cáritas recognised the support work done by our three centres in Gandía and the one in Alzira. Behind each of these recognitions is the hard work done by the more than ten thousand persons working at Consum, whom we would like to thank for all their effort and dedication in such hard times. This has also involved the cooperation of our suppliers and the loyalty of the over one million nine hundred customer-members, whose active participation encourages us to go in in this approach of improving every day. I firmly believe that this cooperation model, in which all the groups involved play a decisive role in the evolution and success of the project, fosters the development of a socially responsible management. This way of understanding the company, in which people prevail over capital, has, anti-cyclically, shown that this is a successful formula for generating and distributing wealth and a tool which fosters solidarity among all of us forming part of this organisation. 8 9 Letter from the Director-General (1.1) Juan Luis Durich Accounting period 2012 was characterised by the worsening economic crisis through an increase in unemployment and the consequent recession in consumption, which The Director-General has been reflected in the evolution of business. This situation stresses the importance of working positively and with a vision for the future, enhancing the importance of people and responsible management, the returns from which may not always be immediate, but definitely do eventually arrive and constitute a collective benefit. In a highly competitive sectorial setting, a turnover of 1764.2 million euros was achieved in 2012, 0.56% more than the previous year, and a profit of 32.1 million euros, 9.8% less than the previous year. This evolution reflects the major efforts made by Consum to adapt to the customer’s demands, even at the cost of profits. The most important thing is nevertheless that we have located clear objectives for improvement. We have taken on major organisational changes to simplify the coordination and execution of our projects, with greater customer orientation. We have completed the Strategic Plan 2010-2012, reinforcing our presence in the zones in which we operate, which has thrust us forward to tackle the next Operative Plan 2013-2014 as well as possible, as a framework enabling us to gain in flexibility and adaptation to an increasingly changing market. 82.9 million euros were invested in 2012, mainly on opening new supermarkets and extending logistics installations. It is highly positive to see that we have generated stable quality employment, increasing our staff by 337 new members, which means we closed the year with 10,440 workers. In a context marked by increasing unemployment and job cuts it is particularly satisfactory to assert that not only are we maintaining employment, but also making progress in the area of work-personal life balance and equality. As regards the commercial line, we continue to put our stakes on the capacity of choice, variety and the best price. We want to go on working to improve the quality of our fresh products day by day and to adapt our range of own-brand products, which combines proven quality and a good price, enabling the consumer to make those essential savings. In 2013 we would like to thank our customer-members now numbering over one million nine hundred thousand for their trust, by improving our advantage scheme and increasing the value of cheque discounts. Consum thus gave its customermembers over 19 million euros in 2012. In the environmental area we should stress the Cooperative’s effort in the extension of eco-efficient supermarkets, which already make up half of our own network, and along with the measures for savings of natural resources and the recovery of waste carried out at all Consum installations in 2012, have enabled us to reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere by a further 5%. I would lastly like to encourage you so that we can all make 2013 really the beginning of the end of the crisis, helping to reactivate consumption and the economy, with optimism as our watchword. 10 11 32.1 610 Profit Shops 32.1 million euros, 610 9.8% less than the previous year 1,764.2 7.6 Sales Innovation 1,764.2 million euros, 7.6 million euros 0.56% more than the previous year 82.9 3.7 Investments Environmental 82.9 million euros expenses and investments 3.7 million euros 10,440 5.2 Workers Work-personal 10,440 life balance 337 more than the previous year 5.2 million euros, 494 euros per worker 19.1 CustomerCheques for members 1,935,095 1,935,095 Customermembers 19.1 million euros 25 3.9 Cooperation ‘Profit’ agreements Scheme in the field of the environment, food donations social projects and training 3.9 million euros 25 12 Consum_Sustainability Report 2012 13 Responsibility by definition _1 Presentation Consum is the biggest cooperative in the Spanish Mediterranean arch and carries out its business in the commercial distribution sector, through Consum, Consum Basic su(2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 4.8) permarkets and Charter franchises.

Consum is one of the main companies in the distribution sector. Since it started business in 1975, Consum has generated quality employment and wealth in the zones where it works: Catalonia, the Valencian Community, Murcia, Castile-La Mancha, Andalusia and Aragon. Our customer-members and customers are the main beneficiaries of Consum’s commercial work. The main contracted services are transport, shopping delivery service, the filing service, fitters, the lifeline (safety cables and protection for work done at heights) and the smoke venting systems (integral smoke removal evacuation service).

In their permanent assessment of the risks stemming from sustainability at this organisation, the Board of Directors and the Governing Body adopt the measures required for monitoring and controlling these. On the basis of these measures the organisation is ready to overcome these threats, affirming the model of cooperative organisation. 18 Consum_Sustainability Report 2012 19 Responsibility by definition Strategic development (1.2, 4.9, 4.10, 4.11) Consum is becoming Consum has carried out the process for monitoring and attaining its economic, environmental and social objectives through its three-year Strategic Plan, for the 2010-2012 established as a model period, and the annual Management Plan. These documents materialise our long and with great results and short-term objectives, which go along with the progress indicators. They also specify a reference in business the measures, periods for achievement, competences and resources necessary to carry and social management these out. The progress indicators are given in the COPLAN application. of supermarkets. The Strategic Plan completed in 2012 had the key aims of consolidating a model with great results, becoming a reference in business and social management of supermarkets in its setting and steering the group of worker-members towards achieving goals and obtaining results, improving care and commitment in service for the customer. To be able to evaluate proper progress in the objectives set in the Strategic Plan, the Governing Board and the Board of Directors work with indicators enabling the impacts and possible deviations generated to be observed, facilitating feedback processes. Furthermore, every time that a new product or service is brought onto the market, the relevant formal system for analysing risks and opportunities is got under way. The most basic management instrument used by Consum is its monthly management control and even monthly/weekly/daily sales control, as a tool enabling it to compare the economic progress of the year as compared with the forecasts. Any proper development of Consum’s work in the distribution sector in Spain requires an accurate positioning of its products and services on the market as well as a precise definition of the map of competitors in the sphere of its implementation zone. In an increasingly changing market, Consum has drawn up an Operative Plan 2013-2014 designed to help the organisation to take up the new challenges as successfully as possible. 20 Consum_Sustainability Report 2012 21 Responsibility by definition Sustainability Consum has a Sustainability Policy passed in 2010, which covers all the business policies of the organisation (Social Responsibility, Quality, Prevention of Occupational Risks, Policy Environment, Equal Opportunities and Family-Responsible Company). This policy can be consulted in full on the corporate web page. (HR 5, HR 6, HR 7, HR 10, SO 7, ES 1.1, ES 4.3) The Cooperative constantly works to comply with all the aspects defining Corporate Responsibility, and in this framework we propose measures consistent with the development of all our processes and also in the evaluation of their results. Consum also encourages its suppliers and contractors to share our corporate and environmental values and supports any efforts to promote these values in their business activities. This policy also defines that Consum respects its workers’ fundamental rights and their freedom of expression and association, guarantees good working conditions and ensures equal opportunities with no kind of discrimination. It also prohibits the acceptance of unlawful benefits by the workers at the organisation. Consum complies with all the regulatory legislation involved in its business. It guarantees the defence of human rights in its activities and rejects any kind of business or commercial activity of other kinds in which obligatory and forced children’s work is directly or indirectly involved, supporting any initiatives intended to ensure children’s interests. In keeping with its Sustainability Policy, the Cooperative’s commercial action is always loyal to the market, respecting its rules at all times and deliberately refusing to carry out any activity which could be considered as being unfair competition. To monitor these aspects, the legal division at Consum evaluates the possible existence of any unfair measures. Thanks to this practice we can now claim that Consum has never been accused of unfair competition. The Cooperative constantly works to comply with all the aspects defining Corporate Responsibility and proposes measures consistent with the development of all its processes and also in the evaluation of their results. 22 Consum_Sustainability Report 2012 23 _2 Economic responsibility CSR is not philanthropy – it does not seek to turn businesses into charities, as CSR means being businesses have to be profitable.

The Cooperative has invested 82.9 million euros in 2012 in the extension and adaptation of the network of shops to Consum quality standards. The total surplus of 20.9 million euros is obtained from these results, after deducting the interest on the capital of worker and consumer-members (which is not an accounting expense, but neither is it taken into account for purposes of sharing surpluses) and adding the sum for the Training and Cooperative Promotion Fund (which, though this is an accounting expense, is substantively considered as profit for purposes of distribution). 13.16 million euros of this sum is cooperative profit The percentage assigned directly to worker-members of Consum stood at 72.4% of the total of the cooperative net surplus, which means 9.5 million euros.

Along with the cooperation of members and customers, this growth has enabled Consum to maintain its position. In 2012, the Cooperative’s national market share by surface area was 3.7%, which places it in 8th position in the national ranking of distribution companies. As regards the improvement of premises, 8 supermarkets have been refurbished, extending the sales area by an average of 450 m2. This year 2012 fifteen shops were closed through not meeting the conditions of the Consum supermarket model, but with a minimal impact through the creation of other nearby centres and the relocation of the entire staff.

This effort has a response in the increase in satisfaction of worker members seen in the survey made ES 5.10, ES 5.11, ES 5.12) in 2012. With a responsible personnel management system, Consum makes its workers’ wellbeing compatible with the successful development of business. The commitment to internal promotion and fostering balance, equal opportunities and diversity promote the quality of life at work. Consum’s staff came to 10,440 persons at the close of business year 2012. 74.7% of these are women and the average age is 37. The figures also reveal stable and quality employment, as 97.2% of the people working at Consum are permanent members or members in their trial period. The 9089 worker members participate in ownership, management and results. In 2012, the Cooperative’s staff rose by 337 persons in respect of the previous year. This is a positive aspect in a year marked by the economic crisis and increasing unemployment, and a point which reveals the Cooperative’s commitment to creating and maintaining jobs of work. Consum has also generated over 11,000 indirect jobs, mainly through the growth in the staff at the Charter franchise network and employees of transport, cleaning, security and shopping delivery services. As for external contracting, the selection policy at Consum is characterised by giving priority to contracting staff who live in the zones where it operates and, on the internal level, to covering responsible positions through the internal promotion procedure. The management of Consum also come from the zones in which we work. Thanks to the internal promotion policy of the Cooperative, 306 workers were promoted in business year 2012, 199 of these being women and 107 men. The commitment to internal promotion and fostering balance, equal opportunities and diversity all promote the quality of life at work. 44 Consum_Sustainability Report 2012 45 Social Responsibility Personnel by type of contract and sex Personnel by type of working hours and sex % 8.6% FULL TIME 2439 6077 8516 81.6% 87.1% Permanent workers: 902 314 588 Members: 9089 100% PART TIME 201 1723 1924 18.4% 2173 6916 TOTAL 2640 7800 10,440 100.00% Total staff: 10,440 2.8% Temporary workers: 288 Personnel by region and sex 114 174 % 1.5% Members in trial Valencian Community 1671 5753 7424 71.1% period: 161 Catalonia 729 1387 2116 20.3% 39 122 Murcia 186 377 563 5.4% Castile-La Mancha 29 185 214 2% 97.2% Andalusia 25 98 123 1.2% 97.2% of the people working at Total 2640 7800 10,440 100.00% Consum are members, either permanent or in their trial period. 46 Consum_Sustainability Report 2012 47 Social Responsibility Evolution of worker-members Reg.

Consum thus continues to be the only commercial distribution company in Spain with this certificate from the +Family Foundation, backed by the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality. This certificate recognises Consum’s efforts in implementing policies and measures for balancing family and working life. To make this endeavour more noticeable an EFR mark has been designed, which is placed at the entrance to the centres which have obtained the certificate. Consum invested 5.2 million euros in balance in 2012, which means 494 euros per worker. Consum publishes the catalogue of family balance measures “+de 50 Medidas para Conciliar” (over 50 Measures for Balance), which covers 64 measures to foster working and personal life. To make people aware of this area, a 2013 calendar has been published with messages about co-responsibility. It is important to underline the fact that all the persons who work at the Cooperative enjoy the same social benefits regardless of the type of day worked, although there are advantages connected with membership status. 52 Consum_Sustainability Report 2012 53 Social Responsibility Consum has selected the most prominent balance measures, grouped by categories, in Workers who have taken leave through maternity/paternity order to measure their scope: 2012 Percentage of people enjoying each work-family-leisure balance measure and social benefits 481 106 375 2011 Balance measures 2011 2012 Leadership and style of management 523 87 436 Evaluation of performance 94.6% 93.6% Quality in employment Job stability 93.6% 97% Medical service 30% 10.1% Loans for members 2.6% 2.9% Workers who go back to work after their leave Distribution of profits for members 88.7% 87.1% Since the Compensation for holidays outside the summer period 2.3% 2% % in respect of workers taking introduction of Time and space flexibility maternity leave Consum’s Balance 100% 100% 2012 106 373 479 99.58% Plan in 2007 the central central organisation's Continuous working day platforms platforms 2011 87 434 521 99.62% productivity has 100% shops 100% shops risen by 7.8%.

It is positive to stress that this difference has been reduced by 6.6% as combasis to all its workers, regardless of the minimum wage established in the collective pared with the previous year. This difference is due to the late entry of women to responon average agreements in each zone in which it works. This means that the basic wage for the sible jobs and mainly to the salary differences between the personnel joining through worker-member at the Cooperative is always over the local minimum wage. 2213.6 euros as purchases of several chains in earlier years.

In shop management, both cases. 55.9% of the posts are already held by female Directors and Shop Managers. The total salary expenses of the Cooperative during business year 2012 came to 228.8 million euros, including salaries, pensions and other benefits and compensation. Total salary expenses 2011 2012 227,135,526 € 228,889,664 € As regards the distribution of the Cooperative’s annual profits among its worker-members, in 2012, the members shared 12.8 million euros, 69% of Consum’s cooperative profits in 2011. To this one should add the interest collected by the compulsory provisions to share capital, a sum of 6.5 million euros, which adds up to a total of 19.3 million euros. Hence, adding up both items, each member has received on average the sum of 2,213.6 euros. The Consum Equality and Balance Committee has gone on working on the Equality Plan with measures to facilitate women’s access to responsible posts. Consum fosters the implementation of open contracting systems establishing the same salary criteria for men and women. We must point out that Consum has an Internal Relations Committee which seeks to avoid any discrimination between workers, amongst other aspects. It is worth pointing out that Consum has had no complaints through employment discrimination throughout its history as a cooperative. 56 Consum_Sustainability Report 2012 57 RSEPONSABILIDAD SOCIAL As a result of the equality policy promoted by the Cooperative the representation of women at present reaches 67% on the Governing Body (the highest body for representation and government, with an equal composition between worker-members and consumer-customer–members, renewed in 2010).

Every year Consum assigns major resources to professional development, as investment in training is part of the Cooperative’s culture. The organisation has invested 1.33% on training in respect of the company’s total wage bill, which means 291.6 euros per worker. We should highlight the fact that almost all the financial aid received from regional or local authorities is ploughed back into the workers’ professional and company training. In 2012 we received 577,815 euros in subsidies out of a total of 582,424 euros, a sum similar to previous financial periods, which enables Consum’s commitment for the professional improvement of all its workers.

Consum has an Accident Prevention Plan, with the main aim of integrating the prevention of occupational accidents in the organisation’s management.

Consum’s values can be members and summed up in the assertion “listening to act as a responsible company”, in which it customers puts forward the commitment to cater for and integrate its needs in the Cooperative’s (ES 2.3) management. 243,904 customers were registered as new consumer-members in 2012, reaching the figure of 1,935,095 members, a very high number which vouches for the successful operation of our company and commercial model of advantages for members.

Consum, as a consumer cooperative, is also a legally recognised consumer association, and its corporate aim is to promote consumers’ rights and foster healthy lifestyles through its training and informative action plan, to which it assigns roughly 10% of its profit every year. 68 Consum_Sustainability Report 2012 69 Social Responsibility Advantage programme for customer-members (PR 5) The Consum Interest Programme is also a significant bond for connecting with customer-members. Each member is sent a discount cheque and the statement of their purchases, along with the sales brochure. As a complement they are also regularly sent personalised promotions, depending on their purchasing preferences. The Consum Interest Programme’s main tool is the absolutely free customer loyalty card, which can be converted into a payment card. This can be applied for at any of our sales outlets and enables customers to accumulate discounts on the purchases made at Consum. It also obtains discounts on the consumption of fuel made at the over 3000 petrol stations in the Solred group. Our customer-members can also benefit from discounts on holiday packages. In 2012 the customer-members’ participation in sales exceeded 75%. Consum’s customer-members benefited from discounts of around 19.1 million euros, given in the form of discount cheques, which can be swapped for buying any kind of product at our supermarkets. Discounts rose by 7.3% en 2012, through extra concessions, which reIn 2012 customerflects the successful development of the Entrenosotros Programme.

Customer-members promptly receive the “Consum Entre Nosotros” magazine at their homes, as well as particular information about the programming of training activities on matters of consumer interest which are carried out exclusively for them. In the customer-member satisfaction study performed in 2012 on the satisfaction of the interest programme, Consum obtained a mark of 7.82 on a scale of ten points, increasing the level of satisfaction of the previous year by 0.8 per cent. In order to improve and adapt to our customer-members’ needs, Consum has different channels for learning their degree of satisfaction about the product and services provided to them. The registration and management of the incidents learned of through the Consum Active Listening Area enables the cooperative to receive full information from our customer-members through their calls to this service. To this end Consum has set up a system to get direct information about members’ and customers’ satisfaction. In all 184,923 calls were handled involving incidents detected by our members and customers during 2012, 2.6% less than the previous year. 70 Consum_Sustainability Report 2012 71 Social Responsibility Customer care processes Administrative proceedings (EN 28, PR 2, PR 4, PR 7, PR 9, SO 8) (PR 8) Type Acts fined Cost incurred Voluntary codes 5 3680 52,487 Labelling 2 600 Enquiries Regulations 9 9824 Environmental 5 1351 Service supply 3 12512 5011 Marketing 0 0 Complaints Data Protection Law 0 0 126,813 TOTAL 19 27,967 euros Applications 480 132 Suggestions Congratulations The level of satisfaction of the service given by the Active Hearing Area for the calls received is measured through a study whose result was 8 out of 10, the same mark as the previous year. We aim to go on carrying out this satisfaction study, analysing results and improving the aspects that our customers demand most. With the aim of protecting the personal data of customers and customer-members, Consum complies with the protocols for data protection laid down in the Organic Law on Protection of Personal Data, as is reflected by the results of the two-yearly audit made during 2012. The system is explained in the “security document” drawn up by the cooperative, under the control of its “Security Head”. It is important to stress the lack of complaints as regards privacy and leaks of our members’ and customer-members’ personal data. In the event of there being any penalisation through non-compliance with legislation as regards the supply and use of products and services, Consum assumes the responsibility stemming from any such non-compliance. 72 Consum_Sustainability Report 2012 73 Social Responsibility Training and Information (LA 8, ES 3.5, ES 4.4) Training and Information (LA 8) The training programme for our customer-members has focussed on activities involving healthy lifestyles, with the following themes: The Healthy Menu, Cooking with Sense, Diet and Traditional Cooking, Cooking with Origin Denomination and Christmas Surprises. The aim was to give our customer-members notions about nutrition and cooking, with simple and immediate applications in their everyday lives. 406 training workshops were held at 90 shops in all the regions in which the cooperative works, with a participation of 4832 customer-members. Attended workshops were also held with the cooperation of Valencia General Hospital, as part of the PAIDO programme for prevention of child obesity, with the participation of 39 children. For smaller consumers the seventh edition of the Consum Story Competition was held to celebrate World Consumer Day, under the motto “A tale of colours, smells and flavours. The Mediterranean Diet”, with the participation of 93 centres, preparing a total number of 260 stories written by 2472 schoolchildren. Consum has several channels for keeping up and ensuring direct, two-way communica7343 people took tion with its customer-members. One of the main media used is the “Consum Entre Nopart in Consum’s sotros” magazine, a two-monthly publication exclusively for our customer-members on training measures consumer matters. In 2012 the total print run was extended to 2.7 million copies, reachin 2012. ing over 500,000 homes. In line with our commitment to members in all the regions where we work, our communication supports are published in the official languages of these regions: Spanish, Valencian and Catalan. Another particularly important medium is Consum’s web page, with information, services and applications, which enable both training and participation by the different groups. In 2012, Consum’s web page had over 781,900 visits, 42% more than the previous year, which speaks for the success of the new communication channel. One significant piece of data is the number of 1300 downloads of the 2011 Sustainability Report from the corporate web page. In 2012 the second phase of the web 2.0 started to be developed, as an exclusive digital channel for relations with the Customer-Member. There is also constant dialogue with interest groups through social networks with official Consum channels in Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, YouTube, Flickr, Pinterest, Wikipedia or Scribd, and enabling the socialisation of the Cooperative’s messages. The Cooperative has radio broadcasts on Radio Valencia–Cadena SER, “Ser Consumidor”, on “La Mañana” broadcast by COPE Valencia, “Consum Entrenosotros”, broadcast every two weeks and the “RAC Consumidors” spot on RAC1, on the air weekly in Catalonia. Along with the training work done through the media mentioned, Consum has had a significant presence on the media through current affairs items. In 2012 there were over 2000 hits in the media. 74 Consum_Sustainability Report 2012 75 Social Responsibility Suppliers Suppliers play an active role in the successful evolution of the business, which is why the Cooperative ensures ongoing relations with them, based on trust and a close as(EC 6, EC 9, PR 3, ES 5.3, ES 5.4, ES 5.6) sociation. If Consum’s development is positive, so is that of its suppliers. That is why the organisation works to maintain long-term commitments which enable it to involve these suppliers in its commercial policy right from the start, through its personalised offer. Consum allows the supplier to get straight to its final customer through this offer, adapted to the way each customer-member does his or her shopping, as seen in discounts adapted to their needs, in what is known as “Tus doce Cheque-Crece”. Suppliers are vital for fostering one of the fundamental approaches of our commercial policy: the customers’ ability to choose, offering a broad and varied range adapting to suit the customers’ needs. In 2012 progress was made in seeking the consumer needs demanded by its customers, adapting the selection provided at centres to local and regional needs, and responding to members’ requests through the Active Listening Programme. In fresh produce, the objectives of guaranteeing freshness and quality are maintained, taking into account environmental and sustainability criteria in choosing produce and suppliers, apart from logistics, commercial and quality aspects. These criteria are the basis for the evaluation and approval of manufacturers, exceeding expectations, fostering continuous improvement and verifying that over 90% of the suppliers of own brand fresh and refrigerated products have quality certifications guaranteeing respect for the environment and foodstuff safety. Environmental and sustainability criteria as regards the choice of products and suppliers are a requirement of its sustainability policy. The organisation passes these on to its suppliers through a formal declaration of intentions in the development of socially responsible management. It is stipulated in the Cooperative’s Corporate Responsibility Policy that “we have the intention to stimulate local economic development through a gradual increase in the use of resources of the territories where we do business, so that the companies in the area benefit from this”. Hence, over the last five years the share of purchases from local suppliers has doubled. At present 73% of the purchases made by Consum are made in the autonomous communities in which it is present, 10% more than in 2011. 73% of the purchases made by Consum are in the autonomous communities in which it is present. 76 Consum_Sustainability Report 2012 77 Social Responsibility For the Consum product, the Cooperative maintains a high level of demands as regards parameters of quality, design, competitiveness and customer satisfaction. 364 new Franchisees Another essential group for the Cooperative are its franchisees entrepreneurs who offer Consum products and services under the Charter brand in the towns and urban items were incorporated in 2012, which means a total number of 1705 references of its districts which do not have a big enough population to allow the presence of a large own brands.

Implementing the established quality requirements, food is withdrawn prior to its best-by date, which is perfect for consumption. This is donated, in proper order and following a strict protocol to ensure foodstuff safety, to social institutions, for this to be distributed among the people who need this most. Over 3,881,167 euros has been donated in this way. Along with these endeavours different contributions of food have also been made, coordinated from the Cooperative’s distribution platforms. From Silla, El Prat de Llobregat and Las Torres de Cotillas donations have been made to such organisations as the Banco de Alimentos in Valencia and Barcelona, Médicos del Mundo de Valencia, Proyecto Vida de La Pobla Llarga, Proyecto Hombre in Murcia and Cáritas in Valencia, Barcelona and Murcia.
