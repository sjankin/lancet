LAURIE DIPPENAAR / CHAIRMAN A RECURRING THEME, BUT AN IMPORTANT ONE One of the topics I have covered more than once in my recent statements is the need for banks to build bridges with their regulators. The ﬁrst time I raised it was in 2010, when I warned that unless global banks demonstrated appropriate discipline, governments and regulators would continue to look for ways to rein them in. Last year I touched on the issue of trust and how that had been eroded between banks and regulators and the need for the banks to earn that trust back, or suffer the consequences of more draconian regulations. As I write this statement towards the end of August 2012, I see no positive developments in this regard in the global banking sector. In the last six months alone we have witnessed the Libor ﬁxing issue at Barclays, the money laundering ﬁne for HSBC and Standard Chartered ﬁned for circumventing US sanctions against Iran. Some banks seem to continue to push the boundaries from a risk and regulatory perspective to generate proﬁts, and when this ﬁnally backﬁres it conﬁrms what everyone thinks about banks – they can’t be trusted. It also begs the question – how much more bad news is there to come? Was this behaviour systemic during the golden years of banking, and now, following increased scrutiny from regulators, the accusations and ﬁnes will follow? I sincerely hope not as the effects are beginning to spill over into a broader negativity, which ultimately impacts customer perceptions of banks. The trust of depositors is a bank’s fundamental licence to operate but it is also ephemeral in nature, therefore we need to guard against any kind of breakdown in this relationship. So far the South African banking sector appears to have avoided similar behaviour and it is probably due to a combination of factors. Firstly, there is a very robust relationship with the regulator who has always had clear line 07 of sight on the execution of banking strategies. Secondly, as emerging market banks we had signiﬁcant chairman’s statement natural growth to tap into without needing to seek it out in marginal type activities, which certainly seems FirstRand Group to have been an issue for the more developed market global banks. Thirdly, the domestic banks have been, in the main, regionally focused, and management capacity has not been diluted by extended expansion into other markets, on different continents and in different time zones. Banks are incredibly complex organisms and when you replicate that complexity over and over again, it is extremely difﬁcult to keep track of the most basic of principles and reliance on people’s competence and integrity increases exponentially. Even with robust risk management frameworks, human beings are such that if they deliberately choose to work outside of mandates, the impact of these actions can be hard to detect for some time. This year FirstRand suffered its own event where a few individuals hid bad business practices. A new management team, deployed into the FNB merchant acquiring business unit, uncovered collusion between certain members of staff, who had created an incredibly complex set of transactions to cover up their incompetence. These concealed transactions proved very difﬁcult to detect by the risk management and internal audit processes and what this demonstrates is, that if people deliberately seek to circumvent frameworks, however robust, they can, and complexity creates opportunity for bad practice if you have the wrong people in place. This matter has been fully dealt with in the risk and capital management report. There is also a strong link between pushing the boundaries and remuneration. One of the lessons learned from the banking crisis is that you get the behaviour you reward. This played out in very elevated levels of gearing and high risk strategies as bankers tried to maintain the trajectory of earnings their shareholders had become accustomed to and the commensurate growth in performance pay. This was not conﬁned to the investment banking fraternity, eventually the universal banks also fell victim to remuneration practices out of kilter with their mandates. Over time this created massive excesses building up in the system and eventually it ran out of steam. The rest, as they say, is history. I will return to the topic of remuneration a bit later. So the aggressive pursuit of growth and high levels of remuneration, which were in many cases inappropriate, led to ﬁnancial Armageddon. Five years on and the legacy of that is still playing out across the world in the form of signiﬁcant macro economic uncertainty which in turn continues to introduce major business challenges. WE ARE OPERATING IN VERY UNCERTAIN TIMES BUT OUR FRANCHISES CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM During the year global policy makers had to deal with a number of signiﬁcant negative issues, including the European sovereign debt and banking sector crisis which threatened to break up the euro zone on a number of occasions. Portugal and Greece received bailout packages and concerns over systemically important countries such as Spain became elevated. Faced with its own ﬁscal challenges, the US sovereign rating was downgraded by ratings agency Standard and Poor’s, preceded by heightened volatility in ﬁnancial markets over fears that the US government might default on some of its debt obligations. Conﬂict in the Middle East and the ever-present possibility of military action against Iran also contributed. This uncertainty, along with high indebtedness of governments, ongoing stress in the European banking system and households that continued to rebuild their balance sheets, weighed heavily on economic activity in the major developed economies. This weakness subsequently spilled over into the large emerging economies and growth in countries such as China, India and Brazil slowed markedly during the latter part of the year. South Africa was not immune to these global developments and although domestic growth picked up in the latter part of 2011, it moderated again at the start of 2012. Consumer demand remained resilient, particularly on durable goods, however falling business conﬁdence resulted in subdued private sector investment spending and these factors directly impacted the Group’s performance, albeit in very different ways.

IN CLOSING… ALIGNING EXECUTIVE PAY WITH PERFORMANCE Whilst all of the topics I have covered above are important ones, it is For me there are two key questions about remuneration – one, is the important in life to maintain a balanced perspective and in some ways absolute number too high? Second, do executives, on a pro rata basis, they all pale in comparison to a singularly profound event that took receive more than the providers of the capital? The ﬁrst one is, in some place during the year, the loss of Thys Visser in a motor car accident. ways, the more difﬁcult to answer as there is always an emotional I had the privilege of knowing Thys for many years both as a friend and reaction to very high numbers.

Compared to this, what he receives in terms of remuneration is modest. Conversely this simple sum also demonstrates that if you have the wrong person in place, not properly incentivised, the potential for value destruction is equally high. Laurie Dippenaar I have stated on a number of occasions that FirstRand fundamentally Chairman believes that executive remuneration must align with shareholder value and our key performance measure, net income after cost of capital, ensures that the link between pay and performance is direct. This year, as a compensation health check, I compared the growth in the combined remuneration of our leadership team (CEO, CFO and franchise CEOs) over a four-year period to growth in shareholder returns. F I R S T R A N D A N N U A L I N T E G R AT E D R E P O R T 2 0 1 2 A 10 hises Our operating franc esBank FNB, RMB and W d both all outperforme conditions the macro economic and the market. / CEO SIZWE NXASANA 11 ceo’s report A STRONG PERFORMANCE FirstRand’s diversiﬁed ﬁnancial services portfolio produced another strong FirstRand Group performance for the year to June 2012, once again demonstrating the quality and resilience of our operating franchises, FNB, RMB and WesBank, all of which outperformed both the macro economic environment and the market. DRIVEN BY A CONSISTENT STRATEGY The Group’s ultimate objective is to create long-term franchise value and deliver superior and sustainable returns to our shareholders. It pursues this objective through a consistent strategy to; • become a leading player in all of the ﬁnancial services proﬁt pools in South Africa, growing in existing markets and those where we are under-represented; • grow our franchise in the broader African continent, targeting those countries expected to show above average domestic growth and which are well positioned to beneﬁt from the trade and investment ﬂows between Africa, China and India. Focusing for a moment on growth in our existing markets, in South Africa FNB has successfully grown core transactional accounts. It has achieved this through offering customers a compelling value proposition, supported by exciting rewards programmes and platform innovations such as the Banking App, cellphone banking and e-Wallet. A positive outcome from this strategy has been the strong increase in transactional volumes, which, along with robust advances growth, contributed signiﬁcantly to FNB’s overall growth. RMB’s decision to focus more on client-driven activities has resulted in structurally lower ROEs, however these levels are much more sustainable and earnings are of a much higher quality with less volatility. WesBank’s domestic point of sale dominance means that it has been able to capitalise on the strong domestic replacement cycle that has played out over the past two years. Now turning to those markets or proﬁt pools where we remain under-represented, there are some speciﬁc initiatives already underway to grow our share in these markets. As I mentioned in my report last year, at RMB we have created a CIB business to more effectively service the large corporate market. This strategy has continued to gain traction as we have grown out the coverage team, particularly into those segments and economic sectors where we have been historically under-represented. In addition we have attracted key talent to supplement our growing African footprint which better positions us to take advantage of clients who trade across the corridors which link Africa to both Asia and Europe. The year also saw continued investment into the technology platform which is key to providing a holistic transactional capability for clients. In WesBank, the focus on growing the corporate and Full Maintenance Rental business remains a strategic priority. Another gap in our portfolio, particularly since we unbundled Momentum, is asset management. When we looked at the opportunities to enter this market again we took the decision to position the strategy as an alternative investment management offering, as this plays to the strengths and track records of our existing investment, origination and structuring businesses. We will continue to offer traditional products, particularly to our wealth clients. To facilitate this strategy we have created an asset management pillar alongside the Bank. In line with our multi-branding strategy we have branded the new asset management franchise, Ashburton Investments, and through this franchise we will market traditional and alternative products. Traditional products will in the main be originated by the original Ashburton business, which has a 30-year track record as an active investment manager. The alternative products will initially be provided by RMB.

NPLs continued to decline (down 6%), and mortgages still dominate. It is also important to understand that the lifecycle of NPLs has changed given the severity of the last cycle and the introduction of the NCA (debt counselling processes). NPLs are therefore stickier and take longer to work out. The Group remains prudent in provisioning, and although the speciﬁc impairment charge remained similar to last year, the higher portfolio provisions have increased the total coverage ratio to 60.0% (2011: 50.4%). The Group believes the higher portfolio provisions are appropriate given the current cycle, some signals from both the macro economic environment and portfolio trends.

The cost-to-asset ratio has remained stable and the volatility in the impairment component is as expected given the accounting treatment.

These are underpinned by a consistently improving retail and commercial franchise which is particularly focused on providing innovative and cost effective products and solutions for customers. The FNB franchise is key to the Group’s vision to be a predominant South African ﬁnancial services player and a growing force in other targeted African markets. EXECUTION ON STRATEGY South Africa Given the relative size of FirstRand in its domestic market, it is imperative that the Group continues to grow in its existing segments and at the same time increase its share of those markets and segments where it is under-represented. However, the Group is only focused on proﬁtable growth, not market share per se and many of FNB’s strategies reﬂect this focus. When assessing FNB’s performance in the year under review, the business beneﬁted from a deliberate strategy to grow and retain core transactional accounts. It has driven this through offering customers a compelling value proposition – innovative products and channels at an acceptable cost to the customer.

RMB’s strategy continues to be reﬁned in anticipation of the changing market conditions and regulatory regime and is focusing on three key themes – capital allocation, growth and efﬁciency. These themes are fully aligned with FirstRand’s objective to deliver sustainable growth in shareholder returns, within acceptable levels of volatility. EXECUTION ON STRATEGY In broad terms RMB executed on speciﬁc initiatives which support the Group’s strategic intent to grow the franchise in areas where it is currently under-represented domestically such as the corporate and investment banking (CIB) segment. The current year has also seen a focus on India and certain targeted African territories, particularly Nigeria where RMB has received approval in principle for a merchant banking licence. When assessing RMB’s performance in the current year, the business is clearly beneﬁting from the strategic decision in 2009/10 to focus more on client-driven activities, resulting in a healthier balance between these and trading or investment businesses. This shift has resulted in structurally lower but more sustainable ROEs (which remain well above Group hurdle rates) and a higher quality of earnings Review of operations 5 year review Statement of earnings Normalised earnings Corporate governance and sustainability 35  , 7iÃ > with less volatility.

The underlying advances are also well balanced between ﬁxed and variable, thus minimising the impact of changes in interest rates. Arrear levels continue to reﬂect positive trends although they appear to now be at the low end and further improvement would not be expected. Overall NPLs have decreased over the prior year, driven by a signiﬁcant reduction in corporate. Retail NPLs include residual debt review accounts; most of which are paying according to arrangement. Credit appetite remains conservative and disciplined across all the portfolios. Origination is well within agreed risk thresholds and vintage performance is very closely monitored. The overall portfolios continue to track well within expectations.

Key characteristics of FirstRand’s compensation practices include the following: • FirstRand has never paid bonuses unless cost of capital has been met; • long-term incentives have never vested unless performance conditions have been met; and • variable compensation has consistently been aligned with shareholder returns through determining the size of the variable compensation pool in proportion to net income after cost of capital. “THE GRAPH BELOW COMPARES GROWTH IN SHAREHOLDER RETURNS WITH GROWTH IN THE COMBINED COMPENSATION OF THE GROUP’S PRESCRIBED OFFICERS OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD. THE TREND LINES DEMONSTRATE THAT GROWTH IN SHAREHOLDER RETURNS IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN GROWTH IN PRESCRIBED OFFICER COMPENSATION, WHICH INDICATES THE DESIRED ALIGNMENT BETWEEN SHAREHOLDER RETURNS AND THE GROUP’S COMPENSATION PRACTICES.” Total growth in shareholder return compared with growth in prescribed officer compensation 250 4 year CAGR = 22.5% 200 4 year CAGR = 10.3% 150 100 50 0 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Share price − DPS (excl. special dividend) − Total return − Remuneration In 2012 FirstRand delivered a solid set of results in challenging market and economic conditions.

In line with the Group’s objective to drive the delivery of long-term franchise value, there are deferral structures within the performance bonus component of compensation. Furthermore, the vesting of share-based payments depends on the Group achieving certain performance criteria – namely real growth in earnings and a premium over cost of equity. Details of share scheme vesting criteria are disclosed in note 30 of the annual ﬁnancial statements.

MARGINS FROM TRADITIONAL BANKING BUSINESS BEGAN TO DIMINISH AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS BEGAN TO INCREASE. BANKS HAVE RESPONDED BY ENTERING INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS FOCUSING ON SUPERIOR INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT. RISK COMMITTEES HAVE ACCORDINGLY HAD TO KEEP UP WITH THESE DEVELOPMENTS.” COMPOSITION FirstRand’s Risk, capital management and compliance (RCC) committee is composed exclusively of non-executive directors with a majority of independent non-executive directors. Among the attendees are members of the Group’s divisional risk committees, the chief executive ofﬁcer, chief operating ofﬁcer, the Group and divisional chief risk ofﬁcers, the Group audit executive and the head of regulatory risk management, all of whom attend meetings in an ex ofﬁcio capacity. The chairman and with other members of the RCC committee are nominated by the Board which ensures that members have the necessary, skills, experience and ﬁnancial services background to fulﬁl their duties. ROLE “Income generation through client-based activities is now a major source of FirstRand’s proﬁts. Financial innovation has led to increased market orientation and marketability of bank assets. These recent developments have placed renewed focus on the need for robust risk management processes, sophisticated risk measurement techniques and integrated approaches to internal controls.” The RCC committee is appointed by the Board and has a formally approved charter. The RCC committee provides independent oversight of risk, capital management and compliance activities undertaken within the FirstRand Group. This includes ensuring that: • an effective policy and plan for risk management has been implemented to enhance the FirstRand’s ability to achieve desired outcomes; and • FirstRand’s risk disclosures are timely, sufﬁciently detailed and relevant to the Group’s stakeholders. The Committee does not assume the functions of management, which remains the responsibility of the executive directors, ofﬁcers and other members of senior management. During the year the RCC committee reviewed reports from the chief risk ofﬁcer and subsidiary risk committees in ensuring that signiﬁcant issues are addressed adequately across the Group.

The committee has overseen greater coordination by management of the risk management processes affecting the life cycle of each business line. International expansion In line with FirstRand’s strategic intent on international expansion of operations, the RCC committee oversaw processes for ensuring that the Group risk management policies and procedures were implemented at all operations. Aligning risk and reward Increased focus was placed on the alignment of remuneration practices with risk taken by FirstRand employees. This includes recommendations on the remuneration of employees in the risk and control functions. Identifying and managing sustainability risks By means of the analysis of potential volatility of earnings against the internal capital adequacy processes under various scenarios the RCC committee quantiﬁed the risk exposures impacting the short, medium and long run viability of the going concern. In addition to the above environmental, social and governance risks affecting the sustainability of the Group were assessed using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Stakeholders are referred to the comprehensive Risk and capital management report set out from pages 118 to 212 for a detailed review of the risk and capital management processes and responsibilities undertaken by the Group. ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN DURING THE YEAR FirstRand’s combined assurance model underlines the importance of an effective relationship between the RCC and Audit committees. To this end the RCC committee works closely with the Audit committee to ensure that risk management processes and information appropriately inform the evolving nature of risks affecting ﬁnancial institutions. In line with the above the committee has undertaken the following during the year: • approved risk management policies, standards and processes as required; • received the CRO reports from the Group and franchise chief risk ofﬁcers and specialised risk functions, which highlights the effectiveness of risk management processes; • noted corrective actions implemented and initiated additional corrective actions where necessary across all risk types; • received compliance and regulatory reports and noted actions taken and effectiveness of regulatory risk management. This included updates on new and pending regulatory changes; • received presentations on emerging risk and topics requiring detailed analysis; • reported the consolidated risk proﬁle and risk effectiveness to the Board; • approved regulatory capital models; • reviewed and approved changes to board limits and risk appetite; • overseen the Group’s stress testing processes used to assess the Group’s capital adequacy and to determine the Group’s internal policies and exposure limits as approved by the Board; • liaised closely with the Audit Committee to exchange information relevant to risk.

The committee is therefore not composed exclusively of independent directors as recommended by King III. The Board is of the opinion that Mr Crouse’s specialist skills, experience, knowledge of the FirstRand Group and value that these bring to Audit committee deliberations, warrant his ongoing membership.

In discharging this responsibility, the directors rely on management to prepare the consolidated and separate annual ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS and for keeping adequate accounting and separate records in accordance with the Group’s system of internal control. As such, the annual ﬁnancial statements include amounts based on judgments and estimates made by management. In preparing the annual ﬁnancial statements, suitable accounting policies have been applied and reasonable estimates have been made by management. The directors approve signiﬁcant changes to accounting policies, however, there were no changes to accounting policies during the ﬁnancial year. The ﬁnancial statements incorporate full and responsible disclosure in line with the Group’s philosophy on corporate governance. The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control. To enable the directors to meet these responsibilities, the directors set the standards for internal control to reduce the risk of error or loss in a cost effective manner. The standards include the appropriate delegation of responsibilities within a clearly deﬁned framework, effective accounting procedures and adequate segregation of duties to ensure an acceptable level of risk. The focus of risk management in the Group is on identifying, assessing, managing and monitoring all known forms of risk across the Group. Based on the information and explanations given by management and the internal auditors, nothing has come to the attention of the directors to indicate that the internal controls are inadequate and that the ﬁnancial records may not be relied on in preparing the consolidated and separate annual ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS and maintaining accountability for the Group’s assets and liabilities. Nothing has come to the attention of the directors to indicate any breakdown in the functioning of internal controls, resulting in a material loss to the Group, during the year and up to the date of this report. Based on the effective internal controls implemented by management, the directors are satisﬁed that the consolidated and separate annual ﬁnancial statements fairly present the state of affairs of the Group and company, at the end of the ﬁnancial year, and the net income and cash ﬂows for the year. Alan Hedding, CA(SA), supervised the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements for the year. The directors have reviewed the Group and company’s budget and ﬂow of funds forecast and considered the Group and company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the light of current and anticipated economic conditions. The directors have reviewed the assumptions underlying these budgets and forecasts based on currently available information. On the basis of this review, and in the light of the current ﬁnancial position and proﬁtable trading history, the directors are satisﬁed that the Group has adequate resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. The going concern basis therefore continues to apply and has been adopted in the preparation of the annual ﬁnancial statements. It is the responsibility of the Group’s independent external auditors, Deloitte & Touche and PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc, to report on the fair presentation of the annual ﬁnancial statements. Their unqualiﬁed report appears on page 114. The consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements of the Group, which appear on pages 115 to 212 and 213 to 404 and the separate annual ﬁnancial statements of the company, which appear on pages 405 to 426, were approved by the Board of directors on 10 September 2012 and are signed on its behalf by: LL Dippenaar SE Nxasana Chairman Chief executive ofﬁcer Sandton 10 September 2012 Group secretary’s certiﬁcation DECLARATION BY THE COMPANY SECRETARY IN RESPECT OF SECTION 88(E) OF THE COMPANIES ACT.

Registered auditor An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence Director: Tom Winterboer about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. The Sandton procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the 10 September 2012 assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the ﬁnancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Identifying, assessing, quantifying, pricing and managing these risks appropriately are core competencies of the individual business areas. Individual risk types are commonly grouped into three broad categories: strategic and business risks, ﬁnancial risks and operational risks. Risk category reference Risk components Deﬁnition Page STRATEGIC AND Includes strategic risk, Strategic risk is the risk to current or prospective earnings arising from 132 BUSINESS RISKS business risk, volume inappropriate business decisions or the improper implementation of such and margin risk, decisions. reputational risk, and environmental, Business risk is the risk to earnings and capital from potential changes in social and governance the business environment, client behaviour and technological progress. (ESG) risks. Business risk is often associated with volume and margin risk and relates to the Group’s ability to generate sufﬁcient levels of revenue to offset its costs. Volume and margin risk is the risk that the earnings and capital base is negatively impacted by a downturn in revenue due to market factors (e.g. margin compression), combined with the risk that the cost base is inﬂexible. Reputational risk is the risk of reputational damage due to compliance failures, pending litigations or underperformance or negative media coverage. ESG risks focus on the environmental, social and governance issues which impact the Group’s ability to successfully and sustainably implement business strategy. FINANCIAL RISKS Capital management The Group manages capital by allocating resources effectively in terms of 136 its risk appetite and in a manner that maximises value for shareholders. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of loss due to the non-performance of a counterparty 145 in respect of any ﬁnancial or other obligation. For fair value portfolios, the deﬁnition of credit risk is expanded to include the risk of losses through fair value changes arising from changes in credit spreads. Credit risk also includes credit default risk, pre-settlement risk, country risk, concentration risk and securitisation risk. Securitisations Securitisation is the structured process whereby loans and other 178 and conduits receivables are packaged, underwritten and sold in the form of asset backed securities. Counterparty Counterparty credit risk is the risk of a counterparty to a contract, transaction 185 credit risk or agreement defaulting prior to the ﬁnal settlement of the transaction’s cash ﬂows.

Translation risk is the risk associated with banks that transact in foreign currencies or hold foreign assets. The greater the proportion of asset, liability and equity classes denominated in a foreign currency, the greater the translation risk. Funding and Funding liquidity risk is the risk that a bank will not be able to meet current 195 liquidity risk and future cash ﬂow and collateral requirements (expected and unexpected) without negatively affecting its reputation, daily operations and/or ﬁnancial position. Market liquidity risk is the risk that market disruptions or lack of market liquidity will cause the bank to be unable (or able, but with difﬁculty) to trade in speciﬁc markets without affecting market prices signiﬁcantly.

It is therefore part of the Group’s tactical and strategic decision making. The Group aligns its risk management approach to its strategy discussed in the COO and CFO’s report on page 14. Risk taking is an essential part of the Group’s business. FirstRand recognises risk assessment, monitoring and management as core competencies and important differentiators in the competitive environment in which it operates. The Group deﬁnes risk widely – as any factor that, if not adequately assessed, monitored and managed, may prevent it from achieving its business objectives or result in adverse outcomes, including damage to its reputation. FirstRand follows a comprehensive approach to risk and capital management that comprises six core components, illustrated in the following chart. Components of FirstRand’s approach to risk and capital management RISK APPETITE Best-in-class risk and capital Assurance through independent methodologies and approaches validation and audit Integration of sustainability, risk Pervasive stress testing framework and and ﬁnance in business processes embedding of scenario-based thinking GOVERNANCE These are discussed further in this report: • The Group’s risk appetite frames all organisational decision making and forms the basis for the reﬁnement of risk identiﬁcation, assessment and management capabilities (see page 123). • A strong governance structure and policy framework fosters the embedding of risk considerations in existing business processes and ensures that consistent standards exist across the Group’s operating units (see page 129). • Best practice risk and capital methodologies have been developed in and for the relevant business areas (see page 132 to 212). • An integrated approach to sustainability and managing risk was established to facilitate the exchange of information between individual risk areas, and between risk and ﬁnance functions (see page 124). • The Group employs a comprehensive, consistent and integrated approach to stress testing that is ingrained as a business planning and management tool, emphasising scenario-based analyses in all its decisions. Stress testing includes the quantiﬁcation of potential volatility of earnings under various scenarios and due to event risk. (see page 125). • Independent oversight, validation and audit functions ensure a high standard of assurance across methodological, operational and process components of the Group’s risk and capital management processes (see page 128). 123 Risk appetite • risk transfer to be about true risk transfer and not accounting or regulatory arbitrage; FirstRand Group AFS The level of risk the Group is willing to take on – its risk appetite – is determined by the Board, which also assumes responsibility for • sources of income must be widely diversiﬁed across business ensuring that risks are adequately managed and controlled through entities, products, market segments, investments, ﬁnancial and the Risk, capital management and compliance (RCC) committee and commodity markets and regions; subcommittees, as described in the Risk governance structure • the potential impact of severe downturn and stress conditions section on page 129. must be identified, measured, quantified, understood and contained in accordance with capital preservation and earnings The Group’s risk appetite framework sets out speciﬁc principles, volatility parameters; objectives and measures that link diverse considerations such as • concentration in higher risk asset classes must be avoided; strategy, risk, target capitalisation levels and acceptable levels • diversiﬁed sources of funding; of earnings volatility.

These instruments qualify for the grandfathering arrangements under Basel III. The Group’s old-style Tier 2 instruments also do not meet the loss absorbency criteria under Basel III and will be grandfathered. Demand for capital Risk weighted assets (RWA) movement for the year was driven mainly by the following: • credit risk – the increase is due to credit risk recalibrations, volume growth and the 6% scalar applied to exposures on the advanced internal ratings-based (AIRB) approach (Basel 2.5 requirement); • market risk – decreased market risk positions were offset by the Basel 2.5 stressed VaR requirements and incremental risk charge; and • equity investment risk effective 1 July 2011, the SARB requested that all equity investment risk exposures be risk weighted under the simple risk weighted method (previously risk weighted under the standardised approach). This is only applicable to the nonbank entities and has increased the RWA movement for the Group. Under Basel III RWA are expected to increase further mainly due to the credit valuation adjustment for counterparty credit risk, as well as the requirement for capital on central clearing parties. 139 Capital adequacy FirstRand Group AFS Composition of capital The following table shows the composition of regulatory capital for FirstRand.

Based on the outcome of detailed stress testing, each entity targets a capital level in excess of the regulatory minimum. Adequate controls and processes are in place to ensure that each entity is adequately capitalised to meet local regulatory requirements. Capital generated by subsidiaries in excess of targeted levels is returned to the Group, in the form of dividends.

The fair value adjustments made to these advances directly impact the income statement and the value of advances. For risk management purposes a migration matrix is used to estimate the fair value impact of changes in credit risk. The matrix contains probabilities of downgrading or upgrading to another rating bucket. The main beneﬁts of using the migration matrix to estimate the fair value impact of credit risk are: • downgrades are more realistic because better rating grades are less likely to be downgraded compared to riskier rating grades; • migration matrices take into account higher volatility of riskier rating grades; • rating migration can be positive or negative; • rating migration is not restricted by one notch only and, in extreme cases, includes default risk; and • migration matrices can be based on different economic conditions (for example long-term, downturn). The graph below sets out the fair value impact based on actual observed rating migrations from Standard & Poor’s over the long-term. Based on this scenario the average fair value impact is a loss of approximately R120 million. The fair value at the 75th percentile (i.e. there is a probability of 25% to exceed this value) of the distribution is a loss of approximately R196 million.

Funding strategy The Group’s objective is to fund its activities in a sustainable, diversiﬁed, efﬁcient and ﬂexible manner, underpinned by strong counterparty relationships within prudential limits and requirements. The objective is to maintain natural market share, but also to outperform at the margin, which will provide the Group with a natural liquidity buffer. The Group seeks to diversify funding sources across segments, countries, instrument types and maturities. Where structural restrictions exist such as South Africa’s reliance on wholesale funding, the risk is mitigated through term proﬁle and liquidity buffers.

Relying solely on the contractual liquidity mismatch when assessing a bank’s maturity analysis would overstate risk, since this represents an absolute worst case assessment of cash ﬂows at maturity. Due to South Africa’s structural liquidity position, banks tend to have a particularly pronounced negative (contractual) gap in the shorter term short-term institutional funds which represent a signiﬁcant proportion of banks’ liabilities. These are used to fund long-term assets, e.g. mortgages. Therefore, in addition to the analysis in the table above, the Group carries out an adjusted liquidity mismatch analysis, which estimates the size of the asset and liability mismatch under normal business conditions. This analysis is also used to manage this mismatch on an ongoing basis.

Capital requirements are calculated for each franchise using the AMA capital model and then allocated to the legal entities within the Group based on gross income contribution ratios. This split of capital between legal entities is required for internal capital allocation, regulatory reporting and performance measurement purposes. Business practices continuously evolve and the operational risk control environment is therefore constantly changing as a reﬂection of the underlying risk proﬁle. The assessment of the operational risk proﬁle and exposures and associated capital requirements take the following into account: • changes in the operational risk profile, as measured by the various operational risk tools; • material effects of expansion into new markets, new or substantially changed products or activities as well as the closure of existing operations; • changes in the control environment the organisation targets a continuous improvement in the control environment, but deterioration in effectiveness is also possible due to, for example, unforeseen increases in transaction volumes; and • changes in the external environment, which drives certain types of operational risk. 209 Operational risk assessment, management approaches and tools FirstRand Group AFS OPERATIONAL RISK TOOLS AND APPROACHES Risk control self assessments (RCSA) Process-based risk and control identiﬁcation assessments (PRCIA) Key risk indicators (KRI) • integrated in the day-to-day business and risk management • used across the Group in all businesses as an early warning processes; measure; • used by business and risk managers to identify and monitor key • highlight areas of changing trends in exposures to speciﬁc key risk areas and assess the effectiveness of existing controls; and operational risks; and • PRCIA (currently being rolled out) is the risk and control • inform operational risk proﬁles which are reported periodically assessment per product/service based on key business to the appropriate management and risk committees and are processes. monitored on a continuous basis.

These include the purpose of limiting its net loss potential through the diversiﬁcation amounts due to and from agents, brokers and policyholders. 233 Receivables are included in the accounts receivable balance on the statement of ﬁnancial position while payables are included in the FirstRand Group AFS creditors and accruals balance. If there is objective evidence that an amount receivable under an insurance contract is impaired then the Group reduces the carrying amount of the insurance receivable accordingly and recognises the impairment loss in profit or loss. The same indicators that are considered when assessing whether a ﬁnancial asset measured at amortised cost is impaired are considered when assessing whether there is objective evidence of impairment of receivables related to insurance. 29.6 Accounting for cell captive arrangements Certain cell captive arrangements have been entered into by businesses within the Group. Per these arrangements, certain risk products marketed and distributed by these companies are underwritten by an external insurer. The collection of premiums and the payment of claims is a function that is performed by the cell captive’s administrator. When the substance of the arrangement is such that the Group controls the cell captive, the results of the cell captives are fully consolidated into the results of the Group. 30. CUSTOMER LOYALTY PROGRAMMES The Group operates a customer loyalty programme in terms of which it undertakes to provide goods and services to certain customers. The reward credits are accounted for as a separately identiﬁable component of the fee and commission income transactions of which they form a part. The consideration allocated to the reward credits is measured at the fair value of the reward credit and recognised over the period in which the customer utilises the reward credits. Expenses relating to the provision of the reward credits are recognised as fee and commission expenses as they are incurred. 31. SERVICE CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS Service concession arrangements are recognised if the Group acts as an operator in the provision of public services. Where the Group has a contractual right to recover the amount receivable in respect of the arrangements from the government organisation the amount receivable is classiﬁed as a ﬁnancial asset and is accounted for in terms of the Group’s policy for ﬁnancial assets. Alternatively, where the Group is entitled to collect the monies for usage from the public the Group recognises an intangible asset. The intangible asset is measured in accordance with the Group’s policy for intangible assets and amortised over its useful life. Fee income earned from public usage is included in fee and commission income as it is receivable.

For accounting purposes, derivative instruments are classiﬁed as held either for trading or hedging. Derivatives that are held for hedging are formally designated as hedging instruments as deﬁned in IAS 39. All other derivatives are classiﬁed as held for trading. The held for trading classiﬁcation includes two types of derivative instruments, those used in sales and trading activities, and those that are economic hedges but do not meet the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting. The latter includes derivatives managed in conjunction with ﬁnancial instruments designated at fair value. The Group’s derivative activities give rise to signiﬁcant open positions in portfolios of derivatives. These positions are managed continually to ensure that they remain within acceptable risk levels, with offsetting deals being utilised to achieve this where necessary. Whilst the Group employs the same credit risk management procedures to approve the potential credit exposures for derivatives as are used for traditional lending, the calculations and procedures used to assess credit risk for derivatives are more complex. The notional amounts of the derivative instruments do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash ﬂows involved or the current fair value of the instruments, and therefore, do not represent the Group’s exposure to credit or market risk. Derivative instruments become favourable (assets) or unfavourable (liabilities) based on changes in market interest rates, foreign currency, market share prices, credit rating and the price of underlying commodities, as applicable. The aggregate notional amount of derivative ﬁnancial instruments, the extent to which the instruments are favourable or unfavourable, and thus the aggregate fair value can ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly over time. The Group’s detailed risk management strategy, including the use of hedging instruments in risk management, is set out in the Risk and capital management report on pages 117 to 212. 259 9 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued FirstRand Group AFS Trading derivatives Most of the Group’s derivative transactions relate to sales and trading activities. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Trading activities in derivatives are entered into principally for the purpose of generating proﬁts from short-term ﬂuctuations in price or margin. Positions may be traded actively or be held over a period of time to beneﬁt from expected changes in currency rates, interest rates, equity prices or other market parameters. Trading includes market making, positioning and arbitrage activities. Market making entails quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants for the purpose of generating revenues based on spread and volume. Positioning means managing market risk positions in the expectation of beneﬁting from favourable movements in prices, rates or indices. Arbitrage involves identifying and proﬁting from price differentials between markets and products. As mentioned above, other derivatives classiﬁed as held for trading include non-qualifying hedging derivatives, ineffective hedging derivatives and the components of hedging derivatives that are not part of a designated and effective hedge. Non-qualifying hedging derivatives are entered into for risk management purposes but do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting. These include derivatives managed in conjunction with ﬁnancial instruments designated at fair value. Hedging instruments Fair value hedges The Group’s fair value hedges consist of commodity derivatives used to hedge the price risk associated with physical commodity positions and interest rate swaps that hedge the interest rate risk inherent in a ﬁxed rate preference share advance. For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in fair value of the derivative and in the fair value of the item in relation to the risk being hedged are recognised in proﬁt or loss. Upon discontinuance of the hedging relationship, any fair value adjustments recognised as part of the carrying amount of the hedged item in terms of fair value hedging requirements is included in the carrying amount of the item until it is disposed of. On disposal of the previously hedged item, these fair value adjustments will be realised through proﬁt or loss.

The mix of interest rates in the Group’s assets and liabilities exposes the Group to interest rate risk. Changes in the market interest rates have an impact on the Group’s proﬁt or loss. The Group has hedges in place to manage this risk and are accounted for as cash ﬂow hedges. The Group hedges this risk using separate portfolios. These portfolios are managed under separate mandates, which take into account the underlying risk inherent in each portfolio. Counterparty credit risk is managed centrally by FirstRand Credit. The inherent complexity of interest rate risk in the Group’s statement of ﬁnancial position and consequently in each portfolio, requires that the risk be analysed and managed using various analytical tools and frameworks. While each analytical process may highlight a different aspect of risk, each analytical tool is intended to corroborate and support the overall interest rate risk management objectives of the Group.

No exchange of principal takes place. The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss. Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are released to proﬁt or loss in periods in which movements in the hedged item affect proﬁt or loss. When hedging instruments are sold or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative gains or losses remain in other comprehensive income and are released to proﬁt or loss as the risk, previously hedged, affects proﬁt or loss. When the hedged risk is no longer expected to occur, the gains or losses deferred in other comprehensive income are released to proﬁt or loss immediately.

As the changes on the hedged items were less than the changes in fair value on the hedging instrument, a portion of ineffectiveness was recognised in proﬁt or loss.

F I R S T R A N D L I M I T E D A N N U A L I N T E G R AT E D R E P O R T 2 0 1 2 B 272 Notes to the consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements continued for the year ended 30 June 12 ADVANCES continued Securitisation transactions Securitisation transactions arranged by the Group result in either the full derecognition of the securitised ﬁnancial assets (i.e. traditional securitisation transactions) or the transfer of credit risk related to speciﬁc ﬁnancial assets, thereby resulting in neither the transfer nor derecognition of the asset (i.e. synthetic securitisations). In a synthetic securitisation transaction, credit risk related to speciﬁc advances is transferred to a SPE through credit derivatives. The securitised advances are neither transferred nor derecognised and associated credit derivatives are recognised at fair value through proﬁt or loss. The Group consolidates these securitisation vehicles as, in terms of IAS 27 Consolidated Financial Statements and SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities (SIC 12), the Group exercises control over the SPEs. The following are bankruptcy remote SPEs created to facilitate synthetic securitisation transactions in the Group: • Fresco 2, a bankruptcy remote SPE, facilitated a synthetic securitisation transaction where credit risk relating to the R20 billion (2011: R20 billion) of the value of a portfolio of the Group’s corporate advances, has been transferred to Fresco 2. • Procul, a bankruptcy remote SPE, facilitated a synthetic securitisation transaction where credit risk relating to retail instalment sale advances of R2 billion was transferred from WesBank to Procul. The transaction was wound up in 2011 and all the related notes issued were redeemed. In a traditional securitisation transaction, certain advances are transferred to a SPE, which then issues liabilities to third party investors, for example, variable rate notes. The Group consolidates these securitisation vehicles under SIC 12 and has, therefore, not derecognised the securitised advances. The Group’s obligations (associated liability) toward the third party note holders is limited to the cash ﬂows received on the underlying securitised advances, i.e. the note holders only have a claim to the ring fenced advances in the SPE, and not to other assets of the Group. The following are bankruptcy remote SPEs created to facilitate a traditional securitisation transaction related to WesBank retail instalment sale advances: • Nitro 4 facilitates a securitisation transaction amounting to R4 billion of WesBank retail instalment sale advances and was established in July 2011. Advances with a carrying amount of R2 573 million are held by Nitro 4 and are not derecognised as Nitro 4 is consolidated by the Group. Liabilities of R3 007 million have been recognised in terms of notes issued into the market. • Turbo Finance facilitated a securitisation transaction amounting to GBP 341 million of retail instalment sale advances in the United Kingdom relating to the Group’s MotoNovo ﬁnance division (formerly Carlyle Finance). It was established in September 2010 and issued notes into the market in February 2011. Advances with a carrying amount of R1 487 million (2011: R2 682 million) are held by Turbo Finance and are not derecognised as Turbo Finance is consolidated by the Group. Liabilities of R1 486 million (2011: R2 771 million) included in deposits have been recognised in terms of notes issued into the market. • Turbo Finance 2 facilitated a securitisation transaction amounting to GBP 320 million of retail instalment sale advances in the United Kingdom relating to the Group’s MotoNovo ﬁnance division (formerly Carlyle Finance) and was established in March 2012.

Liabilities of R3 637 million (2011: Rnil) included in deposits have been recognised in terms of notes issued into the market. The following are bankruptcy remote SPEs created to facilitate a traditional securitisation transaction related to FNB home loan advances: • iKhaya 1 facilitated a securitisation transaction amounting to R1.9 billion of FNB home loan advances. The transaction was wound up during the year and all the notes issued were called/settled. Advances with a carrying amount of Rnil million (2011: R1 161 million) are held by iKhaya 1 and are not derecognised as iKhaya 1 is consolidated by the Group. Liabilities of Rnil million (2011: R1 131 million) included in deposits have been recognised in terms of notes issued into the market. • iKhaya 2 facilitated a securitisation transaction amounting to R3 billion of FNB home loan advances. The transaction was wound up during the year and all the notes issued were called/settled. Advances with a carrying amount of Rnil million (2011: R1 620 million) are held by iKhaya 2 and are not derecognised as iKhaya 2 is consolidated by the Group.

Additional information relating to these transactions is set out in note 36. 273 12 ADVANCES continued FirstRand Group AFS Credit risk mitigation Collateral is an important mitigant of credit risk. Refer to page 145 to page 177 of the Risk and capital management report for the Group’s credit risk management strategy with detailed information on credit risk mitigation. The table below sets out the ﬁnancial effect of collateral per class of advance. The amounts disclosed below represent the difference between the balance sheet impairment using the actual LGD and the proxy unsecured LGD for all secured portfolios.

Where there is no collateral or where collateral is disregarded for impairment purposes, no ﬁnancial effect was calculated. It is the Group’s policy that all items of collateral are valued at the inception of a transaction and at various points throughout the life of a transaction, either through physical inspection or indexation methods, as appropriate. For wholesale and commercial portfolios, valuations are reassessed as part of the annual facility review. For mortgage portfolios, collateral valuations are updated on an ongoing basis through statistical indexation models. However, in the event of default a more detailed review and valuation of collateral is performed, this therefore yields a more accurate ﬁnancial effect. Refer to note 37 for information relating to the fair value of advances. Refer to note 46 for the current and non-current analysis of advances.

The following factors are considered when determining whether there is objective evidence that the asset has been impaired: • breaches of loan covenants and conditions; • the time period of overdue contractual payments; • actuarial credit models; • loss of employment or death of the borrower; and • the probability of liquidation of the customer. Where objective evidence of impairment exists, impairment testing is performed based on the loss given default (LGD), probability of default (PD) and exposure at default (EAD). 2012 FNB R million Retail Commercial FNB Africa Analysis of movement in impairment of advances per class of advance Opening balance 3 793 1 011 375 Amounts written off (2 919) (306) (77) Acquisitions/(disposals) of subsidiaries – – – Acquisitions/(disposals) of advances 4 – – Reclassiﬁcations – – – Exchange rate difference (3) 3 9 Unwinding of discounted present value on non-performing loans (113) (9) (9) Net new impairments created/(released)** 3 399 174 121 Closing balance 4 161 873 419 (Increase)/decrease in provision** (3 399) (174) (121) Recoveries of bad debts previously written off 831 8 – Impairment loss recognised in proﬁt or loss (2 568) (166) (121) * The Group’s corporate transactional banking activities were previously reported under FNB Corporate.

These are not always drawn up to the same date as the ﬁnancial statements of the Group. Where the reporting date of the associate is different from that of the Group, the Group uses the most recent available ﬁnancial statements of the associate as well as reviews the associates management accounts for material transactions during the in-between period. In instances where signiﬁcant events occurred between the last reporting date of an associate and the reporting date of the Group, the effect of such events are adjusted for. The Group has applied this principle consistently since adopting the equity accounting method for associates. 293 16 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT FirstRand Group AFS The useful life of each asset is assessed individually.

Small item ﬁxed assets are those items of property and equipment with a cost of less than R7 000. The Group has determined that from the 2012 ﬁnancial year all small item ﬁxed assets will no longer be capitalised but rather written off through the income statement when acquired. This change in estimate has been applied prospectively in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. The write off of these small items ﬁxed assets is reﬂected in note 3 of the ﬁnancial statements. The change in estimate resulted in accelerated depreciation of R251 million in the current period relating to small item ﬁxed assets that had been capitalised in prior periods and written off in full in the current period.

Refer to note 26 for liabilities that are related to the ﬁnance lease assets. The impairment reversal of R2 million is as a result of exchange rate gains causing a movement in the recoverable amount of the asset. R37 million of the impairment of freehold property in the prior year was as a result of the decline in certain offshore property markets, where the additional cost to the Group to complete certain building projects is in excess of the expected recoverable amounts of these assets. The remaining impairment is as a result of the decline in the market value of property and assets held under lease agreements. The cost to acquire and repair these assets exceeded their market value. The impairment of computer equipment in the prior year was as a result of the decline in the market value of this equipment.

In terms of the service concession arrangement the Group is entitled to charge the users of the asset for usage, the pricing of which has been established in the terms of the service concession arrangement. The Group has the obligation to maintain the asset in a workable condition and will deliver ownership of the asset to the government at the conclusion of the concession period. The carrying amount of the intangible asset relating to the service concession arrangement has been estimated taking into account usage levels and the pricing under the arrangement. During the previous year there was a reversal of a previously recognised impairment loss in respect of the service concession arrangement entered into by the Group. The reversal occurred as result of an improvement in the receipts associated with the asset’s economic performance being better than expected and a reduction in the risk margin associated with the asset. 299 17 INTANGIBLE ASSETS continued FirstRand Group AFS The impairment of goodwill in the prior year was as a result of the partial disposal of investments in certain subsidiaries of the Group. The partial disposal of these subsidiaries requires the write down of the related portion of goodwill, and in the case of certain private equity investments, this represented the realisation of previously unrealised value of the investments. Impairment of goodwill also occurred as a result of the decline in the future economic beneﬁts expected to be derived from certain investments in subsidiaries of the Group. The circumstances which resulted in this decline related to the decrease in the net asset value of these investments. The goodwill impairment of R115 million relates to certain investments in private equity subsidiaries held through Corvest Proprietary Limited that have been impaired during the current ﬁnancial year. These speciﬁcally relate to the investments in South African companies SA Die & Pattern Company Proprietary Limited (R98 million) and Diamonds Discount Liquor Proprietary Limited (R9 million). These subsidiaries are currently operating under ﬁnancial pressure and have defaulted on certain of their debt agreements with the Group. Both of these investments are in the process of being disposed of and have been included in non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale. The amounts included in non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale, are the amounts after the impairment of goodwill was recognised. The remaining goodwill impairment relates to various other private equity subsidiaries held by Corvest Proprietary Limited that are individually immaterial and are included in RMB. The recoverable amount was calculated based on the value in use of the investments in subsidiaries. Details about the discount rate and growth rates applied are set out in the table below. Impairment of goodwill For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGU) at the lowest level of operating activity to which it relates, and is therefore not combined at Group level. The CGUs to which the goodwill balance as at 30 June relate to: R million 2012 2011 FNB Botswana 29 28 FNB Mozambique 128 105 FNB Retail 433 431 RMB Corvest 192 205 RMB Other 117 117 WesBank 164 178 Other 121 108 Total 1 184 1 172 When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined as the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use. The fair value less cost to sell is determined as the current market value of the CGU less any costs related to the realisation of the CGU. The value in use is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash ﬂows to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the CGU. The future cash ﬂows are based on ﬁnancial budgets approved by management covering a one year period. Cash ﬂows beyond one year are extrapolated using the estimated growth rate for the CGU. The period over which management has projected the cash ﬂows ranges between three and ﬁve years. The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average past growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates.

Some of the other assumptions include investment returns, expense inﬂation rates, tax rates and new business growth. RMB determines the recoverable amount as the fair value less cost to sell and not based on the value in use due to the nature of the entity. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the speciﬁc segment, adjusted for speciﬁc risks relating to the segment.

Management had begun negotiations with potential buyers and as a result Finsettle Services Proprietary Limited was classiﬁed as a disposal group held for sale in line with the requirements of IFRS 5. An impairment loss of R3 million was recognised when Finsettle was classiﬁed as a disposal group held for sale. The full impairment loss was allocated to goodwill recognised at acquisition. During the current ﬁnancial year there was a change to the plan to dispose of Finsettle Services Proprietary Limited. Finsettle Services Proprietary Limited was previously disclosed as a disposal group held for sale. The negotiations between management and potential buyers of Finsettle Services Proprietary Limited was unsuccessful and management decided to wind down the business rather than dispose of it. As a result of this change in the plan of sale, Finsettle Services Proprietary Limited were no longer classiﬁed as a disposal group held for sale and all assets and liabilities of Finsettle Services Proprietary Limited were reallocated to their respective categories on the statement of ﬁnancial position. The effect of the decision on the results for the current period is that additional depreciation was recognised on the property and equipment that would not have been recognised if the entity had continued to be classiﬁed as held for sale. This additional depreciation was recognised as an impairment charge as it represents an IFRS 5 remeasurement adjustment of a disposal group classiﬁed as held for sale. The additional depreciation amounted to R203 000 and has been included in operating expenses.

Terms and conditions of insurance contracts The terms and conditions of insurance contracts have a material effect on the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash ﬂows. The key risks associated with general insurance contracts are claims experience. The provisions of these contracts are reﬁned at least annually. As claims experience develops, certain claims are settled, further claims are revised and new claims are reported. The reasonableness of the estimation process is tested by management and reviewed on a regular basis. The Group believes that the liability for claims carried at the end of the year is adequate. 323 27 POLICYHOLDER LIABILITIES UNDER INSURANCE CONTRACTS continued FirstRand Group AFS 27. 4 Risk management relating to insurance contracts continued The Group underwrites short-term insurance in the following risk classes: • Liability – Provide cover for risks relating to the incurring of a liability other than relating to a risk covered more speciﬁcally under another insurance contract. • Motor – Provide indemnity cover relating to the possession, use or ownership of a motor vehicle. The cover includes comprehensive cover, third party, ﬁre and theft and liability to other parties. • Personal accident – Provide compensation arising out of the death or disability directly caused by an accident occurring anywhere in the world, provided that death or disability occurs within 12 months of this injury. • Property – Provide indemnity relating to movable and immovable property caused by perils such as ﬁre explosion, earthquakes, acts of nature, burst geysers and pipes, malicious damage, impact, alterations and additions. The Group underwrites long-term insurance in the following risk classes: • Death cover – Provide compensation arising out of the death of the policyholder. With respect to the credit life product, in the event of a valid death claim, the Group settles the policyholder’s outstanding debt by way of a lump sum payment to the ﬁnance provider. • Disability cover – Provide compensation arising out of the permanent disability of the policyholder. With respect to the credit life product, in the event of a valid death claim, the Group settles the policyholder’s outstanding debt by way of a lump sum payment to the ﬁnance provider. Risk management objectives and policies for mitigating insurance risk The principle risk the Group faces under such contracts is that the actual claims and expenses exceed the carrying amount of insurance liabilities. Insurance risk occurs due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of future cash ﬂows arising under insurance contracts. This is inﬂuenced by the frequency and severity of claims, especially if actual beneﬁts paid, are greater than originally estimated, and the subsequent development of long-term claims. The Group manages its insurance risk through underwriting limits, approval procedures for transactions that involve new products or that exceed set limits, pricing guidelines and monitoring of emerging issues. The Group cedes insurance risk to limit exposure to underwriting losses under various reinsurance agreements. These reinsurance agreements spread the risk of loss and minimise the effect of losses. The risk retention levels depend on evaluation of speciﬁc risk, subject to certain circumstances, to maximum limits based on the characteristics of coverage. The Group is not exposed to any signiﬁcant concentrations of insurance risk due to the fact that the nature of the policies underwritten by the Group. In addition, the Group has adequate reinsurance in place to reduce the risk that arise from insurance contracts to acceptable levels. 28 TIER 2 LIABILITIES R million 2012 2011 Fixed rate bonds* 4 414 4 697 Floating rate bonds** 3 471 1 969 Total Tier 2 liabilities 7 885 6 666 * The ﬁxed rate bonds mature between 15 September 2014 and 21 December 2018 and bear interest at between 9% and 12%. ** The ﬂoating rate bonds mature between 5 November 2012 and 22 December 2018 and the interest varies between 65 bps and 300 bps above the three month JIBAR rate.

The Group adopted revised share incentive plans in 2009, a conditional share plan (CSP) and forfeitable share plan (FSP). These plans are in line with practices in the UK and with several adopted schemes for large JSE listed or dual listed companies. On the date of the unbundling of Momentum, FirstRand will receive no further services from the Momentum employees. As such all of the unvested amounts that related to the share-based payment transactions in which Momentum employees received FirstRand shares were recognised on the date of unbundling. For equity settled schemes the share-based payment reserve relating to these schemes was reclassiﬁed to retained earnings and the liability for cash settled schemes was derecognised as part of the unbundling. Description of the schemes FirstRand share incentive scheme The rules of the FirstRand share incentive scheme (the scheme) are constituted in the FirstRand share trust. This scheme was implemented in 2000. One third of the total number of options issued may be exercised after the third year, two-thirds after the fourth year and all of the options vest on the ﬁfth anniversary of the grant date. The last of the beneﬁts awarded under this scheme vested during the year ended 30 June 2011. The share-based payment reserve relating to these awards was reclassiﬁed to retained earnings. The FNB Botswana and FNB Namibia schemes are generally aligned to this scheme in terms of purpose and rules.

These shares are employee beneﬁts that fall within the scope of IAS 19 and as such the portion of the sharebased payment reserve that relates to these shares has been reclassiﬁed to staff-related provisions, refer to note 25. FirstRand black employee trust This trust was set up speciﬁcally for the beneﬁt of the black employees. The participation in this trust is in addition to participation in any existing FirstRand share incentive scheme. The issues of participation rights in the trust was made as follows: • ﬁrst issue on 20 July 2005; • second issue on 1 November 2006; • third issue on 3 December 2007; and • last issue on 14 May 2010. Distribution to beneﬁciaries takes place on 31 December 2014. FirstRand black non-executive directors’ trust The beneﬁciaries of this trust are the black non-executive directors and those executive directors who were non-executives prior to becoming executives of FirstRand Group companies. Distribution to beneﬁciaries takes place on 31 December 2014. FirstRand share appreciation right scheme The FirstRand share appreciation right scheme was implemented in 2006 to provide selected FirstRand Group employees, including executive directors of the participating companies, the opportunity of receiving incentive remuneration payments based on the increase in the market value of ordinary FirstRand shares. One third of the total number of rights issued may be exercised after the third, two thirds after the fourth and all of the shares by the ﬁfth anniversary of the date of grant, provided that the performance objectives set for the grant have been achieved. In any one year where the performance objectives have not been achieved the shares will not vest in that year but will be carried over to the following year, provided that the performance objectives are met in that following year. If performance conditions are not met by year ﬁve, the rights will not vest. During the year ended 30 June 2011 the strike price of the appreciation rights was amended as a result of the Momentum unbundling. During the current year the strike price was amended as a result of the special dividend of R0.70. The purpose of these amendments was to place employees in the same position before and after the transactions. The modiﬁcations were neither beneﬁcial nor detrimental to the employees. Conditional share plan The conditional award comprises a number of full shares with no strike price that will vest conditionally after three years. The number of shares that vest is determined by the extent to which the performance conditions are met. Conditional awards are made annually and vesting is subject to speciﬁed ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial performance, set annually by the Group’s Remuneration committee. During the year ended 30 June 2011 additional conditional awards were granted to the Group employees as a result of the unbundling of Momentum. During the current year additional conditional awards were granted to Group employees and as a result of the special dividend of R0.70. The purpose of the additional shares was to place the employees in the same position before and after the transactions. The modiﬁcations were neither beneﬁcial nor detrimental to employees. 331 30 REMUNERATION SCHEMES continued FirstRand Group AFS Description of the schemes continued Forfeitable share plan The forfeitable share plan is a remuneration scheme that grants selected employees full shares with no strike price that will vest after two years. Selected employees are awarded shares that are forfeited if the employee leaves the employment of the FirstRand Group before the end of the vesting period. During the vesting period the shares are held in trust for the employees. Dividends earned on the shares during the vesting period form part of the award. As such they accrue to the participants and will be delivered along with the shares at the vesting date. Due to the unbundling of Momentum Limited from the FirstRand Group in December 2010, participants received MMI Holdings shares to compensate them for loss of value. These shares vested during September 2011 and the related liability settled. Co-investment arrangement A co-investment arrangement was established whereby certain key executives and decision makers of the Group are allowed to coinvest with FirstRand in certain predeﬁned portfolios. The rationale for the co-investment arrangement includes: • alignment of management and shareholder objectives; • retention of key employees and decision makers; and • attracting new talent in a highly competitive market. The participants who co-invest with FirstRand buy into existing portfolios at the disclosed fair values and are required to place capital at risk. No additional gearing is provided by FirstRand. Participants share in future proﬁts to the extent of their capital as a percentage of the total capital at risk in the portfolios. The co-investment arrangement encourages a long-term perspective and commitment from employees. The arrangement also encourages executives to remain in the employ of the Group companies in excess of three years, as the value of the underlying investments are expected to realise over a longer time frame. The Group remuneration committee determines annually: • the portfolios in which co-investment will be allowed; • the level of co-investment allowed; and • which key executives and decision makers qualify for co-investment. The amounts invested by key management personnel have been included in note 42. Valuation methodology FirstRand share incentive scheme Fair values for the share incentive schemes are calculated at the grant date using a modiﬁcation of the Cox Rubenstein binomial model. For valuation purposes, each call option granted has been valued as a Bermudan call option with a number of exercise dates. The days on which the options can be exercised have been assumed to be the last day that the shares trade cum-dividend. Market data consists of the following: • volatility is the expected volatility over the period of the plan, and historical volatility was used as a proxy for expected volatility; and • the interest rate is the risk free rate of return, recorded on the date of the option grant, on a South African government zero coupon bond of a term equal to the expected life of the option. Dividend data consists of the following: • the last dividend paid is the Rand amount of the last dividend before the options were granted; • the last dividend date is the ex date of the last dividend; and • the dividend growth is the annual expected dividend growth. Employee statistic assumptions: • annual employee turnover is the average annual rate at which employees participating in the option scheme are expected to resign before the options have vested. The number of iterations is the number to be used in the binomial model, which is limited to 500. The weighted average number of forfeitures is based on the major grants as these grants have a more reliable cancellation or forfeiture pattern.

These criteria, which must be met or exceeded to enable vesting, vary from year to year, depending on the conditions prevailing at the time of the award. The criteria for the schemes are as follows: 2007 FirstRand’s normalised earnings per share (EPS) must grow at a rate per annum which equals or exceeds CPIX plus 10%, measured on a cumulative basis from base year end, 30 June 2007, for the ﬁve year performance period, to enable 100% vesting. In respect of the 2006 and 2007 awards, should CPIX plus 10% not be achieved, the Remco may sanction a partial vesting of the appreciation right, which is calculated pro-rata to the performance which exceeds CPIX. 2008 FirstRand’s normalised EPS must grow at a rate per annum which equals or exceeds CPIX, measured on a cumulative basis from base year end 30 June 2008, to enable 100% vesting. In addition FirstRand’s net income after cost of capital (NIACC) must be positive over the ﬁve year performance period. 2009 FirstRand’s normalised EPS must grow at a rate per annum which equals or exceeds CPIX, measured on a cumulative basis from year end 30 June 2009, to enable 100% vesting. In addition FirstRand’s NIACC must be positive over the three year performance period. 2010 FirstRand’s normalised EPS growth must equal or exceed South African Nominal GDP (deﬁned as South African GDP plus CPIX) plus 4%, measured on a cumulative basis, from year end 30 June 2010, to enable 100% vesting. In addition NIACC must be positive over the three year performance period. Should Nominal GDP plus 4% not be achieved, the Remco may sanction a partial vesting of conditional shares, which is calculated pro-rata to the performance which exceeds Nominal GDP. 2011 FirstRand’s normalised EPS growth must equal or exceed South African Nominal GDP (deﬁned as South African GDP plus CPIX) plus 1.5%, measured on a cumulative basis, from year end 30 June 2010, to enable 100% vesting. In addition NIACC must be positive over the three year performance period. Should Nominal GDP plus 1.5% not be achieved, the Remco may sanction a partial vesting of conditional shares, which is calculated pro-rata to the performance which exceeds Nominal GDP. FirstRand black employee trust Economically, FirstRand has granted European call options and is repurchasing shares. The strike price equates to the expected outstanding amount of the funding. The value of the implicit options is determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Market data consists of the following: • volatility is the expected volatility over the period of the plan, and historical volatility was used as a proxy for expected volatility; and • the interest rate used was the RMB forward prime curve (extrapolated where necessary) as the funding of the option is linked to the prime lending rate. Dividend data consists of the following: • a ﬁxed dividend yield was assumed. Employee statistic assumptions: • the weighted average forfeiture rate used is based on historical forfeiture data for this scheme and takes cognisance of whether the shares are in or out the money and the vesting date. 333 30 REMUNERATION SCHEMES continued FirstRand Group AFS Valuation methodology continued FirstRand black non-executive directors’ trust The FirstRand black non-executive directors’ trust is valued on the same methodology as used for the FirstRand black employee trust, except that a zero percentage weighted average forfeiture rate was used due to the fact that there are only 10 participants (2011: 10 participants). Market data consists of the following: • volatility is the expected volatility over the period of the plan, and historical volatility was used as a proxy for expected volatility; and • the interest rate used was the RMB forward prime curve (extrapolated where necessary) as the funding of the option is linked to the prime lending rate. Dividend data consists of the following: • a ﬁxed dividend yield was assumed. FirstRand share appreciation right scheme The share appreciation right scheme issues are valued using a Cox Ross Rubenstein binomial tree. The scheme is cash settled and will thus be repriced at each reporting date. Market data consists of the following: • volatility is the expected volatility over the period of the plan, and historical volatility was used as a proxy for expected volatility; and • the interest rate is the risk free rate of return, as recorded on the last day of the ﬁnancial year, on a swap curve of a term equal to the expected life of the share appreciation right. Dividend data consists of the following: • management’s estimates of future dividends. Employee statistic assumptions: The number of rights granted is reduced by the actual staff turnover at year end. This turnover is then assumed to be constant over the period of the grant and used to estimate the expected number of rights which will vest on the vesting date. Conditional share plan The conditional share plan is valued using the Black Scholes model with a zero strike price. The scheme is equity settled and is therefore not repriced at each reporting date. Market and dividend data consists of the following: • volatility is the expected volatility over the period of the plan, and historical volatility was used as a proxy for expected volatility; • the interest rate is the risk free rate of return as recorded on the last day of the ﬁnancial year, on a swap curve of a term equal to the expected life of the plan; and • a ﬁxed dividend yield was assumed, based on the average historic dividend yield over a similar period. Employee statistic assumptions: • the weighted average forfeiture rate used is based on historical forfeiture data over all schemes cognisant of whether the shares are in or out the money and the vesting date. Forfeitable share plan The forfeitable share plan is valued using the Black Scholes model. The present value of all declared dividends was added to the value as determined using Black Scholes. The scheme is equity settled and will thus not be repriced at each reporting date. Market and dividend data consists of the following: • volatility is the expected volatility over the period of the plan, and historical volatility was used as a proxy for expected volatility; • the interest rate is the risk free rate of return as recorded on the last day of the ﬁnancial year, on a snap curve of a term equal to the expected life of the plan; and • a ﬁxed dividend yield was assumed, based on the average historic dividend yield over a similar period. The valuation includes assumptions about the valuation of the MMI shares received as a dividend as well as cash dividends on the MMI shares. Employee statistic assumptions: • no forfeiture rate is used due to the short duration of the scheme.

The rentals are ﬁxed monthly payments, often including a contingent rental based on a percentage contribution of the monthly operating costs of the premises. Escalation clauses are based on market related rates and vary between 8 and 12%. The leases are usually for a period of one to ﬁve years. The leases are non-cancellable and certain of the leases have an option to renew for a further leasing period at the end of the original lease term. Restrictions are more an exception than the norm and usually relate to the restricted use of the asset for the business purposes speciﬁed in the lease contract. 2012 Within Between More than R million 1 year 1 and 5 years 5 years Ofﬁce premises 940 1 928 17 Equipment and motor vehicles 99 233 – Total operating lease commitments 1 039 2 161 17 2011 Within Between More than R million 1 year 1 and 5 years 5 years Ofﬁce premises 772 1 207 145 Equipment and motor vehicles 93 138 – Total operating lease commitments 865 1 345 145 Future minimum lease payments under operating leases where the Group is the lessor The minimum future lease payments receivable under non-cancellable operating leases on investment properties and other assets where the Group is the lessor: 2012 Within Between More than R million 1 year 1 and 5 years 5 years Ofﬁce premises 76 167 138 Equipment and motor vehicles 523 1 305 951 Total operating lease commitments 599 1 472 1 089 2011 Within Between More than R million 1 year 1 and 5 years 5 years Ofﬁce premises 109 140 167 Equipment and motor vehicles 213 243 – Other 4 3 – Total operating lease commitments 326 386 167 355 33 COLLATERAL PLEDGED AND HELD FirstRand Group AFS 33.1 Collateral pledged The Group has pledged assets as security for the following liabilities: R million 2012 2011 Short trading positions 5 343 9 094 Total deposits 31 469 47 041 – Deposits held under repurchase agreements 28 277 41 146 – Deposits in securities lending transactions 3 192 5 895 Other secured deposits 3 161 8 137 Other liabilities 303 237 Other 2 363 2 269 Total 42 639 66 778 The Group pledges assets under the following terms and conditions: • Mandatory reserve deposits are held with the Central Bank in accordance with statutory requirements.

Different methods are used to determine the current period and cumulative changes in fair value attributable to credit risk for investment securities and advances. This is due to the differing inherent credit risk of these instruments. The methods used are: Advances The change in credit risk is the difference between the fair value of the advances based on the original credit spreads and the fair value of the advances based on the most recent market observable credit spreads. Investment securities and other investments and non-recourse investments The change in fair value for investments designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss is calculated by stripping out the movements that result from a change in market factors that give rise to market risk. The change in fair value due to credit risk is then calculated as the balancing ﬁgure, after deducting the movement due to market risk from the total movement in fair value.

Financial assets are transferred when the Group has either transferred its contractual right to receive cash ﬂows from the ﬁnancial asset, or it has assumed an obligation to pay over all the cash ﬂows from the ﬁnancial asset to another entity in such a way that the transaction meets the deﬁnition of a pass through arrangement in terms of IAS 39. Where the transfer of the ﬁnancial asset qualiﬁes for derecognition, these transfers may give rise to the partial or full derecognition of the ﬁnancial asset concerned. • No derecognition occurs when the Group transfers ﬁnancial assets in such a way that it retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset. The entire transferred ﬁnancial asset will continue to be recognised on the statement of ﬁnancial position of the Group. The majority of transferred ﬁnancial assets of the Group that do not qualify for derecognition are debt securities transferred under repurchase agreements or lent under securities lending agreements. Disclosures relating to these transferred ﬁnancial assets that are not derecognised in their entirety are included under point 36.1 below. 359 36 TRANSFERS AND DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS continued FirstRand Group AFS • Partial derecognition occurs when the Group transfers ﬁnancial assets in such a way that it neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership but still controls the transferred ﬁnancial assets. These ﬁnancial assets are recognised on the statement of ﬁnancial position to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement. This excludes the full derecognition of part of a larger ﬁnancial asset as is detailed below. Disclosures relating to these transferred ﬁnancial assets that are partially derecognised are included under point 36.1 below. • Full derecognition occurs when the Group has transferred a ﬁnancial asset and it either transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or it neither retains nor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership but loses control of the ﬁnancial asset. Where the ﬁnancial asset qualiﬁes for full derecognition, the Group derecognises the entire transferred ﬁnancial asset. The transfer may however result in the Group obtaining a new asset or assuming a new liability that continues to expose the Group to the derecognised ﬁnancial asset (for example a servicing asset or liability). Full derecognition includes the derecognition of a speciﬁc and identiﬁable portion of a ﬁnancial asset where all the risks and rewards of ownership of that part are transferred, for example, 90% of all the cash ﬂows or interest payments of a ﬁnancial asset. This is not partial derecognition as is detailed above. The majority of transferred ﬁnancial assets of the Group that qualify for full derecognition are outright sales, loan syndications and securitisation transactions. Disclosures relating to the continuing involvement in derecognised ﬁnancial assets to which the Group is still exposed are included under point 36.2 below. 36.1 Transferred ﬁnancial assets that are not derecognised in their entirety Repurchase agreements The Group enters into repurchase agreements in terms of which the Group sells investment securities to an external counterparty in exchange for cash and agrees to repurchase the investment securities at a speciﬁed price at a speciﬁed future date. The Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred investment securities in these transactions. The transferred investment securities continue to be recognised in full by the Group (investment securities and other investments) and a ﬁnancial liability (deposits) is recognised for the cash received. The counterparty’s only recourse is to the transferred investment securities that are subject to the repurchase agreement. The Group remains exposed to all the underlying risks on the repurchase agreements. The risks include counterparty, interest rate, currency, prepayment and other price risks. No derecognition of the transferred assets Investment securities and other investments of the Group with a carrying amount of R13 463 million have been transferred in terms of repurchase transactions. Associated liabilities with a carrying amount of R13 383 million have been recognised for cash received from counterparties and have been included in deposits. Both the transferred investments and related deposits are designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss. Securities lending transactions The Group enters into securities lending transactions in terms of which the Group lends investment securities that it owns to external counterparties in exchange for cash collateral. The cash collateral is provided by the counterparty as security for the return of the securities. The investment securities that are lent, continue to be recognised in full as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of these investment securities and the derecognition criteria are not met. A ﬁnancial liability is recognised for the cash collateral received from the counterparty. The Group’s only recourse in respect to the return of the securities it has lent is to the cash collateral held and as such, the Group generally requires cash collateral in excess of the fair value of the securities lent. The Group remains exposed to all the underlying risks of the transferred investment securities. The risks include counterparty, investment, equities price, currency and other price risks. During the current year, the Group did not enter into any securities lending transactions in terms of which it lent securities recognised on its statement of ﬁnancial position. 36.2 Transferred ﬁnancial assets that are derecognised in their entirety During the current year, the Group did not enter into any transactions in terms of which transferred ﬁnancial assets were derecognised in their entirety. F I R S T R A N D L I M I T E D A N N U A L I N T E G R AT E D R E P O R T 2 0 1 2 B 360 Notes to the consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements continued for the year ended 30 June 37 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair value of a ﬁnancial instrument is deﬁned as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a market transaction between knowledgeable willing parties. When determining fair value it is presumed that the entity is a going concern and the fair value is therefore not an amount that represents a forced transaction, involuntary liquidation or a distressed sale. When determining the fair value of a ﬁnancial instrument, preference is given to prices quoted in an active market. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufﬁcient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. If a particular instrument is not traded in an active market the Group uses a valuation technique to determine the fair value of the ﬁnancial instrument. The valuation techniques employed by the Group include, inter alia, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for the same asset or liability in an inactive market, adjusted prices from recent arm’s length transactions, option-pricing models, and discounted cash ﬂow techniques. The objective of using a valuation technique is to determine what the transaction price would have been at the measurement date. Therefore maximum use is made of inputs that are observable in the market and entity speciﬁc inputs are only used when there is no market information available. All valuation techniques take into account the relevant factors that other market participants would have considered in setting a price for the ﬁnancial instrument and are consistent with accepted methodologies for pricing ﬁnancial instruments. The Group classiﬁes instruments measured at fair value using a fair value hierarchy that reﬂects the signiﬁcance of the inputs used. The Group’s fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1 – Fair value is determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 – Fair value is determined using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and Level 3 – Fair value is determined using a valuation technique and inputs that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). The following principal methods and assumptions are used to determine the fair value of ﬁnancial instruments: Investment securities and other investments Unlisted equities The fair value of unlisted equities is determined using a price earnings (P/E) model. The earnings included in the model are derived from a combination of historical and budgeted earnings depending on the speciﬁc circumstances of the entity whose equity is being valued and the relevance and reliability of the available information. The P/E multiple is derived from current market observations taking into account an appropriate discount for unlisted companies. The valuation of these instruments may be corroborated by a discounted cash ﬂow valuation or by the observation of other market transactions that have taken place. Negotiable certiﬁcates of deposit Where market prices are not available for a speciﬁc instrument, fair value is determined using discounted cash ﬂow techniques. Inputs to these models include information that is consistent with similar market quoted instruments, where available. Treasury bills Treasury bills are valued by means of the Bond Exchange of South Africa (BESA) bond pricing model using the closing BESA mark to market bond yield. Government, public and utility stocks Where market prices are not available the fair value is estimated using quoted market prices of securities with similar credit, maturity and yield characteristics. Other dated securities Fair value of other dated securities is determined by using a discounted cash ﬂow model. The discount curve is derived from similar market quoted instruments. 361 37 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued FirstRand Group AFS Derivatives Market prices are obtained from trading exchanges, when the derivatives are traded. If the derivatives are not traded the following techniques are used: • Contracts for difference are valued by using the differential between the market price and the traded price multiplied by the notional amount. • Credit derivatives are valued using the discounted cash ﬂow model. Where prices are obtained from the market, individual credit spreads are added. • Option contracts are generally valued using the Black-Scholes model. Inputs are obtained from market observable data. Where prices are obtainable from trading exchanges the value per the exchange is used. • Forward contracts are valued by discounting the projected cash ﬂows to obtain the present value of the forward contract. Projected cash ﬂows are obtained by subtracting the strike price of the forward contract from the market projected forward value. • Forward rate agreements are valued by means of the discounted cash ﬂow model. The discount rate is determined using a yield curve for similar market traded instruments. The reset rate is determined in terms of the legal agreement. • Swaps are valued by discounting the expected cash ﬂows using discount and forward rates determined from similar market traded instruments. The reset rate of each swaplet is determined in terms of legal documents pertaining to the swap. • Commodity linked instruments are measured by taking into account the price, the location differential, grade differential, silo differential and the discount factor of the most liquidly traded futures linked to the commodity. Deposits Fair value of deposits is determined by discounting future cash ﬂows using a swap curve adjusted for liquidity premiums and business unit margins. The valuation methodology does not take early withdrawals and other behavioural aspects into account. The Group also determines the fair value of the amortised cost book for disclosure purposes. Call deposits are valued at the undiscounted amount of the cash balance. This is considered appropriate because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of deposits will only be determined for deposits that have a maturity proﬁle of longer than 30 days. For all non-term products it is assumed that fair value equals amortised cost. Short trading positions The fair value of listed short trading positions is their market quoted price. The fair value of unlisted short trading positions are based on the directors’ valuation using suitable valuation methods. Loans and advances to customers The Group has elected to designate the term loan book in the investment banking division at fair value through proﬁt or loss in terms of IAS 39. The fair value is determined using a valuation technique that uses both inputs that are based on observable market data and unobservable data. The Group also determines the fair value of the amortised cost book for disclosure purposes. The interest rate component of the valuation uses observable inputs from market interest rate curves. To calculate the fair value of credit the Group uses a valuation methodology based on the credit spread matrix, which considers loss given default, tenor and the internal credit committee rating criteria. Other liabilities and Tier 2 liabilities Fair value of debentures, unsecured debt securities and ﬁnance lease liabilities are determined by discounting the future cash ﬂows at market related interest rates. The fair value of subordinated notes and ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate bonds are determined by discounting the future cash ﬂows at market related interest rates.

The transfer into Level 1 was as a result of certain entities in which the Group holds an investment becoming listed for the ﬁrst time during the current year. The transfer out of Level 1 was as a result of the market in which certain instruments are listed, becoming inactive during the current year. 363 37 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued FirstRand Group AFS 2011 Total carrying R million Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 amount Assets Derivative ﬁnancial instruments – 37 014 192 37 206 Advances – 35 415 86 844 122 259 Investment securities and other investments 58 477 44 297 4 284 107 058 Non-recourse investments – 17 414 – 17 414 Total ﬁnancial assets recognised at fair value 58 477 134 140 91 320 283 937 Liabilities Short trading positions 9 094 – – 9 094 Derivative ﬁnancial instruments – 36 230 131 36 361 Deposits 1 408 138 052 3 399 142 859 Non-recourse deposits – 17 414 – 17 414 Other liabilities – 252 – 252 Tier 2 liabilities – 1 390 – 1 390 Total ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value 10 502 193 338 3 530 207 370 There were no transfers of ﬁnancial instruments between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year ended June 2011. Although the fair value of credit is not signiﬁcant year-on-year it may become signiﬁcant in the future. For this reason, together with the fact that South Africa does not have actively traded credit spreads, the Group has classiﬁed loans and advances to customers in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

In addition the valuation model for Level 3 ﬁnancial instruments typically also relies on a number of inputs that are readily observable either directly or indirectly. Thus, the gains and losses presented below include changes in the fair value related to both observable and unobservable inputs. The following table shows a reconciliation of the opening and closing balances for ﬁnancial instruments classiﬁed as Level 3 in terms of the fair value hierarchy. 2012 Gains/(losses) recognised Gains/(losses) in other Fair value on recognised in comprehensive R million 30 June 2011 proﬁt or loss income Assets Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 192 27 – Advances 86 844 6 622 – Investment securities and other investments 4 284 341 13 Total ﬁnancial assets at fair value 91 320 6 990 13 Liabilities Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 131 6 – Deposits 3 399 (315) – Total ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value 3 530 (309) – 2011 Gains/(losses) recognised Gains/(losses) in other Fair value on recognised in comprehensive R million 30 June 2010 proﬁt or loss income Assets Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 31 144 – Advances 78 210 6 410 – Investment securities and other investments 3 666 58 (20) Total ﬁnancial assets at fair value 81 907 6 612 (20) Liabilities Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 189 23 – Deposits 3 300 10 – Total ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value 3 489 33 – There were no transfers of ﬁnancial instruments out of or into Level 3 during the current year or prior year. 365 FirstRand Group AFS 2012 Purchases/ Acquisitions/ (sales)/issues/ (disposals) of Transfers Transfer out Exchange rate Fair value on (settlements) subsidiaries into Level 3 of Level 3 differences 30 June 2012 (28) – – – 7 198 7 080 92 – – 153 100 791 770 (42) – – 38 5 404 7 822 50 – – 198 106 393 10 – – – – 147 159 – – – 24 3 267 169 – – – 24 3 414 2011 Purchases/ Acquisitions/ (sales)/issues/ (disposals) of Transfers Transfer out Exchange rate Fair value on (settlements) subsidiaries into Level 3 of Level 3 differences 30 June 2011 17 – – – – 192 2 205 19 – – – 86 844 753 (173) – – – 4 284 2 975 (154) – – – 91 320 (81) – – – – 131 89 – – – – 3 399 8 – – – – 3 530 F I R S T R A N D L I M I T E D A N N U A L I N T E G R AT E D R E P O R T 2 0 1 2 B 366 Notes to the consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements continued for the year ended 30 June 37 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued The table below presents the total gains/(losses) relating to ﬁnancial instruments classiﬁed in Level 3 that are still held on 30 June.

The inputs into these valuation techniques are derived from all available information and management’s judgement. While management believes that these fair values are appropriate they could be sensitive to changes in the assumptions used to derive the inputs. The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the signiﬁcant inputs when they are changed to reasonably possible alternative inputs: 2012 Reasonably possible alternative fair value Reasonably possible Using more Using more Signiﬁcant changes to signiﬁcant positive negative R million unobservable inputs unobservable inputs Fair value assumptions assumptions Assets Advances Credit Credit migration matrix* 100 791 101 700 100 350 Derivative ﬁnancial Volatilities Volatilities are instruments increased and decreased by 10%. 198 268 179 Investment securities Growth rates and Unobservable inputs and other P/E ratios of unlisted are increased and investments investments decreased by 10%. 5 404 5 794 4 761 Total ﬁnancial assets recognised at fair value 106 393 107 762 105 290 Liabilities Deposits Credit risk of the Credit migration cash collateral leg of matrix** credit linked notes 3 267 2 940 3 594 Derivative ﬁnancial Volatilities Volatilities are instruments increased and decreased by 10%. 147 142 150 Total ﬁnancial liabilities recognised at fair value 3 414 3 082 3 744 * The credit migration matrix is used as part of the Group’s credit risk management process for the advances measured at fair value through proﬁt or loss.

Day 1 proﬁt or loss Day 1 proﬁt or loss arises on the initial recognition of a ﬁnancial instrument when the fair value of an instrument is determined using a valuation technique that makes use of inputs that are not observable in an active market. In terms of IAS 39 if the fair value determined in accordance with such a valuation technique differs from the transaction price the initial recognition should take place at the transaction price as the transaction price is considered the best evidence of fair value at initial recognition. The day 1 proﬁts or losses arising as a result of the difference between the two values should only be recognised over the life of the instrument as a result of changes that would also be considered by market participants. The following table represents the aggregate difference between transaction price and fair value based on a valuation technique yet to be recognised in proﬁt or loss: R million 2012 2011 Balance at 1 July – – Day 1 proﬁts or losses not recognised on ﬁnancial instruments initially recognised in the current reporting period 41 – Amount recognised in proﬁt or loss as a result of changes which would be observable by market participants (4) – Balance at 30 June 37 – F I R S T R A N D L I M I T E D A N N U A L I N T E G R AT E D R E P O R T 2 0 1 2 B 370 Notes to the consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements continued for the year ended 30 June 38 TRUST ACTIVITIES R million 2012 2011 Fair value of assets held or placed on behalf of customers in a ﬁduciary capacity 108 695 90 612 Income received from trust and ﬁduciary services 1 566 1 477 The Group provides custody, trustee, corporate administration, investment management and advisory services to third parties, which involves the Group making allocation and purchase and sale decisions in relation to a wide range of ﬁnancial instruments.

FNB FNB offers a diverse set of ﬁnancial products and services to the retail and corporate market segments, ranging from consumer, small business and rural markets to large and medium-sized corporates, ﬁnancial institutions, parastatals and government entities. FNB’s products include mortgage loans, credit and debit cards, personal loans and investment products. FNB’s services include transactional, banking deposit taking, card acquiring, credit facilities and FNB distribution channels (namely the branch network, ATMs, call centres, cell phone and internet channels). FNB Africa A comprehensive range of FNB products and services are offered to retail, corporate and public sector clients through the FNB Africa subsidiaries. FNB Africa comprises the FNB Africa subsidiaries (FNB Namibia, FNB Botswana, FNB Swaziland, FNB Lesotho, FNB Mozambique, FNB Tanzania and FNB Zambia) and a central support division. RMB RMB is the investment banking arm of the Bank. RMB’s portfolio spans Investment Banking, Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC), Equities, Private Equity.

Corporate Centre The Corporate Centre includes various centralised risk and ﬁnance functions, including Group Treasury, Capital Management and Performance Measurement, Group Finance, Information and Technology, Enterprise Risk Management, Regulatory Risk Management and Group Internal Audit. Major customers In terms of IFRS 8 a customer is regarded as a major customer if the revenue from transactions with this customer exceeds 10% or more of the entity’s revenue. The FirstRand Group has no major customer as deﬁned and is therefore not reliant on the revenue from one or more major customers. Basis of preparation of segment information The segmental analysis is based on the information reported to management for the respective segments. The information is prepared in terms of IFRS with the exception of certain adjustments that are made to the segment results in order to eliminate the effect of nontaxable income and other segment speciﬁc items that impact certain key ratios reviewed by the chief operating decision maker when assessing the operating segments’ performance. In order to ensure that the total segment results, assets and liabilities agree to the amounts reported in terms of IFRS, the above mentioned amounts are adjusted in the IFRS adjustments column. 371 39 SEGMENT INFORMATION continued FirstRand Group AFS 39.2 Geographical segments Refer to the reportable segment information for a description of the divisions.

This restructure was approved by the shareholders and the SARB during November 2009 and the effective date of the transaction was 1 July 2010. The restructure process was initiated as a result of the Group’s need to revise the structure of its existing operations and also impacts the Group’s governance structures and the management accounting and statutory ﬁnancial reporting processes. As part of the Group restructure transaction, the FirstRand Bank Group and the FirstRand EMA Holdings Group (previously the FirstRand Bank Holdings Group) disposed of a number of subsidiaries, SPEs and associates to various other Group entities such as FirstRand EMA Holdings Group and Rand Merchant Bank Insurance Advisories. These transactions were accounted for as common control transactions, as these entities were ultimately controlled by the same party, FirstRand, before and after the transaction. These subsidiaries, SPEs and associates were disposed of at their net consolidated carrying value. The consideration received was equal to the net consolidated carrying value. The FirstRand EMA Holdings Group unbundled its investment in FirstRand Bank to FirstRand through a dividend in specie on 1 July 2010. As a result of this transaction, FirstRand is the direct holding company of FirstRand Bank. The unbundling transaction was accounted for at the consolidated carrying value in line with the Group’s policy for common control transactions. Subsequent to the Group restructure the name of the holding company of the FirstRand Bank Holdings Group was changed to FirstRand EMA Holdings. All entities previously included in the consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements of the Group will continue to be included under the revised structure. The restructure had no impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial position or ﬁnancial results for the year ended 30 June 2011. 42 RELATED PARTIES The Group deﬁnes related parties as: (i) Subsidiaries; (ii) Associate companies; (iii) Joint ventures; (iv) Entities that have signiﬁcant inﬂuence over the Group.

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 43.1 Credit impairment losses on loans and advances The Group assesses its credit portfolios for impairment at each reporting date. In determining whether an impairment loss should be recognised in the income statement, the Group makes judgements as to whether there is observable data indicating a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash ﬂows from a portfolio of loans. (a) Performing loans The impairment provision on the performing portfolio is split into two parts: (i) The ﬁrst part consists of the portion of the performing portfolio where an incurred impairment event is inherent in a portfolio of performing advances but has not speciﬁcally been identiﬁed. An incurred but not reported (IBNR) provision is calculated on this subsegment of the portfolio, based on historical analysis of loss ratios, roll rates from performing status into non-performing status and similar risk indicators over an estimated loss emergence period. Estimates of roll rates, loss ratios and similar risk indicators are based on analysis of internal and, where appropriate, external data. Estimates of the loss emergence period are made in the context of the nature and frequency of credit assessments performed, availability and frequency of updated data regarding customer creditworthiness and similar factors. Loss emergence periods differ from portfolio to portfolio, but typically range from 1 to 12 months. (ii) The second part consists of the portfolio speciﬁc impairment (PSI) to reﬂect the decrease in estimated future cash ﬂows for the subsegment of the performing portfolio where there is objective evidence of impairment. The decrease in future cash ﬂows is primarily estimated based on analysis of historical loss and recovery rates for comparable subsegments of the portfolio. The assessment of whether objective evidence of impairment exists requires judgement and depends on the class of the ﬁnancial asset. In the FNB Retail and WesBank portfolios the account status, namely arrears versus non-arrears status, is taken as a primary indicator of an impairment event. In the FNB Commercial portfolios other indicators such as the existence of high risk accounts, based on internally assigned risk ratings and management judgement, are used, while the wholesale (includes RMB and GTS) portfolio assessment includes a judgemental review of individual industries for objective signs of distress. (b) Non-performing loans FNB Retail loans are individually impaired if amounts are due and unpaid for three or more months, or if there is evidence before this that the customer is unlikely to repay its obligations in full. WesBank’s loans are impaired upon its classiﬁcation status, i.e. following an event driven approach and speciﬁc assessment of the likelihood to repay. FNB Commercial and Wholesale loans are analysed on a case by case basis taking into account breaches of key loan conditions, excesses and similar risk indicators. Management’s estimates of future cash ﬂows on individually impaired loans are based on internal historical loss experience, supplemented by analysis of comparable external data (for FNB Commercial and Wholesale loans) for assets with similar credit risk characteristics. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash ﬂows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. Refer to note 13 for a detailed analysis of the impairment of advances and the carrying amounts of the speciﬁc and portfolio provisions. 43.2 Fair value of ﬁnancial instruments The fair values of ﬁnancial instruments that are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. Where valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to determine fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by independent qualiﬁed senior personnel. All models are certiﬁed before they are used, and models are calibrated and back tested to ensure that outputs reﬂect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, models use only observable data, however, areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions could affect the reported fair value of ﬁnancial instruments. Note 37 provides additional details on the calculation of fair value of ﬁnancial instruments not quoted in active markets and an analysis of the effect of changes in managements’ estimates on the fair value of ﬁnancial instruments. 397 43 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued FirstRand Group AFS 43.3 Impairment of available-for-sale equity instruments The Group determines that available-for-sale equity instruments are impaired and the impairment recognised in proﬁt or loss, when there has been a signiﬁcant or prolonged decline in the fair value below cost. The determination of what is signiﬁcant or prolonged requires judgement. In making this judgement, the Group evaluates factors such as, inter alia, the normal volatility in share prices, evidence of a deterioration in the ﬁnancial health of the investee, industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and ﬁnancing cash ﬂows. 43.4 Securitisations and special purpose entities The Group sponsors the formation of special purpose entities (SPEs) primarily for the purpose of allowing clients to hold investments, for asset securitisation transactions and for buying and selling credit protection. The Group consolidates SPEs that it controls in terms of IFRS. As it can sometimes be difﬁcult to determine whether the Group controls an SPE, it makes judgements about its exposure to the risks and rewards, as well as about its ability to make operational decisions for the SPE. In many instances, elements are present that, considered in isolation, indicate control or lack of control over an SPE, but when considered together make it difﬁcult to reach a clear decision. In such cases, the SPE is accounted for based on management’s best estimate of the economic reality of the underlying transaction. Refer to note 37 for more information regarding the Group’s synthetic securitisations and the respective carrying amounts. 43.5 Income taxes The Group is subject to direct tax in a number of jurisdictions. There may be transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination has an element of uncertainty during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities based on objective estimates of the amount of tax that may be due. Where the ﬁnal tax determination is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, the difference will impact the income tax and deferred income tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Refer to note 4 and 19 for more information regarding the direct and deferred income tax charges, assets and liabilities. 43.6 Impairment of goodwill The recoverable amount of goodwill is tested annually for impairment in accordance with the stated accounting policy. The recoverable amount of the cash generating units (CGU) has been determined based on value in use calculations or fair value less cost to sell. The value in use is calculated as the net present value of the discounted cash ﬂows of the CGU. Details of the main assumptions applied in determining the net present value of the CGU are provided in note 17. 43.7 Employee beneﬁt liabilities The cost of the beneﬁts and the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension funds and post-employment medical obligations depend on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the charge to proﬁt or loss arising from these obligations include the expected long-term rate of return on the relevant plan assets, the discount rate and the expected salary and pension increase rates. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the charge to proﬁt or loss and may affect planned funding of the pension plans. The assumptions related to the expected return on plan assets are determined on a uniform basis, considering long-term historical returns, asset allocation and future estimations of long-term investment returns. The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year, which represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of the expected cash outﬂows required to settle the pension and post-employment medical obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rate on high quality corporate bonds and government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the beneﬁts will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The expected salary and pension increase rates are based on inﬂation rates, adjusted for salary scales and country speciﬁc conditions. The inﬂation rate used is a rate within the government’s monetary policy target for inﬂation and is calculated as the difference between the yields on portfolios of ﬁxed interest government bonds and a portfolio of index-linked bonds of a similar term. Additional information is provided in the note 25.

The amounts recognised in respect of these share-based payment transactions are determined by applying valuation techniques that use various assumptions and estimates that require judgement in their application. These assumptions and estimates include expected volatility, expected dividend yield, the discount rate and the expected forfeiture or lapse rate. The expected volatility assumption is determined based on a ruling historical volatility over the expected life of the options and comparable ﬁnancial information. The expected dividend yield is determined based on historical dividend yields and management’s estimates. The discount rate is based on zero coupon government bonds and have terms to maturity consistent with the assumed life of the share option. The expected forfeiture rate has been based on historical experience and management estimates. Refer to note 30 for the detailed information regarding the share-based payment expense and the assumptions used in determining the expense, liability and reserve. 43.9 Fair value of commodities recognised in accordance with the broker trader exception in IAS 2 The Group is long on certain commodities through the outright purchase of the speciﬁc commodity. Judgement has been applied in determining the fair value of the most recent transactions between market participants that is used to calculate the fair value of the physical commodity positions. 399 44 STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE FirstRand Group AFS The Group will comply with the following new standards and interpretations from the stated effective date. Effective date IAS 1 (amended) Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income This amendment was issued to eliminate inconsistencies in the presentation of Annual periods items in the statement of other comprehensive income. The amendment commencing on or requires an entity to group the items of other comprehensive income on the after 1 July 2012. basis of whether the amounts will subsequently be reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss or not i.e. the statement of comprehensive income should be split between items that will be reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss and items that will not be reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss. This amendment addresses presentation in the annual ﬁnancial statements and will not affect recognition and measurement. The impact of the revised presentation is not expected to be signiﬁcant. IAS 12 (amended) Income Taxes IAS 12 requires that deferred tax assets be measured based on whether the Annual periods entity expects to recover the carrying amount of the asset through use or commencing on or through sale. This assessment of the method of recovery may be difﬁcult to after 1 January 2012 assess for investment property measured using the fair value model. The amendment provides a practical solution by introducing a presumption that the carrying amount of such investment property will normally be recovered through sale. As a result of the amendment, SIC 21 Income Taxes – Recovery of Revalued Non-Depreciable Assets has been withdrawn. This amendment is not expected to have a signiﬁcant impact on the Group. IAS 19 (revised) Employee Beneﬁts The main changes include the removal of the corridor approach, which allowed Annual periods entities the option to defer the recognition of actuarial gains and losses on commencing on or deﬁned beneﬁt plans. The revised standard requires that all remeasurements after 1 January 2013 arising from deﬁned beneﬁt plans be presented in other comprehensive income. It also includes enhanced disclosure requirements for deﬁned beneﬁts plans. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact the revised IAS 19 would have on the ﬁnancial statements. IAS 27 (amended) Separate Financial Statements The accounting and disclosure requirements for consolidated financial Annual periods statements have been removed from IAS 27 as a result of the issue of IFRS 10 commencing on or and IFRS 12, which establish new consolidation and disclosure standards. after 1 January 2013 IAS 27 (as amended in 2011) contains accounting and disclosure requirements for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates when an entity prepares separate ﬁnancial statements. This amendment is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s results. IAS 28 (amended) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (amended) supersedes IAS Annual periods 28 Investments in Associates as a result of the issue of IFRS 11 and IFRS 12. The commencing on or new IAS 28 prescribes the accounting for investments in associates and sets out after 1 January 2013 the requirements for the application of the equity method when accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures. The disclosure requirements relating to these investments are now contained in IFRS 12. This amendment is not expected to have a signiﬁcant impact on the Group’s results. F I R S T R A N D L I M I T E D A N N U A L I N T E G R AT E D R E P O R T 2 0 1 2 B 400 Notes to the consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements continued for the year ended 30 June 44 STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE continued Effective date IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation The amendments issued to IAS 32 clariﬁes the existing requirements related to Annual periods offsetting of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities. The application guidance to commencing on or the standard has been amended to clarify the practical application of the after 1 January 2014 offsetting requirements. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of these amendments. IFRS 1 (amended) First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards On 13 March 2012 the IASB published an amendment to IFRS 1 First-time Annual periods Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. The amendments, commencing on or dealing with loans received from governments at a below market rate of after 1 January 2013 interest, give first-time adopters of IFRSs relief from full retrospective application of IFRSs when accounting for these loans on transition. It provides the same relief to ﬁrst-time adopters as is granted to existing preparers of IFRS ﬁnancial statements when applying IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. The Group is not a ﬁrst-time adopter and this amended standard will therefore have no impact. IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures The amendment requires information about all recognised ﬁnancial instruments Annual periods that are set-off in accordance with paragraph 42 of IAS 32. Information includes commencing on or the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts set-off in accordance after 1 January 2013 with the accounting standards followed, and the related net credit exposure. This information will help investors understand the extent to which an entity has set-off in its statement of ﬁnancial position and the effects of set-off on the entity’s rights and obligations. This amendment addresses disclosure in the annual ﬁnancial statements and will not affect recognition and measurement. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 is the ﬁrst phase in the IASB’s three-part project to replace IAS 39 Annual periods Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. This phase deals with beginning on or the classiﬁcation and measurement of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities. after 1 January 2015 Financial assets can be classiﬁed as ﬁnancial assets at amortised cost or fair value. The classiﬁcation is based on the entity’s business model for managing the ﬁnancial assets and the contractual cash ﬂow characteristics of the ﬁnancial asset. Financial liabilities can also be classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities at amortised cost or fair value in line with the existing requirements of IAS 39. If an entity elects to measure its ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value, it should present the portion of the change in fair value due to changes in its own credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact that IFRS 9 would have on the ﬁnancial statements. Until the process is completed, the Group is unable to determine the signiﬁcance of the impact of IFRS 9. 401 44 STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE continued FirstRand Group AFS Effective date IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 10 establishes a new control model for determining which entities Annual periods should be consolidated. The standard also provides guidance on how to apply commencing on or the principle of control to speciﬁc situations in order to identify whether an after 1 January 2013 investor controls an investee. IFRS 10 supersedes a portion of IAS 27 Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements and SIC 12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. Transitional guidance issued in June 2012 amends IFRS 10 to provide additional transition relief by limiting the requirement to provide adjusted comparative information to only the preceding comparative period. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact that IFRS 10 would have on the ﬁnancial statements. Until the process is completed, the Group is unable to determine the signiﬁcance of the impact of IFRS 10. IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements The standard supersedes IAS 31 Joint Ventures and aims to improve on IAS 31 Annual periods by establishing accounting principles that are applicable to all joint commencing on or arrangements. The standard distinguishes between two types of joint after 1 January 2013 arrangements, joint operations and joint ventures. The accounting for joint operations remains unchanged from IAS 31 and all joint ventures should be equity accounted in the ﬁnancial statements of the venturer. Transitional guidance issued in June 2012 amends IFRS 11 to provide additional transition relief by limiting the requirement to provide adjusted comparative information to only the preceding comparative period. Amendments to IFRS 11 also eliminate the requirement to provide comparative information for periods prior to the immediately preceding period. The standard is not expected to have a signiﬁcant impact on the Group. IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities The standard aims to provide consistent disclosure requirements for Annual periods subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities. IFRS 12 commencing on or requires disclosure of information that will enable users to evaluate the nature after 1 January 2013 of the risks associated with the interest and the effect of the interest on the ﬁnancial position, performance and cash ﬂows of the reporting entity. Transitional guidance issued in June 2012 amends IFRS 12 to provide additional transition relief by limiting the requirement to provide adjusted comparative information to only the preceding comparative period. Amendments to IFRS 12 also eliminate the requirement to provide comparative information for periods prior to the immediately preceding period. This amendment addresses disclosure in the annual ﬁnancial statements and will not affect recognition and measurement. The Group is still in the process of assessing the impact of the revised disclosure.

It after 1 January 2013 provides a fair value hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact that IFRS 13 would have on the ﬁnancial statements. Until the process is completed, the Group is unable to determine the signiﬁcance of the impact of IFRS 13. IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine This Interpretation applies to waste removal costs that are incurred in surface Annual periods mining activity during the production phase of the mine (production stripping commencing on or costs). after 1 January 2013 The Interpretation falls outside the scope of the Group’s operations and will have no impact on the Group. Annual Improvements Improvements to IFRS The IASB issued Annual Improvements 2009-2011 Cycle in May 2012, as its Annual periods latest set of annual improvements to various Standards. The collection of commencing on or amendments to IFRS is in response to six issues addressed during the 2009after 1 January 2013 2011 cycle. The annual improvement project’s aim is to clarify and improve accounting standards. The improvements include terminology or editorial changes with minimal effect on recognition and measurement. The amendments have been assessed and are not expected to have a signiﬁcant impact on the Group. 45 TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE LEGAL FORM OF A LEASE The Group entered into an arrangement with the counterparty for the refurbishment of moveable assets, which are for the exclusive use of the counterparty. The duration of the arrangement is for 14 years and will conclude in May 2016. The transactions are a series of back to back leases, which, although the transactions are structured as leases, are in substance a ﬁnancing arrangement. The arrangement also provides for a ﬁnal balloon payment, which will be serviced through sinking fund deposits ceded to the Group, into which the counterparty is making payments and earning interest. Fees received are recognised annually in non-interest income. During the current year the interest paid on the sinking fund deposits exceeded the interest earned on the leases, resulting in a net interest expense reﬂected in the income statement of R20 million (2011: net interest income of R33 million). 403 46 CURRENT/NON-CURRENT ANALYSIS OF AMOUNTS RECOGNISED ON THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION FirstRand Group AFS 2012 Carrying R million amount Current Non–current ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents 38 363 38 363 – Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 52 913 49 610 3 303 Commodities 5 108 5 108 – Accounts receivable 6 007 4 939 1 068 Tax asset 331 26 305 Advances 524 507 171 361 353 146 Investment securities and other investments 119 708 91 090 28 618 Investments in associates and joint ventures 6 869 – 6 869 Property and equipment 12 026 – 12 026 Intangible assets 1 743 – 1 743 Reinsurance assets 898 1 897 Post-employment beneﬁt asset 7 7 – Investment properties 215 – 215 Deferred income tax asset 471 3 468 Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale 599 599 – Total assets 769 765 361 107 408 658 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES Short trading positions 5 343 5 343 – Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 53 760 52 383 1 377 Creditors and accruals 9 086 8 822 264 Tax liability 386 166 220 Deposits 606 281 504 378 101 903 Provisions 592 203 389 Employee liabilities 6 933 3 038 3 895 Other liabilities 6 383 786 5 597 Policyholder liabilities under insurance contracts 1 517 394 1 123 Deferred income tax liability 1 679 6 1 673 Tier 2 liabilities 7 885 1 287 6 598 Liabilities directly associated with disposal groups classiﬁed as held for sale 113 113 – Shareholders equity 67 040 – 67 040 Non-controlling interests 2 767 – 2 767 Total equity and liabilities 769 765 576 919 192 846 F I R S T R A N D L I M I T E D A N N U A L I N T E G R AT E D R E P O R T 2 0 1 2 B 404 Notes to the consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements continued for the year ended 30 June 46 CURRENT/NON-CURRENT ANALYSIS OF AMOUNTS RECOGNISED ON THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION continued 2011 Carrying R million amount Current Non-current ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents 34 240 34 240 – Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 37 206 35 422 1 784 Commodities 4 388 4 388 – Accounts receivable 7 289 6 836 453 Tax asset 139 15 124 Advances 464 593 137 736 326 857 Investment securities and other investments 124 756 92 464 32 292 Investments in associates and joint ventures 6 029 – 6 029 Property and equipment 10 542 – 10 542 Intangible assets 1 691 – 1 691 Reinsurance assets 484 – 484 Post-employment beneﬁt asset 2 – 2 Investment properties 203 – 203 Deferred income tax asset 560 3 557 Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale 5 805 5 805 – Total assets 697 927 316 909 381 018 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES Short trading positions 9 094 9 094 – Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 36 361 35 960 401 Creditors and accruals 9 497 9 283 214 Tax liability 288 69 219 Deposits 552 879 485 208 67 671 Provisions 517 17 500 Employee liabilities 5 937 2 497 3 440 Other liabilities 4 107 1 595 2 512 Policyholder liabilities under insurance contracts 1 047 459 588 Deferred income tax liability 2 223 13 2 210 Tier 2 liabilities 6 666 300 6 366 Liabilities directly associated with disposal groups classiﬁed as held for sale 5 092 5 092 – Shareholders equity 61 150 – 61 150 Non-controlling interests 3 069 – 3 069 Total equities and liabilities 697 927 549 587 148 340 47 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The directors are not aware of any material events that have occurred between the date of the statement of ﬁnancial position and the date of the report. 48 RISK DISCLOSURE The risk disclosure has been disclosed as part of the Risk and capital management report.
