The purchasing habits of investors have changed dramatically, mostly due to procedures and the time it takes to decide on a purchase as well as due to price sensitivity. Here at Trimo, we adapted by developing technical solutions for buildings that were the most optimal for investors. Cooperation with strategic customers was kept at a very high level, which is confirmed by the fact that Trimo is a reliable and trustworthy partner even in tumultuous market conditions. The customers sought, more than ever before, individualised solutions that rationalise the price of investments. Thanks to our competent engineering support, we were able to secure many deals and gain satisfied customers that as a result want to work with us even in the future.

Our completely redesigned sales activities in South America have produced good growth over the past few years. Our innovative products excited investors. We signed the first contracts in 2013. In the Middle East region, we had plans to conclude contracts faster, but the decisionmaking process in that part of the world is far longer than we initially expected. Despite that, however, we expect to see positive results on that market in the next period. We achieved good 2012 results in Russia, and there are positive forecasts being made for Russia and its entire surrounding region, which is why we intend to further expand our sales activities there. ,Q7ULPR*URXSSRVWHGÂ¼Pin consolidated net sales revenue, which is nine percent OHVVWKDQWKH\HDUEHIRUH7ULPR*URXSÂ¶V(%,7'$ZDVÂ¼,8m.

Regular payments from our customers and secured payments have become vital criteria for assessing sales. There were many deals that we were prepared to let go of had we not received guarantees for payment. We tried to insure all payments from our customers, in most cases through SID, Prva kreditna zavarovalnica or using bank guarantees.

During project implementation, the problems of our clients with ongoing financing of projects were causing halts that then led to additional costs and payment delays. We adapted to this with the greatest possible flexibility. Current business in 2012 and the structure of funding sources required us to restructure loan maturity. In 2013, we expect to see the successful realisation of the financial restructuring of the Trimo Group that was launched in 2012. As part of that process, we plan to negotiate with banks on new conditions for loan repayment, which will allow Trimo Group to normally finance its ongoing liabilities. We evaluate that our cooperation with suppliers in 2012 was exemplary, as we had to find the best solutions to tackle the difficult market conditions together. With most suppliers, we successfully agreed on certain limits within which we did business and continuously pursued special solutions in relation to bigger projects that were in the interest of both sides. In terms of upstream markets, we saw large fluctuations of material prices, which reached record-high levels in certain periods. The number of employees at Trimo Group was reduced by 55 to 962 at the end of the year. We saw an increase of workforce at Trimo VSK and Trimo RUS and a reduction in the companies in Slovenia and Southeast Europe. Bad experience from the past made us more careful, which is why we placed special attention on risks in 2012. We mostly monitored liquidity, credit and currency risks. Due to uncertain market conditions in 2012, we terminated our transactions involving derivative financial instruments, reducing currency risks dramatically. The development strategy of the Trimo Group is first and foremost to consolidate the Group financially, operations-wise and in terms of ownership. A suitable short-term financial consolidation can be achieved by balancing the sources of funding. In order to optimise the costs of operations and improve the balance sheet structure, we plan to dispose of assets that are not necessary for our business. Our new business model envisages orientation into building envelopes for new facilities and into energy refurbishment of buildings. Trimo has developed a large number of products that meet the highest technical standards in this area. Another new addition are interiors, which include partition walls and ceilings. We will strengthen our market position using an expanded market network and prompt adaptation to market conditions, especially with regard to our presence on the market via customer technical support in terms of seeking optimum solutions for specific customer needs. The trust-based relations between the strategic customers and Trimo employees are our greatest wealth. We will discontinue unprofitable programmes. We will adapt TrLPR *URXSÂ¶V RUJDQLVDWLRQDO VWUXFWXUH WR WKH QHZ PDUNHW UHTXLUHPHQWV :H ZLOOPDNHRXURUJDQLVDWLRQOHDQHULQUHVSRQVHWRRXUFXVWRPHUVÂ¶QHHGV$OVRZHZLOOSXUVXH additional synergies within the Group, which will gradually lead to lower operating costs of the Trimo Group. The number of employees will be adapted to the needs of the business process. Risks will be defined promptly in advance and the adequacy of adopted measures checked regularly, because past events have taught us that unexpected and sudden occurrences 13 might arise that cannot be foreseen based on known trends. Even the macroeconomic forecasts vary widely, and we intend to adapt our operations accordingly. Due to a number of reasons, which we are solving step-by-step, we have not been able to increase the value for the shareholders our very important stakeholders. We are committed to increasing the value for our shareholders again and ensuring the successful development of the Trimo Group in the future. We recorded some drops after two decades of continued successful operations. We have analysed the causes and assessed the newly created situation before defining the path for future development. The management and employees have both made a commitment to dedicate all their knowledge and abilities to this goal and to make the Trimo Group successful again. We are convinced that we can make it as we have in the past when faced with problems that we solved successfully. Tatjana Fink, MBA General Manager 14 SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT Monitoring company operations and supervising the work of the Management Board Trimo's operations and the activities of the Management Board in 2012 were under the authorisation and competence provisioned by statutory regulations and the company's statutes, monitored and supervised by the Supervisory Board consisting of the following members: Romana Pajenk, MSc, President of the Supervisory Board, Marta Strmec, Deputy President of the Supervisory Board, 3HWHU=RULÃ¾0HPEHURIWKH6XSHUYLVRU\%RDUG 1DWDÃ£DÃ¢WHIHUO3RSLW0HPEHURIWKH6XSHUYLVRU\%RDUG Stanislav Hostnik, Member of the Supervisory Board.

For the duration of the negotiations, it concluded a Stand Still Agreement with creditor banks. The process is expected to be completed by signing the Master Restructuring Agreement.

The international exchange in 2012 increased by 2,5 percent (6,0 percent in 2011), while the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates that the value of direct foreign investments at the international level in 2012 decreased by 18 percent to 1.300 billion dollars. In 2012, developing countries recorded positive growth of 5,1 percent, which is somewhat less than in 2011 (6,4 percent). The economies of Russia expanded by 3,4 percent, the Middle East and North Africa by 4,8 percent and the Central and South America by 3 percent. The traditionally fastest growing countries China and India have posted lower levels of economic growth in 2012, i.e. 7,8 and 4,0 percent, respectively. On the other hand, the USA and Japan saw higher growth in 2012 2,2 and 2 percent, respectively. In the last months of 2011, the construction market was once again in a state of stagnation, i.e. further decline due to the prognosis of a possible new recession and the connected delay of investments. This decrease kept strengthening throughout 2012. According to the information of Euroconstruct, construction in the largest construction markets in Europe was reduced by a further 4,7 percent in 2012, while in the new non-residential construction segment, the decline was even greater, i.e. 5,4 percent. Including the year 2012, European construction has been in recession for five years and is expected to continue in 2013. Despite further construction market reduction, Trimo and the Trimo Group were able to achieve better results in contract sales in 2012 compared to the previous year. 24 GRI: EC9 18 25 Graph 2: Annual growth of the construction market in the selected countries of Euroconstruct, Russia and 26 Slovenia, 2008-2012 20,0 Annual growth of the construction market (%) 15,0 10,0 5,0 0,0 -3,7 -3,3 0,2 -5,0 -8,8 -4,7 -10,0 -15,0 -20,0 -25,0 -30,0 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Slovenia 15,5 -20,9 -16,9 -25,4 -20,4 Great Britain -2,5 -12,3 7,6 2,3 -6,6 Germany 2,1 -2,3 2,5 5,2 -0,2 France -2,5 -7,4 -5,9 4,3 0,3 Poland 11,6 4,9 4,6 11,8 1,6 Russia 18,0 -13,2 5,0 5,1 2,4 Euroconstruct -3,7 -8,8 -3,3 0,2 -4,7 The Trimo Group adjusted to the changed economic and market conditions by applying different measures in different areas of Trimo's operations that are vital for successful operation in a crisis. This way, we strengthened sales activities and optimised business processes. We also aimed our intensively targeted marketing at markets and businesses that were less affected by the economic crisis. According to data from the World Bank, which monitors prices of individual raw materials on the world market, the global prices of raw materials, after a sharp decline at the end of 2011 and the first months of 2012, gained slightly in the course of 2012. In the later part of the year, the prices stabilised on average, though there are still major differences between individual groups of raw materials. The slowdown or even decline in the prices of individual raw materials reflects the state of the global economy, but the average price of raw materials is still at historically high levels and markets cannot support any additional price increases for raw materials. One of the most important raw materials in the Trimo Group is steel sheet-metal. In 2012, considering the annual average, the latter remained at the same level as at the end of 2011, though upward and downward fluctuations did occur during the year. We witnessed a drop in prices in the first quarter, a drastic increase in the second quarter and a gradual decline that went on until the end of the year, when prices again achieved the level of the prior year. In 2013, there are substantial risks of rising prices, mainly because of the great strength of the steel industry and unforeseen market developments, including the European Union's anti25 Members of Euroconstruct are: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Great Britain 26 Slovenia: source Eurostat, Russia: source PMR, other countries: data from Euroconstruct from December 2012 (2012 is an estimate). 19 dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain steel products originating from the People's Republic of China.27 We also witnessed a great price growth in mineral wool, where prices kept increasing from one quarter to another, and the total price increase until the end of 2011 was about eight percent. In 2013, we expect an unsteady macroeconomic environment in the core markets of operations for Trimo Group. In the construction markets, we expect another difficult year, since the value of new non-residential construction at our core markets will continue decreasing. Trimo is actively joining various environmental programmes and developing complete solutions for energy efficient buildings and efficient use of alternative energy resources. 27 Official Journal of the European Union, 2011/C 373/10. 20 THE RESULTS REFLECT THE CHANGED CONDITIONS 28 TRIMO AND THE TRIMO GROUP BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN 2012 Trimo business performance29 Relevant information on operating activities 2012/2011 index TOTAL REVENUE Â¼.277.977 91 P&L FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES Â¼.762.439 174 TOTAL CAPITAL (31 DEC 2012) Â¼.949.357 74 NO.

Trimo knows that satisfied and loyal customers are not just long-term partners Â± they also provide word-of-mouth marketing, and that is why Trimo measures the effectiveness of this market communication strategy. Trimo performs activities to improve satisfaction based on analyses of satisfaction measurements and personal interviews with customers as well as creates increased added value for customers through the process of improvements.

Sustainable development is a key component of the development strategy Development activities in the field of sustainable development, and related responsibility for a sustainable future, remain a vital part of our development strategy, especially in the form of an important addition to our range of products and commitment to creating complete solutions for our customers. Further cooperation with the associations Planet Positive and UNGC shows our continued clear commitment towards realising sustainable construction of modern buildings and sustainable operations. This way, we are also abiding by the UNGC principles on a preventive approach to environmental issues, encouraging increased responsible environmental management and developing and expanding environmentallyfriendly technology. Development of new products New products have an important contribution towards sales, acquisition of new customers and entering new markets. We are successfully developing and realising new products as well as personalised project development solutions for individual customers. Development projects in 2012 and 2013 Also in 2012, the structure of development projects included 39 percent of development assignments in new products and systems, in accordance with the long-term strategy.

Our operations are guided by our values based on high ethical standards, respecting human rights71 and each individual as a free-thinking person. In that way, every person can express their full potential in accordance with their capabilities and interests. Our growth in the development area is aimed at developing high-tech products and technologies. From a geographical perspective, our operations are strong in Europe and the wider environment.72 This demands that we ensure the necessary competencies for our current and future company and Group development needs in employee management. As we enter different cultural environments, we are aware that we not only have to understand business opportunities but primarily understand and respect the fundamental values of these different environments and adhere to the principles of human rights.73 We respect human rights and the employment standards contained in the United Nations Global Compact74 and Global Reporting Initiative75 in our operations. We develop processes in employment management in accordance with the recommendations described in the EFQM model.76 Employee distribution and categorisation The personnel structure for employees is adapted to the strategic needs of the company, and that is why we employ colleagues in sales and finance. We are reducing the number of employees working in processes where we have already reduced our activities; this means mostly assembly work and other processes that needed to be adapted to the volume of business. 70 GRI: 4.16 71 We are members and co-founders of the Slovenian United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). 72 See Introduction of the Trimo Group. 73 More information: Assuming responsibility for a sustainable future, UNGC principles. 74 More information: Assuming responsibility for a sustainable future, UNGC principles. 75 See section: GRI evaluation 76 More information at: www.efqm.com. 48 Graph 29: Fluctuation of average annual number of employees for Trimo and the Trimo Group 1400 1222 1213 average number of employees 1200 1124 1042 1001 1000 800 547 522 463 600 480 443 400 200 0 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Trimo Trimo Group Employees in the Trimo Group have the same rights as employees at Trimo with regard to local labour legislation, which complies with non-discrimination principles77, freedom of association, collective agreements78, prohibition of child employment79 and various forms of prohibition of forced or mandatory labour.80 In employing and managing people in other cultural environments, we have to pay special attention to the human rights of indigenous populations and learn about their cultural customs and habits to prevent a breach of their basic human rights from our lack of knowledge.81 Qualification structure The qualification structure of employees is adapted to the needs of the business processes. On 31 December 2012, 48 percent of Trimo employees had a level six education or higher. The Group employs people with comparable levels of education and vocational groups.

The starting point for developing employee competencies is not only mastering expert knowledge in individual areas, but it also includes a developed competencies model82 and Trimo values.83 Employee salaries and other benefits We have been keeping fair ratios of salaries and benefits for employees and specialist groups at different levels. The system monitors results achieved Â± i.e. the contribution of an employee to the added value and successful operation of the company. Tariff classes of the collective labour agreement are considered when assessing the ratios for starting salaries; basic salaries of employees are higher than starting salaries. There is no differentiation between men and women in salaries; they are set according to the same measures.84 Care for the health, safety and well-being of employees The health of employees is an important area to which we pay much attention by implementing various activities for improving work conditions, organised sports and social activities.85 83 More information: Vision, Mission, Values 84 GRI: LA14 85 In accordance with ISO 14001, the Board appointed an agent to manage environmental protection, safety at work and fire VDIHW\'DQLMHO=XSDQÃ¾LÃ¾06FZKRLVRWKHUZLVHWKH'HSXW\*HQHUDO0DQDJHUIRUWKH7HFKQLFDO6HFWRU$QHQYLURQPHQWDOVDIHW\ 50 In the Trimo Group, we ensure a safe and regulated work and natural environment to all stakeholders.86 Every company in the Group is committed to ensuring the necessary resources (personnel, finance, etc.) for the operation of a health and safety at work system and to prevent the risk of injuries and health problems.

Communication with employees In 2012, we strengthened the communication with employees at the Trimo Group level. During the economic and financial crisis, we regularly informed staff of the circumstances and the situation of Trimo and the Trimo Group. We allocated over 50 percent of our funds intended for public relations to internal communication within Trimo. Relationship between staff and the Management Board89 Employees can state their opinions and points of view directly to the Management Board at regular meetings and annual interviews. They meet with management at annual training sessions and other joint events. The General Manager talks to staff in person when extending their contract from a fixed period contract to a permanent contract. Managers also attend informal meetings with staff. The trade union SKEI operates within Trimo and includes 34 percent of all employees and an 11-member works council. Two staff representatives are also members of the Supervisory Board. Employees can communicate their opinions through them and give proposals regarding their position at Trimo. Good dialogue has been established between the Management Board of Trimo, the trade union and the works council. At meetings, the Management Board informs employees about current events, important changes in operation and measurements concerning employees. Representatives of both bodies inform the Management Board about their positions and proposals for improving work conditions and ensuring staff rights in accordance with the labour legislation. In 2013, we are going to adapt the employee qualification structure at Trimo and Trimo Group to our business needs. When selecting and finding new employees, we will follow sales strategic directives and primarily employ sales staff on promising markets. Considering operational activities run in a demanding global environment, we will further expand the competencies of employees in terms of the knowledge on strategy and management, sales skills and customer orientation. The Trimo dialogue DQG 7ULPRÂ¶V FRPSHWHQFLHV model will continue to be our tools to develop personnel. The process of developing employees will be upgraded with mentorships and coaching, and we will discover potential and develop successors. 89 GRI: LA5 52 MANAGING BY PROCESSES The framework for the process of constant improvements is the business excellence model that integrates different approaches for improvements in all processes. At Trimo, management is carried out with the help of the process approach and in accordance with the ISO 9001, 14001 and OHSAS standards. The Head of the quality department is the representative for quality management, and the representative for the management of environmental protection and safety at work is the Deputy General Manager of the Technical Sector. The model of the processes at Trimo is presented in the figure below.

Risk management It is very challenging to recognise and effectively manage risks and accept risk in business decisions considering how rapidly the conditions of operation are changing nowadays. We take into consideration both the external factors (the macroeconomic environment on international markets) and the internal risk factors (business processes). Our risk management process is shown below.

Risk monitoring and assessment Risk monitoring is done annually or as needed. Takers of individual risks assess the probability of the risks occurring, and the consequences if the risk actually occurs, using a 5x5 matrix. Risk priorities in 2012 In 2012, Trimo paid special attention to key risks identified for the 2011Â±2013 period. Risk management was expanded to several other companies within the Trimo Group. 58 Future risks and the planned activities in 2013 For the period from 2011 to 2013,92 we identified 44 risks from the above definitions as key sales and financial risks. For individual risks, the risk takers are already using selected indicators for risk management. These indicators will be collected and attributed to individual risks in 2013. At the same time, they will be revised and checked for adequacy. In 2013, we intend to revise the risk management process and transfer it to other Trimo Group companies. 92 GRI: 1.2 59 BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS93 Trimo develops partnerships with all stakeholders. In 2012, we cooperated with over 127 partners. We developed new products and improved existing products together with strategic suppliers. 94 Figure 4: Trimo's stakeholders Knowledge centres The development process includes employees and our vital stakeholders customers, suppliers, subcontractors, universities and institutes. We cooperated domestic and foreign partners In 2012, our development department actively cooperated with 127 domestic and foreign partners in the development process. These included 21 universities, 19 institutes, 55 departments for development from other companies, 24 suppliers and a large number of independent researchers and designers. We cooperated with external partners in 79 percent of all development projects; almost 63 percent were partners from other countries. We develop cooperation with knowledge centres through other forms of cooperation such as the Trimo Research Awards,95 cooperation in joint calls for applications in development (for 93 GRI: 4.16, SO1 94 GRI: 4.14 95 More information in the section: Nurturing creativity and innovation. 60 example: ARRS, Eureka, Competency Centres, Economic Centres), collaboration with students, enabling visits and tours of production facilities and our specialists functioning as guest speakers at universities or members of specialised associations.

Managing the complete chain of physical as well as the financial flow became even more demanding, not merely for Trimo but for the whole Group. We paid special attention to ensuring the supply of raw materials. Prices of services (assembly, others) also had a slight upwards trend. With coordinated and focused operations throughout the whole chain, we were able to optimise the level of supplies of raw materials and thereby improve the tying up of money in materials. With our strategic suppliers, we improved the technical, functional and aesthetic qualities of the existing products. In terms of functional characteristics, we focused activities on increasing insulation, in technical on reducing materials and finding cheaper alternatives and in aesthetics we aimed at introducing several different colours and patterns in sheet metals. We collaborated with key suppliers for Qbiss Air on coordinating the technical and supply conditions for materials and services. Together with suppliers, we pursued solutions and rationalised manufacturing and assembly processes with a project-based approach.

In 2012, the quantity of municipal waste was significantly reduced as a consequence of additional collecting and separation of waste. The share of municipal waste represents about two percent of the waste total of the company. Secondary waste The relative share of separated waste and waste handed over in the form of secondary raw materials at Trimo is increasing as the waste management programme is implemented consistently; constant improvements also positively contribute to the results.

Water usage per employee in 2012 was 1,32 m3/month, which is more than in 2011. The higher consumption is a result of a defect in the local pipeline, which was successfully eliminated after it was discovered. Consumption of heating gas oil (HGO)110 Consumption of HGO is related to the heating system during winter. We monitor the absolute consumption and the usage per unit of heating volume. Part of the consumption is tied to the technology heating system, where we monitor the consumption of HGO per product unit.

It includes the electricity consumption for production processes, ventilation, air conditioning and heating and lighting. With the introduction of energy-saving lighting and the conversion of compressor drives in 2012, we achieved annual savings in consumption equalling a little over 500.000 kWh. The project was co-financed via a tender of the Ministry of the Economy. 7ULPRÂ¶V WZR VRODU SRZHU SODQWV RSHUDWHG WKH ZKROH \HDU JHQHUDWLQJ DERXW  N:K RI green electricity. Emissions of harmful substances into the natural environment We regularly monitor the emissions of all combustion plants, which operate within legally prescribed limits.111 LCA112 Trimo is spreading the culture of a responsible attitude towards climate change, together with our partners in the supply chain, by implementing careful natural resource and energy product management and measures for reducing the indirect impact on the level of emissions. In 2012, with the help of measurements to reduce emissions of the CO2e footprint, we achieved a CO2 footprint reduction of approximately three percent in relation to Trimoterm and Qbiss product families. We also monitor CO2 emissions occurring from the activities in the production factory on the basis of energy product use, emissions and calculations. In 2012, absolute emissions slightly decreased due to the lower use of electricity.113 Emissions by employees (arrival at work, work-related travelling, etc.) are not included in these calculations.
