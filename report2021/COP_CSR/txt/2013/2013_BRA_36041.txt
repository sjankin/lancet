We consolidated our presence in our existing operational segments and expanded into the airport sector. We also recorded four new achievements, including the São Paulo International Airport and Via Expressa TransOlímpica concessions, the incorporation of Via Parque Rímac, in Peru, and the granting of a stock purchase option on Line 4 of the Rio de Janeiro subway system. All these projects are highly visible and play a vital role in the mobility and logistics of their respective regions. For example, São Paulo International Airport will have to have a new terminal capable of handling 12 million passengers per year by the beginning of 2014, while the Via Expressa TransOlímpica has to be ready before the 2016 Olympic Games, providing enormous benefits for the population. By the end of the concession, the airport will be able to handle 60 million passengers a year and the TransOlímpica will contribute to the urbanization of Rio de Janeiro, providing improved access to and greater integration between its different regions. Via Parque Rímac will improve traffic flow in Lima, the capital of Peru, and Line 4 of the Rio de Janeiro subway system will carry over 300,000 passengers per day. All these operations will be conducted in accordance with best management practices, as well as the professionalism and regard for quality that have made Invepar one of Brazil’s fastest growing transport infrastructure companies. We are facing a number of challenges related to investing the necessary resources in ongoing operations, while simultaneously improving our operating and financial performance. However, we have successfully overcome challenging situations before, such as the arrival and start-up of MetrôRio’s new trains, and have achieved all our targets to date (for more details, see page 27). In the Toll Road segment, the total number of paying vehicle equivalents increased by 13.4% to more than 147 million, while the result in the Urban Mobility segment was equally positive, with 185.9 million passengers transported, 3.3% more than in 2011. Similarly, in the Airport segment, GRU Airport handled 32.8 million passengers in 2012, 9.2% up on the year before. These results were reflected in Invepar’s positive financial performance. We recorded consolidated annual gross revenue of R$2.2 billion, a 42.4% improvement over 2011, while adjusted consolidated EBITDA (excluding the IFRS effects) moved up by 24.2% to R$428.0 million. Annual net income stood at R$24.6 million, R$84.2 million more than the previous year. Also in 2012, we took our first steps towards a new growth cycle. We launched a new brand identity, in which our essential nature is encapsulated in the phrase “Commitment means reliability”, as well as a new green and yellow logo, symbolizing our sector and our country. We also intend to become a market byword for our main attributes as a Partner, Mobilizer and Innovator. Invepar is now preparing for its IPO, which is why we have been paying even greater attention to our corporate governance. We have already adopted several best market practices, such as ensuring accountability in accordance with the requirements of the CVM (Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission) and building a robust governance framework, with a Board of Directors, Board of Executive Officers and Fiscal Council, as well as a series of advisory committees. In 2012, we strengthened our business guidelines through the adoption of a corporate Code of Ethics, accompanied by a communications channel for suggestions and complaints. We are also signatories to the United Nations Global Compact. 6 2012 Annual Report The issues defended by the Compact, such as human rights, environmental preservation and decent work practices, among others, are of increasing concern to Invepar. All the group’s companies seek to promote social and environmental responsibility initiatives in order to reduce negative impacts and enhance positive influences on their surrounding communities. One successful example of this was the project to resettle families evicted due to the works associated with the Via Parque Rímac toll road. In order to accomplish this, the Concessionaire is financing the construction of an apartment complex, whose units can be acquired for the same price paid for their current residences. Our commitment to issues like this is embodied by the Invepar Institute, through which we invest our own resources and those arising from tax incentives in educational, sporting, cultural and environmental projects, thereby building long-term relations with our surrounding communities and fostering their development. We have high expectations for the future. There are innumerable opportunities in our operational segments (toll roads, urban mobility and airports), especially now that infrastructure has become a government priority, exemplified by the inclusion of public transport concessions in major metropolitan areas in the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC). We will continue to pay close attention to opportunities in Brazil, but will also be prepared for possibilities in the rest of Latin America, while always maintaining our focus on service quality, for which Invepar aims to become an international benchmark, putting it amongst the best companies in the world. Essentially, our intention is to grow while creating value for our shareholders and society as a whole. One of the great challenges in this regard is to find and develop talent with the skills and culture that we esteem. But we are also fully aware of the value of our existing workforce, without whose dedication and professionalism we could not have achieved our targets. According to an organizational climate survey conducted in 2012, most of our staff already have a sense of belonging to the Company, which is extremely important to us. We are also strengthening our image as a group, which led us to create a new brand identity, giving more exposure to the Invepar name and reinforcing our image and market credibility. We are proud of the role we are playing in the countries where we operate. A strong economy calls for first-rate infrastructure, allowing people to reach their destination quickly, facilitating the transportation of agricultural and manufactured products, and ensuring connections between different modes of transport. We will continue contributing to sustainable mobility through solutions that complement one another and enable ample and unrestricted accessibility. We are certain we are on the right track and that we have the full support of our employees, shareholders and the granting powers. You will find more information regarding our group and its 2012 performance throughout this report, which for the first time has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s sustainability reporting guidelines. I wish you all a good read. Gustavo Rocha CEO of Invepar Invepar 7 Vision, Mission and Values Vision To be the leader and international benchmark in the transport infrastructure sector.

New businesses expand operations to new mobility segments and beyond national frontiers. [GRI 2.2 2.3 2.5 2.7 2.8 2.9] In 2012, Invepar, one of the largest private-sector transport infrastructure operators in Latin America, recorded four new achievements which were important for its business and also vital for the infrastructure of the regions where they are located. The Company made its first strategic entry into the airport sector, winning the bid to manage and operate São Paulo International Airport, the largest in Latin America; took its first step towards internationalization by incorporating the controlling concessionaire of Via Parque Rímac, in Lima (Peru); won the bid to implement and operate the Via Expressa TransOlímpica, in Rio de Janeiro; and signed a stock purchase for shares issued by Concessionária Rio Barra S.A., the company responsible for constructing Line 4 of Rio de Janeiro’s subway system, thereby becoming the sole subway operator in Rio de Janeiro state (for more details on each business, please visit www.gru.com.br, www.viaparquerimac.com.pe and www.metrolinha4.com.br). Currently, Invepar has ten concessions. It began operations in 2000 with LAMSA (Linha Amarela S.A. RJ) and CLN (Concessionária Litoral Norte BA) and now also controls MetrôRio (Concessão Metroviária do Rio de Janeiro S.A. RJ), CART (Concessionária Auto Raposo Tavares S.A. SP), CBN (Concessionária Bahia Norte BA), CRT (Concessionária Rio Teresópolis S.A. RJ) and CRA (Concessionária Rota do Atlântico PE).

With the acquisitions, mergers and victorious concession bids in the last four years, Invepar has established itself as a sector benchmark and one of Brazil’s leading private-sector transport infrastructure operators. It is also the largest private subway operator in Brazil, runs the largest airport in Latin America and is SMART MOBILITY among the top five toll road concessionaires, managing a total of 1,027 km. Demand for its services increased The term “Smart Mobility” was chosen as in 2012: the number of paying vehicle equivalents on Invepar’s slogan because it represents its roads moved up by 17 million to 147 million and the the primary concept of its business. The number of MetrôRio passengers reached 186 million, group focuses on developing and operating 7 million higher than in 2011. Invepar posted intermodal solutions in a proactive and planned proportional consolidated gross revenue of R$2.2 manner, providing millions of Brazilians with billion, 42.4% up on the year before and we expect mobility and accessibility and paving the way these indicators to record further improvements in for the country’s economic growth. the years ahead, thanks to ongoing and scheduled investments in the group’s various concessions. Invepar is convinced that integration between different means of transportation with agility, Invepar is present in four Brazilian states as well comfort and safety is the best means of as Peru, with over 5,000 employees in 2012. The transforming investments into an effective Company operates in accordance with the highest response to Brazil’s massive transport ethical principles and is preparing to go public on the infrastructure bottlenecks. This approach is BM&FBovespa. The group also maintains the Invepar in line with the National Urban Mobility Policy, Institute, which is responsible for developing and which calls for sustainable mobility, defined as implementing a series of social and environmental the result of a conjunction of transportation and responsibility programs, especially in relation to the circulation policies that allows access to urban communities surrounding its concessions. space. Such access should be extensive, socially inclusive and ecologically sustainable, In 2012, Invepar created a new brand identity, without spatial segregation. which encapsulates its essence and attributes. For Invepar, “Commitment means reliability”, and its brand embodies its attributes as a Partner, Mobilizer and Innovator. 10 2012 Annual Report Venezuela Guyana Suriname Colombia Ecuador Brazil PE Peru CRA BA Bolívia CLN Vila Parque Rímac CBN SP Chile Paraguay RJ LAMSA CRT Argentina MetrôRio CART Transolímpica Uruguay GRU Airport Invepar’s operations Toll Roads In 2012, the Brazilian government announced an investment plan for railway and toll road concessions. Responsible for most of the country’s cargo transport, the highways play a crucial role in national logistics. Currently, only 15,000 of Brazil’s 214,000 kilometers of paved roads are managed by private enterprise. Invepar itself manages approximately 1,000 km of toll roads in Brazil and 25 km in Peru. In this segment of operation, expressways are also included, such as Linha Amarela, one of the most important expressways in Rio de Janeiro, which handles more than 430,000 vehicles per day; Via Expressa TransOlímpica, which will be ready by the end of 2016 and will play an important role in the development of the city’s West Zone; and Via Parque Rímac, which is under development in Lima and is regarded as Peru’s most important urban infrastructure project. It extends for 25 kilometers, passing through Lima and another 11 municipality districts, connecting them to the port and the international airport.

Object Airport expansion, maintenance and operations Capacity Current 30 MPax (million passengers) Scheduled – 60 Mpax Concession period 2012 to 2032 Invepar 15 Twelve years of evolution Invepar’s trajectory reveals growth strategy and business expansion Invepar’s four achievements in 2012 — São Paulo International Airport, Via Parque Rímac (Peru), Via Expressa TransOlímpica and Line 4 of the Rio de Janeiro subway — reinforced the group’s growth strategy, which envisages investments in new transport infrastructure projects in Brazil and abroad. Invepar also created two new companies: PEX (Passe Expresso), responsible for automatic and exclusive transit lanes at the Linha Amarela (RJ), Rio Niterói bridge (RJ), Via Lagos (RJ) and Concessionária Bahia Norte toll plazas, and Metrobarra S.A., which provides systems and rolling stock for Line 4. The Company was constituted in 2000, initially to operate two concessions: LAMSA (Linha Amarela S.A.) in Rio de Janeiro, and CLN (Concessionária Litoral Norte) in Bahia. By the close of 2011, with capital reinforcements and a structured strategic growth plan, Invepar’s portfolio already contained five other toll road and passenger rail concessions: CART (Concessionária Auto Raposo Tavares), in São Paulo, MetrôRio, in Rio de Janeiro, CBN (Concessionária Bahia Norte), in Bahia, CRT (Concessionária Rio-Teresópolis), in Rio de Janeiro, and CRA (Concessionária Rota do Atlântico), in Pernambuco. If we factor in the 2012 achievements, the number of portfolio concessions has increased from two, at the beginning of operations, to ten, while the number of group companies totals 12. Passe Expresso (Express Pass) allows drivers to use exclusive automatic toll lanes, eliminating the need to stop at the toll plaza 16 2012 Annual Report 2012 Achievements GRU Airport São Paulo International Airport [GRI 2.9] In February 2012, Invepar won the bid to operate São Paulo International Airport, located in Guarulhos, the largest airport in Latin America with 274,000 arrivals and departures and 32.8 million passengers transported in 2012. This marked the group’s entry into a new operational segment, opening the way for new opportunities in the segment, which should be the subject of further bids in the coming years. The concession will be managed by a consortium comprising Invepar and ACSA (Airport Company South Africa), which retains 51% of the SPE (special purpose enterprise), the other 49% being held by Infraero. Of this 51%, 90% belongs to Invepar and 10% to ACSA. ACSA has extensive experience in this role, being responsible for the operations in nine airports in South Africa, including three major international facilities: OR Tambo (Johannesburg), Cape Town and King Shaka (Durban). Since 2006, it has also been managing the airport in Mumbai, India. The company’s airports are internationally recognized for their operational efficiency and excellent user service. Once the association between ACSA and Invepar was formalized, Concessionária Aeroporto Internacional de Guarulhos took control of operations on November 15, 2012, with definitive control scheduled for February 15, 2013*. The Company plans to invest R$6 billion in the airport by 2032, around R$3 billion of which before the 2014 World Cup. The funds will be allocated to a number of important improvements, including the construction of a new passenger terminal and a parking lot. With this in mind, in December 2012, the Company contracted its first bridge loan from the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) totaling R$1.2 billion, R$450 million of which has already been disbursed. The main investments include construction of the new Terminal 3, which will be capable of handling 12 million passengers per year, on which work has already begun, with conclusion scheduled for 2014; a parking deck, * Control was effectively transferred on that date. Invepar 17 which will add around 2,600 new parking spaces, scheduled for completion in May 2013; 22 new boarding points; a new aircraft yard with 36 aprons; widening and expansion of the runways; construction of two top-class hotels, one with 50 rooms, located in the restricted area, for passengers with international connecting flights, and the other with 350 rooms in the external area of Terminal 3; a retrofit for Terminals 1 and 2, with expansion of the baggage off-loading, passport control and X-ray areas, as well as the commercial and service areas; a convention center; and a shopping mall. When all of the investments are concluded by the end of the concession, capacity will have climbed from 30 to 60 million passengers, the airport will be able to hold 130 aircraft, versus the current 61, and parking spaces will have increased from 4,100 to 20,000.

In this context, in November 2012 the Concessionaire renewed the contracts with Dufry in the current terminals related to the duty-free retail area (items subject to tax reductions or exemption). In accordance with the new agreement, this company will continue to operate In February 2012, Invepar the duty-free facilities until 2016 and will expand its sales won the bid to operate São area by up to 2,100 m². Dufry currently operates a total of eight duty-free stores in the airport, with a joint sales area Paulo International Airport, of around 4,500 m². The expansion of the commercial area located in Guarulhos, the will take place in the arrival and departure areas of Terminal largest airport in Latin 2, allowing Dufry to further increase its mix of products and offer international users best-selling brands. The new stores America with 274,000 should be inaugurated by the end of 2013. arrivals and departures and With the beginning of operations, the Concessionaire 32.8 million passengers decided to adopt a new brand for the airport, which is transported in 2012 now called GRU Airport – São Paulo International Airport, in line with the international standard used by the world’s main airports. In order to manage the company responsible for the airport, an internal recruitment process was instituted to engage people who are already steeped in the Invepar culture and possess the necessary skills to assume strategic positions. Once the recruitment process is finalized, the airport’s controlling company will employ a direct workforce of around 1,800, since certain previously outsourced positions will be insourced. 18 2012 Annual Report Via Parque Rímac [GRI 2.9] March 2012 saw the conclusion of Invepar’s merger of V.P.R. Brasil Participações S.A., which retains 100% of Linea Amarilla S.A.C. (Lamsac), a special purpose enterprise created in 2009 to explore the concession to build, maintain and operate the Via Parque Rímac toll road, in Lima, Peru. The transaction also marked Invepar’s first foray outside of Brazil, in line with its vision of becoming “a leader and international benchmark in the transport infrastructure sector.” Located in metropolitan Lima, the toll road is regarded as Peru’s most important urban infrastructure project, as it not only involves improved mobility, but also the regeneration of the area surrounding the Rímac River and investments in social development. All in all, there will be 25 kilometers of toll road connecting the main highways serving Lima to the Port of Callao and the International Airport, comprising nine kilometers of new roads, three kilometers of bridges and overpasses, four kilometers of road expansions and two kilometers of tunnel under the river, with safety, communications and operational control systems and equipment along the entire extension, together with nine new toll plazas, five of which are already functioning. When the concession is fully operational, 80% of revenue will come from these five plazas. Investments are expected to total around US$703 million. Due to its characteristics, the project is very similar to Invepar’s experience of operating Rio de Janeiro’s Linha Amarela. Invepar 19 Community relations A series of social and One of the major challenges of a project such as Via Parque Rímac is the expropriation of properties and environmentally responsible the relocation of residents, only successful through the programs are also being development of close relations with those involved, implemented by Via Parque so that they understand the benefits of the toll road and the advantages of the housing option offered by Rímac, including an urban the Company. Developing initiatives to minimize the agriculture project in schools impacts on their lives is another priority. to teach students how to grow In order to address this issue, Via Parque Rímac is chemical-free crops, and building 465 apartments, 417 of which located in the Patio Unión family complex (81 ready) and 48 in programs focusing on hygiene the fully concluded Acomayo building. More than and the management of waste 40 families have already been resettled in Acomayo and diseases caused by it and 81 have requested transfer to Patio Unión. Other 32 families are living in accommodation paid by the company (at a cost similar to their previous residence). The Concessionaire is also providing computer In addition, Via Parque Rímac construction works courses for the community’s teachers, students and generate 1,071 direct and 231 indirect jobs. A series parents, with a particular emphasis on women, so of social and environmentally responsible programs that they can contribute to household income.

Other such initiatives include cooking, confectionery, handicrafts and first aid. programs dealing with hygiene and the management of waste and its related diseases. Recycling measures will be introduced in the future. 20 2012 Annual Report Via Expressa Transolímpica [GRI 2.9] Invepar will make a direct contribution to the infrastructure improvements in Rio de Janeiro, triggered by the city’s selection to host the 2016 Olympic Games. In April 2012, a consortium led by Invepar in association with Odebrecht TransPort and CCR, won the municipal bid to implement and operate the Via Expressa TransOlímpica, which will link Avenida Brasil in Magalhães Bastos with Avenida Salvador Allende in Jacarepaguá. Regarded as the city’s biggest road project in the last 30 years, the toll road is part of the Rio 2016 Olympic Plan as it will provide a direct connection between the Barra da Tijuca and Deodoro Olympic Centers. The concession will last for 35 years, during which the consortium will be responsible for the building works, as well as the installation of the operational and maintenance systems, including 13 kilometers of three-lane toll road (two vehicle lanes and an express bus lane), a 1.53 kilometer tunnel, and 48 bridges and overpasses. The corridor will pass through the Barra da Tijuca, Recreio dos Bandeirantes, Camorim, Curicica, Taquara, Jardim Sulacap, Magalhães Bastos, Vila Militar and Deodoro neighborhoods, directly benefiting more than 400,000 people. Invepar retains a 33.34% interest in the special purpose enterprise, while Odebrecht TransPort and CCR hold 33.33% each. The project to seek bids from Via Expressa TransOlímpica was the result of an Expression of Interest (PMI) drawn up by Invepar, a legal instrument that allows the private sector to develop technical and financial feasibility studies for projects in the public interest. It is an innovative tool that fosters proactivity and allows for the creation of competitive advantages. Through this instrument, the state government encouraged and created the necessary conditions for the private sector to carry out infrastructure exploration studies and modeling. In some Brazilian states, they are known as Private Enterprise Expression of Interest (MIPs). In order to develop TransOlímpica, several alternative routes were evaluated so as to arrive at the best urban mobility solution at the lowest implementation cost, always in compliance with environmental and technical regulations. The TransOlímpica bid and victory in the Concessionária Rota do Atlântico bid in 2011 has given Invepar a relevant track record of projects structured through PMIs. Social and environmental responsibility Since this is a structural toll road project, the regulatory authorities require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and an Environmental Impact Report (RIMA), containing data from the environmental locations crossed by the toll road, as well as socio-economic information. As the works are located in a highly urbanized and densely populated area, the environmental impact was considered to be low, mostly associated with air quality and noise pollution during construction. Socially, however, the impact is slightly higher – so far, 1,200 expropriations have been scheduled to accommodate the works. Such expropriations are the responsibility of the granting authority, which has the Concessionaire’s support in the preparation of certain field stages, such as the Local Production Arrangements (APL), the General Property Registry (RGI) and the socioeconomic register. Invepar 21 PEX In 2012, Invepar created PEX (Passe Expresso), the company that manages the Passe Expresso system, which is responsible for exclusive automatic transit lanes, allowing users to pass through toll plazas without stopping by means of an electronic chip on their windshield, thereby speeding up traffic and eliminating the handling of money. The Passe Expresso system also has the advantage of being a prepaid mode, which allows users to purchase credits in advance. It also offers the lowest management fees in the market. PEX is constantly attempting to increase its accredited network, which currently permits the use of the Passe Expresso system on the Linha Amarela (RJ), Rio Niterói Bridge(RJ), Via Lagos (RJ) and Concessionária Bahia Norte (BA). Invepar plans to expand the system to CLN (BA) in 2013, and also to new toll roads and shopping malls. Rio de Janeiro Subway Line 4 In November 2012, Invepar signed a stock purchase agreement, for all the shares of CRB (Concessionária Rio Barra), totaling R$50 million, which holds the right to operate the concession for Line 4 of the Rio de Janeiro State Subway System. Exercise of the option is contingent upon the successful completion of the construction works scheduled for 2016 as well as compliance with the conditions precedent set forth in the agreement. Until then, Metrobarra S.A., an Invepar subsidiary, will provide systems and rolling stock for Line 4 operations. As a result, Invepar is the sole operator of Rio de Janeiro’s Subway System, reinforcing its determination to become one of the country’s main transport infrastructure companies by expanding its activities in the urban mobility segment, which will present major challenges for Brazil in the coming years. With start-up scheduled for 2016, Line 4 will link the city’s south side with Barra da Tijuca, add six new stations to the existing network (Jardim Oceânico, São Conrado, Gávea, Antero de Quental, Jardim de Alah and Nossa Senhora da Paz) and 16 kilometers to the current 41, facilitating the movement of more than 300,000 passengers per day who are expected to take less than 35 minutes to commute from Barra da Tijuca to the south side. 22 2012 Annual Report 02 BUSINESS Market _23 The Sector in Numbers _24 Corporate Performance _27 Investments _33 Outlook _35 Invepar 23 Market Market performance Prioritizing investments in infrastructure benefits the concession sector in Brazil According to the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), Brazil’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product) edged up by only 0.9% in 2012 as a result of the 0.8% In 2013, the Brazilian increase in value added to basic prices and the 1.6% growth in product taxes net of subsidies. The service Government will launch sector was the only one to record growth, moving up by concession bids for 1.7%, while agriculture and industry declined by 2.3% and 0.8%, respectively.

In order to take advantage of the BRIC average n/a 4.10 growth opportunities, however, Brazil will have to intensify its Brazil 62 4.02 infrastructure improvements, which the federal government has been doing through heavy investments with the close support of private partnerships in the form of concessions. Source: WEF The Global Competitiveness Index 2010-2011 24 2012 Annual Report According to the balance of the second edition of the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC 2), a Ministry of Planning initiative expected to last until 2014, the government channeled R$27.7 billion into improving infrastructure, which went towards the construction of around 1,500 kilometers of roads and 459 kilometers of railways, as well as airport and port facilities. These numbers are expected to increase in the near future, given the government’s announcement of the Logistics Investment Program based on a strategic partnership with the private sector and focusing on the renewal and integration of Brazil’s transportation network. The program will consist of an extensive range of transport logistics concessions which will require substantial private investments. Throughout 2013, the Brazilian government will launch bids for 7,500 kilometers of federal highways, 10,000 kilometers of rail track, two international airports — Galeão in Rio de Janeiro, and Confins in Belo Horizonte — and several port terminals. The bid to operate Brazil’s first high-speed train on the 511 kilometer Rio-São Paulo-Campinas route, is also scheduled for 2013. Total investments in the country’s infrastructure are expected to reach approximately US$235 billion in the coming years. To facilitate the entire process, the government has been introducing a series of measures related to tax breaks and the removal of red tape, such as the acceptance of non-resident investors and the creation of ground-breaking financing mechanisms. The Sector in Numbers Toll Roads According to the Brazilian Association of Highway Concessionaires (ABCR), Brazil has the fourth largest auto market in the world. Between 2002 and 2012, traffic on toll roads under concession grew by 84%, from 57,000 to 105,000 vehicles per kilometer, with the number of vehicles (including buses, trucks, passenger and light commercial vehicles) moving up from 1.5 to 3.8 million in the same period. Currently, the highways account for more than 70% of cargo volume, according to the World Bank. Nevertheless, the quality of Brazil’s network still falls well short of international standards – a mere 13.8% of roads are paved and most are in poor condition. Aiming to change this scenario, the federal government plans to spend R$42 billion on highways in the coming years. As confirmed by the PAC 2 balance, 1,479 km of highway works have been completed nationwide and there are ongoing interventions in a further 8,000 kilometers. Investing in toll road concessions has therefore proved to be a wise decision. The ABCR’s figures indicate better road quality, which increases traffic flow and facilitates the movement of people and goods.

Excellent Good Average Poor Very Poor The major events should increase the flow of visitors to large cities. The World Cup alone should attract 3.7 million tourists to Brazil in 2014 Subways According to the World Bank, over 80% of the Brazilian population currently lives in cities and metropolitan areas. In the Southeast, this figure exceeds 90%. The public transport system, however, has not kept pace with demand, leading to social, economic and environmental disadvantages such as traffic congestion, air and noise pollution, accidents, loss of community spirit and lower quality of life. The major events scheduled for the coming years, such as the Confederations Cup and World Youth Day in 2013, the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games in 2016, amongst others, should increase the flow of people in the larger cities. The World Cup alone is expected to attract 3.7 million tourists in June and July 2014, according to the Ministry of Sports. This scenario, coupled with the need for improvements in the public transport system in order to promote the country’s growth, led the federal government to launch specific Growth Acceleration Programs (PACs) to meet urban mobility needs, including PAC Large Cities Mobility, PAC Medium Cities Mobility and special investments designed to ensure people flow during the mega sporting events. 26 2012 Annual Report According to the Ministry of the Cities, the programs cover around 100 of Brazil’s largest cities and involve resources of R$60 billion. The Government has been using the PAC Urban Mobility to invest in different types of trains, subways, bus corridors and other public transportation systems. The number of airline passengers in Brazil increased approximately 134% from 48.4 million in 2002 to 113.4 million in 2012 Airports According to the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC), the number of airline passengers in Brazil increased from 48.4 million in 2002 to 113.4 million in 2012, growth of almost 134% in just ten years. According to the latest global estimates from Airbus, Brazil has the world’s fourth-largest air transport market. Furthermore, the major sporting events — the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics — will significantly increase tourist flows. Studies by Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) indicate that the World Cup alone will attract 79% more foreign visitors to the country’s airports. If confirmed, these estimates will have a massive impact on demand for airport infrastructure, one of the federal government’s main current concerns. Including the expected investments in regional airports, the government plans to spend US$9.4 billion on this system in the coming years. Many works have already been completed. The PAC 2 balance indicated the conclusion of 15 airport projects, including the expansion of Cuiabá, Goiânia, Guarulhos, Porto Alegre and Vitória airports, which increased total capacity to 14 million passengers per year. Nineteen more interventions are under way, including the renovation and expansion of passenger terminals in Cuiabá, Florianópolis, Fortaleza, Foz do Iguaçu, Manaus and Salvador. In addition, four airports have been conceded to private enterprise — São Gonçalo do Amarante, Guarulhos, Campinas and Brasília — and will receive investments of over R$16.8 billion. Invepar 27 Corporate Performance Year of growth Invepar records healthy operating and financial performance 2012 was an exceptionally good year for Invepar, beginning with the successful bids for São Paulo International Airport, Via Parque Rímac, Via Expressa TransOlímpica and Line 4 of the Rio Subway. The importance of these projects to their respective regions constitutes a quantum leap in the group’s achievements. In the Toll Road segment, the total number of PVEs (paying vehicle equivalents) increased by 13.4% to more than 147 million, mainly due to the ramp-up of Bahia Norte, which began operations in April 2011; the consolidation of traffic at CART, inaugurated in March 2009; the acceleration of agribusiness in the state of São Paulo; the growth in LAMSA’s traffic flow due to improvement works; and closure of the Las Palmas escape route at CLN. The operating result of the Urban Mobility segment was equally impressive, reaching 185.9 million passengers transported, 3.3% up on the 180.0 million recorded in 2011. One of the main factors behind the upturn was the economic acceleration of the city of Rio de Janeiro, coupled with the operational improvement of MetrôRio and the gradual introduction of new trains to its fleet, which increased supply. In the Airport segment, GRU Airport transported 32.8 million passengers in 2012, 9.3% more than in 2011. Aircraft arrivals and departures totaled 274,000 and cargo and mail transport came to 507,000 tonnes. 28 2012 Annual Report Consolidated Annual Income Statement (R$ thousand) – pro rata 2012 2011 Δ↑ Gross Revenue 2,204,284 1,547,454 42.4% Tariff Revenue 1,121,738 948,584 18.3% Ancillary Revenue 67,061 29,175 129.9% Construction Revenue (IFRS) 1,015,485 569,695 78.3% Gross Revenue Deductions (92,200) (73,225) 25.9% Net Revenue 2,112,085 1,474,229 43.3% Operating Costs and Expenses (1,880,587) (1,344,436) 39.9% Personnel (269,377) (220,317) 22.3% Conservation & Maintenance (104,449) (105,176) -0.7% Operational (140,603) (131,138) 7.2% Variable Concession Fee (6,683) (5,833) 14.6% Construction Costs (IFRS) (1,002,806) (555,437) 80.5% Provision for Maintenance (IFRS) (6,533) (6,556) -0.4% Depreciation & Amortization (202,681) (172,525) 17.5% Administrative Expenses (147,455) (147,454) 0.0% EBIT 231,497 179,857 28.7% (+) Depreciation & Amortization 202,681 172,525 17.5% EBITDA 434,178 352,382 23.2% Adjustments (6,146) (7,702) -20.2% (-) Construction Revenue (IFRS) (1,015,485) (569,695) 78.3% (+) Construction Costs (IFRS) 1,002,806 555,437 80.5% (+) Provision for Maintenance (IFRS) 6,533 6,556 -0.4% Adjusted EBITDA 428,032 344,680 24.2% Depreciation & Amortization (202,681) (172,525) 17.5% Financial Result (166,104) (249,867) -33.5% Equity Income (3,513) 490 n.m.

Part of this amount – R$1.0 billion – is related to construction revenue, in compliance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) norms. For the purposes of analysis, the Company’s Adjusted Net Revenue does not include this amount. Adjusted Net Revenue (Adjusted NOR) came to approximately R$1.1 billion, 21.2%, or R$192.1 million, more than in 2011. This was primarily due to the following: Toll Road Segment: accounted for 48.2% of Adjusted NOR, R$76.7 million (17.0%) up on 2011, mainly due to the increase in PEVs, tariff adjustments, and higher ancillary revenue; Urban Mobility Segment: accounted for 56.2% of Adjusted NOR, R$54.2 million (12.0%) more than in 2011, mainly due to tariff adjustments, the higher number of paying passengers, and ancillary revenue growth; Airport Segment: accounted for 5.6% of Adjusted NOR, equivalent to R$61.1 million.

This amount includes R$1.0 billion in construction costs, and R$6.5 million in provision for maintenance related to IFRS. For the purposes of analysis, Adjusted Operating Costs and Expenses exclude these amounts. Adjusted Operating Costs and Expenses came to R$733.5 million in 2012, R$108 million (17.3%) up on the previous year, primarily due to the new concessions, particularly GRU Airport and companies that were still in the pre-operational phase in 2012, including CRA, Via Parque Rímac and CTO.

In regard to financial expenses, gross debt climbed by around R$850 million, most of which was raised at the end of the year and therefore had no relevant impact on 2012 financial expenses. The improvement in the debt profile, thanks to rescheduling and the reduction in financing costs, was in line with the Company’s intention of ensuring project financing structures commensurate with the CAPEX and operating performance profiles of its portfolio projects.

Consolidated gross debt totaled R$3.5 billion, 32.0% up on 2011, with long-term debt accounting for 96% of the total, versus 77% the year before. The increase was mainly due to funding through loans and debentures for investment in the concessions, including approximately R$450 million for GRU Airport (part of a R$1.2 billion bridge loan from the BNDES); the equivalent of US$570 million for Via Parque Rímac through a project bonds issue and loans from local banks in Nuevos Soles; R$387 million for improvements in the Linha Amarela toll road through a debenture issue; and R$750 million for CART through a CVM 400 debenture issue. Although consolidated gross debt increased to finance the Company’s expansion, net debt fell by 6.3% over 2011 thanks to the increase in cash and cash equivalents.

MetrôRio: fleet expansion through the acquisition of 19 new trains (increasing capacity by 63%, to 49 trains and 294 cars), a new Operations Center, new yards and the construction of Uruguai Station (scheduled for conclusion in the first quarter of 2014). GRU Airport: the airport structure will be expanded and modernized by 2014, including the partial remodeling of Terminals 1 and 2. The main highlights are the beginning of the construction works for Terminal 3, which will be capable of handling around 12 million passengers per year, and a new parking deck with approximately 2,600 parking spaces. Via Parque Rímac: construction of new roads, bridges and viaducts, as well as the diversion of the Rímac River for the construction of a two-kilometer tunnel under the river.

Through the Horizontes Project, SAP was implemented successfully in MetrôRio, the Invepar holding company, the Invepar Institute, LAMSA, CLN, CART, and VPR. The Company is currently studying its implementation in GRU Airport. The SAP platform helps standardize and improve Invepar’s management procedures. It will also permit the installation, in 2013, of the BPC system (Business Planning & Consolidation) for the automatic and precise monitoring of financial and managerial information, thereby ensuring accurate data for making decisions and defining Invepar’s strategies. Invepar 35 Outlook New businesses: Invepar will continue seeking new opportunities, both domestically – at federal, state and Invepar will continue local level – and abroad, always focusing on its operational seeking new opportunities, segments and the creation of value for its shareholders. both domestically – at IPO: Invepar is currently registered with the Brazilian federal, state and local Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) as a category level – and abroad, A corporation and intends to hold an initial public offering of shares, or IPO. With this in mind, it began preparations in always focusing on its 2012. At the end of the first half, it constituted the Investor operational segments and Relations area, with the prime responsibility of planning and coordinating this process. In this context, it is worth noting the creation of value for its that Invepar already has already implemented a corporate shareholders governance model and follows the requirements of the CVM. 36 2012 Annual Report 03 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Governance Profile _37 Governance Structure _38 Ethics and Transparency _39 Stakeholders _40 Communication Plan _47 Invepar 37 Governance Profile Preparation for the IPO Invepar is preparing to go public on the BM&FBOVESPA, strengthening its corporate governance and dialogue with potential investors [GRI 2.6] Invepar is currently a corporation whose shares are not traded on the stock market, but is preparing to hold an IPO shortly. With this in mind, the Company began its preparations in 2012, constituting an Investor Relations area at the end of the first half, with the prime responsibility of planning and coordinating this process. Since then, it has been developing relations with potential investors, through personal meetings, conference calls and other means of communication. It is important to note that Invepar already has a well-advanced corporate governance model in place, whose accountability procedures are in accordance with CVM requirements. Shareholding structure and current corporate structure [GRI 2.9] At the beginning of 2012, Invepar received a capital injection of R$1.3 billion from Petros and Funcef in the proportions of 41.5% and 58.5%, respectively, at the same time as the merger of V.P.R. Brasil Participações S.A. (Via Parque Rímac), which used to belong to the construction company OAS S.A. As a result, as of March 21, 2012, Invepar’s shareholding structure has been broken down as follows: PREVI – 25.56%; FUNCEF – 25.00%; PETROS – 25.00% and Grupo OAS – 24.44%.

In addition to the attributes determined by the Bylaws, the Board of Directors has the power to create advisory committees. Currently, the Finance and Investment, Construction Works, Human Resources & Governance, and Audit Committees are in operation. Unlike many companies, whose Fiscal Councils may function intermittently, Invepar maintains a permanent Council. It also has a Corporate Governance area, which reports to the Board of Executive Officers and is responsible for guiding decision-making processes with shareholders, the Board of Directors and the Fiscal Council. In order to facilitate these activities, the Company has maintained a Governance Portal since 2011, a ground-breaking tool designed to store and centralize all relevant information and documents for those involved in decision making in a single channel, thereby ensuring greater security. Board of Directors The Board of Directors consists of eight sitting members and their respective alternates, all of whom Brazilian citizens and residents, elected and removable by a Shareholders’ Meeting for a two-year mandate, re-election being permitted. The current Board was elected on April 30, 2012. Invepar’s Board of Directors meets two of the best market practices: it consists of at least five members and has a maximum mandate of two years. Its total compensation is fixed on an annual basis by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, which also defines, whenever necessary, Management’s share of the Company’s profits and the benefits they are entitled to, including representation allowances. This Board in turns decides on the apportionment of its compensation and that of the Executive Officers. It is also establishes the Company’s overall business strategy and policy, as well as appointing (and removing) the Executive Officers. It normally meets once a month when called by the Chairman or, in his or her absence, the Vice-Chairman, and on an extraordinary basis whenever called by the Chairman or at least two members. Meetings are held at the Company’s headquarters. See the composition of the Board of Directors at: www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in Invepar governance profile/Governance structure. Board of Executive Officers Invepar’s Board of Executive Officers comprises six members, three of whom elected by the Board of Directors and three executives, whose qualifications are commensurate with their positions. Among other attributes, it is responsible for proposing the fundamental guidelines related to the Company’s objectives and targets to the Board of Directors; ensuring the smooth running of the business in order to meet these objectives; and determining the personnel framework, defining the various positions and their respective salaries, as well as the bonus system and benefits policy. It normally meets on a monthly basis at the Company’s headquarters.

Fiscal Council [GRI 4.1] The Fiscal Council’s role is to oversee the financial situation of a company. At Invepar, this task is undertaken by four sitting members (with an equal number of alternates), each of whom representing one of the shareholders. This body also relies on independent auditors to check the consistency and integrity of its operations. Members are elected for a one-year mandate (from one Annual Shareholders’ Meeting to the next), re-election being permitted. Invepar’s Fiscal Council is a permanent body. See the composition of the Fiscal Council at: www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in Invepar governance profile/Governance structure. Ethics and Transparency Enhanced Ethics Code of Ethics published in 2012 establishes the rules governing Invepar’s conduct in order to maintain its good reputation In 2012, Invepar launched its Code of Ethics, which establishes appropriate standards of behavior in order to protect the Company’s reputation. Applicable to all employees, including the group’s Board and Committee members, Executive Officers, subsidiary officers, staff, interns and third-party workers, its directives are designed to ensure fair and responsible relations with the Company’s main stakeholders (shareholders, employees, users, unions, partners, service providers, government, communities and society in general). The Code was drafted and approved by the Executive Officers and the Board of Directors and an Ethics Committee was constituted to implement, guarantee and maintain the application of its guidelines. The document was launched in all the group’s companies, accompanied by a presentation and discussion. All employees received a copy and signed a term of acknowledgement. New employees are given a copy when they are hired. At the same time, the Company launched a communications channel to handle complaints of misconduct (see chart below). Such complaints are investigated by a committee in order to check their veracity and pass them on to the appropriate authority, if necessary. The channel is also open to contributions and suggestions from employees, for possible incorporation during the Code’s periodic review process.

These issues are reflected in ten principles (see below) derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration of the International Labor Organization on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. Adhering to the Compact was a natural decision given that the Company’s own values match these principles. In addition to the parent company and the Invepar Institute, four of the group’s wholly-owned subsidiaries have also signed up: LAMSA, CLN, CART and MetrôRio. Being a signatory to the initiative strengthens Invepar’s convictions and contributes to its good reputation. Company initiatives embodying the Compact’s principles include: The launch of the Code of Ethics and a communications channel for complaints, in order to ensure that all Invepar members comply with the highest standards of ethical conduct and respect the Company’s values; Principles 1, 2 and 10 The inclusion of clauses relating to compliance with labor laws and the prohibition of child or forced labor in all contractual agreements with suppliers and service providers in 2013; Principles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 Conducting a participatory diagnosis of the environmental situation in surrounding communities; Principles 7, 8, 9 and 10 The constant preparation of employees involved in toll road or subway operations through training and accident simulations; Principles 1 and 2 Support from Invepar group companies in relation to planting activities, environmental education, wildlife conservation, participation on the boards of APAs (environmental protection areas) and the fostering of local sustainable handicrafts, in compliance with the principles of environmental conservation, in accordance with the characteristics of the specific geographic surroundings. Principles 7, 8, 9 and 10 Stakeholders Invepar is completing the mapping of its stakeholders in order to improve its stakeholder relations [GRI 4.14 4.15] In the second half of 2012, Invepar instituted the mapping of its stakeholders, a term used to describe the groups with whom the company interacts on which it has an impact and/or which have an impact on it. Invepar 41 The stakeholder mapping process will give rise to a Strategic Relationship Plan The process included a series of interviews with managers of the Company and its subsidiaries, the results of which will serve as the basis for drawing up a Strategic Relationship Plan, comprising guidelines for short and medium-term proactive initiatives at both the general and specific levels. These results are currently being compiled and should be ready by March 2013. There are many advantages in mapping and understanding the stakeholders of a company. Maintaining an open dialogue is the key to understanding the needs of both parties and designing strategies with a mutual beneficial effect. Even though this process is being concluded now, Invepar is well aware of which stakeholders it interacts with most due to the characteristics of its business, namely users, shareholders, employees, the media, the community, suppliers and service providers, as well as local, state and federal government agencies. The dialogue channels for each stakeholder are listed in the on-line version of this report. (www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in Corporate governance/Stakeholders). Users Invepar serves different users in various segments: passengers, airline companies and drivers, amongst others. Since users have a direct influence on the Company’s financial success, it is absolutely vital to establish a series of communications channels with these stakeholders. The idea is to influence their perception in regard to the services provided, as not only essential to their mobility needs, but also as a mobility enabler ensuring quality connections to other parts of the city or country. In addition to the traditional channels such as emergencies, websites and Contact Us, some companies have also created profiles on the main social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, thereby facilitating communication and interaction with users, especially the younger ones. Another important tool for assessing user perception, both in terms of dialogue with the companies and service quality, are the satisfaction surveys, which were conducted in 2012 by LAMSA, CLN, CART, MetrôRio, CBN and CRT. The final results showed satisfaction levels hovering between Good and Excellent. [GRI PR5] LAMSA [GRI PR5] The company promotes annual user satisfaction surveys, always with the help of research institutes, and also evaluates user perception through dialogue channels such as the Ceru (User Service Center). The survey covers all aspects of the business, including management quality (user service, free services, maintenance and traffic flow), physical aspects (lighting, cleaning, landscaping, paving, roadworks etc.), and environmental performance. Some questions consider toll costs, while others invite comparisons with other roads in the city in terms of user preference and their sense of safety while driving. The process includes on-site face-to-face interviews, as well as by phone, always accompanied by a supervisor and subject to subsequent sample checks. 42 2012 Annual Report In 2012, the company’s overall score was 8.4. These results are presented to managers and disseminated internally and externally, and influence the prioritization of works and actions and the routing of communications efforts. Improving survey indicators is one of the company’s strategic goals. Communications via channels such as Ceru generate Internal Occurrence Bulletins which are distributed to all the areas involved, who reply to the user. At the end of each month, managers receive a statistical report, which is used to improve processes. As an example, following requests from motorcyclists, LAMSA implemented preferential cabins for these users at the toll plaza. CLN [GRI PR5] CLN conducts monthly and annual surveys of BA-099 users. The monthly survey is designed to evaluate user satisfaction with service in case of incidents on the toll road, and contains the following items: Degree of satisfaction with the user support service Degree of satisfaction with the traffic inspection service Degree of satisfaction with towing and medical care services Degree of satisfaction with the emergency and rescue service See the detailed results of the survey at: www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in Corporate governance/ Stakeholders/Users/CLN. In case of dissatisfaction, an internal process is initiated to determine the cause and resolve any problems. Users are subsequently notified of the results. Should the evaluation be positive, it is channeled to the responsible team and the particular employee who provided the service. The annual survey, in turn, is designed to understand the profile of the various users and their habits, as well as assess traffic conditions and the services provided. In this case, a quantitative research technique is applied to personal interviews with private drivers at the toll plaza, related to the following items: Administrative aspects such as user service, support or inspection vehicles, first aid and towing, as well as the toll-free and ombudsman services; Physical aspects such as landscaping, road cleaning, drainage, paving and signage; Image-related aspects such as if the concessionaire is well-equipped, provides useful and important user services, can resolve toll road demands and is socially responsible. The concessionaire’s final score in 2012 was 85.6. In addition to these surveys, CLN maintains a permanent dialogue channel with its users through the ombudsman, which is responsible for correctly routing their complaints within the company. CART [GRI PR5] CART conducts daily user satisfaction surveys, but only with those requesting help from the Call Center after the service has been provided. They are contacted by CART employees or can fill out a form available in the service vehicles. The evaluation is focused on the operational team’s performance. The goal is to survey at least 55% of these users. Invepar 43 In 2012, CART contacted 60.6% of the users who had received service. Of this total, 1,742 replied, of which 1,635 rated service as Excellent, 97 as Good, 4 as Average, and 5 as Poor. CART as a whole is also exceptionally well regarded by users, having received 5 out 5 for all items except “Rapid Attendance”, for which it received 4.8. The survey results are compiled into monthly reports, giving CART an indication of how its service quality is perceived by its users. See the detailed results of the survey at: www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in Corporate governance/ Stakeholders/Users/CART. MetrôRio [GRI PR5] User satisfaction surveys are conducted in March and November of each year, both of which with a sample of 1,000 paying subway users aged 16 or more who answer a questionnaire through which they assess 18 items related to the stations and train cleanliness, car lighting, system safety, and employee and safety team service, among others. An overall system quality score of 0-10 is also requested, which reached 7.5 in 2012. The survey results are routed to the area in question so that MetrôRio can take corrective action. Examples of such initiatives were the more rapid replacement of spent lighting fixtures and the removal of gum stuck to station floors. CBN [GRI PR5] CBN measures satisfaction in three different ways. Firstly, it carries out a quantitative survey with toll road users through personal interviews through which a form is filled out. There is also a qualitative survey which is applied to three different groups – the surrounding community, professional drivers and local business people – who participate in collective interviews which take place in facilities equipped with one-way mirrors and audio and video recording. Finally, occurrence reports are generated via the company’s audit system, via email through ouvidoria@cbnorte.com.br, telephone via + 55 71 3023 6342 and the Contact Us channel at www.cbnorte.com.br/faleconosco. The charts below show the main results of these three surveys, which are used to plan the building consortium’s investment program, to speed up response to users and to develop measures to mitigate potential damage. They also form the basis for the training of the company’s field officers (traffic inspectors, engineers, technicians, security staff, etc.), so that they can properly record and investigate road system occurrences. See the detailed results of the survey at: www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in Corporate governance/ Stakeholders/Users/CBN. 44 2012 Annual Report CRT [GRI PR5] CRT conducts two user surveys, a six-monthly Ibope public opinion survey, and a monthly ANTT (National Ground Transport Agency) survey. The Ibope study is conducted in accordance with ISO 20252:2006 International Quality in Market Research and Opinion and ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management standards, while the ANTT survey follows the guidelines of the Draft Report on Standardization of User Complaints and Suggestions established in October 2011 by the regulatory agency. According to the latest Ibope survey conducted in 2012, 81% of users considered the toll road excellent or good, 87% thought that the road had improved in the last year, 88% considered that CRT was doing a good or excellent job, and 89% felt that the Concessionaire was efficient or highly efficient. The 2012 ANTT survey recorded 1,015 manifestations, only 40 of which were complaints, mostly in regard to works and the conduct of employees or third-party workers, with four occurrences each. The volume of complaints was 12.5% lower than in 2011. The Ibope results are always presented in their entirety to the company’s executive officers and management team, and in summary form to the Board of Directors. The ANTT results are printed and circulated among the managers. In both cases, leaders and their teams assess the most appropriate corrective measures to improve the indicators, in addition to the guidelines issued by the ANTT regarding the results. See the detailed results of the survey at: www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in Corporate governance/ Stakeholders / Users /CRT. CRA As it is still in the pre-operational phase, CRA has no users as yet and therefore does not conduct satisfaction surveys. Shareholders [GRI 4.4] Invepar’s shareholders are currently limited to OAS, Previ, Funcef and Petros. Relations between this group and the Company’s management are handled by the Corporate Governance Department. Since the Company hopes to hold an IPO in the short to medium term, it has also created an Investor Relations area, setting up a platform for communicating with its future shareholders. Learn more about the area’s activities at www.invepar.com.br/ri. Employees The Company closed 2012 with 5,122 employees. Well aware of the importance of each of these employees to the effectiveness of its operations, the Company promotes specific employee communication initiatives, as well as professional development programs. More information on these initiatives can be found in the People Management chapter and the Communications Plan section. Media Materials produced by this group have the potential to reach all of the Company’s other stakeholders – whether through magazines, newspapers, television, radio or other vehicles. Consequently, maintaining good media relations is crucial in terms of publicizing Invepar’s accomplishments and avoiding damage to its image, whether by effectively communicating its positions and arguments or rebutting false reports. Invepar 45 In 2012, the Company created a Corporate Communications area, which established an official Communications Policy and set up an in-house media advisory group fully focused on managing this relationship. The group’s subsidiaries also engage media consultancies for the same purpose. These professionals are a good means of conveying news, furnishing press releases and information and establishing contacts with official spokespersons. The websites of the Holding Company and the subsidiaries are also good sources of information, since they contain news, publications and archived press releases. Invepar is designing a crisis contingency plan to prepare the Company for transparent interaction with the media in the case of episodes such as the bus that caught fire on the Linha Amarela, which tend to be picked up immediately by the press. Communities The profiles of the Company’s surrounding communities vary depending on the region and the type of concession. Regardless of such differences, maintaining good relations with these communities can help mitigate the impact caused by the concessionaire’s arrival and operations. On the one hand, maintaining good relations helps to ensure that people whose lives may be affected by the concessions understand that they are vital to Brazil’s infrastructure and growth. On the other, these communities can benefit from the jobs provided and take advantage of the increased activity stemming from the concessions to develop, thereby generating wealth for the region. They also have access to assistance in expediting this process in the form of social and environmental responsibility initiatives. The Company’s community relations are handled by the Invepar Institute, which uses its own resources or taps into incentive law funding to promote various initiatives. The companies also contribute to these efforts by providing their own programs and keeping the lines of communication open at all times. Find out more about the Invepar Institute at http://www.invepar.com.br/en/pages/instituto-invepar For more details on each group company, go to www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012,Group companies and select the company you want.

That is what makes suppliers and service providers so important to Invepar. Five of the group’s concessionaires (excluding the most recent additions – GRU Airport, Parque Rímac Toll Road and Via Expressa TransOlímpica) have already added clauses related to social and environmental responsibility to their supplier contracts. Hiring criteria will be spelled out in the Supplier Contract Standard, a document based on a survey of the practices of all five companies, as well as studies and consultations with topical and legal experts. The minimum requirements are related to the environment, labor relations and health and safety. The final document is currently in the approval phase and will be published in 2013. 46 2012 Annual Report Government [GRI SO5] This stakeholder group encompasses municipal, state and federal entities, as well as regulators with authority over the group companies in the areas where the Company hopes to expand. The Company currently maintains an Institutional Relations area, which seeks to go beyond the minimal relationship level required to carry out its operations. Much of the attention in terms of this stakeholder has focused on GRU Airport, which Invepar assumed operational control of in November 2012. The partnership with Invepar may prove to be extremely important for the creation of public policies, since infrastructure projects have to be well planned in order to facilitate the nation’s growth. Moreover, in light of the public-private nature of our concessions, we must always ensure that our actions are ethical and promote fruitful relations with the surrounding communities. The group companies pursue the same ideal. CLN has been a member of the Bahia State Committee to Combat Sexual Violence against Children and Teenagers since 2004. In 2012, it helped to plan and to implement the group’s annual initiatives related to the issue, such as the Toll Plaza Carnival Campaign, which included handing out folders and displaying banners and signs. It also participated in initiatives sponsored by the State Prosecutor’s Office. Similarly, MetrôRio is a member of the Brazilian Corporate Volunteers Committee, one of 29 companies engaged in discussing related topics, identifying best practices and promoting coordinated actions to improve legal conditions applicable to volunteer work. In 2012, the company was also involved in Rio+20, a United Nations conference held in June in Rio de Janeiro to discuss the renewal of political commitments to sustainable development. For its part, CRT is a permanent member of the Serra dos Órgãos National Park Advisory Council (Conparnaso), whose aim is to ensure the implementation of and compliance with the objectives behind the creation of the Park, which is traversed by CRT’s toll road. The Concessionaire is also a member of the board of the Brazilian Association of Highway Concessionaires (ABCR), a forum for discussing the sector’s key interests. CART has its own Institutional Relations area, charged with strengthening ties with municipal governments and the São Paulo state government. INVEPAR AT RIO+20 Invepar also participated in this important event, sponsoring the Rio+20 opening reception. The event was attended by President Dilma Roussef, Foreign Relations Minister Antônio Patriota; U.N. Under-Secretary-General Sha Zukang; and the National Secretary for the Rio+20 National Organizing Committee, Laudemar Aguiar. Invepar also participated in a series of discussions with important organizations, including the Brazilian Corporate Council for Sustainable Development (CEBDS); the Ethos Institute; the Institutes, Foundations and Companies group (GIFE) and the government. Among other activities, it supported Rio Como Vamos (Rio as We Go) in establishing mobility indicators, and took part in debates with community leaders on the topic of cities and mobility during the “Nossa Rio+20 A Comunidade que Queremos” (The Community We Want) event, which resulted in the delivery of a document drafted by the community leaders on the biggest challenges facing cities.

Turnover Rate [GRI LA2] Details on the turnover rate of each company are presented in the on-line version of this report (www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in People management/Workforce profile), with the exception of CRA, which is still in the pre-operational phase. Compensation and Benefits In accordance with best market practices, Invepar’s compensation policy is based on the Hay Group’s job evaluation methodology. By applying these techniques, it is possible to structure positions and salaries, allow for mobility between companies, compare salaries with prevailing market rates and provide competitive compensation. Invepar also adopts a bonus system whereby performance is rewarded annually via quantitative and qualitative indicators and clearly-defined and challenging goals. The amounts offered are calculated on the basis of salary multiples established for all levels of the organization. Compensation methods are standardized for the group’s subsidiaries. The Hay Group’s point methodology is used, which involves converting salaries into points and determining the value of each point in different regions. For example, positions in Brazil and Peru have the same number of points on the scale, but actual compensation varies depending on the local market. The methodology is well-known, respected and practiced by major companies throughout the world. There is also a competitive benefit package which is more or less the same for all group companies. Invepar 51 Health, Safety and Quality of Life [GRI LA7 LA8] Health and safety are priority issues for the Company. It therefore complies with all the pertinent labor regulations and adopts prevention programs and initiatives to preserve the health and safety of its employees. The on-line version of this report details each company’s health and safety initiatives and provides information on injury and occupational disease rates, lost days, absenteeism and fatalities in 2012 (www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in People management/Workforce profile). These rates were calculated using International Labor Organization (ILO) formulas. Note: The factor 200,000 is the product of 50 40-hour working weeks and 100 employees. The rates generated using this factor refer to numbers of employees rather than numbers of hours. It should be noted that for the purpose of these calculations, the factor of 200,000 was used, in accordance with GRI guidelines. However, Invepar uses a 48-hour working week. Therefore, its rates are estimated based on the formulas commonly used under this methodology. The Holding Company and CRA do not currently measure these data, the former because of the rare incidence of workplace accidents and its small workforce, and the latter because it is not yet operational. Competency-Based Management INVEPAR COMPETENCIES Invepar Competencies Learn about the strategic professional skills most valued by Invepar and Leadership how they contribute to the Company’s advancement Team spirit One of the greatest challenges for a growing organization is training its employees so that they can keep pace with corporate growth. Communication With a view to facilitating this process, Invepar has defined a set of strategic competencies, i.e. skills required to develop the Company’s Agent of change professionals and ensure compliance with its Mission and goals. Focus on the customer In all, nine strategic competencies and one metric have been defined for the management of all Invepar group companies. These aptitudes Innovation/entrepreneurship are applicable at all levels of the organization, guiding identification of potential talent by the Careers and Succession Committee. Commitment One of the Committee’s essential tools is performance assessment, Focus on results which has been conducted annually since 2011. The outcome of this process is used to define the Company’s Succession Map in Corporate relations a process involving all managers – including those of the group’s companies – right up to Invepar CEO level. Being aware of and ensuring internal succession helps to strengthen and maintain the Invepar culture. 52 2012 Annual Report Professional Development Based on its competencies, Invepar promotes initiatives to attract, train and develop talent in order to ensure that its professionals are capable of putting Company growth strategies into practice. Examples include the Trainee and Leadership Development Programs and the Management Meeting. These initiatives are corporate in nature, i.e. applied at all levels, from trainees up to top management. Although the target audience and format may differ, all offer the same basic element: the opportunity to develop with the Company. More details follow below. Trainee Program The second cycle of this biannual program began in 2012. A total of 18 trainees were selected, three of which allocated to headquarters and 15 to the group’s companies. All are young professionals recent graduates in Engineering, Economics and Business Administration, selected through a rigorous process from no fewer than 4,808 candidates. For 14 months, they will take part in a number of activities to promote their professional development in line with Invepar’s culture and competencies. As part of the program they will visit all group companies, operating in the areas for which they were selected and attending training sessions. At the end of the process, they may be granted full employment status, depending on their performance, in the operational, new business or finance areas. Leadership Development Program Those occupying leadership positions participate in a specific program, delivered in conjunction with the Fundação Dom Cabral, one of the most renowned executive development centers in Brazil, with 36 years of experience. Activities are also aimed at developing Invepar competencies, and involve specialists and top executives from the Holding Company and the group’s companies. The 2012 program consisted of three modules and focused on innovation, strategic vision, business finance and user management, while the 2013 priorities will be people management, corporate relations and project administration. Management Meeting This initiative, developed and run by the Human Resources and Management Department since 2010, consists of a sixmonthly gathering of Company leaders (supervisors, managers, senior managers and executives) to discuss market and global prospects and opportunities. The aim of the meeting is to encourage synergies and enable the alignment of leadership visions and strategies, as well as team engagement and interaction, in addition to the sharing of experience and best practices. It was at one of these events that the Company’s Mission, Vision and Values were created. The first meeting in 2012 took place in August, and the second in December, covering such issues as the new concessions, the future of the Company and its new brand identity, as well as results and prospects.

In the short term, Invepar intends to extend performance assessment to all hierarchical levels in order to encompass operational jobs. To this end, the current analysis model may migrate to a 180-degree format, including self-assessment and evaluation by the employee’s immediate superior with subsequent feedback. Such changes are strategic and are aimed at enhancing the focus on initiatives and competencies required for the development of Company professionals. Invepar also intends to establish a corporate university throughout 2013 and 2014 – the Human Resources department is currently working on the ideal curriculum in order to ensure a sound qualification program that is totally geared to the Company’s business and profile. Invepar 55 Organizational Climate 2012 Survey The first Invepar corporate satisfaction survey leads to the preparation of an improvement action plan. Commitment to the Company is the positive highlight In January 2012, Invepar conducted its first Organizational Climate Survey, measuring staff motivation and satisfaction across various aspects of professional life at the Company, including issues such as quality of life, professional development, relations with management and colleagues, communications and community relations. Of the 3,474 employees consulted, 2,612 answered the survey. Employees from the Holding Company, CART, LAMSA, MetrôRio and CLN took part in the survey. The average satisfaction ratio, covering topics such as people, work processes, leadership, institutional matters, corporate communications, empowerment and compensation, was 59%. Empowerment and compensation, both of which scored 45%, required the most improvement, while commitment, with 84%, scored best, indicating a strong sense of belonging within the group – one of the targets addressed by the HR department in recent years. The survey led to the drawing up of action plans in each of the companies in line with their respective results, involving such issues as the leader/staff relations, leadership feedback-giving skills and the pursuit of shorter working hours, among others.

The results generated an action plan for each company. Social and environmental responsibility has been an integral part of Invepar’s strategy since 2011, supported by the Board of Directors and the Board of Executive Officers, underlining the Company’s degree of commitment to the issue. Invepar believes that managing its impacts on society and the environment is essential in creating an environment in which business can move forward while respecting all parties. With this in mind, it has developed a number of initiatives in this vein, detailed below.

Learn morre about the Ethos Indicators at http://www3.ethos.org.br/conteudo/iniciativas/indicadores/ Social and Environmental Responsibility Invepar Institute This organization is a vehicle for Invepar’s community actions. It focuses on education, the environment, culture and sports, with support for public administration and entrepreneurship as transverse themes. Owing to the nature of its business, Invepar has an impact on its concessions’ surrounding communities. Given their public nature, these concessions require a matching contribution which, in the developing countries at least, transcends the provision of good services and includes social and environmental development. Since 2002, these initiatives have been managed by the Invepar Institute which, in line with its Social and Environmental Responsibility Policy, focuses on three key areas for the development and improvement of impacted areas: education, culture and sport, and the environment, with support for public administration and entrepreneurship as transverse themes. Invepar 59 SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY POLICY “Through its institute, Invepar formulates its social responsibility principles and guidelines and articulates such actions in line with Company values, generating social, economic and environmental benefits in its surrounding communities and in society as a whole.” Guidelines Social and environmental responsibility is a firm Invepar commitment, inherent to the way its companies operate, which is guided by the Invepar Institute through specific standards and procedures. Social and environmental responsibility at Invepar is a recognized and valued competency to be applied at all levels. The Invepar Institute has a duty to provide technical support for the group’s companies, promoting opportunities and guidelines, clarifying and encouraging internal and external social actions and initiatives. An understanding of the social, economic and environmental situation in Invepar’s areas of operation and the companies’ effective participation in the socio-territorial dynamic is imperative. Expansion of the Company’s capacity for social and environmental action through partnerships with other companies and public or private institutions operating in the region. 60 2012 Annual Report Examples of such initiatives: [GRI EC9] Social and environmental pre-diagnosis in the Company’s operational regions; Raising public and private resources in the social and economic area aiming to set up local social networks; Identification of local talent and vocations to enhance social capital in the area; Establishing an emergency action plan to meet the demands of communities impacted during the implementation period of new businesses; Sustainable community land-development projects implemented through participatory methods; Sustainable management through which the Institute advises group companies on commitment to UN Millennium Goals and Global Compact principles.

Respect Innovation Invepar 61 NEW DEPARTMENT AND COMMITTEES In 2012, Invepar was strengthened by the addition of the Corporate Social Responsibility Executive Department, whose aim is to ensure that social responsibility management is more aligned with the concept of sustainability, in which social, economic and environmental performance play an equal role in ensuring the Company’s longevity. The Company also receives support from the Social Responsibility Committee at corporate level, and Internal Social Responsibility Committees within each group company. Representatives from both bodies maintain constant contact to exchange information and experience, plan actions and jointly define strategies, targets and objectives. These committees normally include managers from the Human Resources, Corporate Governance, Communications, Procurement and HSE departments. Investments The Institute formulates its financial planning based on the local diagnosis of group companies and business compliance. Operating expenses are met by the companies on an apportionment basis, using the previous budget as a reference, and proportional to the projects to be executed. Resources are also obtained through partnerships with other companies, associations and foundations. Further project financing comes from the companies’ own resources through the FIA (Children’s and Teenagers Fund) and the Rouanet Law, ISS (service tax) and Sports Laws. In 2012, R$5.2 million was invested in social and environmental projects, R$1.8 million of which from the companies’ own funds, R$2.2 million from incentives and R$1.2 million from third-party funding. A total of 130,000 people benefited directly from these projects, while indirect beneficiaries came to 600,000. Communications initiatives reached an estimated audience of 2.5 million.

The document specified criteria enabling cross-referencing of the Institute’s areas of focus with the impacts each candidate project may have on operations. The rules apply to the selection of initiatives for CART, CLN, CBN, LAMSA and MetrôRio. The aim was to render the Institute’s operation more strategic, transparent and standardized while supporting projects aligned to group company community relations which contribute to the development of surrounding communities, generating synergies between the results and the companies’ presence in the region in a more efficient manner. Proposals for three areas – education, the environment, and culture and sport – will be analyzed. Education projects should be related to safety and the preservation of life, entrepreneurship, community management and projects, associativism and preparations for a solidarity-based economy, while environment projects should focus on education, selective waste collection, recycling and reforestation. In the culture and sports area, priority will be given to projects benefiting from federal and municipal incentive laws that combine social benefits with the respective cultural and sporting activities. In addition to these characteristics, the proposals should have support for public administration and entrepreneurship as transverse themes. The Notice received 215 proposals, all of which assessed by a Technical Committee. Approved projects will receive up to R$0.1 million per year and will run for between 12 and 24 months in the municipalities around LAMSA, CLN, MetrôRio, CART and CBN. Supported Projects The Invepar Institute underlines its support for public administration by partnering in projects of major social importance.

Invepar 63 Environmental Management The environment in focus Invepar’s main environmental initiatives Invepar’s concessions are in full accordance with the environmental laws and guidelines set forth for each type of undertaking. The Company’s concern, however, is not limited to direct impacts, but also includes indirect effects related to energy and water consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and waste generation, among others. Although there is still much work to be done in regard to understanding and mitigating these impacts, the Company has already taken several important steps in this direction. The survey of the Ethos Indicators, together with those of the GRI (see more on pages 57 and 96), will also serve as a benchmark for the implementation of new environmental initiatives or the improvement of existing ones. It is worth mentioning that each Invepar company develops its own initiatives in line with its specific activities. Accordingly, each one is at a different development stage and is therefore focusing its efforts on distinct areas. CART, CRT and CLN adopt initiatives to decrease energy consumption Energy Consumption [GRI EN3 EN4 EN5] In 2012, Invepar’s consumption of direct energy from non-renewable sources totaled 26,163.70 GJ of gasoline (with and without additives) and diesel and 189,04 tonnes of LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), direct energy being defined as that which is purchased or produced by the Company itself, whether or not from renewable sources, and is mainly used in its operations. The fuels mentioned above are chiefly used by service and emergency medical assistance vehicles, as well as generators. The amounts exclude LAMSA, CLN and CART, which calculate their consumption in liters. If these are added, the gasoline and diesel total came to 746,773.30 GJ. Fuel use was the same as for the other companies, although CART’s figures also include the São Francisco toll road rescue service fleet. The Holding Company, which is based in a commercial building in Rio de Janeiro managed by third-parties and only houses administrative areas, was also excluded from the calculations, as was CRA, which is still in the pre-operational phase. 64 2012 Annual Report Consumption from renewable sources on the other hand, totaled 134,100.92 liters of ethanol. CRT also uses solar energy for its toll road emergency call boxes and weather stations. In the call boxes, this source feeds 50-watt panels in poorly-lit areas and 10-watt panels in better-lit areas. A weather station was recently installed on the highest peak in the Serra dos Órgãos in Teresópolis (RJ), which contains two solar panels of 130 watts each. In relation to indirect energy, i.e. energy produced outside the Company, consumption came to 27,097,103.45 GJ (CRA’s figures are for office consumption only and exclude the works). The Holding Company uses hydroelectric energy – a renewable source – acquired from power concessionaires. Among the Invepar companies, CART, CRT and CLN have adopted measures to reduce their energy consumption. In 2012, CART recorded a 1% decline in consumption in its toll plazas, equivalent to R$9,700. The result was negligible because basically it was a case of maintaining the hefty 20% reduction achieved in 2010 thanks to improvements to the plazas’ air-conditioning system, which is CART’s most costly item. The number of projectors was also diminished in order to improve the operation of refrigerating systems. In annual terms, this decline represents the monthly consumption of a city of around 18,000 inhabitants, eliminating the use of 13 million m³ of water in the hydroelectric plant. CLN and CRT also introduced changes in their toll plaza. The former saved 153 kW per day due to lighting rationalization in days of relatively low traffic, as well as 2,300 kW per month by substituting compact fluorescent lamps for mercury vapor lamps, and a further 20% by changing air conditioning devices from the window to the split type. CRT replaced 30 400-watt metal vapor lamps with more economical LED versions. One hundred 40-watt fluorescent lamps were also replaced by 18-watt LED lamps. However, there has been no significant reduction in power consumption to date. Direct energy consumption in 2012 [GRI EN3] Non-renewable sources* Gasoline 10,172.50 GJ Gasoline with additives 454.59 GJ Diesel 15,531.61 GJ LPG 189.04 T Gasoline (LAMSA, CLN and CART) 309,164.61 L Gasoline with additives 523.37 L Diesel (LAMSA, CLN and CART) 437,085.32 L Renewable source Ethanol 134,100.92 L * Excludes CRA, which is in the pre-operational phase, and the Holding Company, which is based in a commercial building managed by third-parties and comprises administrative areas only. Invepar 65 Water Consumption [GRI EN8 EN10] Invepar’s water consumption totaled 198,996.40 m3 in 2012, excluding CRA, still in the pre-operational phase, and the Holding Company, whose consumption is controlled by the manager of the commercial building where it is headquartered. The origin of the water varies from company to company. LAMSA and MetrôRio use municipallysupplied water only; CLN and CBN also use water from this source, but supplemented by groundwater; CRT only uses groundwater; and CART uses ground and surface water. Monitored data generally refer to consumption at headquarters, toll plazas and call centers, among others. Water consumption in 2012 (in m3/year) [GRI EN8]* Surface water Groundwater Municipal supply LAMSA 7,526.0 CLN 1,200.0 1,800.0 CART 1,473.0 3,255.0 MetrôRio 159,393.4 CBN 4,202.0 2,354.0 CRT 17,957.0 Total 1,473.0 26,614.0 170,909.4 Total Invepar 198,996.4 * Excluding CRA, still in the pre-operational phase, and the Holding Company, whose consumption is controlled by the manager of the commercial building where it is headquartered. None of Invepar’s companies, including the Holding Company, have water recycling or reuse systems. MetrôRio, however, is implementing three water treatment stations to handle industrial wastewater, sewage and water for reuse, all of which are expected to be operational by January 2013. 66 2012 Annual Report Water disposal [GRI EN21] LAMSA, CLN, CBN and CRA do not control water disposal in their installations and operations. In 2012, CART discharged 3,385.00 m³, 441.00 m³ of which was treated in a septic tank and 2,944.00 m³ discharged into the municipal sewage treatment system. This company does not discharge process water. Of the 17,957.00 m3 of water withdrawn from wells by CRT in 2012, 15,263.50 m³ were discharged after sump filter treatment, including domestic sewage (the company does not have separate control over different types of waste). The remaining 2,693.50 m³ were used without prior treatment for gardening purposes and to supply water-tankers for general and accident-related toll road cleaning and the fighting of small fires. CRT uses a sump filter system for wastewater treatment and does not use process water. At MetrôRio, water generated in Maintenance Center processes is sent to an industrial waste treatment station, where it undergoes physical, chemical and biological treatment. In 2012, treated flow reached 10,828.21 m3, 594.00 m³ of which were discharged. In order to reduce this amount, the company is implementing industrial waste, sewage and water treatment stations for reuse which should be ready by the end of January.

Biodiversity [GRI EN15] Five group companies have operations or installations in areas of protected biodiversity – CLN, CART, CRT, CBN and Via Parque Rímac, all of which, except for CBN, adapt their actions to the needs of local flora and fauna. CLN’s toll road, the BA-099, crosses areas of Atlantic Forest and restinga (typical sandy coastal vegetation). Based on lists prepared by the Ministry of the Environment and on the Red List published by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IULCN), the Concessionaire has mapped and monitors all species of flora and fauna threatened with extinction. All in all, there are seven threatened species in accordance with the first list and five vulnerable species in accordance with the second. The three toll roads making up the Raposo Tavares Corridor (SP-225, SP-327 and SP-270) are located on the Bauru – Ourinhos Presidente Epitácio corridor where it crosses the Atlantic Forest and the savanna region. Based on IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) reports for Birds (2005); Mammals, Reptiles and Amphibians (2006); and Insects and Other Invertebrates (2007), CART has mapped and monitors fauna species in its operational area threatened with extinction, which total 23. Initiatives for preserving these species include a series of projects to reduce accidents involving wildlife, such as the implementation of animal trails and the adaptation of existing ones. In 2012, in partnership with an NGO, CART inaugurated a song-bird nursery to protect species in the areas surrounding the toll road. Invepar 67 CRT manages the stretch between kilometers 2.1 and 144.6 of the BR-116/RJ toll road, which crosses the Serra dos Órgãos State Park (Parnaso), in the Serra de Teresópolis region, bordering the Três Picos State Park. Aiming to protect wildlife, the company has been running the Fauna Viva (Live Wildlife) Project, in partnership with Parnaso, since 2008. This initiative seeks to monitor wild animals found on the BR-116/RJ, run over or not, in order to plan and execute strategies to help reduce such incidents, such as the implementation of devices that allow animals to cross safely, including overhead and underground trails, among others. The IUCN Red List and the list prepared by the CBRO (Brazilian Ornithological Records Committee) were used as a reference. No species were found to be threatened with extinction. In relation to flora, there is still no survey of plant species around the BR-116/RJ. Accordingly, the species described in MMA Instruction 6 of September 23, 2008 were adopted for analysis, using occurrences in areas of Rio de Janeiro state that are similar to those surrounding the toll road as a basis. Therefore, the plants identified are not necessarily present in the region, but were considered in the survey because they appear in similar ecosystems. IUCN Red List indicators were also applied, as well as others such as those prepared by the NGO Biodiversitas and National Flora Conservation Center. Several species were found to be threatened with extinction. The IUCN Red List was also used by Via Parque Rímac, which found only one threatened Peruvian forest species – Acacia macracantha, which is classified as near threatened. This plant is found on the banks of the Rímac River, which is adjacent to the toll road, between the Rímac district and the outskirts of Lima. No threatened fauna species are recorded by the IUCN list or any other national conservation list. More details on the species involved and their status can be found at www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in Social and environmental performance/ Social and environmental responsibility. 68 2012 Annual Report Emissions LAMSA, CLN and CBN all conducted carbon emission inventories in 2012, LAMSA for the second time and CLN and CBN for the first time. MetrôRio also conducted an inventory in 2012, but using 2011’s emissions as a reference. They all applied GHG Protocol methodology, which is recognized worldwide. This procedure is being gradually introduced into all the group companies and the results will be disclosed as soon as the process is mature. Waste [GRI EN22] Each Invepar company decides on – and is responsible for – the disposal of its own waste Invepar’s companies generate different types of waste, in accordance with their specific characteristics. Waste may result directly from operations or indirectly, as in the case of accidents on toll roads. Together, the companies generated 93.68 tonnes of hazardous waste in 2012 (excluding 25,949 lamps by CART and MetrôRio) and 177,952.00 tonnes of non-hazardous material. The methods of waste disposal are presented in the charts below together with the respective data limitations. Invepar 69 Each company determines and is responsible for its own waste disposal method. Non-hazardous waste generated by LAMSA in 2012 was disposed of by third parties in landfills. The company does not know if this waste was treated, nor does it have any information on the disposal of used lamps, which is hazardous waste collected by third parties. CART’s waste was also disposed of by other companies and it is currently seeking new decontamination, co-processing and contaminated waste bioremediation technologies. MetrôRio also resorts to outsourcing, working only with companies registered by Inea (Rio de Janeiro State Environmental Institute). CBN’s non-hazardous waste was disposed of in landfills or incinerated and its hazardous waste was disposed of by third parties. CRT calculated its hazardous and non-hazardous waste but did not specify disposal methods. Waste generation is not currently controlled by CLN, CRA or the Holding Company.

Extending concern for traffic for 20 kilometers, it connects neighborhoods and shortens travel times, facilitating the revitalization of a significant portion of the city’s North Zone, fluidity and user now home to number of commercial and residential developments. Today, safety, the Rio de this toll road alone links the Barra da Tijuca and Baixada de Jacarepaguá Janeiro municipal regions to the Água Santa, Encantado, Méier, Engenho de Dentro, Abolição, Pilares, Del Castilho, Inhaúma, Manguinhos, Higienópolis, Bonsucesso government and Fundão neighborhoods. It also gives access to some of the city’s most extended its important transport terminals and thoroughfares, including the subway system, the central rail network, the Linha Auxiliar, the Linha Leopoldina, the concession Linha Vermelha, Avenida Brasil, Avenida Dom Helder Câmara and Avenida agreement for a Ayrton Senna. In 2012, approximately 49 million vehicles passed through the Linha Amarela toll plaza, attesting to its importance as one of Rio’s main further 15 years metropolitan toll roads. Users have access to a number of free services, including S.O.S. Reboque (a tow truck service), S.O.S. Médico, Toll Road Inspections, a toll-free 0800 phone number for immediate accident and breakdown assistance, and a closedcircuit TV system with 51 cameras that broadcast images 24 hours a day to the Operational Control Center. They can also drive directly through the toll plaza using the Passe Expresso system (see more on page 21). [GRI 2.2] The concession contract, signed in 1997 between the Rio de Janeiro municipal government and LAMSA, was set to expire in 2022 but was extended in May 2010 for an additional 15 years (through 2037). This decision was based on LAMSA’s constant concern for ensuring smooth traffic flows and the safety of its users as traffic increased. Examples of this concern include the reverse lane that operates on business days in the Fundão direction, allowing for operators to change its direction at certain times and, more recently, the new electronic payment stations installed in the middle of the toll road. In consideration of the contract extension, the Concessionaire has completed an investment plan totaling R$251 million. LAMSA promotes development around its route, not only through direct investments but also by creating jobs and promoting social and environmental responsibility initiatives. The company currently employs 412 people directly and 290 indirectly.

The projects, which were initiated in 2010, included renovations to the stretch between the University Hospital and the overpass spanning Avenida Brasil, the duplication and resizing of the Ayrton Senna drainage network (the stretch across from Vila do Pan), the installation of bus bays along Avenida Brasil and Avenida Ayrton Senna in Gardênia, duplication of the Manguinhos overpass, the widening of Avenida Bento Ribeiro Dantas and construction of the Abolição overpass. These improvements helped to ease traffic flows in the affected neighborhoods and along the toll road in general. Investments and projects in 2012 included paving repairs on several stretches of the toll road, the dredging and cleaning of rivers and canals, slope retention, enhanced vertical and horizontal signage, maintenance of the closed-circuit TV system (video cameras deployed along the route), consolidation of the reversible lane operations, the installation of two central pay stations featuring automatic vehicle identification in the Fundão direction, the addition of special signage in the tunnels, and the acquisition of equipment and vehicles. These investments had a direct effect on user satisfaction, according to the results of the most recent survey (see page 41 for details), complementing the initiatives developed over the past few years to improve the toll road, particularly in regard to personnel and process management, communications, user relations, technological modernization, engineering, toll collection, and toll road operations. Also in 2012, the basic toll tariff for cars, vans and two-axle trucks was increased from R$4.30 to R$4.70 in line with the annual variation in the IPCA-E consumer price index, as determined in the concession contract. The other tariffs were also adjusted, raising overall revenue by an estimated R$19 million. LAMSA has been preparing to face the following challenges in 2013: Mitigating the impact of the Transcarioca Toll Road construction works on traffic flow and toll revenue; Improving toll plaza traffic flow through increased use of the automatic lanes; Enhancing recognition of the company’s image and service quality, as measured through user satisfaction surveys; Streamlining of management through process modernization and the development of human and technological resources.

[GRI PR2 PR9] CLN Profile of CLN The BA-099 has become consolidated as a highCLN (Concessionária Litoral Norte) manages the BA-099 toll road, which consists of the Estrada de Coco / Linha quality, comfortable and safe Verde system, connecting the city of Lauro de Freitas to toll road, in addition to being the Bahia state border with Sergipe in the north. Extending an important agent for the for 217 kilometers, it runs through a beach-based tourism region. It has just one toll plaza, in Camaçari. region’s social and economic development Invepar 75 CLN maintains several 24-hour services, including accident rescue and first aid, towing, call boxes (emergency phones at two-kilometer intervals), animal control, fire-fighting, User Assistance Service centers, a baby changing facility (at the company’s headquarters), toll road inspections, and toll-free 0800 assistance (0800 071 3233). Since the 35-year concession period began, the BA-099 has become consolidated as a high-quality, comfortable and safe toll road and an important driver of social and economic development in the region. Its excellent state of conservation encourages private enterprise to invest in large-scale developments, particularly in hotels and other real estate projects. To give an idea of the Concessionaire’s economic impact on the region, it employs a total of 296 people, 168 directly and 128 indirectly. In 2012, it generated R$35.33 million in direct economic value, R$7.5 million of which was used to pay employees’ salaries and benefits and R$393,360 was invested in the community.

Over the past seven years, many motorists had used the route to bypass the plaza, which reduced the flow of vehicles in one direction, thus disrupting the concession contract. After the detour was closed, a portion of the revenue was recovered, allowing the Concessionaire to resume certain investments, including widening the toll plaza to install automatic lanes. Community In 2012, with the support of the Invepar Institute, CLN carried out several projects aimed at benefiting the communities along the BA-099, in the municipalities of Jandaíra, Conde, Esplanada, Entre Rios, Mata de São João and Camaçari, especially in the educational, entrepreneurship and environmental areas. These initiatives contributed to local development, promoted small and micro businesses, and strengthened community activities involving such issues as quality of life, education, traffic, and the environment. They also promoted solidarity and citizenship. In an effort to strengthen its involvement in this area, in 2012 CLN established the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee, whose objective is to implement actions contained in the Continuous Improvement Plan, which was created based on an assessment of the Ethos Corporate Social Responsibility Indicators.

CART CART will invest R$2.22 billion in works along its toll road corridor during the 30 years of the concession Invepar 77 Profile of CART Since 2009, CART (Concessionária Auto Raposo Tavares) has controlled the Raposo Tavares Corridor, responsible for maintaining and improving a 444-kilometer stretch of toll roads and municipal access ways in a stretch that includes Bauru, Ourinhos and Presidente Epitácio, in the state of São Paulo. It also provides first-aid, mechanical, and support services to users though its User Assistance Service centers, which are available at various points along the toll road. The concession is for 30 years, during which CART will invest R$2.22 billion to maintain and improve the toll road, R$1.81 billion of which during a seven year-span through 2016. CART, which is headquartered in Bauru and maintains administrative offices in Assis, Presidente Prudente and São Paulo, currently generates 2,698 jobs, 622 of which direct and 2,076 indirect. In 2012, the company generated R$408.43 million in direct economic value, R$30.67 million of which was used to pay employees’ salaries and benefits and R$171,000 was invested in the communities. (R$ thousand) Direct economic value generated [GRI EC1] Revenue 408,428.00 Economic value distributed 299,598.00 Operating costs 167,855.00 Employee salaries and benefits 30,667.00 Payments to capital providers 89,534.00 Payments to government 11,371.00 Investments in the community 171.00 Economic value accumulated 108.830,00 Management At the beginning of 2012, CART’s management system received ISO 14001 certification for compliance with environmental management criteria and OHSAS 18001 certification for meeting occupational health and safety standards. Both achievements reflect the progress of the Integrated Management System, which had already attained ISO 9001 certification, which sets guidelines for quality management, from Fundação Carlos Alberto Vanzolini in January 2011. ISO 14001:2008 establishes requirements for managing all of an organization’s environmental aspects and impacts, as well as the laws applicable to the business, and promotes awareness among all employees with respect to controlling potentially polluting activities, such as waste generation, CO2 emissions, wastewater generation, emergency situations, and other related issues. Basic workplace health and safety conditions under the OHSAS 18001:2007 standard imply the management of activities that may result in danger or risk to workers and the establishment of operational controls consistent with the laws applicable to the business in order to mitigate said risks. In addition to all their environmental and health and safety benefits, both certifications also require preventive measures and therefore help mitigate risks that are inherent to the business, such as possible fines and penalties for not observing environmental and labor laws, which are important factors for market consolidation. 78 2012 Annual Report Business In January 2012, CART completed readjustment of the km 32+400 (Type 1) safety device on the SP-327 toll road (Orlando Quagliato), in the city of Ourinhos, thereby improving safety and toll road access for users of the Raposo Tavares Corridor and residents of the surrounding communities. Also on the SP-327, CART duplicated the stretch from km 31+433 to km 32+433, where it built two 30-meter-long overpasses, installed a drainage system and safety devices on the right of way, completed paving work, and installed horizontal and vertical signage. CART’s investment in the project totaled R$3.69 million, R$2.05 million of which in the duplication and R$1.64 million in the device. CART will invest approximately R$2.22 billion over 30 years on projects that will bring the Raposo Tavares Corridor up to the same high standards as the best toll roads in São Paulo state, R$1.81 billion of which by 2016. The first phase of the duplication of the SP-225 (João Baptista Cabral Rennó) involves laying a new two-lane stretch in Bauru, adjacent to the existing toll road. A raised median, shoulder, and run-off system will also be put into place. During the second phase, the remainder of the SP-225 will be duplicated (km 242+230 to km 298+900). Work is scheduled to begin in 2013, with conclusion in 2016. User Services In 2012, CART implemented an innovative system to speed up the location of users calling from emergency phones (0800 773 0090). Identification labels were placed on each of the toll road’s 8,553 signs, so users who are unsure of their exact location only have to report the number, allowing the 0800 dispatcher to use a database to pinpoint the toll road, kilometer, and direction of the motorist, thereby speeding up the arrival of the requested service. In 2012, CART also inaugurated another permanent User Assistance Service center (SAU) in the Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo region, bringing the total to 10. These centers serve as bases for the medical and breakdown assistance vehicles and teams and are also equipped with bathrooms, baby changing stations, water, coffee, and face-to-face user service areas. Invepar 79 The centers are strategically distributed along the route, at an average interval of 32 kilometers, which helps ensure a responsive service. The Raposo Tavares Corridor has 12 SAUs, 10 of which permanent and two provisional.

For more details on the concessionaire’s main environmental preservation projects, see www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in Group companies/CART. 80 2012 Annual Report Safety CART’s constant concern for the health and safety of its users is embodied by its services, related research, ideals and campaigns. Initiatives that stand out in this regard include the Concessionaire’s toll road operations, initiatives pertaining to the Accident Reduction Program, improvements to toll road infrastructure, user satisfaction surveys that also address these issues, reporting relevant information regarding its actions to print and on-line media vehicles, and ongoing assessment of these efforts. The purpose of all these efforts is to reduce the number of accidents and, as a result, the number of fatalities. This ratio fell from 5.21 prior to the concession to 4.00 in the first year of CART’s operations and closed 2012 at 3.17. The company was not cited for non-compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to the provision and use of products and services, nor did it receive any significant fines in this regard. For more details on the concessionaire’s safety-related initiatives, see www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in Group companies/CART. Awards and Recognition [GRI 2.10] In 2012, CART received the Ecology medal from the Brazilian Society of Heraldry and Humanities – recognized by the São Paulo State Federation of Industries (Fiesp) – with an honorable mention for the implementation of its Environmental Management System based on ISO 14001:2004 standards. The company was also among the recipients of the 2012 Banas National Management Award, in the Quality and Sustainable Development categories, receiving Gold recognitions for its Quality Management methods. CART was also included in Época Negócios magazine’s 2012 Anuário 360 ranking of the 200 best companies. The company was ranked in four of the six areas evaluated in the infrastructure segment, being placed second in Innovation, fourth in Social and Environmental Responsibility, second in Vision for the Future, and third in Human Resources.

The key changes included value discipline geared to operational excellence and the incorporation and expansion of certain strategic areas, such as Risk Management, Quality of Life, Corporate Satisfaction and Mega Events, among others. Business MetrôRio’s main business events in 2012 are listed below. New MetrôRio trains MetrôRio will roll out seven new trains in the first quarter of 2013, bringing the total to 19, representing a 63% increase in the fleet*. The Concessionaire invested R$ 320 million in the purchase of these trains, which are being assembled by Changchun Railway Vehicles, which has produced trains for subway systems in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Saudi Arabia and China. Funds are sourced from a R$1.15 billion package to be invested in system improvements. As a direct result of the higher number of trains, intervals between trains will fall from six to four minutes on the main line and from three to two minutes on the shared line section (Central/Botafogo). MetrôRio currently carries an average of 700,000 passengers on business days, which should increase to 1.1 million as of 2014 with the arrival of the new trains. Changchun Railway Vehicles, which also has bullet-train technology, has produced a model that is fully adapted to the operational and climatic conditions of the Rio de Janeiro subway, following almost a year of studies and planning. The new trains were prepared for surface operations, with a 33% more potent air-conditioning system, giving an ambient temperature of 23°C. Among other state-of-the-art items, the trains are equipped with passages between cars and security cameras. Line 2 users will be the main beneficiaries. In April 2012, a group of journalists from key communication vehicles in Rio de Janeiro traveled to China to see the trains being assembled at Changchun Railway Vehicles. A month prior to the operational start-up of the first new train, the company’s Maintenance Center was the venue for a reception for the press, bloggers and social media users, during which MetrôRio engineers and technicians explained the new technologies and improvements. * In March 2013, all 19 trains were effectively in operation. Invepar 83 The inaugural journey of the first new train took place on August 24 at 9 a.m., starting at Estácio and proceeding to Maracanã, where a publicity event and press conference was held with Invepar CEO Gustavo Rocha and MetrôRio CEO Flávio Almada, as well as Rio State Governor Sergio Cabral and other high-ranking officials. The train then continued to Pavuna. Normal operations began on the following day. Before the trains became operational, the Concessionaire had to face several challenges, including the timeframe between fabrication and effective delivery, which lasted for 30 months, and media questions regarding the size of the trains in relation to current rolling stock and platforms. All questions were answered by the Concessionaire, which carried out preventive adjustments to certain platforms to meet the manufacturer’s specifications in regard to the gap between train and platform, which has to be a minimum of nine centimeters to ensure the safety and reliability of the subway system. The height of the cars in relation to platforms was duly projected and was within the permitted tolerances. New card for integration with the bus system Beginning in July, MetrôRio, in partnership with Fetranspor and RioCard, implemented electronic ticketing on lines which connect up with the bus system (14 lines and seven stations). The idea behind the change is to prevent fraud and is the result of collaboration between the Concessionaire and RioCard to find a fraud-prevention solution and optimize the purchasing process. The new cards are sold exclusively on buses, are scanned at integration-equipped stations, and have a two-hour maximum integration period. No changes have been made to ticketing in the express metro-bus system.

Gastronomia Solidária (Solidarity Gastronomy) Uma Janela para o Futuro (A Window on the Future) Jiu-jitsu Vôlei em Rede (Volleyball Network) 84 2012 Annual Report Environment [GRI EN26 EN28] Given its location in a densely-populated urban conurbation, MetrôRio’s operations have little environmental impact. Nevertheless, the company still promotes environmental preservation through educational and awareness-raising projects. The Concessionaire created a group to identify opportunities for reducing energy consumption and maintains creative groups to encourage the conscientious use of water and the reduction of waste in offices and by users. Treatment of effluents is another area closely managed by the company. Currently, effluents generated by the maintenance process are sent to a specialized company for physical, chemical and biological treatment, but the company is looking to do this in-house and is therefore implementing an effluent treatment-for-reuse plant at the Maintenance Center. MetrôRio does not yet have control mechanisms for its investments in environmental initiatives, but intends to adopt such practices in the near future. In 2012, there were no significant non-conformities in regard to environmental laws and regulations. For more details on the concessionaire’s main environmental preservation projects, see www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in Group companies/MetrôRio. Health and Safety MetrôRio’s concern for the health and safety of its passengers is an integral part of all its services. The company has a security staff of 354 to assist users in the event of accidents, theft and other incidents, who receive constant training in areas such as basic first aid, firefighting, safe access and rescue on train lines. In 2012, the company recorded no non-conformities with laws and regulations covering the provision and use of products and services.

The company won in the Alternative Media category. The award is granted by the Brazilian Association of Marketing and Advertising Columnists. CBN Profile of CBN Since assuming the Concessionária Bahia Norte (CBN) was created by the Invepar-Odebrecht Transport Consortium, which won a 25-year concession, CBN has concession to administer toll roads in the 121 kilometer BA-093 been promoting toll system, connecting the Bahia state capital Salvador to various municipalities in the metropolitan region, namely Pojuca, Mata de road repairs São João, Dias D´Avila, Camaçari, Simões Filho, Lauro de Freitas and Candeias. As soon as the Concessionaire took control of the system, emergency work was carried out on the toll roads, including surface repairs, the replacement of damaged signage and clearing of the drainage system, shoulders and right of way. Having met the challenges presented at the beginning of the concession, Bahia Norte maintains a 24-hour presence on the toll roads and has become a reference for users. Inspection, recovery and medical response teams have attended over 20,000 calls since operations began, dispatched through the Operational Control Center and through the toll-free number 0800 600 0093. There are also four User Assistance Service bases strategically located along the toll roads. The Concessionaire has contributed to regional development through job and income generation. It currently employs 2,047 people, 474 of whom directly and 1,603 indirectly. In 2012, it generated R$72.93 million in direct economic value, R$19.61 million of which went to employees’ salaries and benefits and R$437,000 was invested in social and environmental initiatives. 86 2012 Annual Report To date, Bahia Norte has invested more than R$415 million in road system repairs and duplications. (R$ thousand) Direct economic value generated [GRI EC1] Revenue 72,933.00 Economic value distributed Operating costs 37,877.00 Employee salaries and benefits 19,612.00 Payments to capital providers 16,963.00 Payments to government 6,967.00 Investments in the community 437.00 Accumulated economic value to date (8,823.00) Business Bahia Norte is currently carrying out a number of works on the BA-093 system, including a key project to restore 24 kilometers of the Canal de Tráfego toll road which links the Camaçari Petrochemical Complex with Aratu Port, which is ahead of schedule. Another important project is the duplication of 14 kilometers of the BA-526, known locally as the CIA–Aeroporto, which is in the final stages. This duplication, which will provide a toll road between the CIAAeroporto and the Camaçari Industrial Center, includes a road system over the Ceasa roundabout to resolve the problem of congestion outside this important supply center. Bahia Norte is also duplicating 25 kilometers of the Via Parafuso (BA-535) – work began after an environmental license was obtained in March 2012. The BA-093 toll road, which lends its name to the entire system, had already undergone emergency repairs in November when an environmental license was granted for the duplication of the 14-kilometer stretch between Simões Filho and the entrance to Camaçari. Preparations for the duplication are already under way. The Concessionaire is also installing 28 cameras, 13 message panels, a georeferenced information system and other technological elements which will facilitate traffic management, enhance monitoring and streamline the response to toll road incidents, providing improved road safety to users.

Invepar 87 Environment [GRI EN26] Four of the concession’s five toll plazas are located within the Joanes-Ipitanga Environmental Protection Area, and for this reason the company has a firm commitment to the environmental management of its activities. In its environmental licensing processes, Bahia Norte has not identified any significant environmental impacts. Nevertheless, it has a contractual obligation to restore environmental damage caused since the construction of the toll road over 20 years ago. In 2012, it invested R$3 million in environmental preservation, R$2.7 million of which allocated to environmental repairs, the obtaining of licenses and relevant studies and offsets. The remaining R$270,000 went towards monitoring water quality, noise and vehicle-wildlife impacts, together with the related operating costs. In addition to legal and contractual obligations, Bahia Norte has held educational and awareness-raising campaigns for toll road users and communities in regard to common environmental issues, such as litter on the toll road. Despite the company’s respectable environmental track record, it was fined R$90,000 on June 11, 2012, for alleged environmental damage caused by the construction consortium contracted for the execution of works – especially the silting up of the water body in the BA-526 area. The Concessionaire has appealed and is awaiting a final decision by the environmental agency. [GRI EN28] Safety Concerned as it is with safety on the toll roads, Bahia Norte evaluates all its services from this standpoint, from conceptual development to final service delivery, and applies a number of related measures. One example is the obligation for airbags and ABS brakes in all its fleet vehicles, whether rented or owned. The company continuously guides, supervises and inspects these service providers and sub-contractors in line with its workplace health and safety standards. In 2012, CBN invested R$23,800 in training fire response teams to effectively tackle any incidents of this nature on its toll roads, while R$4,500 was allocated to defensive driver training for its fleet drivers. 88 2012 Annual Report 1.64 CRT Profile of CRT billion Concessionária Rio-Teresópolis (CRT) manages the portion of the Rio-Teresópolis toll road that passes through the cities of Duque de Caxias (starting at its intersection with the BR-040/RJ), Magé, Guapimirim, Teresópolis, São José do Vale do Rio Preto and Between 1996, when it Sapucaia.

CRT is a special purpose enterprise registered as category A in the CVM (Securities and Exchange Commission of Brazil). The Concessionaire’s financial statements are audited by the largest auditing firms who are rotated every five years. On November 14, 2012, Fitch Ratings elevated CRT’s Long-Term National Rating from ‘AA-(bra)’ to ‘AA(bra)’, with a stable outlook. Thanks to strict compliance with the stipulations of the concession contract and prompt responses to the observations, suggestions and requests made by the regulatory agency, CRT has never been fined by the ANTT (National Ground Transport Agency). Business Since taking over management of Rio-Teresópolis toll road in 1996, CRT has invested a total of R$1.64 billion in projects, services and operating costs, as of December 2012. The projects include the construction of five overpasses, 18 pedestrian overpasses and 15.8 kilometers of side roads; the repaving of 86,000 square meters, the installation of lighting along 40 kilometers of toll roads and the construction of a third lane in the sierra region, which is scheduled for completion in December 2013. CRT also implemented and maintains a wide range of user services. Services Number Mobile ICU 1 Ambulance 1 Rescue vehicles 2 Tow trucks 6 Inspection vehicles 5 Variable message signs 4 Surveillance cameras 11 Emergency call boxes 100 In order to coordinate this service structure, the Concessionaire maintains an Operational Control Center (24-hour Intelligence Center), with a supervisor and traffic operators who run all of the user support services, in coordination with the Federal Highway Police, the Rio de Janeiro State Fire Department and the Civil Defense Force. CRT has made it a priority to promptly and professionally attend to the users and communities served by the toll road. This commitment extends to all sectors and levels of the Concessionaire. To ensure quality service and manage user demands, CRT implemented the User Service Center (CAU) at the beginning of its concession. The CAU is equipped with telephone and fax, a waiting room, a private support room for users involved in accidents or incidents and their families. It also has a women’s bathroom (with a diaper changing area and hygiene products for babies), a men’s bathroom and a bathroom for people with disabilities, all of which equipped with showers. The Center’s facilities were developed in accordance with accessibility standards. 90 2012 Annual Report By the end of the concession, an additional R$226 million will have been invested in projects, particularly in paving maintenance and repaving (R$56 million), slope retention (R$51 million) and expanding the capacity of the ascent into the sierra (R$32 million). There are also plans to increase user service equipment, with the addition, in the coming years, of three inspection vehicles, three tow trucks and another mobile ICU. Community CRT believes that its greatest impact on the community comes in the form of job and income generation. The jobs created through the BR-116/RJ, whether direct or indirect, not only insert part of the local population into the job market, but also increase the salary levels practiced in the region. It also conducts several social responsibility programs for these communities. The main initiatives are listed below. Som da Serra (Music in the Sierra) Winter clothing drive Computer and carpentry workshops Natal Solidário (Christmas Solidarity) For more details on the concessionaire’s projects contributing to the socio-economic development of its surrounding communities, see www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in Group companies/CRT. Environment [GRI EN26] Operation of the Rio-Teresópolis toll road does not generate significant environmental impacts, although the improvement projects require compliance with a variety of preventive and mitigating measures, such as the implementation of protective coatings on those stretches most susceptible to erosion, the periodic cleaning of the storm water drainage system, the construction of a sedimentation/decantation basin to avoid the discharge of materials into water bodies, and the implementation of a sandbox to contain waste oil and grease generated by equipment, etc. In addition to compliance with the legal requirements, in 2012 CRT carried out a series of additional environmental initiatives, such as the installation of solar panels in all of the call boxes located along the toll road, the acquisition of absorbent materials for emergency first response to accidents involving vehicles transporting hazardous materials (e.g. diesel), and the replacement of low flashpoint (LFP) oil with LPG as a fuel for the company’s asphalt plant. All in all, the company invested R$1.1 million in initiatives of this type in 2012, as shown in the table below. Environmental protection investments and expenditures in 2012 [GRI EN30] Environmental consulting (administrative licensing processes, technical support for projects, etc.) R$241,000 Environmental licensing process costs R$39,000 Costs related to reforestation (consulting services and labor) R$105,916 Waste transportation and disposal R$5,400 Execution of the Fauna Viva Project (monitoring road accidents involving wildlife) R$217,000 Programs for monitoring the environmental quality of the Serra dos Órgãos National Park (noise R$240,000 pollution, air quality, water quality and hazardous cargo traffic) Environmental quality monitoring (monitoring of the water and air quality at projects and analysis R$13,000 of emissions at the asphalt plant) Accident remediation costs from the transport of hazardous products on the toll road (clean-up, R$228,000 transportation and disposal of the contaminated material) Purchase of absorbent materials for emergency first response to accidents involving vehicles R$13,000 transporting hazardous products TOTAL R$1,102,000 Invepar 91 During this period, CRT did not receive any fines or administrative or legal sanctions for the breach of any environmental laws or regulations. [GRI EN28] For more details on the concessionaire’s main environmental preservation projects, see www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in Group companies/CRT. Safety Since the beginning of its concession, CRT has been developing an extensive program of projects and maintenance in order to provide its users and the residents of the communities located near the Rio-Teresópolis toll road with greater safety and comfort. These interventions include the elimination of 36 irregular turn-around points and intersections, which were responsible for the highest accident rates. In order to provide safer turn-around and access points, the Concessionaire introduced five new overpasses and 15 kilometers of side roads, widened and reinforced 12,744 square meters of bridges and overpasses, and installed 17 pedestrian overpasses. The three previously existing pedestrian overpasses were also renovated. Another important project was the implementation of a public lighting system along the Baixada Fluminense stretch between kilometers 144.6 and 104.0. The slopes that border the toll road were also examined. In addition to an ongoing monitoring program, retention projects were carried out at 203 different points. New lane markers and signage made of reflective material were introduced in order to improve visibility at night and in foggy conditions and stretches were repaved whenever necessary. For more details on the concessionaire’s main safety-related initiatives, see www.invepar.com.br/annualreport2012, in Group companies/CRT. 92 2012 Annual Report CRA Profile of CRA Concessionária Rota do Atlântico (CRA) has a 35-year The undertaking managed by contract to manage approximately 45 kilometers of the CRA will meet the needs of Suape Roadway and Logistics Complex, in Pernambuco. The project is designed to meet the need for infrastructure the Suape Port and Industrial investments in the Suape Port and Industrial Complex, Complex, which currently which is currently home to more than 100 companies, with contains more than 100 another 35 in the process of implementation, including shipyards, petrochemical plants and an oil refinery. The toll companies, with a further 35 in road concession is also driving the development of tourism the implantation phase in the state, as an alternative to the PE-60, which connects Recife to the beaches of Pernambuco’s southern coastline. CRA also contributes to the local economy, generating income through the 1,100 jobs involved in the current project phase. When operations begin, there will be 750 jobs, 250 of which direct and 500 indirect. Despite being in the pre-operational phase, with the only source of revenue coming from investments, which totaled R$522,000 in 2012, CRA has already invested around R$86 million in the region, R$5 million of which was used to pay employees’ salaries and benefits and R$37,000 was invested exclusively to the community. (R$ thousand) Direct economic value generated [GRI EC1] Revenue 522.00 Economic value distributed Operating costs (4,008.00) Employee salaries and benefits (4,896.00) Payments to capital providers (384.00) Payments to the government (1.00) Investments in the toll road (77,167.00) Investments in the community (37.00) Accumulated economic value (87,015.00) Invepar 93 Business Within its integrated safety, accessibility and logistics support solution, CRA’s business plan for the Suape Highway and Logistics Complex envisages investments of R$450 million, which will be spent on the construction, renovation, operation, monitoring and maintenance of the roadway under its domain. Specific investments include paving maintenance, drainage devices and the right of way, and the implementation and conservation of safety equipment, such as cameras, message boards, signage, metal fenders, barriers and lighting. The company’s implementation phase is expected to be completed in 2013, when the entire toll road system will effectively enter into operation. Community [GRI EC9 SO1] Like all toll roads managed under concessions, the short-term impacts may include an increase in the cost of freight and dissatisfaction among the most directly affected communities. However, the benefits from the toll road improvements, the increased flow of traffic, the creation of jobs and the consequent contribution to the local economy should soon outweigh the initial inconveniences. At the moment, one of the main concerns of the Concessionaire’s social area is helping the granting authority in regard to expropriations and resettlement, identifying and suggesting options for squatter families who need to be relocated and compensated as the route of the toll road is implemented. Even though these processes are technically the responsibility of the granting power, CRA provides support, always seeking to maintain dialogue with its surrounding communities. The Concessionaire is currently mapping community leaders and organizations, in order to maintain frequent contact and develop strategic initiatives throughout the concession period through the implementation of a Social Responsibility Program. During the current stage of the project, periodic relationship initiatives are carried out on commemorative dates, such as Children’s Day, which featured traffic education activities, and Christmas. Environment [GRI EN26 EN28 EN30] As the project is still in the investment phase, in which the responsibility for obtaining environmental licenses falls upon the granting authority, CRA has been focusing its environmental responsibility actions on toll road operational licensing needs. It has already been confirmed that several stretches will require the removal of Atlantic Forest vegetation. In compensation, CRA has scheduled a regional native species reforestation program. The company also plans to hire a consulting firm in the second half of 2013 to conduct its carbon inventory. In 2012, the company spent R$60,000 on flora and fauna surveys, as well as forest inventories, in order to support the granting power in the licensing process. It also spent an average of R$950 per month to collect and dispose of waste in a properly licensed landfill. CRA has not received any fines or non-monetary sanctions for any incidents of legal or regulatory non-compliance. 94 2012 Annual Report 07 Appendices About the Report _95 GRI Indicators _96 Ibase Social Balance Sheet _102 Financial Statements _107 Contacts _107 Credits _107 Invepar 95 About the Report [GRI 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.10 3.11 4.14 4.15] GRI Methodology Invepar’s 2012 Annual Report was produced in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) methodology, one of the most widely used and recognized in the world. Created by the NGO of the same name, it provides guidelines for measuring, disclosing and being held accountable for organizational performance to both internal and external stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of promoting sustainable development. Much has been said about this subject, but few really understand the concept. In general terms, it is a tripod supported by the economic, social and environmental dimensions that, when taken together, allow a company “to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,” (Brundtland, Harlem. Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, 1988). The quest for sustainable development is a global trend. Definition of Content Version G3 of the GRI includes 42 profile indicators and 79 economic, social and environmental performance indicators. The number of indicators to be reported varies according to the application level. In order to identify its level and determine the content of this report, Invepar sent an email to its stakeholders asking them to choose five issues from among 33 defined in accordance with GRI criteria. The email was sent to a sample of 1,511 people, selected from among users, shareholders, journalists, employees and those involved in the process of developing a new brand identity for Invepar. It should be noted that the Company is completing the process of mapping its stakeholders, which will permit an even more accurate consultation process in 2013. One hundred and thirteen people responded. The 20 issues that received the most votes corresponded to 49 indicators, Highly relevant indicators INFLUENCE ON STAKEHOLDER EVALUATION AND DECISIONS to which an additional eight were PR1 EC4 EC9 added which Invepar itself regarded EN26 PR2 EC1 as being important for the sector, the LA10 EN3 Company and its peers. This same SO1 EN4 perception was used to submit the Relevant indicators set of indicators to a test, which was EN5 LA1 LA13 PR9 used to create the materiality matrix LA2 LA7 LA8 Slightly relevant (see below). In total, 24 issues were indicators EN8 EN10 EN15 EN28 HR8 SO5 classified as highly relevant, 10 LA3 EN16 EN21 as relevant, six as slightly relevant LA12 SO6 SO8 Irrelevant EC5 EN22 LA4 and nine as irrelevant. Only the 34 indicators LA14 EN30 SO2 EN13 HR1 classified as highly relevant or relevant LA11 LA12 SO3 SO4 are included in this report. LA9 EN6 EN7 EC2 SO7 EC3 EN27 EN29 IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS 96 2012 Annual Report Based on the GRI guidelines (see table below), Invepar’s report could qualify for Level B. However, since this is the first time that it is adopting the methodology, the Company chose to meet the criteria for Level C. As it advances in its application of the GRI, Invepar intends to improve its measurement and control methods, in turn improving its report. The reported indicators cover the period between January 1 and December 31, 2012 and refer to the companies that are currently operational or in the investment phase – Linha Amarela, Concessionária Litoral Norte, MetrôRio, Concessionária Auto Raposo Tavares, Concessionária Bahia Norte, Concessionária Rio-Teresópolis and Concessionária Rota do Atlântico. We did not include indicators related to the concessionaires launched in 2012 GRU Airport, Via Parque Rímac and Via Expressa TransOlímpica. Given that the concessionaires have their own human resources and environmental programs, with unique measuring processes and models, it was not possible to give certain indicators an overall number that represents the Company as a whole. We therefore present certain indicators by company in this report, based on their forms of measurement.

fully consolidating the Brazilian Labor Laws in 2011, to facilitate understanding, we decided to present the 2012 figures with the percentage equivalent to Invepar’s equity interest held in the companies, in accordance with Law 6404 of 1976. The interests held are as follows: CLN (91.50%), CBN (50%), CRA (50%), CRT (24.91%) and GRU Airport (45.90%). In terms of External Social Indicators, the amounts representing the group’s projects/social and environmental actions are reported in “Others”, since most of them are donations to the Invepar Institute and will be presented in Invepar’s Balance Sheet. Since Via Parque Rímac and TransOlímpica were in the pre-operational phase, such as GRU Airport, which was operating under the assistance of INFRAERO in 2012, the figures will only be included in the calculation base and the workforce indicator.
