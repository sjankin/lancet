All other repairs and maintenance are fair value of the consideration given or received) unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced charged to income statement of the financial period in which they are incurred. by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e., without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from Land is not depreciated.

Gains/losses Computer equipment 5-7 arising on this basis are recorded in the income statement as foreign exchange gains/losses. Furniture and other equipment 7-25 Motor vehicles 5 Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 6 7 ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Serbia The assets’ residual value represents the estimated amount that the Bank might obtain at present Financial instruments, such as debt securities held, containing one or more embedded through the sale of the asset, decreased by the estimated cost of sale. If the Bank expects to utilize derivatives significantly modify the cash flows. the asset until the expiration of its useful life, the residual value amounts to zero. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. b) Loans and receivables Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.

Held-to-maturity investments are stated at amortized cost using effective interest rate method. Software The amortized cost is calculated taking into consideration all discounts and premiums received at the date of purchase. Acquired computer software licenses are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives (15 years). d) Available-for-sale financial assets Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software are recognized as an expense as Available-for-sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which incurred. Costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique software products controlled by may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or the Bank and will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognized equity prices. as intangible assets. Direct costs include the costs of employees involved in software development. e) Accounting treatment and calculation Computer software development costs recognized as assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives (not exceeding 10 years). Regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held to maturity and available for sale are recognized on trade-date – the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognized at fair value increased for transactions costs for all financial assets not held at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets 2.9. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Bank has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. The Bank classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held-to-maturity investments; and available-for-sale Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsefinancial assets.

The criteria that the Bank uses to determine that there is objective evidence of an impairment loss When a loan is uncollectible, it is written off against the related allowance for loan impairment. Such include: loans are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined. • Delinquency in contractual payments of principal or interest; • Cash flow difficulties experienced by the borrower (for example, equity ratio, net income If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related percentage of sales); objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized (such as an improvement in • Breach of loan covenants or conditions; the debtor’s credit rating), the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the • Initiation of bankruptcy proceedings; allowance account. The amount of the reversal is recognized in the income statement in impairment • Deterioration of the borrower’s competitive position; charge for credit losses. • Deterioration in the value of collateral. b) Assets classified as available for sale The estimated period between a loss occurring and its identification is determined by the local management for each identified portfolio type. In general, the periods used vary between three and twelve months; in exceptional cases longer periods are warranted. The Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of securities classified as available for The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not in determining whether the assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale individually significant. If the Bank determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of and the current fair value – is recognized in the income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and the increase can be Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in profit or loss, to be recognized, are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.

Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the exposure of bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in interest turing individuals rates. Generally, there are two ways on which the bank could be affected by changes in interest 147,231 7,626,299 2,118,217 9,891,747 8,716,325 rates. Firstly, changes in interest rates are affecting the value of banks assets, liabilities and offbalance sheet items, and secondly, it impacts banks future cash flows that the bank will obtain. Interest rate risk could come in the variety of forms, including reprising risk, yield curve risk, basis and optionality risk. The Bank’s interest rates are set taking into account the market interest rates and other factors (such as cost of risk, reserve requirement, etc.) and the Bank regularly adjusts them.

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank is unable to meet its payment obligations which can have a negative result on the Bank’s financial results and equity. The Bank manages liquidity risk by obtaining different funding sources that include: 25,674,787 30,466,016 24,321,419 1-5 years 1,656,428 27,651,817 29,308,245 1-5 years 3,703,193 26,762,823 • customer’s deposits with different maturities • deposits from the money market and available lines with financial institutions • available lines form the majority shareholder • available lines from international financial institutions • share capital. 40,067,556 19,403,431 2,125,025 51,650,019 42,592,525 3-12 months 37,942,531 3-12 months Sources of liquidity are regularly reviewed so as to maintain a wide diversification by currency, 50,083,864 1,566,155 geography, provider, product and term.

An unmatched position potentially enhances profitability, but also increases the risk of losses. The maturities of assets and liabilities and the ability to replace, at an acceptable cost, interest bearing liabilities as they mature, are important factors in assessing the liquidity of the Bank and its exposure to changes in interest rates and exchange rates. 153,436 41,014,264 67,075,047 Up to 1 55,728,969 40,602,152 318,958 258,676 33,882,718 Up to 1 33,392,907 Diversity and stability of core deposit base involves an analysis allowing for Bank to more effectively month 170,853 month controls and measures deposit based liquidity and more accurately measures liquidity risk by defining deposit inputs.
