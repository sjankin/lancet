Page 16 Environmental Responsibilities Environmental Management Our approach to environmental issues is focused on reducing and taking control of the environmental effects of our activities and products. Raw materials and wastes are stored properly, chemicals are kept under control. The use of less material, creating less waste, water and energy consumption reduction, prevention of chemicals and wastes from polluting the nature are among our environmental improvement activities and goals. According to 2010 data from Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, in Turkey %10,7 of primary energy is supplied from renewable resources (including hydro) (EÜAŞ, Electricity Generation Sector Report, 2011). Today, criteria that stand out like efficiency, cost and environmental awareness are affecting the conditions of competition and we are aware that success will be of those who give importance to these criteria. Since the beginning of 2011, we started to use renewable energy. Our supplier provides all of the electrical energy from wind power plants in İzmir-Bergama and HataySamandag. (http://www.fibaholding.com.tr/tr/sirketler.php?gid=6&sid=68) Page 17 Energy efficiency activities: • The use of high efficiency lighting fixtures and bulbs. • The use thermal insulation jacket on injection machines. • Analyzing the down times of injection machines, improvements of energy efficiency according to the analysis results. • The use of air pistons which consume less compressed air in pneumatic processes. Maintenance and repairs performed to prevent leakage and losses. • Increase in efficiency with planned and periodic maintenance activities. • As a result of room temperature controls, closing the unnecessary radiators. • Bringing radiators closer to employees in large areas, to provide comfort and savings. • Reduction of lighting with fixtures in areas that benefit from the daylight. • Use of the lighting system with motion sensor in areas that are not occupied all the time. Other environmental activities: Waste management is carried out in accordance with the legislation. • Hazardous wastes are collected separately according to their codes and are disposed of through a licensed company. 2011 2012 2013 (First 9 Month) 343 kg 500 kg 340 kg • Waste batteries are collected separately and waste batteries employees bring from their homes are also accepted. In 2011 24 kg batteries have been sent to Portable Battery Manufacturers and Exporters Association. • Packaging wastes are sent to recycling within the scope of the system of Pendik Municipality. Gating’s from injection machines are grinded to be reused in production process. These materials are used without disturbing the product properties and in acceptable proportions as specified by the raw material manufacturers. Safety Data Sheets of all chemicals in use are examined and the necessary information about chemicals is given to employees. Any new chemical which will be supplied is started to be used after it is approved in terms of environmental and occupational safety. Chemicals are kept in containers which carry a label including the name and the hazard sign. As a result of the examination by the authorities, it has been determined that our facility is not subject to Emission Permit requirement. We do not have an industrial wastewater discharge. Municipal (tap) water is purified by reverse osmosis system for obtaining drinking water. Page 18 Spill Response Kits that are necessary to respond to environmental emergencies were obtained. Environmental impacts of our processes are evaluated in scope of ISO 14001 Environmental Management System studies. Compliance with Legal Requirements RoHS In 2000, in line with customer demand, our activities about restriction of using lead, cadmium, mercury and bromine-containing flame retardants has begun. In 2004, informing all suppliers about this subject has been completed. With the tests carried out, the use of raw materials that do not contain these substances has been achieved. Thus, the production is compatible with RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) Directive. As a result of harmonization efforts in Turkey, Regulation on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment has been published in the Official Gazette on 30.05.2008 and entered into force on 30.05.2009. Regulation on Control of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment has been issued in Official Gazette on 22.05.2012. Article on some responsibilities of EEE producers related to authorized organization and Coordination Center will come into force in May 2013. The regulation has been prepared in parallel to EU RoHS and WEE directives. The new ROHS 2 Directive (2011/65/EU) has taken place to the RoHS Directive (2002/95/EC) which is related with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in the Electric and Electronic Equipment (EEE). Restriction of the lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium compounds, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) which is flame retarder and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) is continuing with ROHS 2 Directive. REACH – Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) Substances of very high concern are the substances that are candidates to REACH regulation’s “Authorization List”. These substances are cancer-causing (carcinogenic), mutagenic, toxic to reproduction, persistent organic pollutant and bio accumulative substances. This category also includes chemicals that have equivalent risk like “endocrine system disruptors”. There are already 144 substances in the list of SVHC. SVHC List is updated on 20 July 2013 and 6 substances are added. Our products do not contain these substances. We are able to follow this by the declarations of conformity we receive from our suppliers.
