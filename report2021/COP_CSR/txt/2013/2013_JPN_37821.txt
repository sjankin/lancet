Summary of New Strategic Direction Future pull approach eyeing 2020 Clear portfolio strategy: select winning with a vision to double our business by businesses through proactive reshaping building a diversified but focused portfolio of portfolio Our priority is to capture growth Grow our business and deliver returns opportunities in expanding Asian while maintaining financial discipline markets 04 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Vision and Strategy Ken Kobayashi President and CEO 05 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2013 objectives vs. results Reflecting on Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012 Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012 was announced in July 2010, and under it we promoted measures to create sustainable corporate value. Quantitatively, we targeted consolidated net income of ¥500.0 billion for the year ended March 2013. We also targeted a dividend payout ratio of 20% to 25% and earmarked between ¥2.0 trillion and ¥2.5 trillion for investment over the plan’s three years from the year ended March 2011. While our earnings in the year ended March 2013 were lower than we had targeted, we generally achieved the goals set forth under the plan. The total earnings we accumulated and the progress we made with investments over the past three years were largely in line with our plan. What’s more, the average dividend payout ratio for the past three years was 24%. Qualitatively, we steadily implemented measures for building a management platform for the MC Group in accordance with the reshaping of MC’s business through changes and diversification of business models. In addition, directly after the Great East Japan Earth*See page 86 quake, we established the Mitsubishi Corporation East Japan Earthquake Recovery Fund*, which spearheaded Company-wide support for helping with relief and recovery efforts in disaster-hit areas. We are still implementing measures to help with relief and recovery efforts in these areas and will actively continue these efforts going forward. All in all, I think we achieved a certain degree of success. That said, various issues have emerged that we must address. Initial Objectives Set in July 2010 Actual Results 3-year total ¥1,280 billion ■ Consolidated net income target for Earnings Fiscal Year Ended March 2013 set at 464.5 452.3 360.0** ¥500 billion FYE* 3/2011 FYE 3/2012 FYE 3/2013 3-year total ¥2,600 billion ■ Invest ¥2,000 – 2,500 billion over three years in order to strengthen existing Investment earnings drivers and develop new 1,300 900 400 businesses for future growth FYE 3/2011 FYE 3/2012 FYE 3/2013 3-year average 24% Dividend Dividend payout ratio of 20 25% each year 23% 24% 25% FYE 3/2011 FYE 3/2012 FYE 3/2013 Diversify business models ■ All key initiatives achieved Key Initiatives Strengthen management platform ■ Established the Mitsubishi Corporation East Japan Earthquake Recovery Fund Create sustainable corporate value **FYE = Fiscal Year Ended **Lowered earnings due to longer-than expected strikes at BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance coal operations 06 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2013 business environment Vision and Strategy Our Business Environment and Pressing Issues Geopolitical risks have come to prominence in various regions around the world amid the drawn-out European crisis and slowing growth in emerging markets. Volatility in financial markets and resource prices will also require continued vigilance going forward, and uncertainty surrounding the global economic outlook will continue. On a brighter note, the Asian economy is expected to see comparatively robust growth, raising hopes that it will drive the global economy. The uncertain external business environment presents risks for MC. But it presents new business opportunities as well. As the reshaping of MC has occurred faster than expected due to changes in our business model and business sites, we must concentrate more on maintaining balance sheet discipline, raising profitability and tackling other management themes. We are also being compelled to think again about how we manage the company and set performance targets. This is due to the special nature of our business as a sogo shosha, a unique business model that comprises both resource and non-resource businesses. Facing these issues head on, we revisited the fundamental questions of “What value does a sogo shosha create?” and “What is the value of Mitsubishi Corporation?” We formulated New Strategic Direction after reviewing how we set growth targets, management frameworks and other matters.

In terms of the time horizon, with our business models and external business environment changing dynamically, we believed we had to shift from a conventional midGrowth Eyeing 2020 term management plan approach, one that centered on a three-year financial target, to formulating strategy with a longer-term perspective. Therefore, we Double business adopted a “future pull” approach that looks ahead to circa 2020. Resource: double attributable Our growth vision sets the goal of doubling the size of our business by equity production around 2020. Non-resource: double earnings By that time, we aim to have more than 10 business sub-segments in our portfolio that generate net income of at least ¥20.0 billion, and another 10 to 15 that can generate between ¥10.0 billion and ¥20.0 billion. To do this we will ×2 narrow down our business sub-segments, being mindful of strengthening multiple “winning businesses” in an appropriately diversified business portfolio. FYE 3/2013 Circa 2020 Portfolio Vision Grow “winning businesses” Circa 2013.3 2020 Number of Business 47 35 – 40 Sub-Segments (BSS) Number of which More earn > 20 billion yen 5 than net income 10 Number of which earn 10–20 billion 1 10 –15 yen net income 08 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2013 strategic direction Vision and Strategy Let me explain our management policies for realizing our “future pull” growth scenario for the MC Group around 2020. Principles: New Strategic Direction continues our drive under Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012 to create sustainable corporate value. We aim to further increase societal value and environmental value by redoubling efforts on a consolidated and global basis. Furthermore, we plan to strengthen “winning businesses” through the proactive reshaping of our portfolio in order to win against competition on a global scale. Investment Policy: We will accelerate divestments selectively and free up capital for new investments, while continuing to invest at a rate in line with the average of the last three years under Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012, in order to improve our earnings base. Financial Discipline: We will increase our focus on financial discipline, including funding our investments within our own cash flow. And we plan to deliver a return on equity of 12-15% over the medium to long term. Dividend Policy: We will introduce a two-staged dividend policy with a base and a variable portion in order to provide a stable dividend to shareholders regardless of changes in the business environment. business strategy & market strategy Business Strategy *See page 12-13 In our resource businesses, we will focus on the profitability of projects which will primarily entail expanding our existing asset base (coking coal, copper, LNG, and other core assets) and projects in the pipeline. At the same time, we will refocus on capital and operational costs to improve our competitiveness. In non-resource businesses, we will proactively reshape the portfolio in line with our long-term vision of creating multiple sizable “winning businesses,” while deploying management resources to the most promising opportunities. Market Strategy *See page 12,14-15 Our market strategy calls for us to accelerate our global business development by leveraging our shift towards Asian markets, which are gaining greater international presence not only as resource rich and industrial nations, but as consumer markets as well. Our objective is to ensure sustainable growth by capturing growth in Asia. This will entail securing global supply sources to meet increasing demand for raw materials and other commodities in Asia, where relatively strong growth is expected, and establishing a local presence within the region, through M&As, strategic alliances, and other proactive initiatives. 09 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Business Development (R&D) Strategy As we drive forward with our business portfolio strategy, we will actively develop new business domains that will form part of MC’s future portfolio. Each business group is pursuing business development in existing business domains and peripheral areas. In addition to these ongoing efforts, I myself will take the lead in targeting new growth fields—fields that cannot be sufficiently covered by existing business groups. In this way, I am determined to optimize our portfolio to drive our growth as a sogo shosha. Under New Strategic Direction, we have stepped up initiatives in environment-related fields, which we have designated as a new target domain for business development. And our Business Service Group plans to actively utilize IT and develop IT services that will power the expansion of all our business groups. In terms of our market strategy, we plan to develop business in countries and regions that are expected to grow dramatically going forward. With a mediumto long-term perspective, we believe that we will benefit from growth in these countries and regions. In the process of contributing to the development of these countries and regions, we will forge long-lasting relationships of trust with local partners and customers. Our goal is to increase our presence by developing multifarious businesses that draw on collective strengths unique to MC. New Strategic Direction earmarks ¥100.0 billion for strategic investments over 3 years for this growth push. reshaping our portfolio eyeing 2020 Focusing Management For optimizing our business portfolio, we have introduced the concept of “business subResources on Winning segments” across the company. This move is geared toward making evaluation of busiBusinesses nesses easier and achieving improved transparency of business strategies. This does not only mean divesting underperforming assets. It also extends to selecting Level of Earnings and strengthening “winning businesses” using return on equity, size of earnings and growth potential as the three main criteria. In accordance with this concept, we will divest non-core and marginal businesses and assets that have reached their peak. In this way, we will narrow down business sub-segments and focus business resources on multiple “winning businesses,” with the aim of achieving our portfolio vision by circa 2020.

In the year ended March 2013, net income was ¥360.0 billion, ¥30.0 billion more than the ¥330.0 billion downwardly revised forecast we issued in October 2012. This was achieved despite the negative impact on our earnings of lower sales prices at our Australian coking coal business and other factors. The better-than-forecast outcome was attributable to higher earnings in the Energy Business Group, as well as non-resource fields, namely the Industrial Finance, Logistics & Development, Machinery and Living Essentials groups. Based on the ¥360.0 billion bottom-line result, we paid an annual dividend per share applicable to the year ended March 2013 of ¥55, which at 25% was the upper limit of the consolidated dividend payout ratio target range set in Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012, our previous medium-term management plan. Total shareholders’ equity was ¥4,179.7 billion as of March 31, 2013, up ¥671.9 billion from March 31, 2012. During the year ended March 2013, we made investments of approximately ¥930.0 billion, balanced between resource and non-resource fields. 1 Net income Attributable to Mitsubishi Corporation 2 Total Mitsubishi Corporation Shareholders’ Equity / Net Interest-bearing Liabilities / Net Debt-to-equity Ratio (¥ billion) (¥ trillion, times) 500 471.3 464.5 5 452.3 4.34 419.0 4.18 400 371.0 4 3.53 3.65 356.4 360.0 3.52 3.57 3.51 3.42 3.44 3.7 3.23 3.13 3.08 2.88 2.83 2.93 2.97 2.95 275.8 3 300 2.9 2.35 2.36 186.6 2.3 200 2 1.49 1.5 117.6 1.22 0.94 1.3 1.0 1.2 100 63.0 1 1.1 1.0 1.0 0.9 0 03.3 04.3 05.3 06.3 07.3 08.3 09.3 10.3 11.3 12.3 13.3 0 03.3 04.3 05.3 06.3 07.3 08.3 09.3 10.3 11.3 12.3 13.3 ■ Shareholders’ equity ■ Net interest-bearing liabilities Net debt-to-equity-ratio 16 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2013 My aim is to build a strong earnings structure while maintaining financial discipline, and in this way support the implementation of New Strategic Direction. Shuma Uchino Member of the Board, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer To make these investments, we procured additional funds through bank loans and bond issuances. Even so, we maintained a net debt-to-equity ratio of 1.0, about the same financially sound level as March 31, 2012. While operating activities provided net cash of approximately ¥400.0 billion, free cash flow was negative, as we continued to make substantial investments. In order to maximize our corporate value, we plan to continue investing under our New Strategic Direction vision at a rate in line with the past three years. We will fund these investments by reshaping our asset portfolio through divestments and generating profits from operations. In addition, by actively reaping the benefits of past investments, we aim to increase earnings and generate positive free cash flow again. While the external business environment is expected to remain opaque going forward, as CFO of Mitsubishi Corporation, my aim is to build a strong earnings structure while maintaining financial discipline, and in this way support the implementation of New Strategic Direction. 3 Cash Flows 4 Cash Dividends Declared for the Year / Payout Ratio (¥ billion) (¥, %) 1,500 70 65 65 60 56 55 1,000 52 623.1 50 46 500 245.9 292.4 177.4 152.3 145.3 68.6 38 40 35 0 −25.8 −135.3 30 −349.2 23 23 23 25 20 19 20 –500 18 24 −550.2 16 16 20 12 15 –1,000 8 10 –1,500 03.3 04.3 05.3 06.3 07.3 08.3 09.3 10.3 11.3 12.3 13.3 0 03.3 04.3 05.3 06.3 07.3 08.3 09.3 10.3 11.3 12.3 13.3 ■ Cash flows from operating activities ■ Cash flows from investing activities ■ Cash dividends Payout ratio Free cash flows ■ Cash flows from financing activities 17 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Financial Overview Achieved Consolidated Net Income of ¥360.0 Billion, ¥30.0 Billion Higher than ¥330.0 Billion Forecast MC posted consolidated net income of ¥360.0 billion on the back of higher-than-expected earnings in all segments apart from Chemicals, even with impairment losses on certain asset holdings. This result was achieved despite a difficult operating environment that saw soft commodity prices throughout the fiscal year. On the other hand, positive factors included the share market rebound and the yen’s depreciation in the second half of the fiscal year. Non-resource Fields Generated 12% More Earnings than Previous Fiscal Year, and Earnings Are Still Rising Consolidated net income in non-resource fields was ¥177.0 billion, up ¥19.3 billion, or 12%, year over year. As a result, the ratio of earnings from resource fields versus non-resource fields changed from 65:35 in the previous fiscal year to 50:50, highlighting the strength of a balanced business portfolio. Maintained Financial Soundness (Shareholders’ Equity: ¥4,179.7 Billion, Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 1.0) Shareholders’ equity rose ¥671.9 billion from March 31, 2012 to a record ¥4,179.7 billion, because of an increase in retained earnings, which were boosted by the net income result, and the impact of the yen’s depreciation and higher share prices. The net debt-to-equity ratio, net interest-bearing liabilities (gross interest-bearing liabilities minus cash and cash equivalents and time deposits) divided by shareholders’ equity was 1.0. Overall, therefore, MC maintained its financial soundness. Consolidated Net Income by Segment [Major Changes (Increase or decrease)] (¥ billion) Industrial Finance, Logistics & Development: 76% increase 500 The increase reflects mainly higher earnings in real estateand leaserelated businesses, as well as in the fund investment-related business. 452.3 14.2 Energy Business: 18% increase The increase reflects mainly increased dividend income from overseas 400 resource-related business investees, despite higher exploration costs and 120.6 the booking of impairment losses on some asset holdings. 360.0 Industrial Finance, Metals: 78% decrease 25.0 Logistics & Development The decrease reflects mainly lower sales prices at an Australian resource300 related subsidiary (coking coal) and decreased equity-method earnings from overseas resource-related companies. 142.4 Energy Business Machinery: 24% increase 170.6 The increase reflects mainly higher sales in Asian automobile-related 200 operations and the absence of a loss on withdrawal from a business recorded in the previous fiscal year, despite ship owning and 36.9 Metals management-related write-downs. Chemicals: 39% decrease 49.8 61.9 Machinery 100 The decrease was mainly due to lower earnings on transactions at the Parent and a petrochemical business-related company, and the absence of 37.1 22.6 Chemicals bargain purchase gains from the acquisition of a plastic business subsidiary recorded in the previous fiscal year. 56.6 67.5 Living Essentials 0 Living Essentials: 19% increase Adjustments Although it recorded lower earnings on transactions at foodand general (3.4) (3.7) and Elimination merchandise-related subsidiaries, the segment saw earnings rise year – 50 over year due to gains on share sales and the absence of a share write12.3 13.3 down recorded in the previous fiscal year. 18 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Financial Highlights Mitsubishi Corporation and Subsidiaries Years ended March 31 (U.S. GAAP) Figures from the year ended March 2006 through the year ended March 2011 have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect a change in year-end at certain consolidated subsidiaries.

Hideyuki Nabeshima Member of the Board, Senior Executive Vice President, Corporate Communications, Corporate Administration, Legal & Human Resources The MC Group’s businesses have been diversifying and globalizing at a rapid rate, and the management of human resources is also changing. Whereas in the past Mitsubishi Corporation itself was the central player, today human resources are increasingly managed globally across the MC Group. To be more specific, along with strengthening the global competitiveness of employees at Mitsubishi Corporation’s head office, all offices and MC Group companies are also taking steps to develop and utilize human resources. Furthermore, we are building frameworks for developing, assigning and utilizing human resources across companies and countries irrespective of gender or nationality, as well as enhancing training programs to ensure that our values and management philosophy are shared Group-wide. These actions will strengthen our management on a consolidated and global basis. 58 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Main Initiatives Global Trainee Program Program for Leadership Development (PLD) ■ Overview ■ Overview This program aims to strengthen MC’s global competitiveness in This program targets middle managers of MC’s head office, terms of human resources so that employees can handle the global overseas offices, and MC Group companies.

Meanwhile, bonuses are subject to Enhancing General Meetings of Shareholders MC sends out notices of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders early and avoids dates on which many other Japanese companies schedule their meetings. In addition, MC discloses some parts of its business report on its website. These and other measures create a framework that facilitates robust deliberations by shareholders. Furthermore, since 2011, MC has collated the results of voting by shareholders in attendance at meetings on proposals and disclosed them on its website and in other ways in order to respond to requests from domestic and overseas institutional investors for detailed disclosure of voting results and to promote dialogue-based meetings with individual shareholders. Additionally, MC conducts activities for the environment. For example, for every shareholder who consents to receive materials such as meeting notices for shareholder meetings via e-mail, rather than post, MC will plant one tree per person every six months. 67 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Internal Control System The demands on companies seeking to fulfill their corporate the reliability of corporate information disclosure (financial social responsibilities are growing amid major changes in the reporting) and adherence to laws and regulations and social business environment such as globalization and rising internorms (compliance).

MC has long engaged in creating a framework to ensure that it continues to conduct proper and fair business activities, in addition to upholding legal and regulatory compliance. This long-standing commitment is based on the Three Corporate Principles, which encapsulate our corporate philosophy, and is stipulated in our Corporate Standards of Conduct. In September 2000, we formulated a Code of Conduct, and all officers and employees are required to carry a booklet containing this code. In addition, every year all officers and employees are required to sign a written commitment to this Code after completing an e-learning program in which they study examples related to the Code of Conduct. Through these measures, we are ensuring legal and regulatory compliance by each and every employee, as well as instilling an awareness of proper conduct that reflects social norms. In another initiative, we introduced the Compliance Officer post and compliance officers have been appointed in all business groups and all regions in Japan and overseas. These people work to foster compliance in daily activities. We conduct various activities so as to instill awareness of compliance issues in each and every officer and employee of MC and MC’s subsidiaries and affiliated companies. For example, in July 2012, we brought together the managing directors of MC’s subsidiaries and affiliated companies for a compliance seminar. The compliance activities of all officers and employees are the basis upon which we conduct all our corporate activities, as well as one of the most important strategies for raising corporate value on a consolidated basis. From the base Hideyuki Nabeshima Member of the Board, of the compliance activities conducted thus far, we will continue to upgrade and Senior Executive Vice President reinforce compliance initiatives that are effective.

We asked Mr. Konno about the corporate governance of Mitsubishi Corporation. The Three Corporate Principles —the cornerstone of MC’s corporate governance I have had the opportunity to have a good look at MC’s corporate governance system over the past three years both as an outside director and as a member of the Governance & Compensation Committee. Looking back over this time, my view is that the Three Corporate Principles are what underpins MC’s corporate governance. It is based on these three fundamental principles that MC as an enterprise has been able to continuously earn the trust of the global community while constantly developing and seeking out new businesses. Adherence to the Three Corporate Principles by directors and employees is deep-rooted at MC, I believe. Besides the various training programs about the principles, MC’s senior managers are constantly working to ensure that employees understand the spirit behind them. When I first took this job, it surprised me to see the three principles displayed on the wall of the office. Like a national vision guides a country, the Three Corporate Principles constitute the fundamental basis of MC’s entire operations and provide a guide for the actions of every individual employee.

As I noted, if territorial disputes were allowed to disrupt trade between the second and third largest national economies, it would not only be bad for China and Japan, but for the world economy as well. One of the major power shifts of the 21st century is the recovery of Asia. In 1800, Asia represented half the world’s population and half the world’s economy. By 1900, because of the industrial revolution in Europe and North America, Asia’s share of world product declined to 20 percent. By the middle of this century, Asia should again represent half the world’s population and product.

We believe that, while tackling this issue will depend a great deal on the development of global climate regulatory frameworks and actions based on them, business leadership and technological innovation will also be vital in the move towards realizing a lower carbon society. As a global business enterprise, we also recognize that we have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint, and we are committed to harnessing our potential to develop systems and technologies to help communities and other industries do the same. In June 2011, the Mitsubishi Shoji Building, our headquarters, was certified as an “Office Taking Excellent Specific Global Warming Countermeasures” (a top-level office) by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. This recognizes the use of automated modulation of office lighting and a highperformance air-conditioning system, along with other aspects such as employee energy-saving initiatives. This photovoltaic power plant in Kumamoto is the first mega solar project MC has built and is operating in Japan. CO2 Emissions Assessment MC is working to reduce CO2 emissions in all business situations, including office work and logistics. MC has been disclosing environmental performance information since 2003 under the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)*, including our CO2 emissions data as well as details on how we are addressing climate change. As part of ongoing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint, in April 2009 MC launched our “CO2 Action Project,” designed to promote the reduction of CO2 throughout our Japanese offices as well as our business activities. MC’s CO2 emissions (indirect CO2 emissions from electricity consumption) in the year ended March 2013 on a nonconsolidated basis were 2,801 tons, approximately 3% lower than the previous year. Furthermore, our direct CO2 emissions from fuel consumption and indirect CO2 emissions from electricity consumption on a consolidated, global basis in the year ended March 2012 totaled approximately 3.33 million tons, roughly a 9% decrease This offshore wind farm is run by Eneco, MC’s partner in an offshore from the previous year. wind farm planned for the Netherlands. In addition, MC achieved carbon neutrality for our operations on a non-consolidated basis over the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012). During this period, MC’s CO2 emissions (on a non-consolidated basis) totaled approximately 430,000 tons, which we offset using emissions credits certified by the United Nations. * Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP): A project conducted in conjunction with institutional investors that requires major companies around the world to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions as well as climate change strategies. 80 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Contributing to a Low-carbon Society Through Business MC is contributing to the creation of a low-carbon society Renewable Energy Share in Mitsubishi Corporation’s Equity Share of Power Generation through businesses such as transportation infrastructure and (units: MW) renewable energy projects.

Preservation of Biodiversity Humanity benefits greatly from the services provided by ecosystems replete with diverse forms of life. These ecosystem services are varied and multifaceted, supplying us with food and water, regulating the climate and purifying the water we drink. What enables all of these natural benefits is biodiversity. Similarly, MC benefits from the services that ecosystems provide in many regions worldwide. Accordingly, MC views the preservation of biodiversity as a vitally important issue. To support our commitment, MC strives to mitigate the impact that our businesses have on biodiversity, and seeks ways to contribute to ecosystem conservation through our businesses and social contribution activities designed to protect A coal mining site before (top) and after (bottom) environmental rehabilitation. the environment. 81 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Environmental Conservation Activities MC conducts various philanthropic activities designed to protect the environment in order to preserve the biodiversity of our global ecosystems through partnerships with NGOs, universities, research institutes and other stakeholders.
