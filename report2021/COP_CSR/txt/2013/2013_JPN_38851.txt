Astellas responds to needs in afflicted areas, not only in Japan but also in other nations. Participation in activities to alleviate salt damage on farmland (Japan) Support for Typhoon Victims in the Philippines The Astellas Asia-Oceania Foundation made a donation of US$20,000 to NGO GMA Kapuso Foundation in order to provide relief for those affected by Typhoon Bopha, which struck southern Mindanao in the Philippines in December 2012. Column Report from an Astellas employee who joined the Great East Japan Earthquake disaster relief activities organized by Astellas labor union I took volunteer leave to participate in disaster relief activities in Otsuchi town, Iwate prefecture. What surprised me at the site was the fact that almost no progress had been made in reconstruction. I deeply felt that we had had only limited information provided by the media, and paid little attention to the disaster-stricken areas. I supported the setup of “Herb Garden,” which was a place of relief for people living in temporary housing, and helped the development of a planned construction site for Kirikiri nursery school, which had been washed away in the tsunami. I do not think I did something special for Otsuchi town, but I was able to feel the seriousness of the disaster through the volunteer work and listen to the feelings of the affected people, and through these precious experiences, I have started to think about what they really would like us to do.

Astellas Pharma Inc. Annual Report 2013 065 Basic Policy Astellas understands that maintaining a healthy global environment is essential for building a sustainable society and is also an important element in maintaining sound business activities. In addition to complying with legal regulations covering various environmental issues, companies must fulfill their corporate social responsibilities in order to sustainably grow. If they cannot meet their responsibilities, their corporate value could be damaged due to a loss of social trust. Going forward, Astellas aspires to be a responsible corporation based on a long-term global perspective that keeps future generations in mind. At the same time, we will continue efforts to address regional social issues and pursue corporate activities in harmony with the global environment.

This was despite an increase in indirect CO2 emissions*2 caused by deterioration in the CO2 emission coefficient of Japan’s electricity providers. In Europe, moreover, we began utilizing renewable energy sources, such as wind and biomass, which reduced our reliance on fossil fuels. As for environmental protection, we achieved our numerical target for fiscal 2015 for reductions in water usage three years ahead of schedule. We also again achieved our targets for zero emission of waste in fiscal 2012, as we have done since fiscal 2008. In addition, the Company’s biodiversity index was improved compared with the previous year. *1 Direct GHG emissions: The amount of greenhouse gases that a company emits directly from its business facilities through the combustion of fossil fuels, natural gas, and the like (Scope 1). *2 Indirect GHG emissions: The amount of greenhouse gases that a company emits indirectly, such as through purchases of electricity and steam (Scope 2).

Accordingly, we have positioned measures to address this problem as one of our key management priorities.

Column Global Warming Prevention Measures Using Renewable Energy Corporate Governance Within the premises of its Kerry Plant in Ireland, Astellas has installed a wind turbine power generation station—measuring 99m in total height, including a 73m-long support pillar and a 53m rotor diameter—as well as a wood chip biomass boiler that uses forest thinning timber as its main fuel source. Both facilities started operation in March 2012. The use of wind power generation enables the plant to reduce the volume of purchased electricity. In fiscal 2012, it was able to cut such purchases by the equivalent of around 800 tons of CO2 emissions. Thanks to the operation of the wood chip biomass boiler, moreover, the plant’s boilers no longer use diesel oil. In fiscal 2012, this equated to a reduction of around 2,200 tons of CO2 emissions that would otherwise have been generated through diesel oil combustion. Financial Section Astellas Pharma Inc.

Long-Term Vision and Astellas is an Astellas’ Corporate Culture ever-changing company. Q. Looking at Astellas’ corporate culture overall, what are its unique characteristics? Also, what are your views on Astellas’ long-term direction? Nogimori: In an ideal world, a company’s culture should take root naturally over a period of many years. However, Astellas was formed through the merger of two companies with different cultures, on top of which we chose a path aimed at rapid global development. As a result, we have had to establish values that can be shared by employees worldwide. We came up with the Five Messages for the Astellas Way through a process of holding exhaustive discussions with all members of the Global Management Committee. The Five Messages consist of easy-to-understand values and a code of conduct for all, and place patients at the heart of all decisions and actions. Putting them into practice is no easy task. Conversely, if all employees can strive to observe these values and actions, then I am certain we will become a wonderful company without equal. Oishi: My impression is that Astellas is a company for which the keywords “sincere” and “fair” fit perfectly. Also, hearing Mr. Nogimori talk about the history of the 084 Astellas Pharma Inc.

Accordingly, we must review the desired corporate culture to take hold. our organizational structure and various frameworks conEmployees Nogimori: I am always saying to people that Astellas is stantly so that when there is change we can respond flexan ever-changing company. By this, I am not referring ibly and swiftly to turn that change into an opportunity. to implementing sweeping reforms under pressure from Indeed, a major challenge for Astellas going forward will changes in the business environment. I want Astellas to be the “resilience” with which it responds to changes in be a company that continuously rises to the challenge of the business environment. change on a daily basis, even if the effort seems munSociety dane, and responds assertively to changing times. On this aspect, I feel that today’s management has come pretty close to achieving the ideal. Astellas identifies the kind of company Oishi: Developing new drugs that do not yet exist and it wants to be and then makes every delivering them to patients who are waiting for such drugs effort to follow a step by step path. is a wonderful endeavor. The progressive aging of populaEnvironment tions, primarily in the developed world, is increasing health awareness and placing more and more demand on healthcare systems. Astellas’ execution of its business model in response to such needs is also significant in a social context. We can foster a high-motivation corporate culture by enabling employees to take pride in their jobs and aspire Compliance to do more while doing their work day after day with passion and enthusiasm. Of course, this kind of company ought to attract outstanding human resources. Because Astellas possesses strong drug development capabilities even when viewed from a global perspective, I would like to see Astellas focus on these strengths while working to Corporate Governance achieve its big dreams and aspirations. Nogimori: I think that concentrating on new drugs underpinned by research and development while adapting deftly to changes in the external environment is the right direction to take at this point in time. I say this because there are many unmet medical needs and delivering innovative new drugs to patients is Astellas’ raison d’être.
