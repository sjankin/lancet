While we encourage vendors to improve their own environmental performance, the most direct way we can reduce emissions from travel is by reducing travel itself. To do so, we have made significant investments in virtual collaboration technologies. These include 27 highdefinition (HD) telepresence systems, 84 conference room camera systems, and a companywide webcam conferencing option. Our HD systems were in use during 47 percent of our regular business hours on average during In fiscal year 2013, nonconference business travel fiscal year 2013.

Data center energy use has the largest environmental impact of Autodesk IT operations. In fiscal year 2013, it resulted in 1,860 metric tons of CO2e emissions, about 3 percent of Autodesk’s carbon footprint and a decrease of 13 percent compared with the base year, fiscal year 2009. To reduce energy use in our data centers, we use the ENERGY STAR rating system to select the most efficient hardware. We also invest in server virtualization, which saves energy by optimizing usage and therefore decreasing the need to run and cool physical servers. So far, Autodesk has virtualized about 86 percent of its servers. In late 2011, Autodesk completed a major upgrade to the company’s primary data centers. Improvements including new servers, advanced virtualization, and smart storage have reduced energy use and associated GHG emissions at the new, consolidated facility by 62 percent while decreasing IT infrastructure costs by US$7 million annually. This represents a savings of 15 percent of Autodesk’s IT infrastructure budget. 28 Autodesk Sustainability in Action Progress Report FY2013 “When “Whenwe weconsider considerthe thefootprint footprintofof hardware.

However, since we are not a major water consumer, it does not pose a material risk to our operations. Fiscal year 2013 saw some of the warmest and driest months on record, resulting in a drought that covered more than 65 percent of the contiguous United States, and affected many other nations worldwide, including locations with Autodesk offices. We use some water in our office buildings for kitchens, cooling, and plumbing. As part of our everyday efforts to reduce Autodesk’s environmental impact, we take steps in many offices to reduce our water consumption through efficient fixtures and water closets, right-size cooling equipment, and conservation efforts such as using gray water, where possible. Because we lease our facilities, we do not currently have access to reliable water usage data across our operations. As with energy use and waste data, we are working with our building owners and facility managers at priority locations to gather water performance data as part of our Two of our facilities in San Rafael use reclaimed water for environmental measurement system. In fiscal year 2013, flushing toilets and rely on weather-sensitive irrigation we used 7.6 million liters of water in one building at our systems.

While we have yet to identify significant areas of water scarcity within our global operations, we will continue to investigate this issue and related risks during the coming years. Environmental compliance As stated in our environmental policy, Autodesk will meet or exceed all applicable environmental laws and regulations related to our business operations. In fiscal year 2013, we were not cited or fined for noncompliance of any environmental laws or regulations. 32 Autodesk Sustainability in Action Progress Report FY2013 Ethics and compliance The trust we place in each other and the relationships we forge are becoming ever more important, as people on the planet become increasingly interconnected.

Download the Human Rights Policy. This policy takes into account the results of a high-level analysis conducted in 2012 and early 2013, which reviewed Autodesk’s most relevant current and future human rights risks and opportunities.
