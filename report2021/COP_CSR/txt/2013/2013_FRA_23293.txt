In 2012 the publication of our Group Code of Conduct was instrumental in mobilising our powerful global workforce with their responsibilities in this regard. We are aware more than ever of the importance of strong corporate citizenship. For Oberthur Technologies, responsible corporate citizenship lies at the heart of our business, from our inherent duty to protect our global workforce, our dedication to building honest, transparent stakeholder relationships, and our interactions with the communities that surround us, to the design and delivery of products and services that benefit society and the environment. In the year to come we will take our sustainability initiatives to the next level, focussing more heavily on reducing our environmental impacts, improving waste streams, lowering energy consumption, eliminating hazardous materials in our production processes, applying ethical sourcing procedures, benefitting the communities around us, and ensuring our employees have a fair, safe and healthy working environment. The 2012 Sustainability Report describes actions taken by Oberthur Technologies in accordance with the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, which the company has supported since 2006. The report marks Oberthur Technologies’ Communication on Progress to the UN Global Compact, and has been created on the basis of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3.1 Reporting Guidelines. 4 Company Information Report scope This report describes actions taken during the twelve month period from December 2011. It is designed to communicate Oberthur Technologies’ corporate responsibility performance, and acts as our UNGC Annual Communication on Progress. The report focuses on the activities of Oberthur Technologies: our manufacturing sites, service centres and sales offices. It shows the financial data of the Company during the reporting period and discusses sustainability activities under the direct control of Oberthur Technologies. Subcontractors and outsourced operations are excluded from the scope of this report. References to employee numbers and locations are relevant to Oberthur Technologies as at December 2012. We recognise that our stakeholders are impacted by the way we operate and they in turn influence our business. The Company considers its key stakeholder groups to be its employees, customers, shareholders, partners, suppliers, communities and society. The report aims to provide a balanced review of Oberthur Technologies’ 2012 sustainability performance and to demonstrate its planned actions for the coming year. The cases presented demonstrate our approach to sustainability across a range of business areas and the impact of our sustainability agenda within its wider sphere of influence. We have categorised our corporate responsibility actions into the following groups: Environment, People, Practices, Relationships and Products. This year we are publishing our progress against the sustainable development performance indicators which we introduced in our 2011 report. The indicators were developed with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative G3.1 Guidelines and chosen to ensure relevance to Oberthur Technologies’ operations. The report will be published on Oberthur Technologies’ corporate website and intranet. It will also be submitted for publication to the UN Global Compact website. Additionally, we will be happy to share electronic copies with our stakeholders on request. How are we doing? We welcome comments on this report, its content, style, and the sustainability initiatives we have undertaken in 2012. We are committed to continuous improvement as we progress with our sustainability actions, and we greatly value an open dialogue with our stakeholders on how we might improve our reporting and performance in the years to come.

Connecting with our stakeholders helps us to understand the sustainability issues that are material to our business and to ensure that our sustainability agenda remains in line with both our organisational goals and our stakeholders’ expectations. In 2012, we improved our stakeholder dialogue on the issue of sustainability, primarily by inviting stakeholders to share with us the topics they would most like us to monitor and report on. Our first exercise focussed on a representative cross section of our global customer base. We approached 26 major customers across the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific and the Middle East. We also began to engage a selection of our key global suppliers.
