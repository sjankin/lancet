Page 09 Fuji Electric Report 2013 To Our Stakeholders Contributing to the realization of a safe, secure and sustainable society through global expansion in the energy-related businesses On behalf of Fuji Electric, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to our stakeholders for their continued support and understanding. Embodied in Fuji Electric’s Corporate Philosophy is our pledge, as responsible corporate citizens in a global society, to strengthen relationships of trust with stakeholders and fulfill our obligations to them in good faith. Building on the technology and experience accumulated throughout the 90 years since the Company’s founding, Fuji Electric aims to pursue technological innovation in electric and thermal energy, and to continue creating high value-added, environmentally friendly products that use energy with maximum efficiency. March 2013 marked the end of my third year in office as president. Since Lehman Brothers’ collapse and the financial crisis it precipitated, the business climate has been harsh. This led Fuji Electric to adopt 1) Expand energy-related businesses, 2) Globalize, and 3) Realize concerted strength as a team, as the three planks to our management policy. In addition to reorganizing with a view to better harnessing our strength in energy-related businesses, we have also undertaken several structural reforms in a bid to further consolidate our earnings foundation. At the same time, Fuji Electric has been working to globalize in order to expand its business and grow as a company. Japan is now grappling with the aging of social and industrial infrastructure on a scale hitherto unseen, while in emerging nations around the world, rapid development in recent years has given rise to power shortages and environmental problems. Fuji Electric can contribute significantly to resolving these social issues by drawing on its prowess in energy-related technology. We aim to win Fuji Electric further endorsement worldwide by further expanding our energy-related businesses globally while also working toward harmony with the ever-changing natural environment. We hope that you will hold Fuji Electric to high expectations in the future. Michihiro Kitazawa President and Representative Director Fuji Electric Co., Ltd.

Michihiro Kitazawa President and Representative Director Fuji Electric Co., Ltd. Page 15 Fuji Electric Report 2013 Review of Operations — Financial Results for Fiscal 2012 Increase in Sales and Profits Net sales increased ¥42.2 billion year on year, to ¥745.8 billion, largely due to the contributions of large-scale contracts in the power generation business and the depreciation of the Japanese yen. Operating income improved ¥2.7 billion year on year, to ¥22.0 billion.
