Sustainability Report 2012 KapitelbalkenPreface Lorem 3 2012 was another dynamic year for Postbank’s business in which we were faced with a variety of challenges. Despite these major tasks we happily fulfilled our social and company responsibilities to our customers, employees and shareholders. Because I am still totally convinced that the economy will only be really successful when it is orientated towards sustainability. After I had taken over as Chairman of the Board from my predecessor Stefan Jütte on 1st July 2012, in my new role I had to find out what motivates the Postbank Group’s employees. From numerous interviews with individuals and groups I have already been able to take away many ideas and suggestions. I was pleased to establish, among other things, that the willingness of my colleagues to give their commitment to society and to voluntary posts is extremely great. Entirely in the spirit of our Postbank agenda: “We’re doing it together!” we will in the future gather this social commitment in, among other things, a new project and jointly implement it. Children are the future of our society. And there could scarcely be a better investment than in the education of the children of Germany. Because education means help towards self-help. So with the slogan “We’re for Children –Education is the Future!”, together with our new partner Save the Children Deutschland e.V. we will jointly develop a nationwide education project in which we work with children, parents and teachers on improving children’s motivation to learn and success in learning. Our common goal is to permanently improve educational opportunities in Germany. I cordially invite you to support us in this project. Because “We” includes all of us: my colleagues, myself and also our customers and shareholders. Our sustainability report, which has been produced in accordance with the GRI regulations, gives you an idea of how we fulfilled our responsibilities in 2012. We have taken a large number of measures from social aspects to environmental and climate protection. At the same time, as a signatory we feel obliged to observe the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, the progress report on which is an element of this report. I wish you a stimulating read and I am already looking forward to telling you more about our partnership with Save the Children. Kind regards Yours Frank Strauß Chairman of the Board Deutsche Postbank AG 4 Contents Contents Preface

the main parameters set out below. Calculation methodology The calculation of the consumption of natural resources is based on the following calculation methodology and distinctions: • Conversion factors The VfU indices are used for the conversion of power consumption into CO2 emissions. • Buildings Statements on buildings relate to the larger properties (owned and leased) of the Postbank Group (> 10,000 m2). As at 31.12.2012 this covers 20 properties. These buildings account for about 58 % of the net floor area and about 52 % of the employees (with part-time employees converted to fulltime equivalents). Scope of the report The Postbank Group’s smaller leased properties (including those leased to The present report covers the period from Postbank Filialvertrieb AG) have been January to December 2012 and therefore estimated.

Here the focus is on • S upporting social aspects • Protecting the environment • Contributing to a robust economic environment. We see it as our task to make an active contribution to climate protection and to our social environment, so sustainability is an important element of our company strategy. By this means we want to secure our company’s long-term success and to convey the model of sustainability to every one of our employees. In our selfimage, sustainability should be a way of life and not just something to think about. We undertake to provide our employees with attractive and secure employment conditions and to protect natural resources. We as a company are an integral part of the society in which we operate. Our goal is therefore to create added value for our stakeholders. As the biggest private customer bank in Germany we see ourselves as obliged to conform to our model.

These health campaigns are supported by regular information in Postbank’s internal staff magazine and intranet.

In addition, in 2012 with the “Fit in the Workplace” campaign, short training modules were piloted directly in the workplace. A step-by-step rollout is planned. 38 Social Sustainability Just like Postbank, its employees are also accepting their social responsibility. Mutual support, external commitment and joint further development of the bank are a fixed part of the company culture. Social commitment Committed employees involved in voluntary work: The private developer Since the 2004 tsunami Monika Kranz has been travelling to Sri Lanka twice a year to help people. 26 December 2004 was the trigger for Munich Postbank employee Monika Kranz to start taking her holidays in a completely different way. That day, the earth shook under the Indian Ocean. The tsunami destroyed large parts of the island of Sri Lanka on which Mrs. Kranz had taken a holiday shortly before. “I saw the destruction on the television and was totally shocked,” she remembers. She immediately asked herself: “How can I help?” This lady from Munich contacted people in Bentota that she had got to know on her holiday. The idea of a charity campaign for Sri Lanka took root among her colleagues. “I then said: I’m going there to see where I can help. Since then it’s taken on a life of its own”, says Mrs. Kranz. Since 2004 she has produced a report twice a year. In this she tells of the journeys she has made to Bentota at her own expense and of the houses that have been built thanks to her colleagues’ donations. About 2,000 Euros are collected before each trip. All the donations that she brings that country flow into the construction of these little masonry houses. Nearly 20 have already been built with her aid. If you include the outbuildings, roofs and floors, that have been constructed with German donations, the number is even higher. “Today it’s no longer about tsunami victims,” says Mrs. Kranz, “but about supporting the poor in the region.” Social Sustainability 39 Committed employees involved in voluntary work: The woodland kindergarten teacher Often it’s the small ideas that give rise to long-term projects. When he could not find a suitable kindergarten place for his daughter, Dirk Wonka immediately set up his own woodland kindergarten. At first glance this looks a little bit like “Löwenzahn”, the programme in which Peter Lustig used to explore and explain the world. The 18-metre long vehicle on the edge of the wood forms the basecamp for the three to five-year-old “nature researchers.” Dirk Wonka is the developer and owner of the “Naturforscher” (Nature Researchers) woodland kindergarten, for which the vehicle on the edge of the wood serves as a shelter. In March 2010 he took the decision to set up his own kindergarten. “At that time our little daughter was due to attend a woodland kindergarten in the next village,” he recalls. But it had just dismissed its lady kindergarten teacher with many years’ service. “So I said: Inge, I’ll take you on. We’ll set up our own woodland kindergarten.” In no time at all Wonka found a plot on the edge of a wood that was already designated as a play area but had not been used. After a planning period of only four months, solid support from family, friends and the urban authorities as well as his own startup funding, he was able to take in the first children at Naturforscher in August 2010. Today there are already nearly 20 girls and boys that meet at the research vehicle every morning. With their rucksacks, weatherproof clothing and handcarts, they set off in sunshine, wind and rain, even in the cold winter, through the thick branches. There they can climb, play and paint to their heart’s content. Nature itself provides the materials for this: trees, leaves and roots. “The children have incredible fun with this. And when they are collected after lunch, they are mostly content because they’ve spent the entire day in the wild,” states Wonka. For him, his work in the woodland kindergarten is more than just a hobby. “It is a very satisfying activity. I see that we can make something happen.” 40 Social Sustainability Committed employees involved in voluntary work: The bearer of happiness Stephanie Kohtz regularly brings a smile to the A dozen senior citizens are sitting on the circle of faces of dementia patients in a Cologne ward with chairs in the recreation room when the dogs charge her dogs. into the room. “Ah, you two,” escapes from the lips of a lady patient who had previously sat silently in Even hours before she visits, the senior citizens have her chair. “I often notice that, with the dogs, a been asking again and again: “When are the dogs spark of life reappears in previously expressionless coming?” That’s what the geriatric nurse on the eyes,” says Stephanie Kohtz. ward says.

This process is also supported by Postbank Ideas Management. It ensures that those involved are kept up to date. If it is an idea with no calculable benefit, this is passed on immediately to the relevant specialist department for rapid implementation. The department also informs the person submitting the idea when it is implemented.

There are some of these committed and creative employees at Postbank, as a glance at the figures for ideas submitted shows. In 2011 Ideas Management collected over 3,000 suggestions from all departments. 600 of these were even submitted within the “feedback loop”, in other words they are ideas that upon implementation bring a calculable benefit for Postbank– and a cash bonus for the person that submitted the idea.

Then we split into small groups, with each group being allocated to a specific children’s age group. Now the task was to produce a timetable with age-specific activities for the children for the day. The emphasis here was on combining fun with giving them a first glimpse of professional life. On the “Girls’ and Boys’ Day” the small groups were also responsible for looking after their specific age groups. The day started at 9 o’clock and it was just as interesting and fun as it was stressful. The children and young people aged between 10 and 16 got to know the various departments of BHW Bausparkasse e.g. the Customer Care Centre and the main kitchen. Besides building their dream homes, the children and young people learnt more about saving for a home and could practice job interviews in front of a camera. They also visited the company fire station and lastly there was a small fire to be put out. Our conclusion is: The “2012 Girls’ and Boys’ Day” was an unforgettable day, not just for the children but also for us who were looking after them! 48 Social Sustainability Now it’s the girls’ turn! At Postbank Systems AG’s “2012 Girls’ Day” the participants were surprised by how IT was so much a part of their everyday lives. On 26 April Postbank Systems AG issued invitations to the “2012 Girls’ Day” to let girls have a look behind the scenes in IT. Many of the participants did not think it would be of any interest to them. Nevertheless they were all excited to find out what they were going to see. “I will take away your fear of the unknown,” explained staff lecturer Alexandra Bestmann. “The proportion of women in the IT sector is still only about 20 %.” The 25 or so participants were able to set aside their fear of the unknown right from the start since they had to interview each other and then present the session. It emerged that although almost all the girls stated that they were not interested in technology, almost all of them own what they refer to as “standard equipment”: television, laptop, mobile phone and iPod. “For you it’s quite normal to use this little bit of IT,” said Alexandra Bestmann. “And in principle that’s no different to what we have here on a bigger scale.” Things got really exciting when the girls were allowed to take a peep at the company’s practical work in the course of a company tour. First of all they learnt something about IT security. Security Analyst Angelika Holl explained to the girls how to choose a really good password, what phishing and trojans are and how careful they must be when they use Facebook. Then the girls had really good fun with Application Analyst Sascha Sehr who let them design their own websites with photos and text that they themselves had to come up with. The ideas were soon flowing. In the end the group’s motto was “Women’s power at Postbank” and they created their own slogan: “Now it’s the girls’ turn so men, dress up warm!” The fact that the day was a success was shown at the end of the day when the word was: “Perhaps this field is of interest to me after all.” Social Sustainability 49 The Group Ambassador Programme Postbank grants a total of 12 North Rhine Westphalia (NRW)/Germany scholarships to The Group Ambassador Programme was talented students of Rheinische Friedrichset up by Postbank in 2009.

And where the food is served, two employees are assisted by a disabled colleague. Their employer, which describes itself as a social company rather than a social project, makes this possible. Elke Seyband, the Managing Director of Regenbogen Arbeit gGmbH, explains: “With a social sector company, the main aim is not to maximise profits but to create jobs and social security.” About 60 % of the employees of Regenbogen Arbeit are people with physical ailments or social problems who have hardly any opportunities in the employment market. In addition to Postbank, the company already provides freshly prepared lunches in four works canteens and a school canteen. And for Torsten Goldmann, the Munich Site Services Manager, when he was looking for a new canteen operator it had already been decided that he wanted to support a social integration company. “Postbank had committed to a policy of social sustainability and social commitment is very important to us. Cost pressure is of course noticeable everywhere but savings must not be made in the wrong places,” stresses Goldmann. He was supported in Social Sustainability 53 Postbank is particularly committed to supporting children and young people. The aim is to give them an opportunity to enjoy a future worth living.

Originally organised on the initiative of the staff, in recent years both employees and external artists have been given an opportunity to exhibit their works of art. As a result of increasing demand, initially from internal painters, photographers and sculptors and later from external ones, the exhibition has constantly expanded. Students of the Hamburg art academies in particular use the site’s gallery for their projects. Now the site’s employees can enjoy four to six different exhibitions a year. The varied techniques, motifs, sizes and designs lead to interesting conversations and increase the artists’ exposure. Social Sustainability 57 Older people are a growing sector of society. Their numbers are increasing and they are growing in importance. In 2035 almost half the people in Germany will be over 50 years old and that will make its population one of the oldest in the world. Demographic change Demographic development In terms of consumption, the proportion of the over-fifties is already almost 50 % and as a result of demographic change it is constantly growing. A representative study by the Institute for Demoscopy in Allensbach, for which 4,200 people aged between 65 and 85 were surveyed, resulted in the following core statements: • Today senior citizens in Germany feel ten years younger than they actually are and they have a high level of vitality. • Over 85 % are very satisfied with their current lifestyle.

With its company measures to protect the environment and climate Postbank is striving to meet this precondition. Environmental guidelines As early as 2008 Postbank dedicated itself to active environmental and climate protection with its voluntary introduction of an environmental management system (EMS). This includes Group-wide environmental guidelines consisting of six basic principles that specify Postbank’s rules with regard to ecological responsibility. As a fixed component of company strategy, the principles are binding on all employees and they are taken into account in all business policy decisions. Postbank’s environmental management system implements these rules on the “Plan, Do, Check, Act” loop principle according to these guidelines: Checking the rules in the course of the internal audit, Hamelin, November 2012 • In the first step, “Plan”, Postbank specifies ecological and/or sustainable goals and measures as set down in the conDeutsche Postbank AG’s environmental guidelines text of the Corporate Responsibility Programme. • Implementation of the agreed goals occurs in the second step “Do”.

Energy subcontracting In 2009 Postbank together with HOCHTIEF Energy Management (HTEM) launched the energy saving partnership. As a first step HTEM experts studied 21 Postbank buildings nationwide for potential energy savings and presented the results to Postbank and produced energy passes for all the buildings to determine the status quo. To date the Postbank sites of Leipzig, Hamburg, Karlsruhe, Essen, Frankfurt and Ludwigshafen have been made more energy efficient on this basis e.g. in the areas of lighting and heat generation, with the use of combined power and heating, by the replacement of windows etc. A 10-year monitoring programme of the New heat exchanger for the As a consequence, HOCHTIEF’s energy improved sites will ensure that the savings more efficient use of energy, specialists were able to reduce electricity are secured not just short-term but also Hamburg site consumption by about 9,500 MWh p. a. for the long term. and heating consumption by about 10,700 MWh p.a. and even to significantly In addition to this, for the Munich, Bonn exceed the agreed savings guarantees. and Dortmund sites, supply subcontracThe electricity saving is approximately ting contracts have been agreed with equivalent to the consumption of 2,700 HTEM.

Participants first discussed questions such as these in small groups: • What has made us as Postbank strong? • What can we be proud of? • What did we not like? • What do we as Postbank want to stand for in the future? • How do we want to work together in the future? Because they belonged to various divisions of the company, the participants discussed the subjects from various perspectives.

The online training clip alone has already been accessed over 400 times. What is more, in future there will be close cooperation with ComLab and the University of Hohenheim in order to recognise and correct undesirable developments. The fact that the efforts made are actually having an effect is evidenced by a current study on the improved comprehensibility of the “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQs).

The Hohenheim index shows the level of comprehensibility on a scale from 0 to 20, with level 20 being the highest score. 104 Economic Sustainability Compliance and protection from money laundering are integral elements of every financial institution. For Postbank this means protecting itself and all its stakeholders by means of the relevant legislation and processes based on other bodies of rules and regulations. Compliance and protection against money laundering Compliance “Compliance” consequently means “Acting in accordance with applicable Financial markets are based to a considelegislation, regulatory provisions and inrable extent on the confidence of market ternal rules.” Within Deutsch Postbank players.

To avoid possible abuse, Postbank therefore invests in particular in the functionality and security of its self-service machines and online banking software.

A possible increase in customers’ concerns resulting from the activities of service portals on the internet such as selbstauskunft.net that record and pass on requests for information from customers to firms is yet to be seen. Customers have also once again made a smaller number of submissions to the data protection authority so Postbank recorded only 20 such cases in 2012.

On the basis of this information, the supplier is assessed as to whether it meets the preconditions of environmental policy for a long-term business partnership with Postbank. Paper policy Paper is amongst the major resources of Postbank, being a financial institution. For this reason it is of the greatest relevance to Postbank that there is responsible use of paper products. So in 2008 the “Paper policy” was agreed for the purchase of paper products. This applies to both Postbank and its subsidiaries and to all their suppliers. The guidelines categorically ban the use of paper products that originate from tropical rainforests, virgin forests, protected ancient forests or those worthy of protection or that are produced or extracted from illegal felling. Based on this and in accordance with the principles of sustainable forestry, only certified paper products from socially, ecologically and commercially sustainable forest management or recycled materials are used. The guidelines also call for the efficient handling of paper products that is sparing with resources.
