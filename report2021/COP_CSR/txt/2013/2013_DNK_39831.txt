No basis was found for impairment. In the impairment tests, the carrying amount of the assets is compared to the discounted value of future cash flows. The future cash flows are based on budgets and Management's estimates of the expected development in the next five years. Revenue, EBIT, working capital, discount rate and growth assumptions are the most material parameters in the calculations. At 31 August 2013, an average growth rate of 8% in the five‐year period for revenue and an expected overall improvement in the EBIT margin in the five‐year period of approximately 1 percentage point have been applied. Working capital is assumed to constitute 14‐16% of revenue. A pre‐tax discount rate of 10% has been applied in the impairment test. A long‐term growth rate of 2‐5%, corresponding to estimated market growth, has been applied in the terminal period. At 31 August 2012, an average growth rate of 8% in the five‐year period for revenue and an expected overall improvement in the EBIT margin in the five‐year period of approximately 2 percentage points were applied. Working capital was assumed to constitute 15‐17% of revenue. A pre‐ tax discount rate of 9% was applied in the impairment test. A long‐term growth rate of 2‐5%, corresponding to estimated market growth, was applied in the terminal period. CHR.

HANSEN – ANNUAL REPORT 2012/13 – Financial statements Group 68 Note 24 ‐ Financial assets and liabilities ‐ continued FINANCIAL RISKS Being an international company, Chr. Hansen is exposed to currency and interest rate fluctuations. Chr. Hansen's corporate treasury department monitors and manages risks related to currency exposure and interest rate levels in accordance with the corporate Treasury Procedure approved by the Board of Directors. The procedure reflects how Chr. Hansen manages financial risks and contains rules defining not only how financial instruments are used to hedge risks, but also an acceptable level of risk exposure and use of counterparties. Funding and liquidity Funding and adequate liquidity are fundamental factors in driving an expanding business, and management of both is an integrated part of Chr. Hansen's continuous budget and forecasting process. To ensure focus on managing the risks related to funding and liquidity, Chr. Hansen's corporate Treasury department manages and monitors funding and liquidity for the entire Group, and ensures the availability of required liquidity through cash management and uncommitted as well as committed facilities. Foreign exchange To reduce exposure to exchange rate changes, Chr. Hansen trades primarily in EUR or USD. However, trading also takes place in other currencies. Currency exposure is mainly managed by having revenue and expenses in the same currency. Where this is insufficient to manage the risk, Chr. Hansen's corporate Treasury department performs hedging in accordance with the Treasury Procedure. Please refer to note 29 for further information. Interest rates Interest rate risk mainly relates to interest on debt. Debt is financed at the market rate plus a margin. The risk is limited by entering into interest‐ hedging agreements in accordance with the Treasury Procedure (note 29). Credit Credit risks mainly relate to trade receivables and other receivables. The risk is limited due to Chr. Hansen's diverse customer base representing multiple industries and businesses on international markets where the Company cooperates with many large and medium‐sized partners. When dealing with smaller businesses, the Company sells mainly through distributors, thus reducing the credit risk regarding these customers. Chr. Hansen monitors credit risk by having internal credit lines for each debtor based on credit rating and regional credit exposure. Counterparty risk Counterparty risk for cash, deposits and financial instruments is handled by working only with financial institutions that have a satisfactory long‐term credit rating. The current level of Chr. Hansen's core financial counterparties' long‐term credit rating is in the AA or the A category. Chr. Hansen's Treasury Procedure also defines a credit limit for each counterparty.

The Group only enters into hedging agreements that relate to the underlying business. Interest rate risk Interest rate swaps are used for cash flow hedging, where the underlying floating interest rates are hedged.

There is no currency risk related to the swaps for the Group. The interest on the Group's financing facilities is based on floating interest plus a margin. At 31 August 2013, 70% of outstanding debt was hedged through interest rate swaps or loans with a fixed interest rate.

Hansen Holding A/S is exposed to market risk, primarily risks relating to currency and interest, and uses financial instruments to hedge of recognized and future transactions. Chr. Hansen Holding A/S only enters into hedging agreements that relate to the underlying business. Interest rate risk Interest rate swaps are used for cash flow hedging by hedging the underlying floating interest rates. At 31 August 2013, the outstanding interest swaps had the following market value: Market value of open interest rate swaps 2013 Recognized in Recognized in Contract Gain/loss at 31 income fair value amount August statement reserve EUR 75 million interest rate swaps, expiry February 2016 75.0 0.2 ‐ 0.2 EUR 150 million interest rate swaps, expiry 15 April 2015 150.0 (3.0) ‐ (3.0) USD 75 million interest rate swaps, expiry 15 April 2015 56.7 (1.2) ‐ (1.2) 281.7 (4.0) ‐ (4.0) 2012 Recognized in Recognized in Contract Gain/loss at 31 income fair value amount August statement reserve EUR 180 million interest rate swaps, expiry 15 April 2015 180.0 (5.3) ‐ (5.3) USD 75 million interest rate swaps, expiry 15 April 2015 59.5 (2.1) ‐ (2.1) 239.5 (7.4) ‐ (7.4) The fair value is calculated using a valuation model, based primarily on observable market data. There is no currency risk related to the swaps for the Group. The interest on the Company's financing facilities is based on floating interest plus a margin. At 31 August 2013, 92% of outstanding debt was hedged through interest rate swaps or loans with a fixed interest rate (81% at 31 August 2012). The total debt had an average maturity of 2.3 years at 31 August 2013 (2.4 years at 31 August 2012). An increase of 1 percentage point in the average interest rate on the Group's interest‐ bearing debt excluding swaps will reduce the Group's earnings before tax by EUR 3.1 million during the next 12‐month period (EUR 3.0 million for the financial year 2011/12). The effect on the swaps entered into of an interest rate change of 1 percentage point will be EUR 2.8 million based on the interest change of 1 percentage point (EUR 2.4 million for the financial year 2011/12).

HANSEN – ANNUAL REPORT 2012/13 – Financial statements Parent company 96 Note 21 ‐ Credit, currency and interest rate risk Credit risk Credit risk for cash and cash equivalents and financial instruments is managed by only working with financial institutions that have a satisfactory credit rating. In general, the risk is considered to be limited. Currency risk The overall purpose of managing currency risk is to minimize the impact of short‐term currency movements on earnings and cash flow. The main exchange rate risk for the company is loans denominated in USD. It is the policy of the Company not to hedge investments in subsidiaries. Interest risk The interest on the Company's multi‐currency loan facility is based on variable interest plus a margin. Interest rate swaps are utilized to reduce the risk to the income statement. At 31 August 2013, 92% of the outstanding debt was hedged through interest rate swaps (81% at 31 August 2012). Cash flow risk Chr. Hansen Holding A/S's net interest‐bearing debt amounted to EUR 303.8 million at 31 August 2013 (EUR 297.3 million at 31 August 2012). Note 22 ‐ Commitments and contingent liabilities Operating leases Lease commitments, primarily related to car and equipment rental and due within 1 year and between 1 and 5 years, amounted to EUR 0.2 million (EUR 0.1 million in 2011/12). Payments of EUR 0.2 million were expensed in 2012/13 (EUR 0.2 million in 2011/12). Other guarantees and liabilities Chr. Hansen Holding A/S was jointly and severally liable for drawings of EUR 57.5 million on the Group's credit facility by the subsidiaries Chr. Hansen A/S and Chr. Hansen France SAS at 31 August 2013 (EUR 57.3 million on 31 August 2012). Pending court and arbitration cases Certain claims have been made against Chr. Hansen Holding A/S. Management is of the opinion that the result of these disputes will not have a significant impact on the Company's financial position. Change of control The loan facilities established in 2009/10 are subject to change of control clauses.

Employee development The average number of days of training per employee per year recorded locally in individual training records. For some small sites or offices, e.g. in Eastern Europe, the number of training days is estimated for data before 2009/10. Employee satisfaction An employee satisfaction survey is conducted at least every second year. All employees with a seniority of three months or more and who are not on leave of absence participate in the survey. Temporary employees are included if they have a contract of more than six months. Overall employee “satisfaction and motivation” and “loyalty” are measured, as is satisfaction with engagement drivers such as “professional and personal development,” “daily work” and “immediate manager.” Occupational health & safety The number of lost­time incidents (LTIs), i.e. accidents resulting in more than one day's absence from work, and the incident type are recorded. The LTI frequency is calculated as incidents resulting in more than one day's absence per million working hours, excluding sickness, maternity/paternity leave and holidays. A decrease in the frequency is an improvement. The severity of incidents is measured as the number of days away from work per incident. Quality & product safety Customer complaints Customer complaints are recorded when received. Product safety audit findings All ISO 9001, ISO 22000 and FSSC 22000 third­party audits are performed by the Company’s certifying body, Bureau Veritas Certification (BVC). If the final BVC audit report has not been received at the time of reporting, the number of non­ conformities mentioned at the audit exit meeting is used. Product retrievals An internal procedure is in place for managing incidents that can lead to the withdrawal or recall of products. All products sold by Chr. Hansen are covered by this procedure. Retrievals are recorded on the day the decision is made to retrieve.
