Full Support for the UN Global Compact Since 2005 E.ON has been committed to upholding the ten principles of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact. With more than 10,000 members from over 130 nations, the Global Compact is the worldâ€™s largest sustainability initiative. The Basis for Group Policies and Standards As a signatory we affirm our commitment to the observance of human rights, labor and environmental protection standards and the fight against corruption. Accordingly, we have anchored anti-corruption measures in our corporate policies. We participate in national and international Global Compact networks in countries such as Germany and Sweden, working across sectors to strengthen the structures that will help master these challenges around the world. The Global Compact provides us with external points of reference as we develop our Sustainability Work Program. We incorporate its principles in our policies and standards, and are guided by them in managing our internal compliance systems. Reporting on the Global Compact Principles When we became a signatory to the Global Compact, we undertook to publish an annual Communication on Progress (COP). Consequently, in our 2012 Sustainability Report we also report on our progress in implementing the Ten Principles of the Global Compact.
