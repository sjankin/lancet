We remain committed to promoting all ten principles both for ourselves as a company but also through the innovations we deliver for our customers. Customers look to SAP to help them face this world of accelerating change in real time. Based on our unparalleled knowledge of critical business processes, they expect us to help them overcome global competition; use economic, natural, and social resources more wisely; interact with customers in new and personalized ways; and process the exabytes of information that flow into their data centers each year. Our purpose as a company is clearly defined as helping the world run better and improving people’s lives. We start with ourselves as we seek to minimize our own environmental footprint and positively impact the communities in which we work. In 2012, for example, 60% of the electricity consumed by SAP came from renewable sources. We reduced our greenhouse gas emissions slightly despite strong business growth. And, our employees delivered more than 130,000 hours of volunteering in the communities in which we work. Our commitment to achieving sustainable success is further demonstrated in our Integrated Report 2012, where we integrated our sustainability and financial reporting for the first time and which also contains our communications on progress towards the UN Global Compact. Companies that will lead in the 21st century define success more broadly than financial performance. They look at their impact on the world – socially, environmentally, and economically. Our solutions give us a huge opportunity to respond to challenges and opportunities, whether that means addressing the lack of opportunity for people throughout the world or contending with stress on our ecosystems. We believe that our business success hinges on our ability to seize this opportunity and fulfill our vision to make the world run better.
