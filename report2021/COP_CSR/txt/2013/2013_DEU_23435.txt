It refers not only to our profession as a communications agency, but also to the aspect of internationalism. Over the years, media consulta has built a global network consisting of 72 agencies on all continents. In our Berlin Headquarters, people from 24 different nations work together. Ensuring employee well-being and guaranteeing them a pleasant working atmosphere, across our network, is of utmost importance to us. We highly value diversity, as well as proper payment, the rejection of all forms of discrimination and helping staff to balance family and career. But well-being and justice shall not be restricted to our employees. No person must be denied his human rights. With contributions and campaigns, media consulta shows its dedication to a world where everyone is treated fairly and gracefully. And yet, to enjoy living in a “World of Ideas”, we need a healthy planet. Countering climate change requires a combined effort and positive role models. I strongly believe that ecologically conscious businesses can influence others to reconsider their stance on environmental protection. media consulta’s headquarters demonstrate to our whole network and other firms a good example of how small adjustments can contribute to better sustainability. mc undoubtedly has a clear vision of how our “World of Ideas” must look. It should be a world where human rights are respected and guaranteed, where people are staunchly committed to fighting corruption and contributing to a greener planet. That’s why media consulta strongly supports the Global Compact and its principles with our corporate culture. Not only as the CEO, but also as a member of the International Business Leaders Forum, I am convinced that a company stands a greater chance at succeeding in the future through the continuous application of ethical strategies, based on internationally accepted moral concepts and judgements. The agency understands the absolute necessity of aligning its strategies, procedures and objectives with certain legal and environmental principles. This goes for human rights, equal opportunities, social responsibility and eco-standards of our company’s work, employees and people affected by our work worldwide. We live the principles of the Global Compact – in Berlin, Brussels (our European hub), our CIS hub in Moscow and in Rio de Janeiro, where the mc Latin America Ltda. coordinates the work of our network agencies in South America. We will continue complying with these principles in our new hubs in the Asia-Pacific and MENA/GCC reigons. I herewith confirm my continued support for the Global Compact and my renewed commitment to the initiative and its principles.

......................................................................................................... 30 4 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 1 Company Profile Following media consulta’s COP for the United Nations Global Compact the company presents its objectives focusing on working conditions at its headquarters in Berlin as a positive and productive example for the whole media consulta network and partner agencies. 1.1 Full Service Agency Network media consulta International Holding AG (mc) is an international full-service communications agency and the only German agency with a global network across all continents. With 72 network agencies, mc is present in all 28 EU Member States, the candidate countries, the EFTA states, as well as all business centres worldwide. To coordinate its global business media consulta established a system of continental hubs. Each hub supervises/will supervise the work of the network agencies in its region. mc has continental hubs for Europe (Brussels), the CIS (Moscow), as well as for Latin America/Caribbean (Rio de Janeiro). The hubs for the regions MENA/GCC, as well as Asia-Pacific will be founded in 2013 and 2014. The foundation of the continental hubs North America and Africa will follow. 5 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 1.2 Range of Services mc has its own specialised units working in the fields of strategic planning, panEuropean campaigning, public relations, advertising, media planning, audio-visual services and TV production, broadcast PR, interactive, youth, music and sports marketing, corporate publishing and event management. The agency has broad experience in these areas and in promoting pan-European and international campaigns and projects by using a comprehensive range of communication tools. Our approach to communications was honoured twice in 2013. For example, the German newspaper Handelsblatt, the absatzwirtschaft magazine and the polling institute Innofact conducted a survey among 455 marketing decision-makers of Germany’s leading companies. They were asked to give marks to the 32 most renowned German agencies. media consulta ranked first in the category ‘efficiency’ and third in ‘strategic branding’. Overall, the agency ranked third. Furthermore, the Holmes Group voted mc the DACH Consultancy of the Year (DACH: Germany, Austria and Switzerland). As an agency committed to providing its clients high-quality services regarding all communication measures, mc is certified to ISO 9001:2008, the decisive European standard when it comes to quality management. At the same time, media consulta is an environmentally-aware company, certified to ISO 14001:2004, a standard defining the framework for an environmental management system. 6 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 7 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 8 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 1.3 mc Headquarters media consulta’s two media centres in Berlin and Cologne integrate a network of expert agencies in the fields of Public Relations, Advertising, Media Planning, Corporate Publishing, Event Marketing, TV Production, Interactive, as well as Sports and Entertainment. 1.4 Employees media consulta has 2,364 specialists across the globe and 278 in Germany, each of whom is part of a team performing a whole range of modern communication services. All our consultants have specialist know-how of various PR and advertising instruments and sustain good contacts within editorial offices of national and international media. In order to maintain up-to-date services which are in line with the most specific communications needs, media consulta runs its own mc Academy. With its regulated and inspirational training sessions mc Academy enhances further education of the employees, developing their know-how in the various areas of expertise. 1.5 Client Structure media consulta’s clients include institutional and private organisations. About 50 % of all clients are public organisations, including political institutions, such as the German government and numerous ministries, the German Bundestag, the European Commission, and various national governments and associations (e.g., Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit/Association for International Cooperation, GIZ). In the NGO sector, the German Cancer Aid is one of the agency’s longstanding clients. Private clients – approximately 50 % of all mc clients – include German and international companies, such as Lidl, Generali Investments, Goodyear Dunlop, Electrolux, Turkcell, LC Waikiki and Werner & Mertz. Social ethics is not just empty words for us; they form the genuine basis for the corporate conduct of our entire network. Communication campaigns help to raise the public awareness for socio-political issues. Thus, we realise communication campaigns for public clients, which are related to our socio-political aims. To name a few examples: mc implemented a media relation and advertising campaign for the European Destinations of 9 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress Excellence (EDEN) programme. One target of this programme is to support sustainable tourism. Another example is the European Commission’s EU Ecolabel, which helps consumers to identify environmentally friendly products and services. At the same time, the label allows firms, which comply with these requirements, to use the EU Ecolabel logo in their marketing. In this way it encourages those companies to operate in a more eco-conscious manner. Furthermore, mc promotes renewable energies for the Federal Ministry of the Environment; Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety; gender equality for the European agency EIGE and helps the European Commission raise awareness for citizen rights. mc displayed its commitment to understanding among nations by conducting an integrated campaign for the German Year in Brazil 2013, as well as highlighting the project’s guiding theme “Where will we live tomorrow? Innovation, Sustainability and urbanity”. On behalf of the German Bundestag and against the background of the upcoming election in the Federal Republic, media consulta is currently promoting the right to vote. Taking social ethics seriously also means that sometimes lucrative business must be renounced. So, mc will never work for the tobacco industry, and it will never promote environmentally harmful products or services. Rather, we try to increase awareness about the importance of corporate social responsibility, and ensure that our private clients include important socio-political issues in their agenda. 10 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 2 media consulta and Corporate Social Responsibility Corporate principles are one of the highest priorities for mc. Thus, the following guidelines were initiated and play an important role in mc’s work: mc takes on social responsibility and refuses assignments that contradict the corporate principles (e.g., campaigns for the tobacco industry or for products and companies that pollute the environment). mc is staunchly committed to environmental and climate protection, and incorporate these values into the daily work of the agency. mc’s corporate principles are valid for its entire network. As market leader in the field of political communication, mc especially supports democracy and human rights (e.g., the initiative “Reporters without Borders”). With the European Commission as one of its main clients, mc explicitly supports a better European Union and also international understanding. mc is committed to the UN Millennium Goals by financing schools in Africa. mc offers excellent development opportunities for its employees. For paper waste disposal, mc cooperates with “Delphin Werkstätten”, an institution employing handicapped people giving them an opportunity to work in a normal environment. mc developed a profound plan to achieve these principles. This plan includes direct funding activities (building schools in Africa on behalf of UNICEF and the Nelson Mandela Foundation, financing of teachers’ pay and providing them with a daily warm meal, printing of schoolbooks), indirect funding activities (supporting organisations such as the Human Rights Organisation Reporters Without Borders), supporting various charters and initiatives (e.g., the Charta of Diversity and the ‘Fair Company’ initiative), and pro-actively supporting environmentally friendly work and procurement processes on a daily basis. 11 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 2.1 media consulta and the UN Global Compact In April 2008, CEO Harald Zulauf personally signed up mc for membership in the United Nations CSR initiative, the Global Compact (GC), at the United Nations in New York. This means that mc officially supports the ten principles of the GC initiative, whose goal is to promote sustainable economic management. With mc’s participation in the UN Global Compact, the agency committed itself, amongst other principles, to protecting international human rights, creating socially compatible working conditions, as well as promoting environmental protection and fighting corruption. By joining the Global Compact, Harald Zulauf, himself a long-standing member of the International Business Leaders Forum (IBLF) for sustainable economic management, further extended the CSR agenda of the worldwide agency network. 2.2 The Global Forum on Responsible Management Education Having already worked on both the 1st and 2nd Global Forum for Responsible Management Education for the UN/Global Compact Office, mc Event also assisted with the preparation of the third forum in June 2012, within the scope of the Rio+20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro. mc provided support with the definition of the target groups, target media and core messages. It also prepared a worldwide press mailing list, translated a press release into nine languages, and distributed it in 11 countries on all continents. Furthermore, the agency was responsible for the forum’s clipping service (430 clippings), drafting and producing a three-minute opening movie, as well as the layout of adverts for the promotion of the event. Mr Zulauf attended the event and was a speaker at a panel discussion. A large number of media consulta’s clients deal with issues such as the violation of human rights; pro-democracy conflicts; prevention of damage to people’s lives; health and the environment. This demonstrates that media consulta is willing to bring more public and political attention to these issues. mc therefore takes on project after project in order to raise awareness worldwide. 12 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 3 Environment: Sustainable Agency According to Principles 7, 8 and 9 Principle 7: mc supports a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Principle 8: mc undertakes initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. Principle 9: mc encourages the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. As the leading communication agency in Europe, mc will implement its own ECO audit. The ECO audit is based on ISO 14001 and the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) and consists of an environmental review. Furthermore, it establishes an environmental management system; carries out an environmental audit thoroughly assessing both the management system in place and conformity within the organisation’s policy and programme; and finally, describes the extent to which the environmental objectives have been achieved, as well as the future steps to be undertaken in order to continuously improve the organisation’s environmental performance. mc encourages environmentally-friendly transportation to and from the office among all employees. As a result, 95% of mc’s staff uses bicycles or environmentally friendly public transportation. We developed a key index system that makes it possible to measure and to continuously improve environmental management performance. The following key indices are relevant for a communication service provider: Category Absolute Key Data Relative Key Data electric power kWh p.a. kWh per employee consumption heat energy consumption kWh p.a. KWh per sqm water consumption cubic meter p.a. cubic metre per employee paper consumption kilogram p.a. kilogram per employee averaged according to paper grade paper waste disposal kilogram p.a. kilogram per employee according to disposal route disposal of electronic quantity p.a. quantity p.a. averaged by waste disposal routes and recycling mc actively pursues the reduction of electric power consumption, for example by using an efficient lighting system. Corridor lights are automatically turned off after three minutes, while office lights are controlled manually. Having divided the lighting into sections, we have lights only where we need 13 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress them, instead of lighting up the entire premises. Each unit has a schedule in place in which an allocated staff member is responsible for turning all electric devices off at the end of each day. This schedule is maintained and updated regularly, ensuring its functionality. Furthermore, in the field of technical and PC equipment, mc keeps in mind environmentally friendliness and solely uses energy efficient models which are produced from reusable and recyclable materials (e.g., Lenovo ThinkVision® flatscreens and ThinkCentre® desktop PCs etc.). The high levels of paper consumption make paper waste disposal particularly important. Hence, mc pays special attention to the use of environmentally friendly paper in the agency’s daily work and to the implementation of paper recycling in the waste disposal management. For example, we exclusively use FSC-certified and recycled paper for all office purposes. In addition, mc advises its employees to print sheets on both sides in order to keep paper consumption at a minimum. Furthermore, when purchasing products across Europe, mc pays attention not only to the traditional criteria of price and quality, but also to environmental factors. Increasingly, mc places an emphasis on recyclable products and advises its clients accordingly. Moreover, media consulta demonstrates its ecological awareness by separating waste for recycling purposes, by relying on bicycle messengers, and by replacing normal light globes with energy-saving bulbs. mc has installed its own internal quality management system, which is also responsible for the agency’s environmental management and permanent development. Regular training of the environmental management appointee is part of the environmental management system. For the continuous improvement of internal environmental performance, staff training is also of great significance in the framework of mc’s in-house educational instrument, the mc Academy. All mc employees are regularly informed about past performances and further developments of the environmental management system, and are hence in a position to communicate and actively contribute to the maintenance of environmental standards. Energy Consumption in mc’s Headquarters and its Cologne Office Part of the HQ Energy Emissions (in kg) Consumption (in kWh) Wassergasse 136.259 88.973 Inselstraße 80.754 40.619 Rungestraße 26.794 13.477 Brückenstraße 49.057 24.676 Hildeboldplatz 65.166 32.788 Cologne Overall 358.030 200.533 14 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress One way of neutralising emissions is planting trees,, something mc has already done in Malta and Cyprus, and is going to do throughout this year and 2014, with possible partners like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Nature Fund. In the future acquirement of new agency real estate, mc will optimise internal energy by:by using photovoltaic elements for producing electricity and supporting the agency’s electricity supply; using solar-thermal thermal and geothermal elements for producing heat; supporting the agency’s further climate-friendly climate measures,, such as planting green shrubbery on the agency’s roof and compounds. compounds 3.1 Green Energy for media consulta mc’s commitment to sustainability and a greener world is also embodied by the agency’s German electricity electric provider. With more than 22,000 members, Greenpeace Energy is the largest energy cooperative in Germany. It aspires to help secure the energy turnaround in the Federal Republic. Greenpeace Energy not only rejects supplying electricity from nuclear power plants, but also from coal power stations, stations where energy production is connected with extremely high CO2 emissions. So, the electricity mc consumes can be referred ref to as truly clean. The he contract with Greenpeace Energy is more than a guarantee for truly clean electricity. It is a contribution to cooperative activities for a healthier planet. Greenpeace Energy builds clean plants, provides innovative solutions such s as wind power,, conducts surveys, and remains an active participant in political debate. Every two years, it organises its Energy Congress, aiming at the provision of solutions that may pave the way for a clean energy sector. 3.2 System of Continental Hubs Establishing a system of continental hubs was of course primarily based on the idea of creating a structure better capable of responding to the needs of target markets outside Germany. In addition, clients naturally prefer to work with agencies present on-site. site. However, the new structure is also an asset for the environment.. Since projects and campaigns can be planned and implemented by personnel living in the respective target regions or countries, business flights will be reduced dramatically. dramatically A good example xample for the practicability is the work for the German Year in Brazil. Even though the pitch stage 15 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress was connected with some business flights of the company’s CEO, the project is implemented by the mc Latin America Ltda., having its headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. No staff from the Berlin headquarters is involved in the implementation process in Brazil. 3.3 Red Nose Clowns mc also participates in the programme Recycling 4 Smile which actually serves two causes at once. The project asks companies to collect their used ink and toner cartridges, so that they can be recycled. So, the agencies commitment to waste separation and proper disposal does not stop at the recycling bin. Recycling 4 Smile also has a social impact, as each cartridge delivered means a donation of at least one Euro to the Red Nose Clowns organisation, bringing a smile to children with chronic diseases. 3.4 Client Campaigns 3.4.1 Greenletter As a communications agency, media consulta has the expertise to promote environmental protection by putting it on the public agenda. Thus, an integral part of mc’s commitment to eco-consciousness is the work of clients sharing the desire for a greener planet. In 2012, for example, media consulta realised the so called ‘greenletter’ for the Chief-Information Officer of the German Federal Government. The publication, which is of course only published on the internet, embraces the topic of Green IT. 3.4.2 Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nucleart Safety In addition, media consulta applied for and won a framework contract of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety including the production of publications about renewable energies (from wind energy to hydropower) and their integration into the German electricity grid. In 2012, the agency started working on a brochure about the promise of offshore energy, which was published early this year. For the ministry, the editors of media consulta’s corporate publishing team regularly attend conferences and congresses focusing on renewable energies. 16 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 3.4.3 EU Ecolabel Another campaign highlighting mc’s eco-conscious approach is the agency’s work for the EU Ecolabel. The Ecolabel honours goods of environmental excellence and is granted to products complying with strict criteria throughout their entire lifecycle. So not only their production has to be ecologically impeccable, but also their packaging, use, and even their disposal must not be connected with the release of environmentally harmful substances. To raise awareness for the Ecolabel mc conducted an integrated communications campaign. The website www.ecolabel.eu was restructured and made more user-friendly. An accompanying campaign on Google and Facebook raised the internet communities’ awareness for the web presence. Google alone drove 35,000 users to the site. The heart of the PR campaign, mainly focussing on the United Kingdom, was an advertorial campaign in special-interest magazines and the renowned newspaper The Guardian. 3.4.4 Green Talents The agency’s latest campaign in the area of sustainability and environmental protection is conducted for the German Aerospace Center (DLR). In cooperation with the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) the DLR initiated a competition for young researchers named Green Talents International Forum for High Potentials in Sustainable Development. 3.4.5 Werner & Mertz Werner & Mertz, a leading German producer of household chemicals and an important client of mc France and mc’s Polish network agency Primum PR, shows its staunch commitment to a cleaner world through its detergent brand Forsch/Rainett (France). In France, Rainett has been cooperating with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) for a long time. The eco-friendly brand and the NGO currently conduct a campaign for water protection. mc France has been working for the brand since 2009, presenting Rainett at trade fairs and events, producing both print and audio materials on sustainability and procuring product offers for journalists. In addition, mc has also utilised Internet promotions, organised media interviews and press trips. Anything and everything to let people know that there is an established, trusted brand for green cleaning products. 17 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 4 Labour Regulations According to Principles 3, 4, 5 and 6 Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour. Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination regarding employment and occupation. media consulta deplores any form of behavior contradicting the principles mentioned above. Of course, the agency secures compliance with principle 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the Global Compact in its Berlin Headquarters and makes sure that none of its network agencies violates them. Yet, in order to fight violations mc thinks beyond its own network. We not only reject assignments from clients subverting fair labour regulations, but also ascertain that our service providers and suppliers comply with the four principles. A good example might be the selection of an appropriate supplier of running shirts we purchased for a relay in Berlin. Instead of choosing the cheapest supplier for this single event, mc relied on CONA Sports, a subsidiary of KONA Internati onal GmbH. KONA has imposed a very strict CSR codex, which perfectly fits the principles mentioned above. According to the codex, the company rejects child and compulsory labour, the freedom of every worker to join a trade union and the exploitation of workers. It supports acceptable working hours and an active health and security policy. Over the year, media consulta receives a myriad of applications from all over the world. Yet due to the special requirements of the communications sector and the need for intercultural competence, potential mc employees have to pass a comprehensive legal and professional selection procedure. Currently, the agency is planning the establishment of its own assessment centre. The highly selective approach of media consulta can on no account be regarded as an obstacle for young and ambitious professionals. Rather, it is the first measure for a pleasant everyday work culture. Only those who really fit a job profile will appreciate their daily work. Once having become a member of the mc family, employees enjoy constant protection of their working conditions, encouraging a better work-life balance. For this, the company created a number of highly efficient schemes: pension, healthcare and childcare. mc promotes and realises in good faith the right of workers and employers to freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; works towards the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour; effectively abolishes child labour and eliminates discrimination regarding employment and occupation. 18 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress media consulta’s CEO Harald Zulauf considers transparency as a prerequisite for a healthy business environment and smooth operations. So, he does not only constantly inform his employees about upcoming changes and new undertakings, but seeks regular meetings with team leaders and account managers to get their feedback and ideas. 4.1 Staff Participation – mc’s Employee Survey mc’s dedication to treat its employees fairly and respect their rights is also underpinned by the decision to conduct an employee satisfaction survey in the company’s Berlin headquarters and its Cologne branch. Employees have the opportunity to assess their situation in the areas of Daily Work Life and Career. At the same time, they are asked to assess the company’s further-training offer and its approach to ‘Corporate Social Responsibility’. In a fourth part, all employees can make comments and propose their own ideas for improving the agency’s policies in the areas of Daily Work Life, Career, as well as CSR and Further Training, thus having a chance to fashion progress. Of course, the survey is completely anonymous. The survey’s results were evaluated by an independent service provider, the Institut für Personalforschung (institute for personnel research), led by Professor Dr Christian Ernst, an expert in the field of human resources, lecturing at the renowned Cologne University of Applied Sciences. The Institute provided mc with a highly detailed report. The first three sections (Daily Work Life, Career and CSR & Further Training) showed good results. Among four answer suggestions – the first one tantamount to “excellent” and the fourth one tantamount to “insufficient” – the participants predominantly decided for the first two. While the fourth category made clear that some improvements are still necessary, the employees’ suggestions are definitely not regarded as baseless by the company’s leadership, but as a true opportunity. They are currently discussed and measures for improvement will be implemented. One such measure might be the appointment of an employee representative in each unit. This representative will be the contact person for colleagues willing to propose changes and to raise awareness of what they consider problems. The representative may report to the leader of the respective unit, or, if suggestions/objections apply for the whole group, to the CEO. In regular meetings, the CEO, the respective unit leader, and the respective representative will evaluate whether and how suggestions could be realised, and what it needs to eliminate problems. Another learning of the survey was to intensify the existing practice of regular team meetings and feedback conversations between the leader and the various members of each unit. 19 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 4.2 Diversity and Internationalism 4.2.1 International Headquarters media consulta maintains a global network in all continents. Its clients are spread all over the world. Thus, respect for cultural backgrounds and a high degree of intercultural competence is a must for the agency. mc lives its dream of a world without any ethnic or religious boundaries in its Berlin headquarters, where people from 25 different countries. Europe CIS North and Latin AsiaMiddle Africa America Pacific East Bulgaria Georgia Brazil China Israel Nigeria France Russia Peru India Germany Ukraine USA Greece Hungary Ireland Italy Netherlands Poland Romania Slovakia Slovenia Spain Turkey United Kingdom 4.2.1 Support for Parents 62% of mc’s employees are female. Additionally, 13 of 17 team leaders are women and four are men. Germany’s communications sector is known for the high degree of flexibility it demands from employees. So, it seems that the ideal person employed by an agency has to be male, single and childless. media consulta does not believe that having children and working in an agency contradict each other. There might hardly be any agency in Germany employing as many mothers as media conuslta. One key to the compatibility of family and career are part-time schemes, allowing mothers to work half a day, or to leave two hours before the workday regularly ends. In addition, regarding preschoolers, mc grants subsidies of € 1,200 for childcare offers of day nurseries, kindergartens, and similar institutions. 20 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress In cases where a full-time female employee’s contract expires during her pregnancy, she can get her contract renewed, go on maternity leave and then return to more flexible working conditions if required. For example, she could combine part-time office work with part-time work from home. 4.2.2 Charter of Diversity So, it is no surprise that mc also signed the initiative ‘Charta der Vielfalt’ (Charter of Diversity), which was initiated by leading German companies and is under the patronage of Dr. Angela Merkel, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Charta strives for fostering the recognition of and appreciation for diversity in Germany’s corporate sector. No employee should be discriminated because of his sex, nationality, cultural background or worldviews. 4.3 Serving our Employees 4.3.1 GWA Membership media consulta is a long-term member of the “Gesamtverband Kommunikationsagenturen” (General Association of Communications Agencies) in Germany. As such the agency follows the association’s guidelines. Regarding “employees and colleagues”, the GWA’s statutes say: The people in our agencies are our most important capital because their work creates values for our clients and our agencies. Therefore, we ensure appropriate working conditions, basic and advanced training and reasonable remuneration. We undertake to ensure that our employees have equality of opportunity and can work free of any discrimination. According to the charter, “every GWA agency undertakes to invest in junior staff and in employee training”. 21 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 4.3.2 Fair Company Indeed, media consulta aspires to meet the GWA’s rules. Supporting young people on their way to professionalism is of utmost importance to us. Graduates have the chance to take their first steps in their chosen profession by completing an internship or traineeship with fair conditions ditions.. We offer them genuine prospects for the future and actively avow for an end to the practice of underpaying qualified newcomers to our professions.

Since its foundation in 1993, media consulta has become the European market leader regarding political communication. Since 1998, the agency has been working for the Bundestag, the German parliament. In addition, the agency has been a long-term communications service provider of the German Federal Government, as well as of the European Commission and its various DirectoratesGeneral. Due to its worldwide network, media consulta also coordinates campaigns for institutional clients outside Europe. Of course, mc’s position makes the agency an advocate for democracy, for citizen rights and for the freedom of opinion. It also obliges media consulta to permanently keep track of political developments on a global level. mc generally advocates the payment of a fair price, as well as social standards in areas related to the production of a wide variety of goods. We therefore reject service providers guilty of human rights violations. The example of the purchase of our running shirts mentioned in point 4 also applies to the issue of human rights. 5.1 Support for Reporters without Borders Our support for the international human rights organisation Reporters without Borders is a good example for this commitment. ‘Reporters Without Borders’ (RWB) is a France-based international non-governmental organisation that advocates freedom of the press and freedom of information. This organisation has consultant status at the United Nations. 5.2 Memberships As a member of the International Public Relations Association (IPRA) and the European Association of Communications Agencies (EACA) media consulta binds itself to the principle of human rights protection. The IPRA’s code of conduct, for example, recalls “the Charter of the United Nations which determines ‘to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, and in the dignity and worth of the human person’”. Furthermore, it refers to the “Universal Declaration 24 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress of Human Rights , especially recalling Article 19. Consequently, the IPRA’s members “shall observe the principles of the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights”. 5.3 Client Campaigns 5.3.1 European Year of Citizens Since 2012, media consulta has been providing its expertise for the European Union’s DirectorateGeneral for Communication by organising and implementing a campaign for the European Year of Citizens. The year’s objective is to raise Union citizens’ awareness of the right to move and reside freely within the EU borders and, in this context, of all other rights guaranteed to citizens. Particularly young people will see how they can tangibly benefit from Union rights, as well as about policies and programmes that exist to support the exercise of those rights. At the same time, there shall be a debate about the impact and potential of the right of freedom of movement and residence. The communication and information campaign media consulta drafted and is currently implementing includes support regarding the organisation of events, as well as editorial tasks and graphic work. All the measures are monitored and finally evaluated. The agency was responsible for the media strategies and the media plans, as well as the drafting of press releases. It also supplied information and promotion materials in all EU languages. Until now mc has organised several events by teaming up with partners. 25 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 5.3.2 “UN Flüchtlingshilfe” (UN refugees relief) mc also won a contract with the UN Flüchtlingshilfe, the German donation partner of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The organisation’s goal is to protect refugees and their human rights, thus enabling them to live a humane life. According to UN Flüchtlingshilfe (UN refugees relief), its work is based on the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (CRSR), signed in 1967, and the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The media planners of mc are drafting and reporting direct response television campaigns in Germany. 26 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 6 Embracing Anti-Corruption According to Principle 10 media consulta sees corruption as not only unethical and damaging, but also as unprofitable flow. Corruption adds additional expense throughout the corporate value chain and can lead to costly operational disruptions. Current studies suggest that corruption adds more than 10 % to the cost of doing business in many countries, and that moving business from a country with low levels of corruption to a country with medium to high levels is equivalent to a 20 % tax. However, as a transparent international agency, media consulta encourages anti-corruption actions worldwide. Therefore, all of mc’s network agencies comply with strict rules to avoid corruption. 6.1 Memberships As an international network, mc is a member of both the International Public Relations Association (IPRA) and the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA). Both organisations attach great value to preventing their members to become involved in any corruption cases. This is visible in their Codes of Conduct. Excerpt from the IPRA’s Code of Conduct Principle All members shall … … act with honesty and integrity at all times Integrity so as to secure and retain the confidence of those with whom the practitioner comes into contact … be open and transparent in declaring their Transparency name, organisation and the interest they represent … avoid any professional conflicts of interest Conflict and to disclose such conflicts to affected parties when they occur Confidentiality … honour confidential information provided to them … take all reasonable steps to ensure the Accuracy truth and accuracy of all information provided … make every effort to not intentionally Falsehood disseminate false or misleading information, exercise proper care to avoid doing so 27 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress unintentionally and correct any such act promptly Deception … not obtain information by deceptive or dishonest means … not create or use any organisation to serve Disclosure an announced cause but which actually serves an undisclosed interest Profit … not sell for profit to third parties copies of documents obtained from public authorities … neither directly nor indirectly offer nor give Inducement any financial or other inducement to public representatives or the media, or other stakeholders … neither propose nor undertake any action Influence which would constitute an improper influence on public representatives, the media, or other stakeholders The PRSA has a similar and very comprhensive code of conduct that can be viewed here. 28 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 6.2 Client Campaigns An ardent opponent of any form of corruption, media consulta is proud to deliver communications solutions for or clients fighting cartels, deception, etc. Below are two examples of campaigns we conducted for such clients. 6.2.1 Directorate-General General for Competition Regarding projects for clients with an anti-corruption anti focus, media consulta’s work for the DirectorateGeneral for Competition of the European Commission clearly stands out. The agency produced an information film about the Directorate-General’s General’s leniency policy that has proven an effective weapon in the fight against cartels.. Companies involved in cartels can count on a fine reduction or even total immunity if they cooperate with the Commission – by self-reporting self and fully disclosing all relevant information. tion. The image film mc produced targets officials from competition enforcement agencies, experts in the field competition enforcement, private companies, students, postgraduates and consumers. 6.2.2 Directorate-General General Development and Cooperation Unfortunately, when it comes to the exploitation of natural resources, corruption is often a problem. On behalf of the Directorate-General General for Development and Cooperation, Cooperation mc produced the brochure Fighting Illegal Logging, Logging dealing with the Forest Law Enforcement cement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan. 29 © media consulta International Holding AG Communication on Progress 7 Prospects – the mc Foundation media consulta will carry on embracing the principles of the UN Global Compact.
