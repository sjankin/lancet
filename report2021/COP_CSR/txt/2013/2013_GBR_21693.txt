The Global Compact and its ten principles are of huge importance to Edinburgh International. Not only is it vital to ensure that the Company is aligned in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-corruption, it focusses the attitude of Edinburgh International’s staff. The Global Compact is hugely beneficial to Edinburgh International and to the other companies that chose to sign up to it. By electing to align with the Global Compact’s initiative and principles, it draws the Company’s attention to what is truly important in the way that it conducts its business. We have always taken a strong stance on what is right and wrong, and an ethical approach. By continuing to apply the ten principles and through production of this Communication on Progress, Edinburgh International has demonstrable evidence to reinforce this. Edinburgh International is dedicated to its production of an annual Communication on Progress and its promulgation to its staff, stakeholders and clients. Frank Philip MBE Managing Director Edinburgh International © Edinburgh International 2013 Commercial in Confidence Page | 2 2013 Communication on Progress Human Rights 2 Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses 2.1 ASSESSMENT On account of the nature of the work that Edinburgh International (EI) conducts and the fact that it operates in often fragile states, human rights is at the top of the agenda. It is one of the first pieces of training that all staff undertake upon joining EI, no matter with functional area they are part of. This is done so that staff understand EI’s stance on human rights and also what is expected of them in the conduct of their work. EI Staff conduct training (left). EI’s overarching Policy is our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (Code), which states: “All projects start with the foundation that respect for, and the protection of, human rights is a core principle of security provision in any society with which we interact. This includes the sometimes fragile states in which Edinburgh International operates and requires strict compliance with laws and regulations. Edinburgh International adheres to the following legislation and codes drawn up by sovereign governments and international agencies: • Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 • UK Human Rights Act 1998 • United Nations International Mine Action Standards, 2001 • Geneva Conventions of 1949 • Chemical Weapons Convention • Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment • United Nations Security Council Sanctions © Edinburgh International 2013 Commercial in Confidence Edinburgh International also believes that it has obligations and commitments that extend beyond its statutory obligations to comply with legislation. Edinburgh International will be a force for good wherever it operates, so to that end, Edinburgh International voluntarily and actively supports the following codes of practice: • International Code of Conduct for Private Security Providers • UN Global Compact • Montreux Document • Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, 2000 2013 • Code of Conduct of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent, 1995” Page | 3 Communication on Progress Human Rights The Code is provided to all staff, contractors, subcontractors and business partners, who are required to conform to its. The Code has been translated and is provided to all staff and subcontractors in their native language. Continuous training and monitoring is conducted to ensure compliance and understanding of the Code. 2.2 IMPLEMENTATION 2.2.1 Ethics Hotline EI continues to utilise its ethics hotline and email address to good effect. This anonymous hotline is used for staff and third parties (including clients) to report any suspected human rights violations from either EI staff or any violations that they may have witnessed in the course of their work. 2.2.2 Human Rights Training In order to instil the importance of human rights and to uphold the value of them, EI conducts annual training for its staff in the areas of human rights by means of its Code and Rules for the Use of Force. Practical and classroom based training and guidance is provided in several languages to accommodate for all the staff requirements. 2.2.2.1 TraKS A significant step-change in the way that EI records and monitors its human rights training is the creation and introduction of its unique Training and Knowledge System (TraKS). No other company in the industry has a system that comes close to this. TraKS enables all training, including human rights and anti-bribery, to be conducted in line with EI’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. Every single employee is on TraKS and it shows all training that they have undertaken, when they did it and who did the training. TraKS also provides an audit feature that allows managers to see what training has been done in all of EI’s programmes and projects around the world, and what has not. In this way, for example, a director in London can investigate what percentage of the personnel within a project in Iraq have conducted training in human rights, when they passed and when they are due for a refresher course. TraKS is in its initial stages and the real benefits of the system will be seen from 2013.

EI always pays substantially above the minimum wage but ensures that it is in line with other relevant government industries, e.g. the local police force, so as not to undermine their recruitment effort and/or create a false economy. 2.2.4 Public Policy Participation A key initiative in 2012, that EI continue to be involved in, is the International Code of Conduct (ICoC), which is a Swiss/UK/US Government and civil society organisation backed initiative, to ensure standards in the private security industry are maintained. EI was an initial signatory in 2010 and, in February 2012, participated in a drafting conference for an oversight mechanism. Director Richard Phillips signs the ICoC in Switzerland (right). Throughout 2012, EI also continued to support and participate in various public policy developments. EI continued its participation in the Security in Complex Environment Group (SCEG), which is the UK’s Government backed partner for the security industry, through attendance at quarterly meetings and engagement in policy decisions. EI staff also became Technical and Working Group Members on the ASIS Private Security Company Standards 1, 2 and 3. 2.3 MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES Appropriate GRI EI’s Indicator 2011 2012 Acceptable 2013 Target Indicator Y/N HR4 Total number of incidents 5 complaints 2 incidents Yes Zero incidents Total number of of discrimination on any received.

EI has conducted a Human Rights Impact Assessment which highlights the potential labour dangers that EI face whilst operating in Afghanistan, Tanzania, Nigeria and Iraq. Therefore, EI implements policies to ensure that it applies UK standards and values. This ensures that it treats its staff and the local population with the highest regard for human rights and labour standards. 1 The Afghanistan minimum wage, according to minimum-wage.org, is 4,000 Afghani per month for government workers, and 2,000 Afghani for private sector workers. 2 2013 Iraq’s minimum wage, according to minimum-wage.org, is 5,200 and 10,500 Dinar per day for an unskilled and skilled worker respectively. Page | 6 Communication on Progress Labour EI initiated a quality, health, safety and environment (QHSE) enhancement programme in January 2013 and is currently addressing and improving the standards across the company. A key output for this programme is that the environments in which EI’s staff operate are improved and fundamentally safer. EI’s overarching Policy is our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (Code), which states: “Edinburgh International staff will respect the human rights of all persons they come into contact with, including, the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly and against arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy or deprivation of property….Staff are expected to treat their peers, superiors, or subordinates, as well as clients, suppliers and others with whom Edinburgh International does business, with respect and to not engage in abusive, disrespectful, violent or insubordinate behaviour.” 3.2 IMPLEMENTATION 3.2.1 Due Diligence EI has a rigorous and comprehensive due diligence and vetting system that has been established for some time with success. All staff that work for EI go through this procedure and this ensures that EI recruit staff that are not complicit in human rights abuses. The process includes criminal record and background checks and local and governmental authorities when employing in Afghanistan and Iraq. As part of this screening, all ages of staff are corroborated so as not to employ anyone under the age of 18 to carry out security service work and therefore no child labour is used. 3.2.2 Locally Hired Managers As the company’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct states, EI “will be a force for good wherever it operates”. A measure EI takes to accomplish this is to recruit and train locally wherever it operates. It provides staff with contracts in their own language and, only when it is absolutely necessary due to qualifications required, does EI recruit staff from abroad. EI also has its policies and procedures available to its staff in their native language. Furthermore, EI invests time and money, to train up its © Edinburgh International 2013 Commercial in Confidence local work force for managerial positions.

To assess where EI could improve and have a positive effect on the environment a full environmental impact assessment was undertaken, which was put to good use by the procurement team. EI applies its strict environmental policies in all the locations where it operates, regardless of whether the country of operation enforces responsible environmental awareness. A major milestone that the QHSE Programme is working towards is the achievement of the internationally recognised ISO 18001, which will further demonstrate EI’s commitment and attitude to the environment. Page | 8 2013 Communication on Progress Environment The following is an extract from EI’s Environmental Policy: “Edinburgh International recognises and accepts its responsibility to minimise, wherever possible, its impact on the environment and to comply with all statutory environmental requirements…It will seek to purchase from local or regional suppliers which will maximise Edinburgh International's input to the local community and minimise transport and carbon footprint.” 4.2 IMPLEMENTATION 4.2.1 Vehicle Fleet Following an environmental impact assessment that was conducted in 2010 for the large vehicle fleet that EI operates, the decision was made to replace its entire fleet from petrol to diesel. It was estimated that this would reduce carbon emissions by an average of 21% per vehicle. Thus far, the fleet replacement has been going well, with targets exceeded, and EI will continue to strive to the ultimate target of the fleet being entirely diesel fuelled. One of our new operational diesel fleet (right). EI, where possible, sources all vehicles locally either through hiring or purchasing them. This will limit the need to ship vehicles long distance to where they are required, therefore reducing the impact on the environment. The only vehicles that are imported are specialist ones that can not be sourced locally. A result of the introduction of TraKS will be the reduction in the number of flights required to run training in the operational areas. These flights are necessary for suitable personnel to conduct training in remote locations and also to audit and verify the training that has been completed. With TraKS now fulfilling this function, this will reduce the need for individuals to fly out to locations and should therefore reduce EI’s greenhouse gas emissions. The benefit of reduced air travel and therefore greenhouse gases should be realised in 2013. 4.3 MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES © Edinburgh International 2013 Commercial in Confidence Appropriate GRI Acceptable 2013 EI’s Indicator 2011 2012 Indicator Y/N Target EN 18 Reduce greenhouse 80% 90% Yes 95% Initiatives to reduce gasses by switching the Diesel Diesel Diesel greenhouse gas vehicle fleet from petrol emissions and to diesel. reductions achieved EN 29 Number of vehicles 20% of 1% Yes – The 5% Significant sourced locally against vehicles figure has environmental impacts of the number being sourced dropped as transporting products shipped in from abroad. locally, the vehicles and other goods and remainder that were materials used for the were shipped previously 2013 organisation’s operations in from abroad locally hired Page | 9 Communication on Progress Anti-Corruption Appropriate GRI Acceptable 2013 EI’s Indicator 2011 2012 Indicator Y/N Target and transporting aren’t any members of the longer. 1% workforce is still hired locally with the majority of the fleet being permanently owned by EI.

To counter these potential bribery and corruption threats, EI has a strict Anti-Bribery Policy in place. This policy is driven by the British Bribery Act 2010 and the American Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and governs all EI staff in anti-bribery. The Anti-Bribery Policy helps guide and focus EI’s attention on the business areas and personnel that are deemed to be most at risk to corruption. Additional training and validation is then conducted annually using EI’s Anti-Bribery Workshops. The following extract has been taken from EI’s Anti-Bribery Policy concerning EI’s commitment to training and educating its staff. © Edinburgh International 2013 Commercial in Confidence “Staff training and the sharing of best practice will take place in Anti-Bribery Workshops. The training will be organised by the manager convening the workshop and will be tailored specific to their business operations covering likely problems that they may encounter. All training which is conducted is to be recorded on TraKS.” 5.2 IMPLEMENTATION 5.2.1 All Staff EI’s Anti-Bribery Policy applies to all staff, contractors, sub-contractors and any organisation 2013 that the company does business with. This Policy is read and understood by all staff on Page | 10 Communication on Progress Anti-Corruption joining the Company and again on an annual basis. This measure was implemented in 2011 and has had great success in 2012. In order to ensure that all staff have a full knowledge and understanding of the Policy, there are annual anti-bribery workshops that are conducted and are given at differing levels depending on the role of the individual. As with human rights training, TraKS is the platform for promulgating all material for anti-bribery training. 5.2.2 Company Areas Deemed at Risk The company areas judged to be at greater risk due to the environments in which they operate are; Business Development, Financial and Operations Departments. These areas receive additional training. This measure was put into practise in 2011 and 2012 has seen the spectrum of anti-bribery policy training and workshops taking place. 5.2.3 Incidents of Bribery EI’s ethics hotline and email address is the procedure in place for anonymous reporting for staff and third parties are to use to report suspected bribery and corruption concerns. In 2012, EI received no complaints for bribery or corruption. 5.2.4 Auditing of Financial Books EI’s financial books are externally audited by Ernst and Young on an annual basis. To date no financial irregularities have been identified during these audits. 5.3 MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES Appropriate GRI Acceptable EI’s Indicator 2011 2012 2013 Target Indicator Y/N SO 3 Percentage of ex15% 80% Yes 90% Percentage of patriate staff who employees trained in received anti-bribery organisations antitraining corruption policies and procedures SO 2 Areas of the company Business Business Yes Business Percentage and total that received Development, Development, Development, number of business additional anti-bribery Financial Financial, Financial, units analysed for training courses Operations Operations, risks related to Sales corruption © Edinburgh International 2013 Commercial in Confidence Number of 0 0 Yes 0 irregularities identified by external auditors of EI’s financial books SO 4 Number of reported 0 0 Yes 0 Actions taken in incidents involving response to incidents corruption of corruption Page | 11 2013
