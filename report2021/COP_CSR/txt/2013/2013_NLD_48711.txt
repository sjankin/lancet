Office Depot’s First COP All our local operations are ISO14001 certified which enables us to ensure a proper implementation of our environmental strategy and policies. To engage our employees we do use various media and tools varying from poster campaigns, group training and e-learning tools. Our poster campaign ‘Did you know?’ addresses facts and figures based on our own performance combined with some more generic messages. We offer programs to collect empty cartridges and e-waste as a standard while in addition a more advanced closed loop program to collect office waste paper has been successfully implemented by our UK operations. In our warehouses have we implemented over the last few years box-cutters to eliminate plastic box fillers and remove unused box space. This has a positive impact on truck load efficiency and effectiveness that when combined with route planning optimization can further reduce carbon footprint emission per delivered package. In our Touchpoints (direct mailing, catalogs and web shops) we mark ‘green’ products using our GO (Greener Office) logo. Products marked using this logo are verified based on predefined criteria and validated by an independent third party. In 2014 we’ll launch a new program called ‘Source with Confidence’ that engages and encourages our vendors to share ‘green’ product and production information. By means of this program we want to share responsibility – increase transparency – create partnerships. A short animation explains from a customer point of view how we want to change our way of working. This animation is available via https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKLn0yP7Kc4. Measurement of outcomes In our annual CC (Corporate Citizenship) report we share our environmental impact and results linked to Buy Greener – Be Greener – Sell Greener. Details on the European operations can be found at the European Dashboard via http://officedepotcitizenship.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2012-EuropeanDashboard-Ledger-Final.pdf Some key achievements FY2012 compared to FY2011 are highlighted below: Buy Greener +175% products Third Party Ecolabel Be Greener -6% Recycling percentage Sell Greener +18% Green Sales (Euro) and +47% Green Sales Percentage In 2014 we’ll start to compensate our Carbon Footprint caused by customer Deliveries in accordance with the Gold Standard. At first we’ll start compensation in the region Benelux-DACH (Germany, Austria and Switzerland). As soon as possible France, Ireland and United Kingdom will implement this approach as well. In parallel do we engage both our upstream (vendors) and downstream (customers) taking a joined responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint per delivery. We identify new logistic services, cross docking, new packaging materials or packaging quantities in combination with optimized order and delivery frequencies. At our internal BSC (Business Score Card) we have identified 3 ‘green’ KPI which Address Our Environmental Sales, Environmental Compliance and Carbon Footprint. The figure below shows a screenshot of the UK section of the BSC addressing the Environmental Sales 2013YTD. Office Depot International BV & Office Depot Europe B.V.
