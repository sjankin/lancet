Communication on Progress of Ch. Dahlinger GmbH & Co KG to the Global Compact of the United Nations, Lahr, Germany – December 2013 Ch. Dahlinger GmbH & Co KG (CHD) is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of luxury packaging and display products for jewellery, watches, writing implements, champagnes, spirits and other items from the luxury and lifestyle sector. Since 1871 CHD has been renowned for its very high quality and innovative products made from cardboard, plastic and wood featuring a variety of cover materials. We documented this fact by signing up to the United Nations’ Global Compact on 13 June 2005. The ten principles of the Global Compact cover human rights, health and safety standards, environmental protection and fighting corruption and are recognised and applied by our management and staff. Consideration is given to observance of these principles whenever we make decisions and take actions impacting on the present and future. The principles form part of the corporate guidelines (attachment 1), the supplier code (attachment 2) and all contracts that CHD negotiates with its main suppliers. These are made accessible to business partners and our partners are made aware of the importance of compliance. Since 2012 all of our suppliers receive a questionnaire regarding the compliance with the 10 principles. You can find the complete questionnaire in attachment 3. Compliance with Principles 1 and 2 within the area of human rights ( Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally pro-claimed human rights; and make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. ) is referred to and demanded in the corporate guidelines and the supplier code. Principle 3 ( Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining ) is contained within point 5 of the supplier code. This point also stipulates that employees are to be protected from any treatment aimed against the freedom of association. Principle 4, the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour , is part of point 6 of the supplier code. In this point, we state that we do not tolerate any forms of enforced or compulsory labour, bonded labour, serfdom, slave labour or conditions similar to slavery. CHD continues to monitor and conduct regular checks on principle 5 ( the effective abolition of child labour ). Employee passports are checked regularly, especially in Southeast Asian countries. If even a vague suspicion of child labour occurs, the existing business relationships are discontinued and, as the case may be, new business relationships are not initiated. All of our current suppliers have been advised that a Ch.

Detailed instructions for the abolition of child labour are formulated in point 3 of the supplier code. Principle 6 ( the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation ) is stipulated in point 4 of the supplier code. In particular, this prohibits any differentiation, exclusion or preference based on race, caste, skin colour, sex, age, profession of faith, political opinion, membership of a workers’ organisation, physical or mental disability, ethnic, national or social background, nationality, sexual orientation or other personal traits. Approximately 32 million product units are manufactured annually at CHD. They are mainly packaging and displays made of cardboard, plastics and wood and are coated with different substances. The wise use of these resources enables CHD to have a strong influence on environmental protection. In order to comply with Principle 8 ( undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility ), our Chinese partner companies communicate the principles of the Global Compact strongly and raise staff awareness through introduction of information blackboards. A sample of such informational signage with the translated contents can be found in attachment 4. The increased demand for varnished wooden packaging from 2011 has continued in 2013. The wood used for this purpose comes from renewable sources. The focus on people and the environment is also very important in production. Our carpenter’s workshop is fitted with a special dust extraction which enables us to collect the sawdust and recycle it. Furthermore, an activated carbon filter technology which exceeds national requirements and is aligned to high international standards is used in the paint line. In addition to the use of conventional coatings for the costly painted wooden boxes, paint tests with waterbased coatings are still being conducted. Unfortunately these eco-friendly coatings are currently not able to compete with the gloss and brilliance of conventional varnishes. We are continually striving to develop an alternative solution in favour of the environment as well as quality. The “Innovation Work Group” was launched in 2007 in order to urge compliance with Principle 9 ( Promote the development and expansion of environmentally friendly technologies ). In this work group, employees from different departments work on new designs and look for new and environmentally friendly materials. In 2011 a newly introduced project was the intense examination on the topic bioplastics which deals with biodegradable plastics. During production tests, applicability has been optimized. However, as of 2013, batch production on the basis of bioplastics is yet to take place. The importance of environmental protection and environmentally-friendly technologies is consolidated in the Ch. Dahlinger Group corporate guidelines in attachment 1. This is Ch.

Our products and processes should be environmentally sound and make efficient use of resources Wherever possible, we use recycled or environmentally friendly materials We want to make an active contribution to protecting and improving our environment. Through our actions we want to show that economics and ecology don’t have to be mutually exclusive. REACH, a chemical regulation authority, has officially been in effect since 1 July 2007. REACH stands for Registration, Evaluation (rating), authorisation (approval) and restrictions of chemicals (substances). Since CHD is not a manufacturer or importer of chemicals, we merely considered as downstream users and are therefore only affected to a limited extent. What we, as a packaging manufacturer, have to pay attention to in compliance with the current REACH regulations, has already been explained in the communication on progress for 2011. CHD has a standard which exceeds the REACH regulations for large customers with a correspondingly large volume of orders. In doing so, we are inspecting our products for a wider range of chemicals in much lower concentrations than required by law. In the last year the quality control of used materials and finished products on-site in China has continued on a very advanced level. The staff at our CHD-China service office are still at the high level of 7 persons. We also place a strong emphasis on the clean environment of our Chinese partners. We see this as beneficial to the product quality as well as immensely important for the wellbeing of the workers. As a result, all rooms that are connected to the production are equipped with modern sanitary facilities and hot water. In order to provide for principle 10, ( Businesses should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery ), point 14, Bribery and corruption , in the Ch. Dahlinger Group supplier code stipulates that no form of bribery or corruption is tolerated by the Ch. Dahlinger Group. Bernd Dahlinger Valerio d'Adamo Managing Partner Managing Director Ch.

Dahlinger Group Supplier code We the Dahlinger Group believe that social commitment, environmental considerations and fairness are essential to our business. The Ch. Dahlinger Group aims to reconcile economic, ecological and social responsibility in the long term. The Ch. Dahlinger Group's basic requirements of its suppliers are set out in this code. The principles this code contains are in line with the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI), the conventions of the International Labour Organisation (hereinafter referred to as the ILO), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the principles of the UN Global Compact and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. The principles laid down in this code should not be viewed as maximum requirements but wherever possible should be exceeded. 1. Scope of validity This code forms the basis for all business relations relating to national and international production processes and production plants for final processing (hereinafter referred to as “production sites”) for goods purchased by the Ch. Dahlinger Group. It applies worldwide to both the Ch. Dahlinger Group itself and the direct business partners of the Ch. Dahlinger Group. It is also applicable to other parties contracted by direct business partners who are involved in producing goods for the Ch. Dahlinger Group (hereinafter referred to as “business partners”). Business partners guarantee to and are responsible for ensuring that they observe the principles contained in this code. 2. Compliance with legislation The various production sites shall observe the applicable national and international laws and regulations, industrial minimum standards, conventions of the ILO and UN and all other relevant requirements (hereinafter referred to as “standards”). The standards applicable in each case shall be those with the most stringent requirements. Compliance with this code and the above standards shall not be evaded through contractual agreements or similar measures (e.g. bogus training programmes). 3. Child labour / youth employment Child labour and any form of exploitation of children will not be tolerated by the Ch. Dahlinger Group. The minimum age for employment must not be any lower than that at which compulsory education ceases, and must not be less than 15 years of age in any case. Domestic standards to protect children and youth employees must be observed. The exceptions of the ILO apply. Compliance with the prohibition of child labour and limitation of youth employment must be ensured. In particular, young people must not be exposed to dangerous or unsafe situations or situations in which their health is put at risk. Should this ban on child labour be violated, the business partner must immediately initiate appropriate remedial measures for the children and young people. These measures must be documented. Measures and actions must also be taken to provide for the rehabilitation and social integration of the children affected and to enable them to complete their school education in line with domestic standards. This is in line with ILO conventions 79, 138, 142 and 182 and ILO recommendation 146. 4. Discrimination Any form of discrimination during recruitment and employment is prohibited. This applies in particular to any differentiation, exclusion or preference based on race, caste, skin colour, sex, age, profession of faith, political opinion, membership of a workers’ organisation, physical or mental disability, ethnic, national or social background, nationality, sexual orientation or other personal traits. It applies regardless of whether the differentiation, exclusion or 2012 03 08_Informationsschreiben 03_Anhang II_ Lieferantenkodex_ChD Gruppe_englisch page 1 of 4 Supplier code of Ch. Dahlinger Group preference was dictated by the business partner or not. This is in line with ILO conventions 100, 111, 143, 158 and 159. 5. Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining Employees must be protected from any discriminatory treatment in relation to their employment and which prevents the freedom of association. Their right to establish, join, leave and actively work for associations or organisations of their choice to promote and protect employees' interests must be respected. This must not restrict them in their employment activities. Should domestic standards limit freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, employees must be enabled and permitted to at least freely and independently come together for the purpose of negotiation. This is in line with ILO conventions 87, 98, 135 and 154 and ILO recommendation 143. 6. Enforced labour All forms of enforced and compulsory labour, bonded labour, serfdom, slave labour or conditions similar to slavery are not tolerated by the Ch. Dahlinger Group.

Working hours Working hours must correspond to the applicable law, industrial standards or relevant ILO conventions, depending on which is the most stringent. The maximum permissible weekly working hours laid down in national legislation apply. However, these must not regularly exceed 48 hours, or 60 hours including overtime.

This is in line with ILO conventions 1 and 14. 9.

The name, date and place of birth, and wherever possible the home address of the employee must be recorded. Direct business partners also guarantee the appropriate documentation of other agents contracted by them. Evasion of applicable domestic labour and social security standards is prohibited. 10.

All business partners and their employees must behave in a manner which does not result in personal dependency, obligation or influence. Everyone is expected to display business conduct based on fairness and observance of the applicable national and international standards. The business partner shall furthermore introduce an anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy for all areas of its business. If gifts are considered a custom and courtesy in some countries, care must be taken to ensure that they do not result in relationships of dependency and obligation and that the applicable national standards are observed. Information relating to corrupt behaviour should be reported to the Ch. Dahlinger Group (management) (see Item 18). 15. Management systems Business partners shall introduce a management system to implement, observe and audit the principles drawn up on the basis of this code.

He shall provide the appropriate details of the production sites. 17. Sanctions and remedial measures The Ch. Dahlinger Group is entitled to monitor the principles laid down according to this code.

Dahlinger Group shall be provided for the remedial measures. The right of the Ch. Dahlinger Group to terminate commercial relations with the business partner is not limited by this provision, regardless of whether the direct business partner itself or the agent appointed by him infringes the principles laid down according to this code. 18.

These may also be made in an anonymous form and should be addressed to the following contact: Anyone reporting such complaints or information must do so in good faith and must be sure that his or her facts are correct.
