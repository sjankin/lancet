SCI’s vessels are the first among the Indian flag vessels to have EEDI compliance. Environmental Regulations Right at the time of construction of ships, it is ensured that the new ships comply with strict environmental regulations such as : a. The new built tanker vessels comply with requirements under EU Directive 2005/33/EC and are thus EU compliant. b. Fuel oil tanks are protected on the sides to avoid direct contact in case of accident. c. Tier II compliant diesel engines are being installed on new vessels constructed after 1st January 2011 to reduce NOx emission levels from diesel engine. d. Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) is being implemented at design stage to reduce GHG emissions from ships i.e. grams of CO 2 emitted per tone mile of cargo moved. e. The refrigerant used by AC plants is environment friendly which if leaked out doesn’t contribute to Ozone depletion f. The vessels have green passport upon delivery i.e. list of all hazardous materials will be kept onboard which will be of great help during recycling/ handling of hazardous materials during in-service repairs. g. Paint applied on the underwater portion of the hull is tin free.
