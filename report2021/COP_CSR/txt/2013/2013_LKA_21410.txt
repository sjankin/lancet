The establishment was named the ‘House of Cargills’. A successful bid by Sir Chittampalam A. Gardiner saw the House of Cargills being incorporated as a Public Limited Liability Company on 1 March 1946. In 1981 Ceylon Theatres acquired controlling interest of the company and Mr. Albert A. Page was appointed the Managing Director. Mr. Albert Page went on to become the Chairman of Cargills on 26 November 1982. Under the new management, Cargills explored the potential of innovating on its trading legacy. As a result, in 1983 Cargills established the first supermarket chain in Sri Lanka with the opening of its first outlet at Staple Street. Cargills ventured into the production of processed meats in 1993 when the company invested in its first manufacturing facility, Cargills Quality Foods, in Mattakkuliya. In 1996, Cargills acquired the franchise license for KFC and innovated on its secret recipe to deliver products that suited the local palate. Cargills began sourcing fruits and vegetables directly from farmers in 1999 when it established its first collection centre in Hanguranketha. In 2002 it invested in a dairy processing plant and thereby expanded its outgrower network to include dairy farmers. Cargills Magic ice cream was the outcome of this endeavor. In the same year Cargills diversified into agri-processing with Cargills Kist, which created further market opportunities for farmers. In 2008 Cargills acquired the business operations of Millers PLC through a newly formed subsidiary, Millers Limited. In 2010 Cargills undertook an aggressive expansion plan in the FMCG sector to ride the growth potential of a growing economy. During that year the Company expanded its interests in the dairy category by acquiring Kotmale Holdings PLC and entered another growing category with the acquisition of Diana Biscuits, now marketed under the Kist brand. In 2011, Cargills entered the soft alcohol industry by completing the acquisition of the McCallum Brewery and its ‘3 Coins’ brand. an icon of TRUST SINCE 1844 | 4 | Cargills (Ceylon) PLC Annual Report 2011/2012 www.cargillsceylon.com Financial Highlights Group 2012 2011 change % Rs. ‘000 Rs. ‘000 Operations Revenue 48,256,413 37,128,661 29.97 Profit from operations 2,274,610 1,825,442 24.61 Profit before taxation 1,586,903 1,406,703 12.81 Profit after taxation 1,093,350 1,094,173 (0.08) Balance Sheet Non current assets 16,096,388 13,568,878 18.63 Current assets 8,754,516 5,741,611 52.47 Current liabilities 16,202,845 11,353,281 42.72 Non current liabilities 930,879 907,775 2.55 Capital and reserves 7,717,180 7,049,433 9.47 Per Share Data (Rs.)

Accordingly the group manages interest rate fluctuations with an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debts through a centralised treasury management function. Credit Risk The Company aims to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions. Risk of default is routinely monitored and required actions are taken. Our manufacturing subsidiaries are more exposed to credit risk by the very nature of their business and this risk is neutralised through a rigorous process of credit management. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Group’s exposure to this risk is minimal as exports are negligible. Risk on imports of plant, machineries and equipments are managed adequately. an icon of TRUST SINCE 1844 | 28 | Cargills (Ceylon) PLC Annual Report 2011/2012 www.cargillsceylon.com Sustainability Report 01.
