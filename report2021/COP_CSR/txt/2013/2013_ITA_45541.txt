Strategy and analysis analysis 1.1 The letter to the registered and non-registered shareholders, published in the Annual Report STATEMENT FROM entitled Reports and Accounts 2012, opens with a tribute to the memory of the Chairman of the THE CHAIRMEN Supervisory Board Corrado Faissola, who passed away on 20th December 2013: “Corrado Faissola was an unwavering follower of a strict personal code, fundamentally geared towards espousing an overall ethical position that governed both life and work based on the principle that the common good should never be supplanted by the possibility of delivering a result, no matter how desirable.” We have always looked to those same ethics and ideals that we recognise in Corrado Faissola in guiding and managing this Group of which he was one of the most convinced founders who confirmed the value of the principles in the Code of Ethics, which we have adopted, and the universal principles of the UN Global Compact, which we have signed. Once again we are renewing our commitment to observe them in all our strategic and operating decisions. As part of this commitment, even at this time of continuing difficulty in the economic environment, we have sought to combine the essential corporate goals of profitability, financial balance and capital strength with satisfaction of the needs and social and environmental aspirations of all our stakeholders. Consequently, while on the one hand, following on from what we have already achieved in previous years, we have paid particular attention to the reorganisation of the Group to reduce overheads and streamline operations, on the other hand we have continued to invest to strengthen our identity and the perception of UBI Banca as a high quality bank that is present and active in the community. This means for example that we have maintained high levels of training and welfare for our staff and also that the necessary action to optimise the work force has been accompanied by a programme for generation turnover, which means new permanent employment opportunities for young people in the context of great insecurity on the labour market. This also means that we have addressed the reorganisation of the distribution model and the branch network in order to improve service levels in all customer segments and not just to increase efficiency. And again it means we have maintained commercial and lending policies that have never been compromised by profit goals and we have always been attentive to the needs of the weaker groups in society. In this respect, in addition to trying to offer maximum support for those families and businesses hit by the economic crisis and the natural disasters that have had a severe impact on various communities, we have also sought to invest in the development of our service model and our range of products and services for the third sector. The launch of “social bonds” in particular met with great success, a sign of just how much the bank is in tune with the values of local communities in its markets. The attentive and active participation of Bank in community life does not end with its commercial activities, but is broader in order to implement the mutual objects implicit in its co-operative status to support charitable, social, cultural and sports activities and initiatives in a philanthropic spirit. This is an investment in the community to which we continuously dedicate significant financial resources each year to support longstanding partnerships and to develop new projects. This year the Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders is called upon to elect a new Supervisory Board , which will in turn appoint a new Management Board. We will be handing an important national concern over to these bodies that is at the same time solid with strong local roots, which must continue to find within its heritage of history, values, principles and expertise the ability to compete successfully on the market in order to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders. The Chairman of the Management Board The Senior Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board Emilio Zanetti Giuseppe Calvi 1 Social Report 2012 Strategy and analysis 1.2 UBI Banca’s Code of Ethics identifies the significant stakeholders of the Group, which are those KEY IMPACTS, RISKS “groups and individuals who are holders of specific interests on which UBI’s activities have effects AND OPPORTUNITIES and/or which contribute in various ways to UBI’s activity and its very existence.” Important issues and the relative risks and opportunities in the different areas of sustainability are considered for each category of stakeholder, account of which is taken in formulating policies and setting operating objectives. The evolving context and the performance of operations in relation to social responsibility and sustainability strategies and objectives are monitored over time as part of the following: strategic planning processes; consultation and dialogue activities (e.g. customer satisfaction surveys); analysis of agency ratings and analysts and CSR investors’ opinions; and also monitoring of indicators calculated as part of the CSR reporting process in the Social Report. In the particularly difficult current economic environment, it is essential to give priority to financial and operating figures with a particular focus on controlling costs and levels of liquidity and capital. In order to support this commitment, the lines of action identified in the 2011-2013/15 Business Plan, summarised in the table below, have been confirmed, especially in relation to the prevention of reputational risk, which is particularly in evidence in the financial sector, and in relation to grasping opportunities arising from the emergence of new demands and concerns of a social and environmental nature. Some objectives have been affected, and in the near future will probably continue to be affected by the availability of financial resources, which means that careful planning must be carried out with priority given to initiatives with the best cost/benefit ratios.

The EXTERNAL auditor also verifies the level of application of the GRI model declared by the bank. ASSURANCE 19 Social Report 2012 Report parameters 20 Social Report 2012 Report parameters 4. Governance, commitments commitments and stakeholder engagement Governance 4.1 Information on corporate governance is published in the Report on Corporate Governance and the GOVERNANCE Ownership Structure. [ Reports and Accounts 2012 pages 1**-71**] STRUCTURE UBI Banca’s governance model takes account of the following: measures and principles governing 4.2 listed issuers contained in the Consolidated Finance Act and the relative regulations issued to EXECUTIVE implement it by the Consob (Italian securities market authority); legislation and regulations CHAIRMAN governing banks contained in the Consolidated Banking Act; the Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies issued by Borsa Italiana Spa (hereinafter the Corporate Governance Code). UBI 4.3 Banca has adopted a two tier governance system in which governance functions are divided INDEPENDENT between a Supervisory Board and a Management Board. AND/OR NONEXECUTIVE The Supervisory Board [ Reports and Accounts 2012 pages 13**-32**] has functions of strategic ADMINISTRATORS policy-making and control and has internal committees with consultation functions (Accounts Committee, Internal Control Committee, Remuneration Committee, Appointments Committee and  LA13 Related and Connected Parties Committee) to oversee the integrity and transparency of resolutions passed on matters of particular delicacy. The members of the Management Board remain in office for three financial years and may be re-elected. Possession of the requirements of independence in compliance with current law (Art. 148, paragraph 3, Consolidated Finance Act) and with the Corporate Governance Code has been verified for all members of the Supervisory Board. During 2012 the Supervisory Board met 16 times and the average length of meetings was four hours with an average of 90% attendance. The Management Board [ Reports and Accounts 2012 pages 32**-39**] is responsible for the management of the Bank in observance of the general strategic policies and programmes approved by the Supervisory Board. Its members remain in office for three years (their term of office expires on the date of the Supervisory Board meeting convened to approve the financial statements for their last year in office) and may be re-elected. In compliance with instructions issued by the Bank of Italy on the organisation and corporate governance of banks, the Management Board consists mainly of executive members. The members of the Management Board are actively involved in the management of the Bank in compliance with policies approved by the Supervisory Board and submitted to it by the Management Board itself, which as specifically required by the Articles of Association performs its main activities exclusively on a collegial basis with no powers to delegate authority. The management commitments and responsibilities of the executive board members apply not only to the sphere of the Management Board, but also at Group level by appointments to positions in the governing bodies of the main subsidiaries of UBI Banca, which actively helps to ensure that the various member companies of the Group comply with instructions issued by the Parent in the exercise of its management and co-ordination activities. In accordance with the Articles of Association, at least one member of the Management Board must possess the requirements of independence pursuant to Art. 148, paragraph 3 of Legislative Decree No. 58 of th 24 February 1998, in compliance with Art. 147 quater of the Consolidated Finance Act. In view of the decision taken by UBI Banca to form internal committees within the Supervisory Board as provided for by the Corporate Governance Code – for which requisites of independence are required – only one independent board member is present on the Board. During 2012 the Management Board met 27 times and the average length of meetings was five hours with an average of 96% attendance. The UBI Banca’s Articles of Association assigns powers and functions to the Chairman of the Management Board, which underline his involvement in the management of the Bank. More specifically the Chairman of the Management Board, who acts as the Bank's legally authorised representative and authorised signatory, performs the tasks that are typically carried out by the Chairman of a company’s management body, to be performed by liaising with the other by-law regulated bodies where appropriate. 21 Social Report 2012 Governance, commitments and engagement In view of the co-operative form of the Bank, the Articles of Association also provide for a Board of Arbitrators [ Reports and Accounts 2012 page 39**] to which each registered shareholder may appeal to settle any disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the Articles of Association and to any other resolutions or decisions taken by the governing bodies of the Bank concerning corporate affairs. Its members are appointed for three years and may be re-elected. 4.4 UBI Banca’s Articles of Association do not provide for mechanisms available for shareholders and MECHANISMS FOR employees to furnish recommendations or give directives to the highest governing body. SHAREHOLDERS AND Nevertheless ordinary shareholders’ and extraordinary meetings may be convened by registered EMPLOYEES TO shareholders on presentation of a request giving the grounds and the agenda, which must be signed PROVIDE by at least one twentieth of the Registered Shareholders in possession of voting rights on the date RECOMMENDATIONS of the request. Furthermore, in compliance with the procedures. according to the terms and within TO THE HIGHEST the time limits set by law, a number of registered shareholders equal to not less than 1/40 (one GOVERNANCE BODY fortieth) of the registered shareholders with the right on the date of the request, may make an application in writing for additions to be made to the agenda to be dealt with in a shareholders’ meeting, as it results from the notice convening the shareholders' meeting or submit proposals to be voted on for matters already on the agenda. The current Regulations Governing Shareholders' Meetings in force, approved by a shareholders' meeting, establishes the right of each registered shareholder to participate in debates and to request information and make observations and proposals concerning matters on the agenda. With regard to employees, their interests are upheld by company and Group representatives as part of periodic discussions required under the various labour contract procedures and in other opportunities for meetings, such as equal partnership commissions and bi-lateral observatories on corporate social responsibility, corporate climate, training and equal opportunities matters. Furthermore, employees who are also registered shareholders may also attend meetings with the right to speak and vote, on a par with other registered shareholders, with the sole limitation that they may not act as proxies. 4.5 Remuneration and incentive policies establish that the variable component of remuneration is set LINKAGE BETWEEN by using instruments designed to involve and motivate personnel to achieve medium and long-term MANAGEMENT Group policies. In compliance with EU and national legislation and also with international COMPENSATION AND recommendations, the guidelines on which incentive schemes and remuneration are based are as PERFORMANCE follows:  EC5 • variable remuneration linked to long-term performance measurement indicators which reflect the profitability of the bank over time and are appropriately adjusted for current and future risks, for the cost of equity and the liquidity required to perform the activities undertaken; • consistency with respect to the results actually achieved, with significant reductions and even no bonus payment if performance is below forecasts or negative; • assessment of the results of the business unit and of the bank or company a person belongs to and of Group as a whole and also of the results of the individual; • the use of indicators that are not economic and financial (e.g. customer satisfaction), which can determine the sustainability of results over the medium to long-term; • the total amount of variable remuneration, which must be such that it does not limit the Bank's ability to maintain an adequate level of capitalisation for the risks assumed. The remuneration of members of the Supervisory board is set by a shareholders’ meeting. The remuneration of members of the Management Board is set by the Supervisory Board, subject to consultation with the Remuneration Committee and it is not linked to the operating results of the Bank. Board members and CEOs may receive forms of remuneration linked to results, while all the other members of the governing bodies of the Group receive no variable remuneration. A variable bonus is reserved to the Chief Executive Officer of UBI Banca related solely to his fixed remuneration resulting from his position as a senior executive. 22 Social Report 2012 Governance, commitments and engagement 4.6 UBI Banca pays particular attention to compliance with both the form and substance of rules when CONFLICTS OF performing transactions with related parties. Transactions with representatives of the bank, with INTEREST representatives of Group member companies and with companies controlled by them – all of whom may qualify as related parties – are conducted under normal market conditions and in compliance with the provisions of Article 136 of the Consolidated Banking Act. Special IT procedures have been introduced in this respect which, on the basis of declarations issued by representatives of companies, make it possible to identify in advance the potential assumption of a direct or indirect obligation of a representative and consequently subject the transaction to the procedures required by the aforementioned article. th With Resolution No. 17221 of 12 March 2010, subsequently amended by Resolution No. 17389 of rd 23 June 2010, the Consob approved regulations concerning the procedures to be followed for the approval of transactions performed by listed companies and the issuers of shares with a broad shareholder base with parties with a potential conflict of interest, including major or controlling shareholders, members of the management and supervisory bodies and senior managers including their close family members. The competent bodies of UBI Banca have approved special regulations, available on the Bank’s website and they have defined internal processes designed to ensure compliance with these measures. An internal Related-Parties Committee has been formed by the Supervisory Board to which transactions falling within the scope of application of the regulations must be submitted in advance. th On 12 December 2011 the Bank of Italy published new measures relating to risk weighted assets and conflicts of interest regarding related parties, which entered into force at the end of 2012. The main purpose of these measures is to reduce the risk that the closeness of persons termed “Connected Parties” to the decision-making centres of a bank might compromise the objectivity and impartiality of decisions concerning the grant of loans and other transactions which in any case regard these persons. In order to manage these risks, in compliance with provisions issued by the Bank of Italy, the UBI Group monitors and guarantees compliance with specific prudential limits set by supervisory regulations on risk asset exposures to parties connected with the Parent and its subsidiaries. It has also put special decision-making procedures in place to ensure the integrity of decision-making processes in transactions with Connected Parties and to prevent possible abuses that might occur in transactions with potential conflicts of interest performed with these counterparties. Finally, in relation to the legislation in force which implements the EC MiFID Directive No. 2004/39/EC, an internal “policy for the management of personal transactions” has been approved which provides detailed regulation of obligations concerning personal transactions in financial instruments performed by all those termed “significant parties”. In this respect, the adoption of a Code of Conduct further regulates the activities of all Group personnel and introduced, amongst other things, quantitative limits on transactions in financial instruments and a prohibition on investing in determined types of highly speculative instruments. 4.7 The Supervisory Board is made up of 23 members appointed by a shareholders' meeting from QUALIFICATIONS OF amongst registered shareholders holding the requisites of integrity, professionalism and THE independence prescribed by laws in force. At least 15 of them must possess the qualities of ADMINISTRATORS professionalism required by the legislation in force for persons who perform bank management functions and at least three of them must be chosen from among persons enrolled in the Registro dei Revisori Contabili (register of auditors), who have practised as legal certifiers of accounts for a period of not less than three years. In compliance with the legislation in force, at least the majority of the members of the Management Board has at least three years total experience in management and/or professional activities in financial and/or securities and/or banking and/or insurance institutions in Italy or abroad and at least one member possesses the requirements of independence set forth in Art. 148, paragraph three of the Consolidated Finance Act. The curricula vitae of the members of the Supervisory Board, the Management Board and the General Management of the Parent are available on the website of the Parent.  http://www.ubibanca.it/pagine/Supervisory-Board-EN.aspx, http://www.ubibanca.it/pagine/Management-Board-EN.aspx, 23 Social Report 2012 Governance, commitments and engagement http://www.ubibanca.it/pagine/General-Management-EN-5.aspx In order to ensure management continuity and certainty and in compliance with Consob recommendations, with the assistance of a leading company in the sector, UBI Banca has introduced a senior leadership succession process which, in compliance with the requirements of the Articles of Association and internal regulations, will entail the identification and evaluation of management personnel who could be considered as possible candidates for senior leadership positions at UBI Banca (Chief Executive Officer and General Manager). The process supports those bodies involved in the selection and nomination of candidates on a series of critical issues such as understanding the value of internal candidates (e.g. strengths, areas for improvement to be made through possible enhancement action) and the corporate and business environment (growth, cost restructuring, internationalisation) in which each candidate may be considered most suitable to fill the role of Chief Executive Officer or General Manager. Generally the procedure will be reviewed and implemented annually to address planned changes or in order to be able to tackle possible unforeseen situations in a professional and organised manner. The candidates assessed for succession are managers who fill the most important roles within the Group and only if the results of the assessment of in-house candidates is unsuccessful will consideration be given to candidates from outside the Group. 4.8 For UBI Banca “Fare banca per bene” means creating a vision of a bank in which you can trust, a MISSION, VALUES, bank recognised on the market for its management style based on a constant sense of ethics, CODES OF CONDUCT, transparency, integrity, dialogue and respect in business. It means believing in strong and shared AND PRINCIPLES values and putting them into practice in observance of principles and rules of conduct which are not seen as limitations, but as the way to establish our identity on the market. The Group’s mission, values and principles are formally set out mainly in its Charter of Values and Code of Ethics, which are based, amongst other things, on the principles of the Global Compact. Our Charter of Values – approved in January 2008 – identifies the mission, vision and values on which the Group has based its identity and which must guide the conduct of all personnel in their relationships with customers and with all other stakeholders in both strategic choices and everyday business. The Code of Ethics approved at the end of 2010 by the Management Board and the Supervisory Board of UBI Banca and subsequently by all subsidiary banks and companies is the result of work performed, which involved the Parent, the network banks and the main product companies at various levels starting with senior management. Other companies in which stakes are held have been informed of the Code. They are asked to commit themselves to the pursuit of conduct consistent with the principles contained in it. It has been communicated to personnel through the consultation of internal regulations on the corporate intranet and in hardcopy form for companies who have no access to that portal and it is also published on the Group website. A copy of the Code is delivered to members of corporate bodies when they accept their appointment, to newly recruited personnel and to all those who do business with the Group under contract or who represent the Bank without being subordinate to it (e.g. business partners, agents, consultants, sales persons and other independent associates), when a relationship is established. Major suppliers are required to sign a declaration of acceptance as part of the respective contract documents. A training programme was completed in 2012 for all personnel on corporate social responsibility and the Code of Ethics introduced last year [ FS4]. The Audit Area of the Parent and the Group is the unit which receives reports and investigates them. In accordance with the Code, reports, which cannot be anonymous, are kept strictly confidential and those making reports are protected against any form of retaliation, discrimination or penalty. Nine reports were received in 2012 for presumed violations of the Code of Ethics (eight from customers and suppliers and one from shareholders) of which six were found to be without grounds following appropriate investigations and three are still under investigation. The Code of Conduct approved at the end of 2011 by the Management Board and the Supervisory Board of UBI Banca is based on the principles of the Code of Ethics and is aimed at all those in a 24 Social Report 2012 Governance, commitments and engagement working relationship with UBI Banca, both on a continuing and casual basis. It is designed to furnish a framework of principles of conduct with which to evaluate concrete situations from time to time and compliance of decisions to be taken with ethical and regulatory norms. Banks and companies belonging to the Group have also adopted the same text, modified, where appropriate, with the consent of the Parent, to meet requirements dictated by specific sectors or residency in foreign countries. Failure to observe the rules of the Code of Conduct constitutes violation of the Code of Ethics: instances of non-compliance must be reported and are punished in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Code of Ethics and in compliance with the rules and regulations applicable to the employment contract in question. 4.9 Much work has been done in recent years on organisational controls and on business innovation, PROCEDURES FOR pursuing objectives of sustainability and consistency with customer expectations and those of THE IDENTIFICATION other stakeholders concerned and on improving dialogue with stakeholders and accountability. The AND MANAGEMENT adoption of a Code of Ethics constitutes a fundamental step in the achievement of the social OF ECONOMIC, responsibility model of the UBI Banca Group. By identifying our stakeholders and clearly stating the ENVIRONMENTAL principles followed in our conduct towards them, the Code constitutes a framework of reference AND SOCIAL we use to integrate ethical, social and environmental aspects in our strategies, policies and PERFORMANCE corporate operations. Oversight of the implementation of the Group’s social responsibility model is performed by the CSR Manager who reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer, who in turn is on the staff of the Chief Executive Officer.

Subsequently, in th EVALUATING THE compliance with Bank of Italy instructions issued on 12 January 2012 concerning the HIGHEST “organisation and corporate governance of banks” and also in compliance with the provisions of GOVERNANCE the Corporate Governance Code, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board performed self BODY’S OWN assessments for the financial year 2012 – similar to those performed for the financial year 2011 – PERFORMANCE on the size, composition and functioning of the boards themselves. The results have been included in a specific section of the Corporate Governance Report [ Reports and Accounts 2012 pages 21**, 33**, 35**, 74**]. Both Boards unanimously confirmed the appropriateness of their composition, size and functioning and they considered that Board proceedings as a whole, in terms of organisation, analysis of issues, attendance at meetings and participation in discussions, were appropriate to ensure the sound and prudent management of the Bank and the Group. 25 Social Report 2012 Governance, commitments and engagement In view of the renewal of board membership in 2013 and in compliance with new the Bank of Italy th requirements to improve the quality of corporate governance (provision of 12 January 2012), the self-assessment process was updated and a specific project was launched to define the optimum composition in terms of quality and quantity of the corporate boards and to provide transparent procedures which will ensure adequate representation of the different components of the shareholder base. Commitments to external initiatives 4.11 UBI Banca has adopted an internal control system which, in compliance with the principles of the MODALITY OF Corporate Governance Code, with instructions issued by the supervisory authority and with the APPLICATION OF THE Articles of Association of the Bank, assigns functions and responsibilities to the various officers on PRECAUTIONARY three levels (managers of organisational units of processes, risk control specialist functions and the APPROACH Internal Audit function), while it is overseen strategically by the Supervisory Board. The internal control system is efficiently organised, without overlap or gaps in control mechanisms, in its consistency with the organisation process and it ensures that adequate response is made to risks which might hinder the achievement of corporate objectives set on the basis of the corporate mission and values. It conforms with legislation and regulations, as a distinctive feature and critical success factor for enhancing customer relationships and in the final analysis for the creation of value for all our stakeholders, over and above any regulatory obligations. Second level control managers – controls assigned to specialist functions including Risk Management, Compliance, Anti Money Laundering, the Senior Officer Responsible for Accounts and Management Control – are responsible for identifying and preventing the occurrence of risk situations on a continuous basis, by employing appropriate assessment models and contributing to the formulation of adequate risk assumption and management policies. The Supervisory Board, Management Board and Senior Management are furnished with integrated maps of risks considered “significant” and they also receive reports on current exposure and future operating risks, with the use, amongst other things, of a special tableau de bord to monitor and assess the system of internal controls. 4.12 UBI Banca is continuing with its commitment, first made in 2003 by the then BPU ADOPTION OF Banca, to apply the ten universal principles of the Global Compact EXTERNAL CODES (www.unglobalcompact.org) in the fields of human rights, the protection of labour, AND PRINCIPLES the environment and the fight against corruption, for the construction of a global economy that is more inclusive and sustainable. 4.13 UBI Banca is a member of the Italian Banking Association Energia Consortium for PARTICIPATION IN energy efficiency in the banking sector and it is also a member of the Sodalitas ASSOCIATIONS Foundation – whose mission is to contribute to the development of the third sector and the growth of a corporate social responsibility culture – and it supports the Sodalitas Social Innovation award. The Group CSR Manger attends the proceedings of the CSR Manager Network Italia, 1 EBEN Italia, the Banks and Civil Society Committee of Science for Peace and the Banks and Social Activities Committee of the Italian Banking Association and also, together with other colleagues, various working groups formed by the Italian Banking Association on specific social responsibility issues. 1 A project launched by the Umberto Veronesi Foundation with the objective of seeking concrete and scientific solutions for peace. 26 Social Report 2012 Governance, commitments and engagement Stakeholder engagement 4.14 The UBI Banca Code of Ethics defines Group stakeholders, dividing them into three classes: STAKEHOLDER • organisations and parties which by the nature of the relationships established or investments GROUPS ENGAGED made, hold an interest in the operations of the Bank (e.g. employees, customers, suppliers); • organisations and parties affected by the external impacts of UBI Banca’s activities, although 4.15 they have formed no direct relationships with it (e.g. local communities and economies); MODALITY OF • organisations and institutions which hold the same interests as those described in the previous SELECTION OF points and which are able to exert influence over the UBI (e.g. trade unions and other STAKEHOLDER organisations which represent stakeholders).  Code of Ethics pages 9-10 The Group’s commitment is designed to continuously improve the quality of relations with its stakeholders and this includes discussion and consultation with them. Engagement activities are designed and structured with account taken of the closeness of the relationship and the breadth and urgency of the interests held by different stakeholders, in addition to the procedures laid down by specific legislation and regulations (e.g. Shareholders' Meetings, negotiations with trade unions) and established practice (e.g. investor relations). 4.16 Registered and unregistered shareholders APPROACH TO The Investor and Media Relations staff manages relations with equity investors (investors in stocks STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT and shares) and fixed income investors (investors in bonds) on a continuous basis and with financial analysts, in full compliance with Consob and Borsa Italiana regulations for the disclosure of 4.17 information which might influence markets. Activities involving contact with investors is performed KEY TOPICS AND through meetings at the Bank and in roadshows abroad as well as by participation at international CONCERNS THAT conferences. In addition to the European and North American financial centres customarily HAVE BEEN RAISED considered during the year an Asian roadshow was introduced in 2012.

The number of contacts are the number of interactions, which may even be with the same parties, at different events on different dates. The Management Board and Registered Shareholders Support staff unit is responsible for relations with registered shareholders and it proposes and co-ordinates initiatives for them. The registered shareholders section on the Group website contains specific information of interest to shareholders which supplements information already available in the investor relations section. All registered shareholders receive a written communication – the “Letter to the Registered Shareholders” – at least annually to keep them up-to-date on the financial and operating position of the Group and on projects in progress. The principal opportunities for engagement are Shareholders' Meetings. In April 2012, 4,522 registered shareholders took part in the ordinary shareholder’s meeting (56.7% in person and 43.3% by proxy), 27.5% of whom Group employees. 27 Social Report 2012 Governance, commitments and engagement Employees The corporate intranet – UBILife – provides an important reporting opportunity for greater engagement with employees through tools which stimulate discussion and participation (e.g. an ideas box, surveys, blogs on articles published in the online magazine and, shortly, social pages reserved to specific professional roles). An ideas box was introduced in 2012 on the subject of “Complaints management” which received numerous and important suggestions for those units responsible for this activity and a project was launched to start up the first social collaboration professional community specially for network bank developers. Internal customer satisfaction surveys came into operation during the year – aimed mainly at staff in contact with customers – in order to understand the level of satisfaction with software applications and services available to the distribution network which could affect levels of external customer satisfaction. Each survey involved over 11 thousand staff, to which a total of more than 75 thousand questionnaires were distributed. Analysis of the over 46 thousand questionnaires returned allowed areas of difficulty for improvement to be identified and corrective action to be taken to constantly raise the standards of customer service. Customers [ PR5] In addition to complaints management, seen as an opportunity to improve services, a “consultation project” has been in operation for some years now with customers. It is a customer satisfaction survey conducted systematically by means of telephone questionnaires managed by a specialist firm. The community Following on from previous years we are commencing engagement with a nationally representative sample of nonprofit organisations by administering a specific questionnaire via internet. Relations with the media are managed by the competent organisational units and are based on the principles of integrity, transparency, independence and equality. They are designed to provide reliable and relevant information on a regular basis on the activities, structure and financial position of the Bank, on its policies and strategies, including social and environmental aspects, and on the impacts of its actions. At Parent level three meetings/conferences were organised in 2012 and 47 press releases were issued, of which 30 of a financial nature and ten on social initiatives (e.g. social 2 bonds) or with a strong community connection (e.g. International Open Day, the “C Project”) . 2 Critical analysis of press articles helps to identify the issues and operational aspects of most interest to the public and how the Group is perceived by public opinion. In 2012, 8,835 articles were published in the press, which in 41.9% of cases provided information on social activities (donations and sponsorships) carried out above all with the support of the network banks, in 30.1% 3 of cases they were specialist articles on the Group and in 28.0% of cases simple mentions of the brand name.

Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector UBI Banca contributes to the sustainable development of the local communities in which it operates, with attention paid to the social and environmental repercussions of its activities. It achieves this through its commercial and credit policies, which consider the demands of all customer segments (especially socially vulnerable consumers and small to medium-sized enterprises), through business innovation to satisfy new needs and development opportunities (e.g. new services for nonprofit organisations in the community and affordable solutions for the disadvantaged) and through specific policies to control and reduce social and environmental impacts – for example the Bank’s armaments policy and its environmental policy. All business policies and management approaches to the various economic, social and environmental issues that affect the financial sector are based on the principles and commitments to stakeholders defined in the Group’s Code of Ethics. Management approach FS1 Since 2007 UBI Banca has pursued a policy for the management of transactions with ENVIRONMENTAL counterparties operating in the arms and weapons materials sector, which bans business relations AND SOCIAL POLICIES with companies involved in the production, development, storage, marketing and/or sales of arms APPLIED TO BUSINESS of mass destruction and other controversial weapons (e.g. mines) and it involves an authorisation regime, for transactions involving international trade in arms, based on the country of destination. The policy applies to all the Group’s activities – with the exception of asset management, where the investment decisions are made with reference to market benchmarks and therefore are not based on screening on specific issues – and it involves periodic assessment of the foreign countries to which arms are destined or from which they come – except for those belonging to the European Union and/or NATO – on the basis of criteria which consider not only international embargos on arms, but also involvement in armed conflicts, violations of human rights perpetrated or tolerated by government authorities, the levels of human development and the level of military expenditure compared to spending on human development (health and education). The spirit, design and criteria for assessing the policy are already basically in line with the Code of responsibility for finance to the arms industry proposed by Science for Peace of the Veronesi Foundation and developed by the multi-stakeholder working group “Banks and Civil Society”, in which UBI Banca participated. While the report on the implementation of the policy published on the website of UBI Banca may be consulted for detailed information, a brief summary of the transactions performed in 2012 at Group 1 level is given here : • 16 authorisations requested in accordance with Law No. 185/1990 worth €17 million (down by 90.1% compared to 2011); • 266 transactions for the receipt of €163.4 million (+48.3% compared to 2011) for exports of arms and weapons materials in accordance with Law No. 185/1990 (78% to EU countries); • 109 transactions for the receipt of €7.9 million (+115.6% compared to 2011) for exports of light arms (87.3% to the USA). No transactions have been performed as exceptions to the criteria of the policy since it was adopted. No requests were received in 2012 from customers for authorisations which did not comply with the policy.  Policy for the management of transactions with counterparties operating in the arms and weapons materials sector 1 The transactions are reported on the basis of the date of the transactions and the authorisations issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and transactions in foreign currency have been translated into euro at the average exchange rate for the year. The data on exports of arms and weapons materials falling under Law No. L,185/1990 may differ from that published in the Prime Minister’s Report to Parliament due to the criteria used to compile the data.  http://www.governo.it/Presidenza/UC PMA /relazione_parlamento.html 29 Social Report 2012 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector  http://www.fondazioneveronesi.it/i-nostri-progetti/divulgazione/science-for-peace/i-gruppi-dilavoro#tab_16 No official policies are pursued with regard to other economic sectors, which may present high risks from a social and environmental viewpoint or which are nevertheless considered critical by rating agencies and investors who employ ethical criteria. Nevertheless, close attention is paid throughout the Group to avoid involvement in transactions which may present reputational risks, in compliance with general principles and rules of conduct in the management of relations with customers contained in the Code of Ethics and the related Code 2 of Conduct. More specifically, with regard to business in the gaming and betting sector , the Credit Area of UBI Banca has invited the credit departments of the network banks to limit this business to a totally marginal level and to employ extremely rigorous conduct in assessing loan applications: parties operating in this sector must not only meet appropriate credit rating criteria, but must also be already known to and approved of by the Bank and in possession of the qualities of absolute integrity, seriousness and reliability. 2012 2011 CO N TRO VER SIAL SECTO R S L en d in g Perc en tag e L en d in g Perc en tag e ( m ilion s o f of total ( m ilio n s o f o f to tal Eu ro) lo an s Eu ro ) lo an s Arms and weapons system 6.8 0.01% 6.5 0.01% Tobacco 92.4 0.15% 81.3 0.12% Alcohol 20.3 0.03% 17.4 0.03% Furs 64.0 0.11% 54.0 0.08% Nuclear Gambling 18.6 0.03% 14.0 0.02% TO TAL 202.2 0.32% 173.2 0.26% An environmental policy has been in force at Group level since 2008, designed not only to progressively reduce direct environmental impacts, but also to provide incentives for virtuous conduct along the value chain through the choice of commercial, credit and purchasing policies.  Environmental policy Special policies and operational and control procedures are in place on the other most important aspects of banking operations concerning consumer protection, market abuse, conflicts of interest, transparency, privacy, usury, money laundering, the fight against terrorism and crimes covered by Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 on the administrative liability of entities. These are constantly updated to comply with changes in legislation and best practices. FS2 The assessment of environmental and social risks is present in all the Group’s activities, although PROCEDURES FOR not based on specific official procedures, except for the armaments sector for which a special set of ASSESSING ASSESSING regulations has been issued to implement the relative policy [ FS1]. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISKS IN The qualitative questionnaires used as part of processes to assess the creditworthiness of BUSINESS businesses include information on social and environmental performance. In the project finance area, in order to receive finance, projects must have passed the authorisation procedures set under Italian law (environmental impact, declaration of the start of activity, single authorisations, building permit, etc.) and the technical, legal, administrative and insurance assessments performed on behalf of the Bank by major independent advisors of international standing. 2 The organisation of gaming and betting in those European countries which allow it is managed by central governments which subcontract operations to private sector companies in return for the payment of license fees. In Italy, laws allow gaming and betting activities to be run by companies authorised by government, which intends in this manner to exercise stringent control over a highly profitable sector with a high risk of illegality. 30 Social Report 2012 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector FS3 No specific standards or performance expectations are set in finance contracts with companies, PROCESSES FOR except with regard to the implementation of the armaments policy, concerning the involvement of MONITORING corporate customers in the production, development, storage, marketing and/or sales of arms of CLIENTS’ mass destruction and other controversial weapons (e.g. mines). All corporate customers which IMPLEMENTATION OF operate in the arms and weapons materials sector are required to sign a declaration to certify that AND COMPLIANCE they are not involved in these activities. Compliance with these declarations is monitored on the WITH basis of information disclosed in the press, by analysts, social organisations and pressure groups. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED IN AGREEMENTS OR TRANSACTION FS4 A training programme commenced last year was completed in 2012 for all personnel on corporate PROCESSES FOR social responsibility and the Code of Ethics with 3,160 hours of direct classroom training for 178 IMPROVING STAFF employees and remote training for 2,144 employees. The training programme, designed as an COMPETENCY TO instrument to implement the Code of Ethics, had the following aims: IMPLEMENT THE • to promote the diffusion of CSR culture, principles and contents in order to incorporate it more ENVIRONMENTAL effectively in corporate policies and to make it a source of innovation, good reputation and AND SOCIAL SOCIAL POLICIES competitiveness; AS APPLIED TO BUSINESS • to increase awareness of the repercussions that CSR may have on the economic value generated by the Group; • to encourage knowledge and the dissemination of Group values and ethics; • to transform corporate values into the responsible conduct of individuals through knowledge of and implementation of the Code of Ethics; • to increase knowledge of some commercial aspects which have strong links with social responsibility (e.g. micro-credit, third sector, migrant banking). A training course is currently being planned, as part of training activity to implement the Code of Ethics, for purchasing personnel (buyers) on sustainability in the supply chain and this will include human rights among the subjects addressed. FS5 The Group’s network banks take part in events and initiatives designed to educate public opinion INTERACTIONS WITH on the issues of sustainable development and the green economy – mobility and sustainable CLIENTS, INVESTEES purchases, ecology and environmental education, renewable energy – organised in the community AND BUSINESS by public and private sector authorities and organisations.

With over 343,000 business customers, 92.8% of which are small business customers – professionals, trades persons and SMEs – Group direct funding from these customers totalled €14.0 billion in 2012 (-1.1% compared to 2011) and outstanding loans to them amounted to €60.5 billion (down by 8.4%, above all as a result of weak demand for credit due to the ongoing economic crisis and of reductions in loans to large corporate businesses). Evidence of the Group’s closeness to and support for the local economies on which it operates, is shown by the fact that 74.9% (up by one percentage point compared to 2011) of loans to businesses are to small to medium-sized enterprises. 32 Social Report 2012 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector FS7 UBI Banca has identified a series of important social causes and specific expectations of stakeholder PRODUCTS AND groups for which special products and services have been designed or subsidised conditions on SERVICES WITH products and services are granted. SPECIFIC SOCIAL BENEFIT Access to credit and support support for families in difficulty In recent years the economic crisis has had a strong impact on a growing number of Italian families, reducing their ability both to gain access to credit – even to obtain a fundamental necessity such as a home – and to meet commitments already entered into. Consequently, in 2012 the banks in the Group participated in new initiatives organised at national or local level and took forward measures launched in previous years to help families in their respective local markets. These included the following: • the Italian Banking Association’s “Young Couples’ Fund” for the purchase of a first home by young couples or single parent families with young children, with “atypical” or temporary employment contracts (€1.2 million granted in 2012 to ten families); • the “Newborns’ Loan”, for families with a child born or adopted in the period 2009-2014, drawn for the “Newborn’s Fund” created by the Department for Family Policies of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers in co-operation with the Italian Banking Association [ www.fondonuovinati.it] (€1.2 million granted in 2012 to 262 families; €7.3 million to 1,298 families since the launch of the initiative in 2010); • the “Italian Banking Association Moratorium”, which forms part of the “Families Programme”, which defers repayments for twelve months on mortgages taken out for the purchase, construction or renovation of a main dwelling for borrowers who have recently suffered a particularly negative event such as the loss of a job or being laid-off, the death of a family bread winner or becoming non self-sufficient (848 mortgages deferred in 2012 on total debt of over €70 million); • the “Solidarity fund for the purchase of a main dwelling”, created as the result of an initiative by the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, which has been in operation since the end of 2010, to enable debtors in difficulty to apply for the deferment of mortgage repayments on main dwelling (24 customers’ mortgages deferred in 2012 for a total capital amount of approximately €2.5 million); • The “Loan of Hope” initiated by the Italian Banking Association and the Italian Episcopal Conference to implement projects for the return to work or the start of small businesses for families that have lost all income from work, have no unearned income or income other than that generated by the ownership of a home or ordinary or extraordinary state redundancy benefits (300 loans granted in 2012 for a total of €1.7 million). Marketing began in 2012 of a Basic Account – the result of co-operation between the Ministry of the Economy and Finance (MEF), the Bank of Italy, the Italian Banking Association and payment services associations – which forms part of government initiatives to promote financial and social inclusion for vulnerable groups in society, to reduce the use of cash and to encourage the use of more efficient means of payment. Basic accounts are offered to all consumers with a limited number of transaction in return for the payment of reduced fees and charges and, for pensioners, who can no longer draw their pensions in cash and for the socially disadvantaged (with an annual ISEE equivalent economic status indicator income of less than €7.500), the concessions also include exemption from charges and stamp duty. At this difficult time of economic crisis, the social function of pawn credit is becoming increasingly more important. A growing number of customers, generally in the medium-low income bands, are turning to nine branches of Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria which provide pawn credit on precious goods (gold, precious stones and gold watches) and which granted loans in 2012 of €31.5 million (+6.8% compared to 2011). Natural disasters In order to assist the people and businesses hit by the earthquakes which hit Emilia Romagna, Lombardy and Veneto in 2012, the Group promptly applied government measures to defer repayments on mortgages and loans and added further concessions of its own (4,480 loan 33 Social Report 2012 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector repayments deferred on total remaining debt of €283 million) and it adhered to the convention agreement signed by the Italian Banking Association and the Cassa Deposito e Prestiti (state controlled fund and deposit institution) for the grant of loans (35 loans concluded for more than €2 million). In order to further come to the needs of its customers, the Group also undertook action on its own account to defer repayments on mortgages and it created a loan pool of €60 million, distributed among the Group banks that operate in the areas affected, for the grant of medium to long-term loans at particularly attractive terms and conditions (115 loans to both businesses and private individual for over €6.5 million). Action also continued to support families in Abruzzo hit by the 2009 earthquake under the agreement signed between the Italian Banking Association and the Cassa Deposito e Prestiti (state controlled fund and deposit institution) (14 loans for a total of €1.6 million). Furthermore Banco di Brescia and Banco di San Giorgio promptly adhered to the Ordinances of the President’s Office of the Council of Ministers with regard to the deferment of mortgage repayments to support towns in the Veneto and Liguria, hit by flooding in October 2010 and November 2011. Credit and services for students In order to help young people with their education, the banks in the Group were among the first in Italy to offer unsecured loans through convention arrangments with local universities. The Group currently adheres to the initiative “Give them a future”, set up by the Youth Ministry and the Italian Banking Association to grant subsidised loans, unsecured by collateral or personal guarantees, to students between the age of 18 and 40 who satisfy precise academic criteria (€200,000 granted in 2012 to 38 students). Co-operation with the main universities present on the local markets on which the Group operates is also continuing through the distribution of the prepaid card Enjoy. This card combines typical banking functions with specific university services (12,600 cards issued in 2012 for students of the University of Bergamo, the University of Pavia, the Carlo Cattaneo LIUC University of Varese and the universities of Bari and of Camerino). The cards are also used as payment instruments for university services and as identity documents or “university record books”. AntiAnti-crisis measures for businesses To provide credit to businesses – and to SMEs in particular – in order to support economic growth in local economies is a high priority and even more so in times of crisis like today. During the year, the Group banks participated in a series of measures to help businesses and firms on their respective markets, co-operating with public institutions (chambers of commerce, regional and provincial governments) and guarantee bodies. Anti-crisis measures launched previously to support small to medium-sized businesses continued with the application, amongst other things, of the 2009 “Joint Announcement”, the 2011 “Agreement on Loans to Small to Medium-Size Enterprises” and the grant of loans drawn from Cassa Deposito e Prestiti (state controlled fund and deposit institution) funds (6,000 loans for over €333 million granted in 2012) together with the use of government instruments to mitigate credit risk such as the Guarantee fund for SMEs pursuant to Law No. 662/1996 (€312 million granted during the year for a total of €753 million of loans outstanding). In 2012 the Group adhered to the “New measures for Credit to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Accord” signed by the Italian Banking Association, the Ministries of the Economy and Finance and Economic Development and by other business associations. It involved the following: • the deferment of capital repayment instalments on mortgages, loans and leases and the extension of the repayment schedules of loans (20,700 deferment applications approved – almost all those submitted met the requirements for admissibility – for a total of €6.8 billion for repayments deferred on total principal of €850 million and approximately 350 applications were presented to extend repayment schedules for loans where the remaining principal totalled €107 million); • the creation of a loan pool entitled “Italy Investment Projects” to finance SME investment 34 Social Report 2012 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector projects and a “Public Administration Receivables” loan pool to release funds consisting of payments due from public administrations (€600 million allocated by UBI Banca for each of the two loan pools for the start of operations from the beginning of 2013). UBI Community for the third sector Relationships with nonprofit organisations offer banks an important return in terms of reputation and links with local markets (in view of the key function they perform as a multiplier of relationships and a social aggregator) and a strategic commercial opportunity in consideration of the substantial growth seen in the sector over the last two decades. Historically the Group holds a quota of deposits from and loans to nonprofit organisations that is higher than for the sector 3 nationally . In 2012 the Group had total funding from the sector of €1.8 billion (57.0% in Lombardy) with market share of 8.7% (compared to an overall market share of 5.4%) and €0.8 billion of loans to the sector (62.7% in Lombardy) with market share of 7.8% (compared to an overall market share of 5.4% ).

It is a new commercial model specifically designed to provide support for the everyday operations and the projects and investments of the different types of nonprofit organisation. Special instruments have been developed for the thorough assessment of the creditworthiness of nonprofit organisations – able to evaluate individual counterparties on the basis of their specific characteristics – and a testing phase was commenced during the year at some of the network banks to ascertain their effectiveness and feasibility. Events to present this model to operators in the sector continued, with meetings at Varese, Monza, Erba and Concesio and the range of commercial products and services commercial was further expanded with the launch of products termed “UBI Community Social Bonds” and a new “Nonprofit On Line” current account specially for organisations who prefer to use the internet channel to manage their bank accounts. The UBI Community social bonds [ 2.10] represent an important innovation in the sector nationally, bringing Italy into line with the more evolved European countries in the area of finance for nonprofit organisations. They provide subscribers with the opportunity to obtain a return on their investment in line with the interest rates offered by the Bank with respect to similar investments, and at the same they support high social value and impact initiatives organised by local public and private sector organisations. The issuing bank either donates a portion of the funding to support initiatives for which the debt was issued, or it uses the amount received to disburse finance. Since the launch in April and until the end of the year, the Group issued 17 social bonds (14 by the network banks and three by the Parent ) for a total of €198.5 million and in many cases they were fully subscribed well before the end of the issue period. As a result of these 3 Data as at 30/09/2012. Processing of Bank of Italy BIP data (online Base Informativa Pubblica – tables TDB 10290 and TDB 10295) by the UBI Banca Studies Service. The funding includes current account deposits, savings deposits and certificates of deposit. 35 Social Report 2012 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector issuances, a total of €1 million has been donated to health and welfare, research and local economic development projects [ EC8] (of which €905 thousand disbursed in 2012) and a loan pool of €17.6 million has been created for the grant of medium to long-term loans under competitive terms and conditions to consortiums, firms and social co-operatives that are members of the Consorzio Nazionale della Cooperazione Sociale Gino Mattarelli (CGM – the Gino Mattarelli national consortium of social co-operation). Important agreements have been concluded as part of UBI Community operations with major nonprofit organisations and representatives of operators in the sector – the CGM Co-operative Group, Federazione Italiana Scuole Materne di Bergamo e Brescia (the Bergamo and Brescia Italian Federation of children’s nurseries) – designed to make products and services available to their members under competitive terms and conditions, with particular reference to access to sources of finance. For example co-operation continued in 2012 with the Accademia Teatro alla Scala (La Scala Theatre Academy), with the objective of providing concrete support in training students of the Academy with a range of solutions for financing and investment management. With technical assistance from the Italian Association for the promotion of a co-operation and nonprofit culture (AICCON), UBI Banca has created the first national observatory on finance and the third sector, for processing and disseminating information annually on the financial requirements of the third sector. The observatory’s first publication presented the results of a survey of the financial requirements of a sample of social co-operatives in Italy. In December 2011, an Enjoy Special Edition card account reserved to employees of the Group was launched in relation to the UBI Community project, with customised graphics and the ability to make donations to support social and charitable activities. Each employee, may select a project from those proposed, to which the Bank donates its charges on the payment transactions made during the year using POS terminals. [ EC8] Treasury services The commercial authorities segment includes public authorities and those entities to which Group banks provide treasury and collection services (1,894 services managed at the end of 2012, slightly down on the previous year). The contracts signed involve the disbursement of contributions to these authorities to support their institutional goals. [ EC8] During the year the UBI Group worked with the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research, participating in the preparatory stages for the launch of a project to adopt the “IT Ordinance” as part of its receipts service for schools and it created a special task-force to provide schools with assistance to help them with the changeover to a paperless system. The “IT Ordinance” service was introduced in over 130 schools and around 50 other authorities, thereby automating the processing of about 35% of documents. With this service and with the “substitute record keeping” service for documentation, public authorities benefit from an efficient service which reduces operating risks and is compliant with regulations for the digitalisation of public administrations. A customer satisfaction survey was conducted in May and June on treasury and payment and collection services provided to public authorities. This was also used for the certification of the system for the management of the “quality of treasury services provided to public authorities” (UNI EN ISO standard 9001:2008). The over 800 authorities interviewed gave very high satisfaction scores for the service as a whole, both in terms of expertise and efficiency, and said they would choose UBI Banca as a provider of this service again. Convention loans for businesses Agreements with guarantee bodies and trade associations and the use of instruments to mitigate credit risk towards the public sector in order to facilitate access to credit for small to medium-sized enterprises – also through more favourable rates and charges – represent an important factor in our relationship with local businesses, and in these difficult times for the economy they have also taken on a substantial anti-crisis value. At present 184 active convention agreements exist with guarantee bodies in different local areas, of which over 149 participating on the UBI-Confidi Web 36 Social Report 2012 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector platform, a tool to which new functions have recently been added, designed by the Group to facilitate information exchange between the Bank and guarantee bodies with which agreements are held and also to manage business. Total outstanding loans backed by guarantee bodies and guarantee funds amounted to almost €3.7 billion at the end of 2012, while new loans granted during the year amounted to €1.3 billion and related to over 17,700 loans. These loans include “Anti-usury” credit lines, which give better terms and conditions than ordinary loans because they are backed by guarantees (1,184 loans existing at the end of 2012 for over €28 million).  Reports and Accounts 2012 pages 42-46, 47-50 2 T2 “Community for the Community” bonds In order to provide a concrete response to strong concerns over credit rationing for the real economy and to support businesses in the community by directly channelling investment received 2 from it to them, the project “T Community for the Community” was launched in the second half of 2012. These consist of bonds issued by the Parent and the network banks in co-operation with “local group systems” (e.g. trade associations) to obtain new funding that can be put back into circulation to create loan pools for lending under competitive conditions. The following loan pools were created in 2012: • €46 million for the benefit of companies belonging to the Associazione Industriali di Brescia (Brescia Association of Industrialists), following the issuance of €23 million of bonds issued by Banco di Brescia, Banca Popolare di Bergamo and Banca di Valle Camonica; • €32 million for the benefit of companies belonging to the Bergamo Confindustria (confederation of industry), following the issuance of €16 million of bonds by Banca Popolare di Bergamo, Banco di Brescia and Banca di Valle Camonica; • €37.1 million for the benefit of companies belonging to Assolombarda (Lombard employers’ association) following the issuance of €18.55 million of bonds listed on the MOT (electronic bond market) by UBI Banca and placed by Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, Banca Popolare di Bergamo and Banco di Brescia; • €10 million for the benefit of companies registered with the Chamber of Commerce of Lecco and belonging to the main local trade associations, following the issuance of €5 million of bonds by Banca Popolare di Bergamo. Issuances are already scheduled for 2013 by Banca Regionale Europea and Banca Popolare di Bergamo to respectively assist business members of the Cuneo Confartigianato (artisans’ association) and businesses registered with the Brianza Chamber of Commerce Monza Brianza that are members of the main local trade associations.  Reports and Accounts 2012 page 49 FS8 In recent years, a series of initiatives already developed over the years by various banks in the PRODUCTS AND Group have been integrated into a single range of products and services to finance household and SERVICES WITH corporate investments in the environmental field with regard above all to the development and use SPECIFIC of alternative energy sources. ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT The Forza Sole (Sun Strength) product is for individual customers to finance domestic photovoltaic systems covered by specific insurance policies (193 loans granted in 2012 for a total of €3.1 million). A variety of products differing in type of loan and investment exist for businesses: “Renewable energies” is to finance the generation of electricity from renewable sources such as solar, windpower and biomass co-generation (two loans for €1.9 million in 2012), while “New Energy photovoltaic” is to finance photovoltaic plants inclusive of tangible investments in items such as land and building works, consulting services, feasibility studies, designs and technical appraisals. The grant of loans is subject to a series of verifications, including: evaluation of the project (business plan and technical report); verification of the authorisations and permits required by the regulations in force; selection of instruments for the repayment of the loan; verification of the 37 Social Report 2012 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector request for a technical appraisal of the project for loans of over €350 thousand. In 2012, 195 loans were granted for €90 million. In addition to banking products, Full Power lease products were also distributed by UBI Leasing for investments in renewable energy (29 new leases financed in 2012 for €22.5 million and a total of 376 outstanding leases amounting to €671.0 million), together with project finance operations by Centrobanca for investments in energy, the environment and infrastructures. Normally the size of the transactions managed varies from a minimum of ten to a maximum of €100 million, with a life which normally for the energy and environment sectors is not longer than 15 years. However with its “Green Green Project” Project Centrobanca made project finance also available for smaller projects. 2012 2011 OF PRO JECT F IN AN CE ACTIV ITIES PRO JECT GREEN PRO JECT W HICH AN D GREEN PRO JECT TO TAL TO TAL F IN AN CE PRO JECT F IN AN CE GREEN F in an c in g g ran ted d u rin g th e year Numbers of contracts 20 10 10 34 19 15 of which for renewable energy 17 7 10 25 10 15 Amount authorised (€ milion) 332 296 36 889 800 89 of which for renewable energy 132 96 36 253 164 89 Amount disbursed (€ milion) 207 179 28 451 368 83 of which for renewable energy 122 94 28 221 138 83 F in an c in g o u tstan d in g at th e en d o f th e year Numbers of contracts 137 87 50 118 78 40 of which for renewable energy 111 61 50 94 54 40 Amount authorised (€ milion) 1,869 1,598 271 1,814 1,571 243 of which for renewable energy 1,094 823 271 1,007 764 243 Amount disbursed (€ milion) 1,489 1,236 253 1,324 1,092 232 of which for renewable energy 1,065 812 253 944 712 232 2012 2011 PRO JECT F IN AN CE O PERATIO N S NO.

Economic performance EC1 EC1 UBI Banca ended 2012 confident yet again of the high quality of the work it has carried out during DIRECT ECONOMIC the years of the crisis, which gave priority to strengthening its balance sheet as the basis for VALUE GENERATED stability and future growth. 1 AND DISTRIBUTED At the end of 2012: • capital ratios were again appropriate to the structure of a conventional bank and they were among the highest in Italy (core tier one ratio of 10.29% and 9.16% compared to 9% requested on the basis of the EBA exercise and a total capital ratio of 16.01%); • liquidity was sufficient to allow compliance with Basel 3 requirements in terms of the net stable funding ratio and the liquidity coverage ratio; • structural indicators showed low financial leverage (tangible assets 17 times tangible equity + non controlling interests + profit for the period) a ratio of loans to funding of 94%, a ratio of loans to funding from ordinary customers of 116%, low dependence on international markets (81.3% of funding from ordinary customers), loans accounting for over 70% of total assets and growth within this of the percentage granted to core customers (75% of the total), which confirms the effectiveness of action taken to discontinue or reduce business with non-core customers and the closeness of the Bank to the local economies of its customers. st As at 31 December 2012, total outstanding net deteriorated loans (non-performing, impaired, restructured and past due/in arrears) accounted for 8.73% of total net loans as a result of the deterioration in the economic environment and also of the reorganisation of consumer credit and st leasing operations. Net non-performing loans increased to €2.95 billion from €2.48 billion as at 31 December 2011, accounting for 3.18% of total net loans compared to 3.35% for loans to the private sector nationally. From the viewpoint of earnings, despite the complex economic and financial environment affected by recession and high volatility, 2012 ended with consolidated profit of €82.7 million as a result of containing costs (-5.1% compared to 2011) and defence of income (+2.6%), principally due to the contribution from the finance area. The profit of the Parent, UBI Banca, was €223.5 million. th The Management Board submitted a proposal to the Shareholders’ meeting of 20 April 2013 to pay a dividend per share €0.05 on outstanding shares on the ex dividend date, excluding treasury stock.  Reports and Accounts 2012 pages 94-106, 57* 1 The statement of the determination and distribution of economic value generated complies with the presentation proposed by the Italian Banking Association. 40 Social Report 2012 Economic performance DETER MIN ATIO N O F THE ECO N O MIC VAL UE 2012 2011 VAR IATIO N CR EATED (thousands of euro ) Interest and similar income 3,924,400 4,047,546 -3.0% Interest expense and similar (1,992,716) (1,925,857) +3.5% Commission income 1,369,422 1,351,827 +1.3% Commission expense (187,616) (159,893) +17.3% Dividends and similar income 15,591 19,997 -22.0% Net trading income (loss) 91,803 10,711 +757.1% Net hedging income 1,072 8,938 -88.0% Income (loss) from disposal or repurchase of: 163,551 26,529 +516.5% a) loans and receivables (2,131) 2,464 n.s. b) available-for-sale financial assets 141,556 11,929 +1086.7% c) held-to-maturity investments d) financial liabilities 24,126 12,136 n.s.

The issue of the fight against and adaptation to climate change involves investments by private individuals and businesses, both to comply with changes in regulations and the efficiency standards for production processes and products and also to develop and use renewable energy sources. The Group has developed specific financing, financial lease and project finance products for these purposes [ FS8]. EC3 All employees benefit from supplementary pension plans through either internal or external COVERAGE OF pension funds, which involve a defined contribution by the employer as part of supplementary DEFINED BENEFIT company labour agreements. Employees may also allocate a part of their salaries to supplementary PLAN OBLIGATIONS pension schemes. Coverage for commitments resulting from internal funds, consisting of defined benefits, is performed by allocating amounts to the “provision for risks and charges: pension and similar obligations”, which are subject to periodic actuarial measurement in compliance with IAS 19 “Employee benefits”.  Reports and Accounts 2012 pages 323-327 EC4 The UBI Banca Group has received no financing from government, but it has used “Banks and SIGNIFICANT Insurance Fund” funds earmarked for training activities [ LA10] and payouts from the “Solidarity FINANCIAL fund for retraining and professional requalification to support the employment and income of ASSISTANCE banking personnel” to manage situations of employment difficulties [ LA10]. These are private RECEIVED FROM sector funds which the Group has contributed to together with other banks. GOVERNMENT  Reports and Accounts 2012 pages 31-33 Market presence EC5 At least once a year, the Supervisory Board, which has an internal Remuneration Committee, sets STANDARD ENTRY and reviews remuneration policies. It also oversees proper implementation of them and formulates LEVEL WAGE BY 2 remuneration schemes for “top management” and control functions ensuring that they are GENDER COMPARED compliant with legislation and regulations and consistent with general policies of the Bank in terms TO LOCAL MINIMUM of risk assumption, strategies, long-term objectives, corporate governance and internal control WAGE approaches. In accordance with the legislation, in 2012 UBI Banca updated its Group Remuneration And Incentives Policies, in order to bring them into line with long-term strategies and objectives, by linking them to results, with account taken of the risks and capital and liquidity levels needed to perform the activities undertaken. At the same time it updated the perimeter of those personnel identified as “Top Management” and the “Highest management level of the control functions”, through a careful process of self-assessment. The most prudent criteria have been applied for those personnel, with at least 50% of the variable component of remuneration consisting of shares with an adequate retention period and at least 40% of remuneration subject to deferred payment systems and retrospective adjustment mechanisms. The variable component of remuneration is set by using instruments designed to involve and motivate personnel to achieve medium and long-term Group policies and to recognise team and 2 Persons whose work has or may have a significant impact on the risk profile of the Bank. 42 Social Report 2012 Economic performance individual contributions.  Reports and Accounts 2012 page 480 2012 2011 AVERAGE GR O SS SAL ARY VAR IA BL E 1 VAR IABL E (thousands of euro) F IXED VAR IAB L E TO TA L F IXED VARIAB L E 1 TO TAL TO TO TAL TO TO TAL Sen io r man ag ers Men 139.7 7.6 147.3 5.4% 138.9 8.5 147.4 6.1% Women 131.7 5.3 137.0 4.0% 125.2 6.5 131.7 5.2% Mid d le man ag ers Men 60.2 2.5 62.7 4.2% 59.2 2.5 61.7 4.2% Women 52.7 2.0 54.7 3.8% 52.0 2.2 54.2 4.2% Pro fessio n al areas Men 38.1 1.0 39.1 2.6% 37.2 1.3 38.5 3.5% Women 35.1 0.9 36.0 2.6% 34.3 1.2 35.5 3.5% 1 The figures are inclusive of: Incentive Schemes, One-off Bonuses, Company Bonuses and Commercial Contests. 1 AVER AGE SAL AR Y , F IRST JO B ( th o u san d s o f eu ro ) 2012 2011 Men 27.8 26.0 Women 26.7 26.4 2 Trade union minimum 25.5 25.0 1 Average pay as at 31/12/2012 of “first employment” contract (inclusive of any indemnities for particular types of work there may be e.g. cash indemnity for cashiers). 2 The base salary set in the national labour contract for the 3rd level 2nd area. The incentive schemes are designed to support value generation by Group companies and to reward the achievement of risk-adjusted objectives, while maintaining adequate capital levels and liquidity over time, through the identification of specific trigger conditions. The parameters employed are mainly quantitative and measurable, sometimes based at times on qualitative aspects and normally also related to levels of satisfaction by “external and internal customers”. The calculation methods are designed to allow graduated payment of bonuses, depending on the degree to which objectives are attained, and also to prevent conduct subject to the risk (moral hazard). Bonuses are related to the complexity of the role and normally to the results achieved at individual, team, company and Group level, with significant reductions and even no payment if performance is lower than expected or negative. The right to bonuses is withdrawn if company regulations or 3 instructions are violated and a clawback clause exists for senior management in particular, applied in cases of fraudulent behaviour or serious misconduct. Bonuses may not exceed a predetermined maximum limit, set in relation to gross fixed annual remuneration and in proportion to the group considered, consistent with the principle of a balance between fixed and variable components of 4 remuneration. Special treatments such as guaranteed bonuses and leaving bonuses which exceed those provided for by collective labour agreements are excluded. For personnel belonging to corporate control functions, the incentive scheme is based on parameters relating to the position occupied and the risks managed and objectives of an operating results and financial nature are excluded. It is paid according to the same conditions for payment set for other personnel. The remuneration policies and practices pursued are subject to examination by the Compliance, Risk Management and Audit Functions, each according to its specific competencies in order to ensure that the remuneration policies and practices pursued comply with the relevant legislation and regulations and that they function properly. All staff involved in incentive schemes receive information that is as broad, complete and transparent as possible by means of various tools such as regulations, circulars and information given over the corporate intranet. 3 A clause which states that a bonus paid must be returned in cases of fraudulent behaviour or serious misconduct. 4 Without prejudice to exceptions allowed by legislation and regulations. 43 Social Report 2012 Economic performance EC6 The Group operates almost exclusively in Italy and 97.1% of purchases are from local suppliers that POLICY, PRACTICES are resident in Italy.

The Group’s Code of Ethics states that where requirements are the same, preference is given to those suppliers who demonstrate the implementation of good practices of social responsibility and/or possession of social or environmental certifications. To ensure the independence of suppliers, we seek to avoid the establishment of exclusive business relationships, or those characterised by excessive financial dependence on the Group (the total amount paid to each Group supplier must not exceed 25% of the supplier’s total turnover). Suppliers who provide goods and services to the Group on a regular basis or occasional suppliers who supply goods and services for amounts greater than €30,000 are registered on a List of Approved Suppliers managed by the Purchasing Department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi. The approved list contains preferred suppliers for each type of good and service, listed on the basis of quality (50% weighting), competitiveness (25% weighting) and financial and capital soundness (25%) and we periodically assess them with the involvement of budget managers, the Purchasing Department and an outside database. Suppliers of utility services (local water companies, gas companies), landlords of rented properties and institutional suppliers (e.g. Italian Banking Association and CONSOB Italian securities market authority) are excluded from management on the list of approved suppliers. Suppliers on the list numbered 863 in 2012 (+108 compared to 2011), as a result of 127 new suppliers and 19 removed from the list. Contractual conditions and terms of payment are constantly updated to comply with the legislation in force and with market conditions on the basis of periodical monitoring. Supplies which are not regular or for small amounts, and considered not strategic and which do not carry a high operational risk are regulated by the general conditions of a standard contract, while specific contracts are drawn up for recurring, strategic supplies, which carry high operational risk or which are for large amounts. 44 Social Report 2012 Economic performance All suppliers are required to fully comply with legislation and regulations to protect the rights of workers, which in particular means observation of national trade union agreements for the sector to which they belong and of pension, accident prevention and insurance legislation along with specific legislation on health and safety. Additionally, all suppliers are required to comply with the principles of the Group’s Code of Ethics either when orders are placed or contracts signed. EC7 The recruitment policies of network banks for personnel in commercial roles is to give priority to HIRING FROM LOCAL the assessment of candidates who are resident in the area of the central units and/or local areas in PERSONNEL which they are to work, in order to exploit their knowledge of the local community. Particular attention was paid to selection processes in areas of southern Italy, in order, amongst other things, to implement generation turnover plans contained within the Group’s business plans, with specific selection sessions carried out locally. Constant co-operation with schools, training institutes and local universities enables the Group to offer opportunities to young people who live and study in the local areas in which the Group operates. Only one member of senior management was recruited from abroad in 2012. Indirect economic impacts EC8 The Group pays great attention to promoting social and cultural activities and also to local DEVELOPMENT AND economic development and it supports a huge number of church and other nonprofit organisations IMPACT OF in the community with donations and sponsorships. This activity is as an expression of its mutual INFRASTRUCTURE spirit as a co-operative, for which the articles of association of UBI Banca and the various Group INVESTMENTS AND banks require the allocation of a share of the distributable profits (the maximum percentage SERVICES PROVIDED allocated varies, where specified, between 1% and 4%). PRIMARILY FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT This activity helps to strengthen the identity of the Group and the individual network banks and has THROUGH no direct correlation with the achievement of commercial objectives, except for cause-related COMMERCIAL, IN marketing initiatives. This action is not the result of rigid and predetermined policies and guidelines, KIND OR PRO BONO but of assessments – based on criteria of consistency, efficiency and effectiveness – of the projects ENGAGEMENT and initiatives taken in the community. They are decided at local level by individual banks and foundations, with support from UBI Banca for the more far reaching projects. There are no particular areas of intervention defined a priori, except for the foundations, formed over the years to promote social and cultural growth in their local areas according to the obligations of their constitutions.

Even when they are of professional sports clubs, the contributions are in any case normally made to organisations which promote the growth of the moral education of young people through sport. The Group also makes donations to assist with the activities of Pro Solidar, a national fund in the banking sector for solidarity and charitable initiatives consisting of a bilateral entity managed by the Italian Banking Association and the national secretariats of the banking trade unions. It is the first body in the world formed by a national trade union agreement and funded on an equal basis by workers and companies. Each employee may contribute a sum of six euro per year deducted directly from salary, against which the company pays in an equal amount. As part of the Group’s philanthropical activities, UBI Banca develops partnerships with the larger organisations and participates in more far reaching initiatives not strictly linked to particular local areas. The principal donations and sponsorships in 2012 included the following: • the “Christmas Dinners” ” initiative, in co-operation with the Exodus Foundation of Milan, Bergamo, Brescia, Turin, Breno and Jesi and the Bari Archdiocese Caritas to help the street homeless and those who suffer from particular hardship. For the third year, 1,120 people were invited to spend a peaceful 46 Social Report 2012 Economic performance day and enjoy a Christmas dinner, served and entertained by volunteers, including 150 Group employees, and they received a gift package with contents designed to be of comfort in winter; • scholarships for four senior high school pupils for a year of study abroad with the Intercultura Foundation onlus; • the continuation of co-operation with the Brescia and Bergamo International Pianoforte th Festival Organisation for the 49 edition of the festival of the same name entitled “Brahms, the progressive conservative”, one of the most important nineteenth century musicians. This edition was also enriched by an educational initiative for young people featuring the famous violinist Uto Ughi; • partial cover of the costs for the restoration of the S. Maria dei Miracoli Basilica of Milan, commenced in 2004 (the following has been fully restored to date: the façade and the outer surfaces; the side naves; the chapels and the valuable renaissance and baroque paintings, while completion of the restoration of the transept, the dome and the altar zone is currently in progress. Work is still to commence on the central nave and the very broad vault, decorated with renaissance rosettes, above it); • the A cradle to operate project of the Cieli Azzurri onlus Friends of Paediatric Surgery Association, to contribute to the estimated costs of bringing the Policlinico hospital of Milan to the forefront in the treatment of neonates who require surgery, by equipping the new Neonatal Intensive Care Department with six latest generation neonatal intensive care units; • co-operation with the Einaudi Centre for the preparation and presentation of the Annual Report on the Global Economy and Italy. The study, conducted by a team internal to the Einaudi Centre co-ordinated by Professor Mario Deaglio of the University of Turin, was presented in the Group’s network banks with the objective of offering an initiative of national importance at local level and at the same time of “localising” customer relationships, thanks to the involvement of local firms; • sponsorship of the San Patrignano Annual International Equestrian Competition and the UBI Banca Goggi Ski Club of Bergamo (with an important ski school for young people); • support for the Sodalitas Social Innovation Award, Award a Sodalitas Foundation initiative to support and facilitate the development of profit-nonprofit partnerships to give visibility to innovative high social value projects of nonprofit organisations. The website www.socialinnovation.sodalitas.it is the first of its kind in Italy dedicated entirely to forprofitnonprofit partnerships as a driving force behind the development of innovative social projects. In economics field, UBI Banca supported the Cathay Pacific China Trader Award for the third consecutive year, a prestigious international award for Italian companies that have excelled on Asian markets for their innovation, technology and know-how. Donations were also made to Assofranchising, at the 2012 Franciacorta Festival and to the publication of the “historical” book Photoansa, Photoansa produced by the press agency ANSA, which features important facts which occurred during the past year portrayed with the most significant photos. Yet again in 2012 UBI Sistemi e Servizi donated retired equipment, which nevertheless still functions well, to various organisations and associations which requested it, for an estimated value of €16,588 [ 3.11]: 35 beneficiaries (eight voluntary associations, 12 schools, four parishes and Church institutes, four recreational associations, two police units, three administrative authorities, one foundation, one cultural association) received 238 personal computers (of which 88 notebooks), one monitor, one photocopy machine and twelve software user licenses. Important investments in the community have already been decided for future years. They total €3.2 million, to be disbursed on the basis of the actual implementation of the activities and projects to which they are destined. The following are of particular importance: • the restoration of the Astino Monastery, founded in 1070 by the Vallumbrosan monks at the foot of the south western slopes of the hills on which the ancient heart of the city of Bergamo was built (in 2007 it became the property of the Order of the Misericordia Maggiore of Bergamo MIA Foundation, to which the Bank’s donation will be made); • the Ospedale Maggiore Research Foundation of Bergamo (hospital research) – of which UBI Banca is one of the founding members – to promote and finance scientific research of particular 47 Social Report 2012 Economic performance interest to society; • the project to renovate the paediatric outpatients department of the Children’s Hospital, at the Azienda Spedali Civili of Brescia; • the Cardinal Federico Borromeo Foundation to “create, promote and diffuse” culture and art, through its support, amongst other things, of the Ambrosian Library, dedicated to academic teaching and research. Proceeds of the UBI Community Social Bonds went to support the Comunità di Sant’Egidio (assistance for the elderly through support in the home and in social life) and to the Umberto Veronesi Foundation (for research into new techniques for the early diagnosis of breast and lung tumours at the initial stages). Yet again in 2012 Banca Popolare di Bergamo assiduously pursued its philanthropic activities both frequently and with conviction to provide concrete and active support to its presence on its local market: a particular, but equally important way, of being a “community bank”. In addition to contributing to the capital endowments of the UBI per Varese Foundation Onlus and the Banca Popolare di Bergamo Foundation Onlus, this bank supported a series of initiatives, some recurring, which now form part of local cultural traditions, while others are new. Established partnerships include the following: support for the Don Antonio Mazzi Exodus Foundation Onlus (for youth education and hardship), donations to the Associazione Nationale Mutilati e Invalidi Civili (for social emergencies to protect the rights of civilian invalids), the “Christmas Solidarity” ” project (for some years now the employees of Banca Popolare have worked to bring a few moments of joy and happiness into the lives of patients in large hospitals for the disabled and rest homes for the elderly in the provinces in which the bank operates), co-operation with the FAI Fondo Ambiente Italiano (Italian Environment Fund) with the Panza Villa and Collection in particular, jointly with the town and province of Varese) and support for the Bergamo Section of the Italian Alpine Club for aware mountain climbing and protection of the environment. Important initiatives in the cultural field included support for the Social Theatre of Bergamo, the Noesis Association for a cycle of seminars on philosophy and the “Verba Manent” ” initiative of the City of Bergamo, a series of meetings with protagonists from the world of culture and show business. Donations to the town of Varese for the Apollonio Theatre season were of particular charitable significance, used to allow free of charge entrance to the disabled. Branches shared the centenaries of their operations with local communities with ethnographic, photographic and historical exhibitions and choral performances. These were opportunities to recount the history of a bank through pictures, documents songs and personal testimony, a bank which has always been committed to fostering local culture, art, traditions and history to reinforce its local identity in harmony with society and the community. nd Sports sponsorships included the Bergamo International Tennis Tournament, the 92 edition of the Tre Valli Varesine and the Binda Trophy cycle races, the U.C. Albinoleffe football club and numerous local sports initiatives to promote and value the practice of sports with particular reference to new generations. The Bank is present with its own office at the new Bergamo Trade Fair CentreCentre and participated in this respect with sponsorships and activities connected with numerous events either organised directly or in any case implemented under the auspices of the Bergamo Trade Fair Organisation. Again in 2012 it was an official partner at the Varese Trade Fair and the Monza Fair, as it reaffirmed its commitment to making its presence more widespread and incisive even beyond traditional Bergamo borders. Proceeds from the issue of UBI Community Social Bonds went to the Renato Piatti Foundation (rehabilitation therapy in water for children with serious disabilities and diseases carried out at the Besozzo rehabilitation centre) and the Our Family Association (purchase of a minibus for disabled children). 48 Social Report 2012 Economic performance In addition to funding the Banca San Paolo di Brescia Foundation and the Credito Agrario Bresciano Foundation Giovanni Folonari Cultural Institute, established to pursue the original ideals of the banks of the same name from which they emerged, the Bank also carefully selects events and organisations to give support directly to local solidarity, cultural and sports initiatives. The numerous activities carried out in 2012 included the following worthy of mention: donations to the initiative co-ordinated by the Bresciana Community Foundation for people hit by the earthquake in Emilia Romagna, to the Brescia Teatro Grande Foundation for the theatre season, to the Brescia Foundation for Economic and Legal Studies and, in the sports field, sponsorships of the historical Mille Miglia and Brescia Rugby. In 2012 this bank published the book “Banco di Brescia, il Palazzo e la Quadreria” (a 2012 Christmas art edition), in order to help promote the cultural heritage of the local communities in which the Bank operates. In the economic field the bank supported the activities of Pro Brixia, a special firm of the Brescia Chamber of Commerce which promotes and organises initiatives designed to create commercial opportunities for Brescia companies on international markets. In 2012 it contributed to a research study conducted by a group of academics at the University of Brescia into the consequences of the crisis on the fundamentals of the Brescia economy and on the dynamics of international commerce. The results were published in the book “Le imprese bresciane e la crisi globale” (Brescia businesses and the global crisis). Proceeds from the issue of UBI Community Social Bonds were donated to the following: the Paediatric Oncological Haematology Department of the Spedali Civili Hospital of Brescia, the Intensive neonatal treatment department of the Brescia Poliambulanza Foundation, the Azienda Ospedaliera M. Mellini of Chiari hospital (purchase of an advanced mammography screening machine), the Casa dell'Immacolata di Don Emilio Roja Foundation (assistance to needy families in Udine), the Casa del Sole Association of Mantua (educational and rehabilitation activities for persons affected by encephalopathy and support for their families), the Opera Caritas San Martino Foundation (employment for young people in socially useful activities) and Udine University (research grants). Each year the bank supports and promotes numerous social, charitable and cultural initiatives to contribute to the social, ethical and cultural development of the community in which it operates, as well as to its economic growth. nd One of the main partnerships is definitely that with Pavia University for the 22 edition of the degree day, when the Bank awarded prizes to the nine best students of the university, one for each faculty and for a research study on the ancient university, which is giving rise to the publication of a trilogy of prestigious books. In order to enhance its image as the Group’s main bank in the city of Milan, in the cultural sphere, this bank is an institutional supporter of the Poldi Pezzoli Museum – an institution famous throughout the world and a point of cultural reference in the Lombard metropolis – and it is listed on the “Golden Roll of Honour” of the supporters of the Piccolo Teatro of Milan, with which it th manages and organises the Eleonora Duse Theatrical Prize, which is now in its 27 edition this year. Again in the field of culture, one of the bank’s most important initiatives was the sponsorship of the exhibition Renoir La vie en peinture, held in Pavia at the Scuderie del Castello Visconteo with 63,000 visitors: an absolute record for the city. In the sports field the bank renewed its sponsorships of the Pallacanestro Milan Olimpia EA7 basket ball team (as a “Gold Sponsor”) and of the Pavia Calcio football team. Proceeds from the issue of UBI Community Social Bonds were used for an important donation to the L’Abilità Association Onlus of Milan (family strategies for infant disabilities), while a donation for 49 Social Report 2012 Economic performance the renovation of the “Carpi Zona Centro” unified school, damaged by the earthquake, was made at the beginning of 2013. The strategic objective of Banca Regionale Europea’s communication, in which the sponsorship of cultural and sports activities plays a primary role, is to confirm its positioning in the local areas in which it operates and its closeness to families and small and medium-size enterprises. In addition to supporting local events, yet again in 2012 this bank linked its name to partners of excellence and high profile events and initiatives both with the usual sponsorship activities and through donations, which until 2011 had been the responsibility of the banking foundations in the provinces of Cuneo and Tortona, local areas where the bank has its historical roots. In the cultural sphere, the bank confirmed its partnership with the Turin Museums Foundation and in particular for the Museum of Oriental Art and it also gave its support to the Regio Theatre of Turin for the 2012-2013 opera season and to the Circolo dei lettori (Readers Club), an important point of reference for the City of Turin and beyond, with which it organises interesting initiatives on economic and financial subjects and also to educate young people on savings and investment, assisted by support from the Italian Banking Association’s PattiChiari Consortium. The bank renewed its role in the sports field as the main sponsor for the Bre Banca Lannutti Cuneo volleyball team, in the serie A1 national championship and in European games, enhancing its image above all among young people for which volleyball advocates values of team spirit, commitment and non-violence. The bank has sponsored the Cuneo Country Club, an important tennis association, for many years and this continued as did co-operation with the Pallone Elastico Cup of Italy (type of handball), organised by the Lega della Società di Pallapugno, (sport that is very popular in southern Piedmont, where the bank has its historical roots). In the football field the bank supported AC Cuneo Calcio 1905 in its youth leagues and for the occasion of the summer camp for FC Juventus youth teams at Chiusa Pesio. Action taken to support the activities of the Federazione Nationale Sport Invernali Paralimpici (FISIP – Paralympic National Federation of Winter Sport) was of important social significance. nd Banco di San Giorgio operated in Liguria until 22 October 2012 when it was merged into Banca Regionale Europea. It continues to use the same brand name on its local market. This bank again renewed its partnership with important local organisations. In the cultural field it sponsored the La Spezia municipality’s Exodus Award and it supported haematological research at the San Martino Hospital of Genoa by making two important scholarship grants. It also entered into various sponsorships in the sports sphere, with particular attention to youth, including the Don Bosco Group (Crociera Stadium, Paladonbosco, Seisport), the CUS of Genoa rugby team and U.C. Sampdoria. Sponsorship of the Ravano ERG Tournament for primary school children was particularly important with the involvement of the Il Porto dei Piccoli Association Onlus, which works to assist children in hospital and was responsible for co-ordinating the cultural and social activities for the tournament and in schools in Genoa. The bank maintained its strong spirit of solidarity and social and cultural commitment to the local communities in which it operates and in 2011 the bank undertook a wide range of different initiatives, especially in the cultural field which included co-operation with the following: the Pergolesi Spontini Foundation of Jesi for the youth theatre prose season, the Teatro delle Muse di Ancona Foundation for various initiatives including the opera season, the Musicultura Association of Macerata for the musical and literary events which began at Recanati in 1990, the Amici della Musica Guido Michelli Assoication of Ancona for concert activities and the Municipality of Fermo for the Festival of traditional Marches products. 50 Social Report 2012 Economic performance In the field of sport and recreation the Bank supported the activities of the Ankon Consortium of the City of Ancona for sport, the Aurora Basketball Team of Jesi, the Fulgor Libertas basketball team of Forlì, the Circolo del Remo e della Vela of Naples for the Three Gulfs Regatta and the Jesi Fencing Club, particularly admired in 2012 for its individual and team Olympic victories under the leadership of Stefano Cerioni from Jesi. With regard to the Olympics, the bank also sponsored the book “Le Marche a 5 Cerchi”, to remember the names, enterprises and stories of athletes, coaches, managers, referees, doctors and journalists from the Marches who took part in the summer and winter Olympic and Paralympic Games from Athens in 1896 to Vancouver in 2010. The bank financed a special research study on “Giacomo Leopardi. Il Pensatore Pericoloso” for the magazine Nostro Lunedì (“Our Monday”), a periodical of articles, pictures and opinions created and edited by the Ancona poet Francesco Scarabicchi. On the other hand, through the Camerino University it sponsored the award for the Umbria Marches Innovation Start Cup, a competition between business ideas set out in a business plan, generated in the university research environment of Umbria and Marches universities and it shared the Campus World project with the Marches Polytechnic, created to support and diffuse technological and educational innovation among university students by means of internships abroad. One of the most important solidarity projects was the Progetto Luce (“Light Project”), a charity fundraising evening to finance a hospital in the Congo to help children recover their sight. With regard to attention and support for social initiatives for the communities in the local areas in which it operates, the bank renewed its commitments yet again in 2012 in a number of different areas. In the field of music, the bank continued its partnerships with the following: the Barese Music Chamber by providing tickets for the more disadvantaged groups in society and for students, the Regional Orchestra of the Schools of Calabria (60 young musician age 12 and over, selected by the Regional Schools Department of Calabria) and the Magna Grecia Orchestra Association of Taranto which valorises the best performers of classical and contemporary musice with a programme of concerts in Apulia and Basilicata. Musical Christmas best wishes were organised in the bank’s branches with young people from the La Bottega dell’Armonia youth orchestra. In order to promote the bank locally, exhibitions were organised in some of the bank’s branches designed to enhance Apulia’s ethnic and anthropological panorama with a series of events dedicated to famous local popular traditions entitled “Suoni, aromi e colori nelle tradizioni popolari Pugliesi” (sounds, aromas and colours in popular Apulia traditions). Community and culture is also the subject of an exhibition of Banca Carime’s paintings, brought to the attention of st the general public at the Petruzzelli Theatre of Bari for the occasion of the 31 National Legal Congress and of co-operation with the Zetema Foundation of Matera, already commenced back in 2008, to support the Museo della Scultura Contemporanea di Matera (MUSMA – Contemporary Sculpture Museum), located in the heart of Sassi, in the prestigious Palazzo Pomarici. The bank’s commitment to young people is continuing with the following: three scholarships in memory of Nicola Calipari for graduates in law and political science from the universities of Basilicata, Calabria, Campania and Apulia for post graduate studies, the initiative NewspaperGame in co-operation with the national daily, the Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno (course for primary and secondary schools in Apulia and Basilicata designed to stimulate young people to think and write on economic subjects) and the project to bring out talent in schools with “Your idea of a business” (a competition between business ideas set forth in a business plan) in co-operation with the Cosenza Confindustria (confederation of industry). Social initiatives include support for the Sant’Egidio Community of Bari for the “canteen for the poor” and the Cielo Azzurro Association of Catanzaro for needy families. 51 Social Report 2012 Economic performance The bank continued its activities again in 2012 to support associations and volunteers in the local communities in which it operates by accepting many requests for small donations in order to help the largest number of organisations given the limited resources available to it. The most significant assistance went to the following: National Alpine Association groups particularly committed to solidarity activities, sports groups committed to the diffusion of sport and to the integration of the disabled in society, educational and youth institutions for young people, parishes involved in the restoration of the local artistic heritage and church properties, such as the Eremo dei SS Pietro e Paolo of Bienno (a religious retreat), and events of importance to the local natural and historical heritage, such as the “Santa Crus 2012” sacred representation. On the th 140 anniversary of its foundation, the bank published the book “Banca di Valle Camonica – 140 years of history”. The bank acted on the invitation of the Comunità Bresciana Foundation and made a donation to help the people of Emilia Romagna, gravely hit by the 2012 earthquake, while proceeds from the issue of UBI Community Social Bonds were donated to the following: the Valle Camonica Sebino Health Authority to buy a magnetic resonance imaging scanner, the ANFFAS Onlus for an occupational rehabilitation project for disabled persons and the Agricola Società Cooperativa Sociale Onlus for the employment of 13 disadvantaged persons in cultivation, catering and environmental education workshop activities for schools. FONDAZIONE BANCA POPOLARE DI BERGAMO ONLUS The Foundation was formed in Bergamo in 1991 by the former Banca Popolare di Bergamo Credito Varesino to promote historical and artistic heritage, health and welfare, charitable activities and the conservation of the environment and nature in the Lombard area. The main commitment, which the Foundation continued again in 2011 with a second large donation, is to the Committee for the Beato Giovanni XXIII Hospital of Bergamo, to build a church, which forms part of the broader context of a project to build the New Bergamo Hospital. The Church will offer a spiritual welcome and hospitality to all those persons who come into contact or must live with the daily and often difficult reality of a hospital and who place their hope and expectations in their faith. Other important activities included donations to the Diocese of the Bishop of Bergamo for a project to restore the Benedictine Abbey of San Paolo d’Argon, which dates back to 1092, to the Adriano Bernareggi Foundation, to Bergamo Scienza and to the Pro Universitate Bergomensi Association. FONDAZIONE CAB ISTITUTO DI CULTURA GIOVANNI FOLONARI The Foundation was founded in Brescia in 1983 to “promote, encourage research into, enhance the value of, analyse and divulge actions and aspects that concern culture, education, instruction, social welfare and scientific research” (Art. 2 of the Constitution). Work continued in 2012 to restore the Santa Maria della Carità (Buon Pastore) Church of Brescia, an important example of Lombard Baroque architecture and a portrait of Cesare Abba by Antonio Salvetti (1854-1931) was purchased from a private collector together with a polyptych “Maddonna with Child” ” by the master Paroto, dated 1447, purchased at auction from Sotheby’s of London. This painting, originally from the San Siro church in Val Camonica, was transferred several times over the years to various capitals (New York, Paris, London) and has now been returned to form part of Italy’s artistic heritage. It will be on view with a calendar of exhibitions and side events. Although to a reduced extent, support continued for initiatives with associations that work in various areas with which the foundation has been linked for some years: the FAI (fund for the italian environment), the Amici dei musei Association (friends of museums association), Artisti Bresciani Association, the Ugo da Como Foundation and the Mus-e Brescia Onlus. The annual concert linked to the Brescia – Bergamo Pianoforte Festival was organised successfully with the award of the Benedetti Michelangeli prize and, in addition to a donation to the national convention of the National economic historians association, organised by the Catholic University of Brescia, important support was also given for the publication of the Brescia Green Touring Guide, needed for some time. 52 Social Report 2012 Economic performance FONDAZIONE BANCA SAN PAOLO DI BRESCIA Founded in 1998 by the bank of the same name, its objective is to perpetuate its original ideals and catholic inspiration. It operates principally in Lombardy and preferably in the province of Brescia, to support social, civic and church initiatives with special attention given to education, welfare and art and it also works with other similar organisations. In 2012 the Foundation made donations to the activities of the following: the Arte e Spiritualità Association and the Opera per l’Educazione Cristiana of Brescia for the Paolo VI Institute, the Diocesan Caritas of Brescia for the people’s canteen “Madre Eugenia Menni”, the Brescia associations Prison and Community,, Casa Emmaus Onlus and VOL.CA – Volontariato Carcere to support prison inmates, former prison inmates and their families, the Cesare Airici Institute and the Santa Maria della Pace primary and lower secondary school, the Brescia publishing houses, Editrice Morcelliana and Edizioni Studium, the Civiltà Bresciana Foundation and the Brescia section of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart of Milan. The Foundation also supports various church related organisations, refunding interest paid on loans granted by the Banco di Brescia on the basis of special agreements entered into for restoration and conservation of artistic heritage and of properties belonging to the parishes and dioceses of Brescia. FONDAZIONE UNIONE DI BANCHE ITALIANE PER VARESE ONLUS Founded in 2001, it pursues exclusive aims of social solidarity in the Region of Lombardy and in the Province of Varese in particular. It supports charitable initiatives and initiatives to conserve, promote and enhance, artistic and historical heritage and it also intervenes to support initiatives in the health, welfare and cultural fields and in the sphere of university education. In 2012 it made donations for the following: restoration of the Parish Church of Masciago, the murals of the Parish Church of Sant’Apollinare of Crosio della Valle, the organ in the Parish Church of San Giovanni Bosco of Busto Arsizio and the restoration of the Company of the Jesuits Aloisianum Library Archives. Other donations were made to: the Italian National Leukaemia Association for the purchase of molecular biology equipment, the Addolorata Institute of Lovere for the “Porta Aperta” (open door) project of the Varese Caritas for the purchase of medicines for persons in financial difficulty, the La Finestra Co-operative to expand their premises for the disabled with no family and the Circolo Hospital of Varese for the “Dama” project.

FONDAZIONE BANCA POPOLARE DI VIGEVANO Founded in 1991 by the bank of the same name which was merged into Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, it has continued over the years to support local initiatives of a humanitarian, social, cultural and charitable nature. After the conservation and restoration of the façades of the Carmine Church and the San Bernardo Churche at Vigevano and after making a donation to build the Museo dell’Imprenditoria (museum of entrepreneurship), recent intervention has included support for the following: the Lomellina for Cernobyl Committee, which provides hospitality to children from that city in the Ukraine, the Società Storica Vigevanese for a university research scholarship on the local economy, the Madre Amabile Foundation, which assists minors removed from their families by the courts and the Parish of San Dionigi to complete the restoration of the church decor. EC9 The financial and economic crisis still in progress has underlined the critical importance of the SIGNIFICANT banking system for sustainable growth, especially in the current context of the globalisation of INDIRECT ECONOMIC financial services and the interdependence of local economies. IMPACTS Given its nature and its distribution network in the community, the UBI Banca Group can generate important indirect impacts on the economy above all at local level: • the competitiveness of the economy, as a result of support to medium-sized enterprises to 53 Social Report 2012 Economic performance promote growth and technological innovation and to manage the crisis; • the development of depressed economic areas, through geographical choices for the location and allocation of economic resources; • the development of new business opportunities and the reduction of environmental costs through support given to investments in households and businesses and through the use of renewable energy and attention paid to environmental factors in lending, purchasing and investing processes; • the reduction of risks and the maximisation of the social benefits of development through attention to issues such as financial inclusion, a civil economy, financial education, occupational health and safety, non-discrimination and equal opportunities. On a national scale, UBI Banca can help reduce the social costs of economic inequalities, breaches of the law and threats to peace and security to the extent to which: • it contributes to the stability and efficiency of the financial system through proper risk management, respect for market supervisory authorities and proper commercial practices in dealings with customers and relations with competitors; • it complies with the law and co-operates with institutions in the performance of all those activities where risks may arise (e.g. money-laundering and terrorism, competition and market abuse, privacy, protection of consumers). UBI Banca takes responsibility with regard to these aspects for formulating and implementing policies and operational and commercial practices and it seeks to be accountable for them through its financial and non-financial reporting (Consolidated Financial Statements and Social Report, even if it is difficult to indentify metrics and operating tools to measure impacts). 54 Social Report 2012 Economic performance EN. Environmental performance In compliance with the principles of the Global Compact, UBI Banca pursues a preventative and proactive approach to environmental issues, as part of its social responsibility with regard to society and the local communities in which it operates. To achieve this, in 2008 it set an Environmental Policy designed to progressively reduce direct environmental impacts in terms of consumption (principally energy, paper and toner), greenhouse gas emissions (principally CO2) and the production and disposal of waste and the implementation of initiatives to promote virtuous conduct along the value chain, with reference primarily to customers. Raw materials EN1 The main raw material used is paper. The Group is continuing with its commitment to using paper MATERIALS USED with a low environmental impact, because it originates from responsibly managed forests and because of the manufacturing processes, and to optimising its consumption through remote monitoring of printers and paperless document processing (digitalisation of new operating areas and electronic signatures). More specifically, the spread of the service entitled Le mie contabili (my accounts) is of great importance as part of the project to develop the “multi-channel banking” project. This service allows all users of the internet banking service to receive most of the documentation which the bank normally sends by ordinary mail in electronic format free of charge. In 2012 this service was extended to include documents relating to safe deposit boxes and in 2013, as part of the evolution of the online sales platform, the introduction of Remote Electronic Signatures is planned to avoid the need to print contract documents. At the end of 2012, paperless correspondence was employed for 837 thousand accounts (+51% compared to 2011) and 598 thousand customers who had signed up for it (+48% compared to the previous year). 1 RAW MATERIAL CO N SUMPTIO N 1 2012 2011 2010 Paper (Kg) 2,324,453 2,000,705 2,048,705 of which: current paper for printing 1,554,766 communication and prints to customers 257,586 forms 129,081 brochures 201,398 corporate reports 9,473 envelopes 113,149 other publications 59,000 of which certified: FSC 73% 71% 85% ECF 100% 98% 100% Ecolabel 76% 85% 85% per employee (Kg) 130.2 112.0 117.7 Toner (Kg) 39,038 n.d. n.d. per employee (Kg) 2.2 n.d. n.d. 1 The data are estimated on the basis of actual spending.

EN5 A substantial contribution to reducing consumption and emissions is made by the properties and ENERGY SAVED DUE eco-compatibility of buildings. The Group has adopted a design system for the refurbishment and TO CONSERVATION construction of offices and branches, which involves an energy section which intervenes in three AND EFFICIENCY areas: IMPROVEMENTS • electricity and lighting, with a high energy efficiency that guarantees constant levels of lighting and reductions in consumption partly through the possibility of the partial use of individual lamps; • machinery and plant, with high efficiency energy equipment such as refrigeration units and heat pumps fitted with inverters, high-performance condensing boilers with low harmful gas emissions; • architecture and structure, with greater use of insulation and film on windows to control sunlight. This reflects up to 70% of the incoming heat, maintains interior temperatures of buildings lower and reduces the need for air conditioning. In 2012 windows were replaced in 17 branches with profiles and glass compliant with the new architectural and structural criteria and 40 new remote control operated heating and air conditioning systems were installed. Remote control equipment, now present on 280 systems, is conditioning used to monitor via intranet the correct environmental temperature settings required and the on and off times, both in winter and summer. A pilot study was conducted from a power and lighting viewpoint to assess the feasibility of introducing LED lighting in branches. As concerns consumption by computer equipment, approximately 3,000 latest generation PCs were purchased as part of the renewal of the PC fleet. These guarantee lower power consumption. Work station monitors all have the following energy efficiency certifications: TCO display 5.0, TCO 03 and Star while all notebooks, desktop PCs and printers have Energy Star certification. Energy Star, The new server farm, which comprises approximately 1,600 servers, uses power management technologies to reduce power consumption. This means that the power delivered by the power supply is no longer constant, but varies as a function of the processing load required by the 57 Social Report 2012 Environmental performance applications that are run. Energy diagnosis activity was commenced for the other server farms at the Brescia and Bergamo farms and when this is finished (first quarter of 2013) appropriate action will be taken to optimise consumption. EN6 In consideration of the activity carried out, the indicator is held to be significant, not so much with INITIATIVES TO regard to products and services that are energy efficient in themselves or that are based on PROVIDE ENERGY renewable energy as with regard to the supply of products and services designed to support EFFICIENT OR investments for energy savings and the use of renewable energy, as reported in the section on RENEWABLE ENERGY products and investments for environmental purposes.

EN18 With account taken of the economic crisis in progress and of the consequent necessity to reduce INITIATIVES TO costs, the Group pays particular attention to reducing waste in the use of all forms of energy, giving REDUCE GREENHOUSE priority to action which does not require investments. GAS EMISSIONS AND THE REDUCTIONS The 2012 Energy Programme led to the implementation of a series of actions taken to improve ACHIEVED energy consumption at zero cost: • a map of inefficiencies in the use of resources (space, energy, water) in branches and their elimination in the most economical way possible, rationalising the use of space and increasing the efficiency of lighting and heating and air conditioning; • extension to UBI Banca and UBI Sistemi e Servizi of the centralised system for switching PCs off at night, introduced in the network banks in 2010 and 2011; • power factor correction for electric circuits to improve the performance of the circuits, thereby also reducing penalty payments for reactive energy; • compilation of the technical specifications for contracts to install luminous signs in branches and the start of a study for a branch lit with LED technology in compliance with photobiological safety standards; • the use of air conditioning equipment which uses low environmental impact refrigerant gas and condensing boilers with low harmful gas emissions in the construction of new branches and refurbishment work. The Group has a number of large business centres consisting of the headquarters of the Parent, the Network Banks and the Product Companies on which problems of sustainable mobility and initiatives to solve them are concentrated. These matters are supervised by the Group Mobility Manager in the Human Resources Area. In order to encourage more sustainable to-and-from work mobility, for some years now protected parking areas have been provided for bicycles in some of the main headquarters of the Group and a coach shuttle service runs between Bergamo, Varese, Brescia and Milan (and actually within the city for the latter). In 2012, the service was used on average by 370 employees per day, thereby preventing emissions of well over 1,000 tons of CO2 1 compared to the use of car travel .

With regard to the R22 gas, the maintenance firms which repair gas leaks have been asked to furnish reports on maintenance intervention carried out, giving the quantity of gas used to top up the system to the correct level for the functioning of the equipment. The quantity of the gas introduced into the systems repaired in 2012 was 427.6 kg.

The duration of part-time contracts is for a maximum of four years and two-year extensions may be requested. These are granted on the basis of the places available and if they are compatible with service requirements and those of the employee. Female workers on part-time contracts who take leave from work for pregnancy, maternity and postnatal convalescence, may normally request a further part-time contract of four years.

Candidates are acquired mainly through the “Work” section of the corporate website of the Group and selection is conducted by means of aptitude and behavioural tests, group assessment and individual interviews, with account taken of age, educational achievement, type of education and experience in relation to professional requirements for different roles in the Group. Over 31,000 CVs were received during the year and approximately 655 candidates were involved in the selection process, with a particular focus on both newly qualified graduates and middle management candidates with experience in various specialist fields. The Group took part in 10 events in 2012 (career days and company presentations) organised above all by schools and universities, in order to let young people know the type of qualifications and experience in which the Group is interested, to acquire candidates and to carry out preliminary and counselling interviews. During the year 91 persons were appointed on internships in co-operation with these institutions, of which 59 were university undergraduates and graduates and 32 school leavers.

BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING There are eight trade union organisations in the Group to which 81.5% of employees belong. All AGREEMENTS trade union organisations operate freely without restrictions and the Group makes adequate operational means available to them to conduct trade union activities. In 2012 trade union representatives took 30,256 days of trade union leave (+0.7% compared to 2011). Relations with trade union organisations are based on the search for agreement, as far as possible, on solutions to the issues which are discussed from time to time, through transparent, concrete and continuous dialogue even beyond the minimum required by institutional procedures. Work on trade union relations was intense in 2012 with 130 trade union meetings held for a total of 520 hours, 67 Social Report 2012 Labour Practices and decent work both to carry out negotiations in relation to the 2011-2013/15 Business Plan and to sign other agreements at a Group and single company level [ LA5]. During the year trade union organisations carried out strikes for a total of 2,672 hours of absence from work, all at national level for reasons relating to the economic and political affairs of the country. No strikes occurred connected with grievances regarding the Group or the banking sector. LA5 Important organisational changes were implemented in full compliance with the procedures set out MINIMUM NOTICE NOTICE in the Banking National Labour Contract which sets a minimum period of 45 days for negotiations PERIODS REGARDING with trade union organisations. Great attention was paid with the reorganisation measures, which OPERATIONAL met important requirements to improve and rationalise the organisation, to minimise repercussions CHANGES for workers with regard to retraining. geographical mobility and reconciliation of work with family time. The change of role and retraining processes were managed with priority given to enhancing human and professional resources, pursued also by proposing training programmes, while intragroup mobility is managed, insofar as it is possible, as an opportunity for the occupational growth and enhancement of individuals, by assigning employees with new duties consistent with their qualifications, experience, potential and aptitudes. Organisational changes were made in 2012, including action planned under the 2011-2013/15 Business Plan, with trade union negotiations which led to agreements being signed at Group and single company level. They included: • two memorandums of understanding with trade unions for the merger of B@nca 24-7 into UBI Banca and one for the merger of Banco di San Giorgio into Banca Regionale Europea, which involved limited geographical mobility measures, including some of a transitory nature and appropriate personnel retraining programmes for the staff concerned; • a trade union agreement concerning the merger of Società Italiana Leasing e Finanziamenti Spa (SILF) into UBI Banca, an operation which did not cause employment and geographical mobility problems for the workers involved; • a trade union agreement relating to the transfer of IW Bank operations to UBI Sistemi e Servizi, which did not cause employment problems at IW Bank and impacts on the occupational mobility of the workers involved and it had limited effects in terms of occupational mobility; • negotiations concerning operations planned under the 2011-2013/15 Business Plan regarding on the one hand, a new series of actions to streamline the branch network of the Group and on the other hand to revise the distribution model at Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, with the introduction of a “Head Branch” and “Group Branch” model already in operation in other Group banks, with limited geographical mobility measures; • negotiations concerning the allocation of the training and professional and managerial development activities of Group companies to the new consortium company UBI Academy. This operation had no repercussions on the personnel concerned, on secondment at the new company, neither in terms of geographical mobility nor legal and professional status; • a report made by law to trade unions on the sale by UBI Banca of a controlling shareholding in UBI Insurance Broker to Marine & Aviation, an operation which had no impacts at all on the working conditions of the UBI Banca staff involved. th Furthermore, negotiations were commenced on 28 August and concluded with a framework th agreement on 29 November, during which trade unions were informed of the main lines of action designed to seek greater efficiency and productivity as part of the plan to change Group organisation and to cut costs. These included action on the following: branches; the organisational structure of the private and corporate banking commercial network; procedures for interaction between the Parent and the network banks; integrated multi-channel banking; the evolution of the organisational structure of the Parent and UBI Sistemi e Servizi; and also further reorganisation of some product companies. The framework agreement contained provisions for the period 2013-2015, which included a voluntary early retirement plan and the possibility of applying for the suspension and/or reduction of working hours through access to the “ordinary cheque” of the Solidarity Fund for Banking 68 Social Report 2012 Labour Practices and decent work Personnel. Employees applying for benefits from the fund receive a cheque amounting to 60% of the gross remuneration for the days/hours not worked up to a monthly maximum limit. The proposal to apply for a reduction in working hours is made to permanent employees in the professional areas and middle management categories, while that for suspension regards all permanent employees (including senior management). That same agreement also provides for a widening of the programme to convert temporary contracts to permanent contracts and 283 new appointments, designed to support generation turnover based on a criterion of proportionality between voluntary termination of employment contracts and new appointments.  Reports and Accounts 2012 pages 31-33 Occupational health and safety Occupational health and safety matters are regulated in great detail by Legislative Decree No. 81/08, the provisions of which are applied in all Group companies. A function was created at the Parent, on the staff of the Chief Operating Officer, which has the duty of overseeing implementation of legislation on the matter throughout the Group and to officially fill the role of the Prevention and Protection Service for those Group companies for which a specific service provision contract is in place. The function is constantly supported by a leading consulting company. L A6 In accordance with article 35 of Legislative Decree No. 81/2008, annual meetings are held in all WORKFORCE companies, attended by company representatives (the employer and its representatives), the REPRESENTED IN manager and the staff of the Prevention and Protection Service, the Corporate Physician and FORMAL JOINT workers safety representatives, where appointed. MANAGEMENTAdditional meetings are held, sometimes separately, between the Prevention and Protection WORKERS HEALTH Service and each of the parties mentioned above, to study specific issues in detail. These include: AND SAFETY COMMITTEES COMMITTEES developments in the risk assessment process and verification of the state of progress of risk mitigation projects; regulatory reviews and updates made necessary by changes in the legislative framework; operational problems which may emerge in individual environments; special projects launched in the Group. The Manager of the Prevention and Protection Service is also periodically convened by the 231 (administrative liability) Supervisory Bodies and/or by the Boards of Statutory Auditors. A total of 73 meetings were held in 2012. LA7 Again in 2011 the banking sector confirmed what had been recorded in previous years with regard INJURY, DISEASES to low levels of hazard for the risk of injury in work environments and processes. AND ABSENTEEISM In the INAIl (national insurance institute for accidents at the workplace) statistics it was positioned in the lowest class in terms of absolute severity, the frequency and seriousness of accidents, with the majority of total injuries occurring while travelling. The Group is perfectly in line with the sector and pursues special policies designed to reduce road accident risks at the source, by encouraging the use of public transport for work activities and by making collective transport facilities available, where restructuring processes result in significant travelling requirements for personnel. For potential sources of accident risk normally present at the workplace (such as those connected with the ordinary and extraordinary maintenance of properties and the relative wiring and services, in addition to continuous work to educate personnel performed by staff at UBI Sistemi e Servizi, which manages relations directly with the suppliers who perform the work, in cases of accidents attributable to failings or omissions by maintenance firms), the failings observed have been officially reported, and the firms reminded of the safety obligations agreed to in contracts. 69 Social Report 2012 Labour Practices and decent work 2012 2011 2010 ACCIDEN TS N O RTH N O RTH SO UTH AN D TO TAL MEN W O MEN CEN TR AL TO TAL TO TAL W EST EAST ISL AN DS At work No. of events 51 26 25 28 1 2 20 57 46 Injury rate1 0.001 0.001 0.002 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.004 0.002 0.001 2 GRI Injury rate 0.39 0.30 0.56 0.31 0.23 0.15 0.93 0.43 0.37 2 Seriousness index 0.05 0.04 0.06 0.03 0.00 0.01 0.14 0.05 0.04 4 GRI Seriousness index 11.98 10.23 15.34 8.00 0.68 2.04 37.12 13.19 10.23 Co mm u tin g No. of events 175 101 74 119 6 17 33 176 182 Injury rate1 0.005 0.004 0.006 0.005 0.005 0.005 0.006 0.005 0.005 2 GRI Injury rate 1.35 1.18 1.67 1.31 1.36 1.28 1.53 1.31 1.45 2 Seriousness index 0.15 0.15 0.16 0.15 0.16 0.17 0.16 0.18 0.16 4 GRI seriousness index 40.53 39.35 42.79 39.11 42.26 46.00 42.78 47.07 41.33 TO TAL N O .

THE HEALTH AND Focus groups were organised to investigate subjective perceptions of work-related stress with SAFETY OF Workers’ Safety Representatives led by a psychologist and a project was commenced with WORKFORCE MEMBERS AND THEIR support from a consulting firm to carry out a voluntary and anonymous survey; FAMILIES • modifications to the corporate system for the Management of Safety at the Workplace to comply with national UNI INAIl (national insurance institute for accidents at the workplace) guidelines, to obtain an organisational model which gives greater protection against crime risks in terms of prevention (Legislative Decree No. 231/01) and also significant savings on the annual accident insurance premium, resulting from the lower tariffs which INAIL charges companies that can demonstrate that they have adopted virtuous practices on prevention and protection from occupational risks at the workplace, having taken additional action with respect to minimum regulatory requirements; • the identification of more appropriate solutions to reduce risks of theft and robberies at source, partly through more effective technical deterrent measures, and also to guarantee the best forms of assistance and qualified psychological support for personnel involved in these events and for personnel subjected to physical and verbal violence by clients or others. Despite the substantial reduction in the number of robberies in absolute terms, both in the Group and in the sector nationally, most of the robberies carried out involve the prolonged presence of the criminals in branches, with employees held hostage, thankfully never violently. These methods make psychological assistance necessary for the personnel involved [ PR1].

The training programme provided for personnel exposed to the risk of robbery was particularly appreciated by participants. It consists of an entire day of classroom training given by specialist psychologists assisted by staff from the Prevention and Protection Service, supplemented by a preparatory e-learning course before the classroom training which, by simulating different types of robbery, provides personnel with a useful means of learning the correct behaviour to employ on those occasions. In order to educate all personnel on the subject of the risk of work-related stress, a remote course providing information has been provided on the corporate training web platform, specifically prepared for the banking sector, by a leading member of the academic world in co-operation with the Italian Banking Association training department. In order to increase personnel awareness of the importance of behaviour consistent with respect for their own health and those of others – also in implementation of the principles and contents of the Code of Ethics – a section exists on the Group intranet portal UBILife dedicated to health and safety. The following can be easily found on it: references to laws and Group regulations; news on safety organisation in the Group (e.g. emergency plans and exit routes to follow in different premises illustrated by actual photographs); material used in classroom training initiatives; and also useful advice and information on correct life-styles to remain in good physical and mental condition. A series of meetings and workshops were organised in 2012 at the Bergamo and Brescia offices of UBI Banca in relation to the risks of smoking – in co-operation with the Umberto Veronesi Foundation – entitled “No Smoking Be Happy”. They were attended by communities in schools (pupils and teachers) and families as well as employees. Participants numbered over 1,600, Prevention All operational units are subject to programmed inspections and on.site visits on the basis of reports received from workers’ safety representatives, trade union organisations and personnel from the operational units themselves or on the request of departments in the Group. All new units and also those subject to restructuring are inspected within 90 days of becoming operational. The inspections may generate a series of “recommendations” to the functions normally responsible for the removal of the risk (Safety Officer, Real Estate, Security), which are entered into the IT system for managing the state of progress of the action taken to solve the problems. Health monitoring performed by corporate physicians is designed to guarantee the same level of 1 service and protection for health for all personnel and it involves periodic visits and visits on request by personnel themselves. The doctors promptly report any problems which may be found during visits in order to identify the best solutions to improve or solve them.

TOPICS COVERED IN FORMAL AGREEMENTS WITH AGREEMENTS TRADE UNIONS Training and education All training activities are managed by UBI Academy, the Group consortium company [ 2.3 and 2.9] created in 2012 for the purpose of planning and providing life-long learning and professional and managerial development services for the personnel of Group companies. In order to assist in the achievement of these goals, UBI Academy has entered into partnerships with national and local institutional knowledge centres (universities and business schools), consistent with the Group’s social responsibility policies. The measurement of requirements and the formulation of training programmes is performed on a periodic basis using a variety of complementary tools: annual meetings with the Human Resources Departments of Group banks and companies, focus groups on specific career families, indications from the Group 2011-2013/15 Business Plan and Commercial Plan and training needs detected from the annual skills survey, in which all Group employees are involved. Appropriately structured and integrated with other systems for the development of human resources and accompanied by intense internal communication, training proposals are designed to be effective tools for improving and enhancing human assets consisting of technical and professional know-how, managerial experiences and skills and the ethical and cultural conduct of each worker and for developing corporate identity and culture through the dissemination of Group values and strategies. The instructors involved in training activity consist of both colleagues from Group banks and companies and also outside professionals. The in-house instructor corps consists of over 400 staff, who taught on courses to produce a total of almost 30 thousand training days (approximately 54% of total classroom training) in 2012. Training and refresher courses for the instructor corps are organised in training and qualification programmes on the best techniques for teaching, classroom management and diffusion of virtuous conduct. Instructors are responsible not only for imparting knowledge but also for facilitating the sharing of experiences, positive examples and distinguished conduct in order to diffuse a common language, values and corporate culture and a sense of belonging to the Group. A satisfaction assessment questionnaire is completed for all activities, whether classroom or remote and a learning questionnaire must be compiled for technical and occupational courses, which assesses acquisition of the contents and successful completion of the course. Group companies contribute to Joint Inter-professional Funds for the FONDIR Continuous Professional Development (fund for senior management training) and to the F.B.A. (fund for the training of the employees working in the credit and insurance sectors Fondo Banche Assicurazioni). Applications for training programmes for a total of approximately 204,500 hours of training, with over 32,000 participants, were submitted in compliance with the contents and the 73 Social Report 2012 Labour Practices and decent work specifications of the notices and they were subsequently approved by the F.B.A. and FONDIR funds. All the training programmes submitted were agreed with the trade union organisations of the individual banks and companies involved except for the FONDIR notices for which the trade unions signed agreements at national level. Training activities are supplemented by intense internal communication designed to convey the Group’s values and strategies and its main projects. The goal is to help improve corporate efficiency by sharing knowledge and by creating involvement and participation and to guide processes of change with initiatives to promote and reinforce Group identity. The corporate intranet portal UBILife is the main tool for internal communication and became fully established in 2012 as a space that was constantly used by employees with 100,000 page views per week. The multi-media electronic magazine E-Book Assemblea was published on the corporate intranet during the year to inform employees of the main issues addressed at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting held in April 2012, while a series of videos – UBIClick – was posted to support everyday working activities and to furnish information on the life and strategies of the Group, on important projects such as corporate reorganisation [ LA5], on the incentive redundancy plans and on the suspension/reduction of working hours [ LA5]. The Group in-house organ YOUBIMagazine, which replaces the previous hardcopy version, can also be read on the intranet. Each article published can be commented on by readers. A convention was organised in 2012 entitled The opportunities of a crisis, which brought together approximately 1,400 staff from all Group companies, while the first edition was published of Almanacco Almanacco YOUBI, YOUBI with news of the main events involving the Group in 2011 and at the beginning of 2012 and the quarterly periodical Noi docenti UBI for employees who act as in-house instructors was also published.

More specifically, a remote online training course was put in place to diffuse a culture of quality and customer satisfaction. The course was taken by 70% of the employees to which it was proposed, numbering over 11,000 staff; • reinforcement of financial expertise in the branch network by focusing on the analysis of financial markets and asset allocation. Activities to reinforce basic professional skills (operational, commercial, credit and finance) accounted overall for 51% of training. Insurance topics continued to represent a significant proportion of the training programmes (29%), with programmes differentiated by market and by customer segment. They were designed to qualify personnel to sell insurance products and to update them, in compliance with ISVAP (Insurance Authority) regulation No. 5/2006. Other updates on regulations and legislation (20% of the total) regarded aspects with a significant impact on banking operations such as transparency, health and safety at the workplace and anti moneylaundering already mentioned. In this period of substantial discontinuities and change in competition scenarios, it is of strategic importance for the Group to provide management the chance to participate in opportunities to update their professional skills and reflect on management topics. In 2012 the managerial training programme was focused on addressing organisational and management complexity, with reference above all to employee management and motivation to foster a greater sense of team spirit. Staff were invited to participate in a programme of discussions on economics, political and social issues held in meetings with leading managers, businessmen, academics and university luminaries. 2012 1 PAR TICIPANTS TR AIN ING B Y SUBJECT AR EA HO URS SEN IO R MIDDL E PR O F ESSIO NAL MANAGER S MAN AGER S AREAS Insurance 214,748 13 3,322 3,765 Regulatory 147,464 267 6,707 9,360 Finance and MiFID 40,103 48 1,186 1,729 Behavioural/Managerial 93,255 286 4,938 6,919 Credit 55,080 34 2,464 2,413 Operational/IT/languages 77,010 75 1,988 3,737 Commercial 115,125 97 3,858 4,267 Social responsibility and Code of Ethics 3,159 18 827 1,435 TO TAL 7 4 5 ,9 4 3 339 7 ,0 6 2 9 ,9 2 2 1 Total participants is not the sum of the participants in each subject area, because a given employee may have attended more than one course in different subject areas. 75 Social Report 2012 Labour Practices and decent work 2012 2 1 PAR TICIPANTS DETAIL S O F REGUL ATO R Y TR AIN ING HO URS SEN IO R MIDDL E PR O F ESSIO NAL MANAGER S MAN AGER S AREAS Administrative liability of entities (Legislative 1,719 5 167 310 Decree No. 231/2001) Transparency and usury 378 1 58 56 PattiChiari (banking services charter) 3,167 5 1,999 3,866 Safety (Legislative Decree No. 81/2008 – 58,934 222 6,234 8,503 formerly Legislative Decree No. 626/94) Privacy 12,624 63 2,362 3,646 Anti Money-Laundering 48,039 195 4,918 7,541 Other regulatory subjects 22,602 151 2,424 2,255 TO TAL 1 4 7 ,4 6 4 267 6 ,7 0 7 9 ,3 6 0 1 Does not include regulatory training on the MiFID Directive, which is included in the subject area “Finance and MiFID”. 2 Total participants is not the sum of the participants in each subject area, because a given employee may have attended more than one course in different subject areas. For “young talent” in the Group, a two-year “Level II University Masters” programme in Management of banking companies” was launched, developed in partnership with the Milan Polytechnic School of Business on which 45 young employees were enrolled. All Group personnel have free access to remote training programmes in computer science and English, Spanish, French and German. LA11 The main tool used to support the management and professional development of personnel and to PROGRAMS FOR plan training activities is the Skill Assessment process periodically proposed (usually on an annual SKILL MANAGEMENT basis) to all employees of the companies in which it has been introduced (for a total of 18,685 AND LIFELONG employees accounting for 97.9% of total Group employees), with the sole exception members of the LEARNING General Management team. The process consists of three main stages: assessment and self assessment of skills, delivery of the results and individual interviews by managers of workers. All managers are required to assess the skills of their workers, while self assessment is not compulsory, but useful to workers to acquire knowledge of their strengths and areas for improvement and to be able to participate actively in their career counselling. As part of this process, managers inform workers of the results of the assessment, propose appropriate skill development action and supervise it and monitor professional advancement throughout the year. Workers may express an opinion on a special form of their degree of agreement with the result of the assessment made by managers and in discussions with them, they make suggestions and come to an agreement on the skill development action proposed.

Affected by the significant changes in the Group’s organisational structure of [ LA5], in 2012 managerial assessments were valuable tools used to guide initiatives concerning managers 76 Social Report 2012 Labour Practices and decent work with a view to matching the personnel selected to business strategies as closely as possible. LA12 In almost all the Group companies (for a total of 18,991 employees accounting for 98.2% of total PERCENTAGE OF Group employees), all employees, with the sole exception of members of General Management, are EMPLOYEES involved in a performance assessment process, or in other words in an assessment of the RECEIVING REGULAR contribution made to achieving company results.

The performance assessment process takes place in three stages each year – planning the expected performance, intermediate verifications and final assessment – and it involves various parties who are in continuous contact with each other: the manager-assessor (who communicates team objectives, assigns individual performance objectives to each worker, supervises them throughout the process and assesses the results achieved); the second level supervisor (who supervises the assessment process and verifies the consistency of the results at the level of the organisational unit); and the workers (who take an active part in all stages of the assessment, furnishing suggestions for the success of the process. Workers express their degree of agreement with the assessment received and they verify the achievement of their objectives in person, themselves). All managers are required to carry out performance assessments of their workers. Result objectives and the knowledge requested (which forms part of the skill objectives) in the assessment of managers vary as a function of the position occupied, while the capabilities required are the same for all. The latter concern risk taking and decision making, the formulation of plans and strategies, human resource management, the management of uncertainties and difficulties and agreement negotiation skills. Performance assessment, together with all other human resource management tools, represents an important and indispensible pool of information which supports personnel management units to plan the career development of all workers. It is connected with skill assessment in particular, because the performance objectives that are set for workers are divided into result objectives (usually operating and project objectives) and skill objectives (capabilities and role knowledge assessed during skill assessment processes). The results of the performance assessment, together with those of the Skill assessment and information from other tools such as position weighting (with the relative external benchmarks), the measurement of potential, managerial appraisal and career paths/growth tables defined contribute to the definition of career progressions on the basis of fairness, consistency, meritocracy and uniformity. 2012 CA REER PR O GRESSIO NS TO TAL W O MEN Within professional areas 1,061 45.4% From professional areas to middle management 161 41.6% Within middle management 238 20.6% From middle to senior management 14 7.1% TO TAL 1 ,4 7 4 4 0 .6 % Each worker is in fact assigned an organisational role, on the basis of which she/he is required to perform a series of activities which presume the possession of specific occupational skills and experience and the achievement of determined objectives.

Human rights UBI Banca is continuing with the commitment entered into in 2003 by the former BPU Banca, to support and promote, within its sphere of influence, the universal principles of the UN Global Compact on human rights and in particular, in accordance with the Group Code of Ethics, the right to personal integrity and dignity and the right to individual and collective health and safety. This commitment is implemented in different areas of the Group’s activity and in its relations with its various stakeholders both through activities performed by control functions and risk management and compliance functions in particular with regard to money-laundering and the fight against terrorism and through the quality of its business processes and in detail: • policies and procedures to manage personnel in compliance with Italian law and with the main international standards regarding it; • ethical standards in contracts with suppliers; • commercial and credit policies attentive to the needs of the socially vulnerable, with particular reference to the issue of financial inclusion and the prevention of over indebtedness and the risks connected with involvement in particular economic sectors and in the arms sector above all; • support for social organisations that work for the promotion and protection of individuals through action in the fields of health, welfare and humanitarian assistance.  LA, FS1, FS2, FS7, EC8 Investment and procurement practices HR1 The UBI Banca Group operates almost exclusively in Italy, where the laws ensure a high standard of INVESTMENT respect for and protection of human rights.

HUMAN RIGHTS RIGHTS OR THAT HAVE As concerns the arms sector, UBI Banca has pursued a special policy since 2007, which: UNDERGONE HUMAN • forbids any relationship with companies involved in the production, development, storage, RIGHTS SCREENING marketing and/or sale of nuclear, biological and chemical arms of mass destruction, missiles able to carry arms of mass destruction, controversial conventional arms such as cluster HR2 munitions, land mines, incendiary and laser arms, as defined by the principal international SUPPLIERS AND conventions on the subject; OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS THAT • puts an authorisation regime in place for financing and payment and receipt activities for HAVE UNDERGONE transactions involving international trade in arms and armaments systems whether they fall HUMAN RIGHTS within the provisions of Law No. 185/1990 (arms for military use) or are excluded from it (light SCREENING SCREENING arms except for sports and hunting arms and replicas of antique arms), on the basis of an independent assessment of the countries of origin or final destination of the goods and services involved in the transactions which takes account of international sanctions and other criteria connected principally with respect for human rights. These transactions regard a total of around ten corporate customers and are performed mainly with EU countries and NATO. The number and value of the authorisations granted by the Bank in 1 accordance with Law No. 185/1990 and the transactions performed are absolutely marginal compared to the volumes of business of the Group and they are publicly disclosed by country and type of counterparty and arm in the social responsibility section of the Group’s corporate website.  Policy for the management of transactions with counterparties operating in the arms and 1 In accordance with the provisions of Law No. 185/1990, all import and export transactions and transit of arms and weapons materials for military use must be authorised by the Foreign Ministry with applications submitted by the importing or exporting firm and the relative bank transactions must be authorised by the Ministry of the Treasury, following notification by the bank in question. 80 Social Report 2012 Human rights weapons materials sector As concerns the supply chain, since 99.1% of the Group’s suppliers are located in Italy where legislation governing human rights and labour is very stringent, all the Group’s suppliers are required to fully comply with legislation on workers’ rights and also with ethical principles consistent with those contained in the Code of Ethics when orders are granted or contracts are signed.  EC6 HR3 In consideration of the activity carried out and its geographical location, no specific training EMPLOYEE TRAINING activities are carried out on the subject of human rights, but it is dealt with in training activities IN HUMAN RIGHTS performed to implement the Code of Ethics.  FS4 Non discrimination HR4 The Code of Ethics expressly provides for respect for the principle of equality and nonnonINCIDENTS OF discrimination [ Code of Ethics p. 11] and therefore conduct is not admissible which might cause DISCRIMINATION AND harm to the integrity and dignity of persons, nor is discrimination based on preferences or arbitrary ACTIONS TAKEN exclusion (i.e. not linked to the importance of the contribution that a relationship with a party may offer or the interest that the party may represent for the achievement of the Group’s mission). As in previous years, no reports of discrimination were received in 2012 for cases of discrimination against personnel or other stakeholders [ 4.8]. Because the principle of non-discrimination is considered particularly important in employment relations, UBI Banca has adopted specific guidelines for disciplinary procedures which: • set out official investigation, decision-making and judgement processes which subsidiaries must follow for the more serious cases of contestations and disciplinary provisions for reprimands; • provide unequivocal recommendations to the body which must decide sanctions in relation to the type of provision and the position of the employee subject to sanction; • defines information which companies must report periodically to the Parent for full visibility of disciplinary procedures taken by the Group. All the Group companies inform the Parent of the start of disciplinary procedures and the Parent monitors all procedures providing advice where requested and also assistance in drafting the contestation, examining the justifications and proposing the relative sanctions to the companies. Companies in turn are also required to inform the Parent of all litigation the nature of which could be of importance for the entire Group and the Parent provides advice whenever requested by companies, with support given in investigating the case, attendance at meetings with outside advisors to formulate strategies and represent companies at hearings before judges. A total of 95 disciplinary measures were adopted in 2012 (37 less than in the previous year) due mainly to operational irregularities and negligence of various kinds (72), to irregularities in the disbursement and management of loans (12), to undue appropriation/diversion of funds administered (9) and irregularities in the management of investments (2).

ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES SO10 PREVENTION AND MITIGATION OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES Corruption UBI Banca provides full co-operation with the authorities in anti money-laundering and anti terrorism activities by making adequate resources and tools available for the prompt performance of the operations requested in observance with the legislation and regulations in force. Oversight of these issues is performed centrally in the Group and is carried out by a special organisational unit, the Anti Money-Laundering Area, in the Risk Control Macro Area of UBI Banca. It is based on the following: • an effective and efficient IT system, which uses various software applications (e.g. Gianos Gpr, Gianos Inattesi) to monitor all transactions (according to the amount limits set by the relative legislation); • clear and easy to follow internal regulations, aligned with legislative regulations; • precise regulations for the conservation of documents acquired to identify customers, to consult their financial profiles and to perform accounting and all other operations in full compliance with civil law regulations and anti money-laundering legislation. In order to ensure effective oversight, information (lists) is acquired – from reliable and independent sources – on persons politically exposed or on terrorists and special IT procedures have been developed or acquired from major software houses which supports adequate controls of customers and complete and accurate recording of transactions and accounts and reporting of suspect transactions. All transactions – with the amount limits set by the relative legislation – are subject to monitoring by IT software applications to identify activities suspected of being connected with moneylaundering or other illegal activities. The software applications consider exceptions in order to detect movements on accounts which might give rise to suspicion and which subsequently are assessed by line and/or control functions. In 2012 new software applications were created and organisational controls were improved to promptly detect transactions and customer relationships that present a potential risk or which do not conform to the relative regulations and the full and detailed training programme to improve the culture and awareness of personnel was continued. As already programmed the training commitment will continue in 2013 with the same intensity and a budget has been allocated to further improve the systems. 85 Social Report 2012 Society  2.5, LA10, FS7 SO2 By signing the Global Compact, the Group has committed itself to fighting all types of corruption BUSINESS UNITS within the sphere of its responsibilities. ANALYSED FOR CORRUPTION RISKS This crime is also disciplined in Italy by Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 on the administrative liability of businesses in implementation of which UBI Banca has adopted a model of organisation, management and control (Model 231/2001), which provides for rules and procedures designed to prevent the crimes covered by the decree from being committed, for the creation of a Supervisory Body to ensure the proper functioning and for constant updating of the Model and reporting and penalty systems. The Supervisory Body reports to Corporate Bodies on the adoption and effective implementation of the model, on the oversight of its functioning and on the supervision of updates. All activities and organisational units are subject to monitoring connected with implementation of the Model. UBI Banca, as the Parent, informs subsidiaries of the policies it has set in relation to the prevention of crimes pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 and recommends general criteria which subsidiaries may follow. More specifically, each subsidiary adopts its own Organisational, Management and Control Model with the same characteristics of those reported above, which is periodically updated with support from the Parent. In compliance with the policies set and with the relative regulations, the Internal Audit Function audited the proper functioning of risks and changes in them and it assessed the functioning of the overall internal control system. In this respect it carried out on site and remote inspections of the organisational units of the Parent and its subsidiaries into compliance by staff of external and corporate regulations including the Code of Ethics, to which the 231/2001 Model makes reference, and the related Code of Conduct for group personnel. SO3 All employees are trained in anti-corruption policies and procedures as part of their training to EMPLOYEES TRAINED implement the project to revise the anti money-laundering model. In 2012, 48,039 hours of specific ON ANTItraining was carried out both in the classroom and through the e-learning platform, with the CORRUPTION involvement of 16,037 employees. Anti corruption policies and procedures were then addressed as POLICIES AND part of training on the principles derived from Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, delivered to 466 PROCEDURES employees for a total of approximately 1,718 hours. The training procedures differed according to  LA10 the level of responsibility. SO4 No cases of corruption by Group personnel occurred either in 2012 or in prior years. ACTIONS TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO INCIDENTS OF CORRUPTION Public policies SO5 The Group contributes to the development of public policies through its active and constructive PUBLIC POLICY participation in the initiatives of trade associations (e.g. Italian Banking Association, National DEVELOPMENT AND Association of “Popular Banks”, Italian Private Banking Association, Associazione fra le Società LOBBYING ACTIVITY italiane per Azioni – association of joint stock companies – Italian Association of Financial Analysts, etc.) and other associations active in specific areas (Italian Compliance Association, Italian Anti Money-Laundering Association), which express the position of the sector on issues of interest, both on the request of the authorities (e.g. the Bank of Italy) and political decision-makers (e.g. Parliamentary Commissions) and by taking own initiatives. 86 Social Report 2012 Society SO6 In compliance with the Code of Ethics, no payments – neither direct nor indirect and in any form – CONTRIBUTIONS TO are made within the Group to political parties, movements, committees and other political POLITICAL PARTIES, organisations, their representatives and candidates, congresses or festivals having political POLITICIANS AND propaganda purposes.

WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Reports and Accounts 2012 page 196 Furthermore, like other large companies, the UBI Group is subject to tax inspections by the competent regional departments of the tax authorities, following which, tax assessment reports and notices of assessment were issued. The total amount contested, inclusive of extra taxes, fines and interest, was €319.5 million. In 2012, €264 thousand of fines and interest were paid in relation to acceptance of tax assessment reports relating to two companies (Banca Carime and Silf).  Reports and Accounts 2012 pages 200-204 87 Social Report 2012 Society PR. Product responsibility The main elements of product responsibility are identified in the commitment to adopt policies, processes and commercial and marketing practices that ensure the following: • respect for the interests of customers; • support for economic activities which create value for the community; • the development of products and services able to produce high social benefits for local communities.  Code of Ethics pages 22-23 More specifically, respect for the interests of customers is assessed from the viewpoint of the following: security (in terms of both business continuity and physical security in branches), labelling of products and services (in the sense of providing customers with transparent information), marketing communications (above all in terms of the proposals being appropriate to customer needs and profiles and the appropriateness of the commercial contact), respect for privacy (from the viewpoint both of protecting IT systems from data loss or unauthorised access to data and respect for customer consent for processing personal data for commercial and marketing purposes) and, in general, compliance with legislation and regulations – including voluntary codes of conduct – which govern the sale and use of products and services. All these items are governed in Italy by specific laws which the Group applies through its own internal regulations, which are communicated to all staff through the Group’s intranet and they are also the subject of specific updating courses. Implementation of these regulations occurs through a series of organisational and technical controls. The Chief Business Officer is responsible for organisational controls of operating activities and first level controls and the Chief Risk Officer (the Compliance Function in particular) and the Chief Audit Officer are responsible for second level controls. The technical controls consist of dedicated support platforms for commercial activities (e.g. identification of customers to which determined products and services should be offered on basis of an analysis of their personal life cycle and behavioural profile and therefore of their possible unsatisfied financial needs) and of locks and protection tools on IT systems. FS15 The Group has a specific process in place for the development of new products and services and for POLICIES FOR THE the modification of those already marketed by the network banks (including UBI Banca Private FAIR DESIGN AND Investment) and by the Parent, with the exception of products and services for which specific SALE OF FINANCIAL regulations apply or are currently being issued (e.g. subsidised loans). This process is designed to PRODUCTS AND help achieve objectives of quality, technological innovation, competitiveness and compliance SERVICES objectives. In terms of quality, the process is designed to ensure that products and services are consistent with the relative customer characteristics and needs and with reducing the time taken to respond to market demands (timetime to market) market and it requires the involvement of different organisational units some of which at the Parent must always be involved: Communication and Marketing, Legal Affairs and Litigation, Risk Management, Administration and Tax, Compliance. Corporate functions responsible for compliance matters are responsible for preventing any misalignments with internal regulations, the most important of which is Group’s Code of Ethics, and with external regulations. The characteristics (e.g. age, occupation, investment plans) and needs of the customers (e.g. financial, protection) are surveyed both through special consultation and interview procedures (e.g. focus groups with customers and potential customers and with commercial distribution network staff) or systematic procedures (e.g. the customer satisfaction survey project or complaints management [ PR5]) and through the analysis of competitor’s products and services. Active participation in observatories and working groups (e.g. through the Italian Banking Association) or research centre initiatives (e.g. at the MIP of the Milan Polytechnic) are also valuable sources of information, for example in relation to the possibilities offered by new 88 Social Report 2012 Product responsibility technologies. Technological innovation is pursued mainly at multi-channel bank level [ 2.5]: requests received from staff through the Group’s intranet and from customers through contact forms on Group websites, emails and call centres are analysed each month to assess their feasibility and to plan corrective action. Competitiveness is based on a pricing policy oriented towards transparency and fairness to customers and it involves analysis and constant monitoring of the relationships between the risk assumed (if present), the return, the costs incurred and the market context, with account taken of the need to provide financial support to local communities and businesses. A pricing excellence project has been ongoing since 2011. It is designed to achieve: (i) higher revenues and greater customer satisfaction at the same time through better management of pricing by commercial units at the Parent and network banks, (ii) savings on time and therefore shorter response times and also greater flexibility in the range of products and services through operational streamlining and (iii) lower operating risks and respect for regulatory and compliance issues, through improved operational instruments, monitoring process quality and greater automation and integration of information. FS16 The possession of proficient economic and financial expertise helps to create knowledgeable INITIATIVES TO citizens, to increase economic democracy and legality and to make local businesses and economies ENHANCE FINANCIAL and the Bank itself more competitive. UBI Banca is aware of this and in playing its role as a bank in LITERACY local communities, it has built relationships over the years and forms of co-operation with schools, training institutes and universities. Activities in schools The Group continued in 2012 with its commitment to teaching on economics and financial subjects in schools, by making specific professional resources available, in the form of tutors, as part of 1 financial training and educational programmes organised by the PattiChiari Consortium . The significant contribution made by the Group’s network banks, which again received explicit recognition from the Consortium, is designed to constitute both a concrete response to the growing demand for financial education from the world of schools and also a tool to develop an increasingly more open and positive relationship with the Group’s local markets. The Group’s commitment was concentrated on three educational programmes in the academic year 2011-2012: for primary school children, to stimulate initial thinking about the value of money and the need to manage it responsibly, for oneself and for the community, with a view to knowledgeable citizenship; to introduce secondary school pupils to economic and financial subjects and to stimulate them to reflect on the principal functions of finance, by illustrating their impact on people’s everyday lives; to study economics and financial subjects, by introducing upper secondary school children to the social, professional and economic reality that surrounds them. At the end of the course, taught in the classroom, the project involves a “Develop your business idea” 1 Confirmation of the importance of financial education activities at national level is seen in the co-operation agreements signed in 2012 by the PattiChiari Consortium with both the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research and the Ministry for Territorial Cohesion. 89 Social Report 2012 Product responsibility competition, with the preparation of a business plan for the start-up of a socially useful enterprise in the local community. During the year Group banks also organise or take part in other initiatives: events, seminar and projects. One of these is “Popotus” ”, supported by UBI Banca and organised for primary and lower secondary schools by the Avvenire newspaper to introduce children to reading newspapers. Every Thursday and Saturday during the first and third terms of the school year, Avvenire and Popotus are distributed to junior and lower secondary classes in two thousand schools, which also creates an opportunity for bank personnel to provide education on the management of money and household budgets. Another is the project “Legality is worth it” ” organised by the Department of Culture of the Region of Calabria, supported by Banca Carime, designed to introduce children at all levels and types of school to basic economic mechanisms so they can acquire the underlying principles of the responsible management of financial instruments. The far reaching vision of this both laudable and demanding initiative is to succeed in making young people understand that it is worth keeping to the rules because that is the only way that everyone can benefit in the long run. 2012 PATTICHIARI F INAN CIAL EDUCATIO N PRO GRAMMES B ANK HO UR O F PR O VIN CES CO N CERN ED SCHO O LS CL ASSES STUDEN TS TEACHER S TEACHIN G Bergamo, Varese, Monza e Brianza, L'Impronta Economica Kids (economics Lecco, Como, Roma, Cosenza, Crotone, 64 175 4,025 59 537 footprint Kids) Reggio Calabria, Vibo Valentia, Catanzaro, Cuneo Bergamo, Varese, Monza e Brianza, L'Impronta Economica Junior Lecco, Como, Roma, Cosenza, Crotone, 37 110 2,390 33 287.5 (economics footprint Junior) Reggio Calabria, Vibo Valentia, Catanzaro, Cuneo Bergamo, Varese, Cosenza, Crotone, L'Impronta Economica Teens (economic Reggio Calabria, Vibo Valentia, 35 117 2,175 22 264.5 footprint Teens) Catanzaro, Matera, Potenza, Cuneo TO TAL 136 402 8 ,5 9 0 114 1 ,0 8 9 Relations with universities and research centres The Group has a series of arrangements with universities (the state universities of Bergamo, Brescia, Pavia, Turin, Genoa and Bari, the Bocconi, the Catholic and the Bicocca universities of Milan, the Insubria University of Varese, the LIUC University of Castellanza, the Polytechnic University of the Marches and the University of Calabria). As part of these relationships, the Group also provides unsecured loans and “Enjoy” cards to students [ FS7] and it participates in career counselling days and offers internship programmes [ LA2]. Again in 2012, co-operation with Italian universities included support for the Ancona University Campus World programme, by accepting ten students on internships of approximately three months each in its representative offices abroad to acquire experience in international financial centres. Organisation of events Each year the Parent and the network banks organise training and educational events on topical economic subjects, which are important opportunities in terms of image for the Group where it involves people and acts at the service of customers and society in general. The most important is the annual series of meetings for the presentation of the “Report on the global economy and Italy” ” published by the Einaudi Centre. The XVII report, entitled “Sull’Asse di Equilibrio” (“On axis of balance”), was presented in ten towns and cities with over 1,200 participants, mostly businessmen and representatives of local economies. As part of support for the internationalisation of Italian small to medium-sized enterprises, the Group not only participated in conventions and conferences through its representatives who spoke at them but again in 2012 it organised and/or sponsored various events as follows: • the UBI International Open Day, with workshops on different subjects, round tables and one-toone meetings attended by over 800 professionals, businessmen and staff; • training meetings on “Business networks as a means to support the growth and 90 Social Report 2012 Product responsibility internationalisation SMEs”, SMEs” in co-operation with Associazione Italiana Politiche Industriali (AIP – Italian industrial policy association), with over 230 participants consisting of staff and businesses in the Milan and Pavia areas; • the China Trader Award, in partnership with Cathay Pacific, an important and prestigious award for Italian companies that have excelled in the development of business relations with Hong Kong and China; • the conferences, India Trade & Export Finance Conference and The situation on world financial markets and trade relations with Italy and the conventions Internationalisation strategies for the Far East: focus on China, South Korea and Singapore, India Day and International Meeting – Focus on foreign markets. Again as part of its support for business internationalisation, UBI Banca co-operated, through its representative offices, on the organisation of a business mission in Russia, reserved to the food and agriculture sector (participants: nine Italian businessmen and 15 Russia companies) and it took part in a joint multi-sector, Government-Regions-Chambers of Commerce mission in Brazil (aerospace, food and agriculture, automobile, contract, construction, energy, social housing, wood-furnishing, logistics, machinery, nautical, fashion), which involved discussions with experts, visits to manufacturing centres and B2B meetings with selected local counterparts (600 participants). Customers health and safety PR1 Safety and security is overseen at the conception, distribution and marketing stages of products and LIFECYCLE STAGES IN services supplied on the market. WHICH HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPACTS OF A number of controls are in operation to ensure the safety and security of multi-channel banking PRODUCTS ARE services [ 2.5] as follows: the use of cards with code numbers to confirm payment transactions; ASSESSED FOR the certification of the beneficiaries of credit transfer, reloading and post office account IMPROVEMENT AND transactions; SMS and email advice of transactions performed using payment cards. Furthermore, in SIGNIFICANT order to prevent the most frequent and common types of IT fraud, customers are constantly PRODUCT AND informed of the most appropriate security procedures and measures for the use of internet banking SERVICE CATEGORIES services, which include the prompt update of information on online channels. SUBJECT TO SUCH PROCEDURES PROCEDURES Specific monitoring services were developed in 2012 for new interactive channels introduced by the Group and new initiatives were developed to guarantee secure internet banking and payment card services. These regarded verification of the security status of services and systems, transaction monitoring, surveys of the most recent types of IT attack (trojans, malware, phishing) and action to prevent possible fraud. As a result of the measures adopted, no cases of fraud were recorded involving QuiUBI internet banking services and the number of cases involving payment cards was considerably reduced. The main actions scheduled for 2013 include the introduction of remote digital signatures on the online sales platform. The security of IT systems involves the adoption of the most advanced standards for data transfer and access to information, constant monitoring both with proprietary tools and in co-operation with the police and prompt reporting in cases of suspected attempts at computer fraud. Operational continuity is guaranteed by a special plan, which involves both a series of technical and organisational measures designed to ensure that the most critical processes will be operational even in emergency situations and also a series of periodic disaster recovery controls and tests. Physical safety concerns safety in branches from the viewpoint of accident prevention and risk of robbery. Activities continued in 2012 to upgrade equipment in accordance with Legislative Decree No. 81/08 (emergency exits and medical emergency alarm systems) and to improve processes to control and manage robbery risk in compliance with the standards defined in the relative Group policy. This involved testing and if necessary upgrading security measures in branches and administrative headquarters and monitoring the work of staff responsible for alarms. 91 Social Report 2012 Product responsibility 2012 2011 2010 F REQUEN CY EMP LO Y EES EMP LO Y EES EMP LO Y EES F REQUEN CY F REQUEN CY 1 1 1 EVEN TS IN DEX EVEN TS IN DEX EVEN TS IN DEX RO B B ERIES AN D THEF TS IN V O L VED IN V O L VED IN V O L VED Thefts (inclusive of ATMs) 15 0.7 21 1.1 19 1.0 Robberies committed 39 2.1 218 38 2.0 216 88 4.67 264 TO TAL 54 2 .8 218 59 3 .1 216 107 5 .6 7 264 1 Number of events every 100 branches.  LA8 PR2 No cases of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary codes concerning the safety of INCIDENTS OF NONproducts and services were recorded.

Direct communication is a determining factor in the establishment of a clear and transparent relationship with customers. The main news about services provided is conveyed to customers by using all the available channels (e.g. websites, campaigns organised by Customer Services, special newsletters, detailed information sheets, SMSs, etc.) to ensure the prompt provision of full information. Information is provided in full observance of the privacy consent given by customers, who if they wish may at any time request either via email or directly to operators for commercial communications to cease. 92 Social Report 2012 Product responsibility PR4 No incidents of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary codes concerning information and INCIDENTS OF NONlabels on products and services were recorded. COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS AND VOLUNTARY CODES CONCERNING PRODUCT AND SERVICE INFORMATION PR5 The centrality of the customer is the first of the values declared in the Group Charter of Values and PRACTICES OF it refers to customer satisfaction as the guide to corporate decision-making, in order to build lasting CUSTOMER relations of trust. SATISFACTION, INCLUDING RESULTS Customers satisfaction is monitored constantly both in daily commercial relations and through OF SURVEYS fidelity indicators such as the duration of customer relationships and also through the results of MEASURING systematic customer satisfaction surveys (Consultation Project) and the analysis of complaints by the Parent’s Customer Care Service.

The weighted sum of four variables, which measure the degree of satisfaction (overall satisfaction and recommendability) and fidelity (probability of repurchases and advantage over the competition) generate an overall satisfaction index calculated monthly by bank, market, local department and branch, which also forms part of the criteria for setting incentives for Group staff. Approximately 130,000 interviews were conducted during the year with the customers of the network banks and with 12,000 customers of competitors’ banks to construct comparison data at local level.

On one aspect which affects customer satisfaction to a large extent – the quality of relationships in branches with habitual contacts – the Group obtained an average score of 8.5 out of 10 for helpfulness and politeness, execution time and the speed and accuracy with which transactions were performed. The main areas for improvement regarded requests for more proactive proposal making and better post-sales care. High satisfaction is expressed, in relation to those social and environmental responsibility issues considered most important by customers, with the following: information on privacy, an honest marketing approach, responsibility in granting loans (prevention of over indebtedness by households) and environmental commitment. However, less satisfaction was found with: information on complaints and dispute settlement; clarity and ease of understanding contracts; and, as a consequence of the crisis, commitment to access by vulnerable groups to financial services and support for households and businesses in difficulty. Complaints Complaints management also forms part of Group customer care processes. This takes place initially at the operational point where the complaint is made and where the contact staff are called upon to investigate in person. At this point a central unit (Risk Control Staff Unit) is involved, present in each network bank, which manages the more structural and administrative stages (entries in the complaints IT register, management of replies, decisions, approvals, etc.), required to process official complaints. The complaints unit of each network bank may decide from time to time which central or Parent units to involve to process single complaints, since no “complaints commission” exists within the organisational structure of the Group.
