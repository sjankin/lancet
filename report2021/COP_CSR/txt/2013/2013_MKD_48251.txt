In 1998, USJE was acquired by the TITAN Group. The company employs 319 direct employees and 224 indirect employees. The Company also cooperates with over 571 (78%) local suppliers and contractors. Our Group’s Governing Objective is to grow as a multi-regional, vertically integrated cement producer, combining an entrepreneurial spirit and operational excellence with respect for people, society and the environment. The achievement of this objective requires a framework of agreed-upon principles and Values that determine our everyday conduct and practice. This framework explicitly defines our responsibilities towards all those affected – directly or indirectly – by our business activities. Our actions reflect our commitments to all of our stakeholders. 1. To our Shareholders: We strive to ensure a sufficient return on their capital, to protect their investment, and to be transparent in all our dealings. 2. To our Customers: We do our utmost to provide quality products and services with competitive terms, tailored to our customers’ needs and supported by the necessary technological, environmental and commercial experience. 3. To our Employees: Our workforce is our most valued resource. Respect for their human rights, providing safe, open, non-discriminatory, diverse and good working conditions and an emphasis on employee development are essential in order for TITAN Group to attain its objectives. 4. To our Business Associates: We believe in mutually-beneficial relationships with our contractors and suppliers and we are committed to promoting responsible supply chain management practices. 5. To the Society: It is our belief that socially responsible businesses contribute to the prosperity and progress of society as a whole. Our commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainable Development is integral component of our Governing Objective. OUR CODE OF CONDUCT IS BASED ON OUR VALUES VALUE TO THE INTEGRITY KNOW-HOW CUSTOMER CORPORATE DELIVERING CONTINUOUS SOCIAL RESULTS IMPROVEMENT RESPONSIBILITY P A G E 3 Message from the Chief Executive Director It is an honor and pleasure to present another Annual Report on Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainable Development of Cementarnica USJE AD Skopje. The pleasure is even greater because the document emphasises the efforts of our Company for continuous development through transparent operation and commitment to partnering with all stakeholders. Our success is possible only if all stakeholders are satisfied and exactly that is our priority and our corporate culture. In our everyday operations, each of us in USJE is dedicated to deliver short-term and long-term company goals, work is as usual, activities are being implemented... The feeling of satisfaction when we look back at the year that has passed and when we see in one place the results of our collective effort and commitment is irreplaceable. Each year is a new challenge, new goals and priorities in order to improve our company, but also to promote and develop the community. These efforts to harmonize the needs of the community and our associates were recognized, acknowledged and awarded with the National Award for Best Socially Responsible Practices. For us, that is just an additional incentive to continue in the direction in which we move for years. Although amid specific economic and social conditions that resulted from the global economic crisis, Cementarnica USJE does not deviate from investments that contribute to long-term and sustainable development in business, but especially in environmental protection. In this regard, we are the first company in Macedonia to enter the process of treatment of atmospheric and surface waters, thus directly contributing to the protection of water as a natural resource. Since 2011, USJE is licensed with the A integrated environmental permit and we work consistently under the terms therein and during 2012 we put efforts to make another step towards the global trends in the cement industry in the direction of the A integrated environmental permit for the replacement of fossil fuels with alternative fuels. USJE puts people first when designing the company’s policy and implementing it. This holds true whether it comes to our employees, our partners, our neighbors or the wider community. Our company’s success is undoubtedly due to the human capital in USJE. Therefore, our priority is the safety and health of our employees and of our close associates. We continuously strive for zero accidents in the workplace by providing safe conditions and means for safe operation, as well as continuous training programs for our employees and contractors. On the other hand, we have expanded regular health checks for employees into other segments, thus directly affecting the healthcare prevention of our people. It is worth mentioning that the cooperation with the local government, as in the previous years, goes as planned, with particular emphasis on schools and infrastructure projects, according to the plans of the municipality. Finally, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to these achievements, with the sincere hope that this Annual Report on Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainable Development of Cementarnica USJE AD Skopje will answer all pertaining questions that are discussed in detail.

PA G E 1 9 Monitoring Emissions Monitoring emissions is a pre-condition for controlling and reducing environmental impacts from cement production. In 2004, USJE was the first company in the country to introduce independent continuous monitoring systems operating 24 hours. This enables the company to closely monitor the emissions on real time basis and take action accordingly. At the same time, it gives interested stakeholders regular, updated information on our performance. At our initiative results from the monitoring are presented at USJE’s web page.

PA G E 2 1 Air emissions Dust At cement plants, major dust emission sources are kiln stacks and open surfaces creating fugitive dust from the 60 MLV=50mg/Nm 3 transportation of materials. 50 In 2012 specific emissions of dust were 6 g/ton clinker for 40 Kiln 3 and 48 g/ton clinker for Kiln 4. This is equivalent to approximately 2.2 tons and 14.4 tons, respectively per year. 30 Dust emissions are many times below the limits (MLV) set 20 by the environmental terms and conditions of both local 10 and EU legal requirements.

PA G E 2 2 PA G E 2 3 Initiatives for improvement of energy efficiency Undoubtedly energy is essential for the industry, while the electric energy consumption per capita is indicator of a country’s development. The increasing awareness on environmental protection and the continuous increase of the price of electric energy contribute to the trend that energy saving is one of the top priorities of every company responsible towards the environment and the society. Cementarnica USJE has a strategy for reduction of the electric energy consumption. In this framework, we have a system for measuring electric energy according to which we know exactly how many kilowatt hours are consumed per ton of product in any part of the plant. There are international targets for consumption of electric energy in cement industry. We make efforts for approaching to these standards and accordingly take measures for improvement. Instead of controlling gas flow in the process by dampers, for instance, (huge energy quantities are wasted by dampening gas flow), the big fans in the plant are designed with a mechanism for regulation of the speed of the fan engine as most energy-efficient way of regulation of gas flow. Cementarnica USJE has applied this modification to the bigger fans, while such activities will continue in the forthcoming period when similar measures will be applied to the smaller fans as well. Fourth year in a row A “Earth Hour” Fourth year in a row, our Company has been a part of the global action “Earth Hour” that gained the support of hundreds of millions of people, companies and organizations in 5.200 cities from 135 countries throughout the world, becoming the largest environment protection event. USJE switched off its cement mills to join this global action. Company’s cement mills were shut down for one hour on 31st March this year, when the supporters and participants of this global action did the same. By switching off the cement mills, USJE saved 10MWh electrical energy, or approximately the amount of the consumption of over 3000 households in Skopje. At the same time the lights were switched off in those locations in the company where the safety measures for occupational safety and health allow that. PA G E 2 4 USJE took part in “Tree Day Plant Your Future” action for the 10th time Corporate volunteering and care for the environment are important priorities of USJE and one of the main pillars of our corporate social responsibility policy. Hence, on November 21st, 2012 the Company for the tenth time joined the “Tree Day Plant Your Future” action. Cementarnica USJE AD Skopje donated 200 trees with a height from 150 to 170 cm, of which 100 of type European ash and 100 of evergreen species Thuja Columnaris. About twenty of our employees along with the management team, through this volunteering action, planted the trees at a location in the Municipality of Kisela Voda. Our support of the action “Tree Day Plant Your Future” is part of our strategic initiative for environmental protection. Among other activities, we improve the horticultural arrangement in the educational institutions and public spaces in the Municipality of Kisela Voda. This way, we contribute to improving the health of the citizens of our neighbourhood and we encourage sustainable development of the Municipality.

Guided by this, Cementarnica USJE AD Skopje presented its CSR and Sustainability Report 2011 and organized Round Tables where the effects of actions taken for community development were discussed. The discussion on the CSR and Sustainability Report was attended by representatives of companies, institutions and members of the community that the company cooperates with. “Community Engagement and Development responsible business”, “Sustainable Production and the Environment” and “Social Responsibility Consumers and Buyers”, were the three thematic sections that hosted discussions among attendees. Each round table was attended by 15-20 participants of the relevant group of stakeholders including our Managers. The topics discussed on the three round tables were Synergy CSR projects with our suppliers and customers, Environment protection and sustainable production, and Collaborative CSR projects for community development of the CSR business leaders and other businesses at local and national level.

PA G E 3 1 Introduction into professions During the interaction with our partners in this Project, we became aware of their further needs. USJE aims to help the young people in finding out their interests, talents and dispositions through direct presentation of the professions to the students of the final grades in primary schools and to help them choose their future career. Hence, in framework of the Partnering with Schools Project, USJE organizes visits and tour around the company as well as direct acquaintance with the employees and the management. The students closely meet with their job position, working environment, behaviour, responsibilities, and everyday activities. During the project span, more than 150 students of eight grades from the primary schools from our Municipality had the opportunity to visit the Department of Finance and the Quality Department and directly to be introduced to their operations and processes. The students participating in this project improved their understanding of the occupations and job positions in real life and real company for easier identification of their potential future professions. Eco Class To introduce the young population in the importance of the protection and promotion of the environment, Cementarnica USJE AD Skopje started, in the framework of this Project, with environmental training in the primary schools of Kisela Voda Municipality. The activities were launched with an environmental class to the pupils of the 4th grade through presentation of positive examples and waste handling activities (separation and recycling) as well as energy and water savings that can be practiced by them. Our Environmental Manager and the Environmental Engineer with their individual efforts & technical know-how conveyed the messages in a simple way through a short presentation and the pupils accepted gladly the idea to draw on cement bags. The drawings and the other creative works designed during the class have been exhibited in the school thus conveying the environmental messages to their schoolmates. Cementarnica USJE AD Skopje presented all the pupils that took part in the environmental class with books about nature as а reminder about the fact that we are all responsible for the environment. Planting trees and other horticultural arrangements of the school yards Aiming at raising the awareness of the students and pupils about importance of environment protection as well as improving their environment, we continually donate and plant trees in the primary schools and kindergartens in the Municipality of Kisela Voda. The Company every spring and autumn organizes actions for planting trees in the schoolyards of the primary schools and kindergartens. So far, more than 600 trees have been planted in the yards of the schools and the kindergarten by our management and employees along with the children and the teachers of the schools. PA G E 3 2 C o r p o r at e volunteering USJE employees volunteered in the Initiative Macedonia Without Waste 2012 The World Cleanup 2012 Action takes place in over 100 countries throughout the world, from March to September. On a global scale, tons of inappropriately disposed waste will be collected. Macedonia is part of this story. In anticipation of Earth Day, spring action took place on April 21, 2012 in the municipalities of Kisela Voda, Dojran, Struga and Saraj, and on April 22 in Lipkovo. These pilot actions are the beginning of a campaign to clean up the waste “Macedonia Without Waste 2012” by which Macedonia joins the global initiative to clean the waste “Let’s Do It! World 2012”. Applying the concept of corporate volunteering and guided by our commitment for environmental care USJE employees gladly joined this initiative. During the weekend we rolled up our sleeves and got to work. More than 40 employees, including the management, volunteered on the territory of the Municipality of Kisela Voda in 3 locations: Rasadnik settlement; Prvomajska Street, and the surroundings of the factory. Waste from landfills was collected and selected in bags with different colors in order to facilitate its separation, transport and recycling. Our support to the action “Let’s Do It! Macedonia” is in line with our strategic initiative for environmental protection within the framework of corporate social responsibility. In the same time, with actions like this one, Cementarnica Usje with voluntary activities of its employees contributes to improving the health of the citizens in the neighbourhood.
