United Nations Global Compact Communication of progress March 2012 – April 2013 Introduction We first expressed support for the Global Compact in June 2004 and continue to fully support the 10 principles. ‘Doing the right thing, the Severn Trent way’, our Code of Conduct, reflects our commitment by setting out our business principles and the standards of behavior that we expect. The Global Compact principles covering labour relations, environment and anticorruption in addition to human rights reflect our integrated approach to corporate responsibility. In this communication, we describe each of the Global Compact principles, our specific commitments and links to relevant communications by Severn Trent, Severn Trent Water and Severn Trent Services which describe our policies and systems of management, our performance and details about specific initiatives.
