Creating and Sharing Economic Gains ROAD TO SUSTAINABLE COMPANY 1 2 Global sales HMC had yet another year of growth despite a global economic recession. In 2012, the number of vehicles produced at HMC’s domestic plant and sold worldwide was 1,911,259, which was a 1.35% increase from the previous year. Sales volume in the domestic market was 667,496 units which was a decrease of 2.2%, due to a variety of reasons including the slow economy and the relatively small number of new models being released. However, HMC’s market share increased by 0.9% in the domestic market, thanks to strong sales of the new Santa Fe, i30, i40 and i40 saloon. In 2012, the number of vehicles produced and sold from overseas plants was 2,499,098 units, which was a 14.9% increase from the previous year. Sales of overseas produced vehicles accounted for 56.6%. In the North American market, the number of vehicles sold increased by 8.9% to 703,000. The low interest 3 rate and increased demand for replacement vehicles were identified as the main contributing factors that led to the increase in sales. It is also noteworthy that HMC achieved an increase in sales while providing the lowest discount and other financial incentives. Sonata and Elantra were the top selling models with more than 231,000 and 202,000 sold respectively. Sales of high-end models such as Azera, Genesis and Equus also increased as they became increasingly recognized for their high quality and excellent overall value. Sales in the Chinese market increased by 11.8% thanks to the strong launch of the YF Sonata, the continued popularity of the Verna and strong sales of localized models in China. In 2012, Hyundai began operation of its third plant in China, which was completed 10 years after Hyundai’s first plant in China began operating. The increased production capacity in China is expected to support Hyundai’s continued growth in China. The European automotive market continued to suffer due to the economic recession in 2012, which led to a decrease in demand for new vehicles. However, HMC succeeded to increase its sales to more than 444,000 units which was an increase of 10.2%, thanks to strong sales of newly released models, namely the i40 and ix35. The global economy is expected to have a much slower recovery than was predicted before, as a result, the 1. Hyundai Manufacturing Brazil with an annual global automotive market is expected to experience a slow down for some years to come.

In 2010, overseas production capacity surpassed domestic production capacity. In 2012, 56.7% of Hyundai vehicles were produced at overseas plants. The recent increase in overseas production capacity was due to the successful launch of HMC’ third plant in China, increasing annual production capacity to 900,000 units and HMC’s new plant in Brazil.

The first track involves providing internship opportunities for Brazilian students at HMC during summer and winter vacations. The second involves financial contribution of 500,000 USD per year for three years between 2012 and 2014 to the Brazilian government, for eligible students scholarships.

SEONGGIL CHOI JOOHYUK KWAK SUNGWON CHOI CHANGJAE LEE SUKHUN CHOI GISEONG LEE Ten years have passed since we published our first sustainability report in 2003. Since then interest in corporate social responsibilKYUHYUK CHUNG HYUNAH LEE ity and the creation of non-financial values has steadily increased. Stakeholder’s demand for increased management transparency and TAE SEUNG HAN JAEHYUNG LEE DAEGUYN HAN YONGJOO LEE information disclosure has also continued to grow. HYEONGMAN HAN JUNGHWAN LEE Recognizing these changing demands, we decided to update our approach to the publication of this report by making it more stakeholdSANG WOOK HAN SANGJUN LEE er-friendly. Rather than a report full of data and jargon, we have aimed to make it more like a good book, that’s easy and interesting SANGMI HAN SEUNGHWAN LEE RAEWOOK HONG YONGHO LEE to read. In the preparation of this report staff established two principles: WON JI HUR HYEONDEOK LIM DUHUN HWANG HYUNWOO NAM SUN OK HWANG HYUNGSEUK OH First, we decided to introduce a new concept of ‘Creating Shared Value (CSV)’. CSV is not a completely new concept but it is more JONG WOOK HWANG DONGHYUN PARK business focused than corporate social responsibility which covers a much wider area with less focus on core business activities. MAN JOO HWANG HAYJUNG PARK Creating added value and strengthening business competitiveness are two of HMC’s fundamental business objectives. Therefore, this HYUNJAE JANG JIYOUNG PARK YONGSIC JANG DONGJUN PARK year’s report is created with a focus on HMC’s achievements and activities which are significant both from an internal management CHIYOUNG JEONG HYOIL PARK perspective and a wider social one. JONGSEOK JIN JAEHONG PARK JAEBAEK JUNG JAHYE PARK The second principle was to create a report which contains new management concepts of HMC. After reviewing the previous ten JONGHO JUNG JUHYUNG RYU published reports, which were all almost identical in terms of how they were organized it was decided to group the management GYOHOON JUNG EUNJIN SEOK JUHYON KIM JAEYOUNG SHIM activities into five key concept areas. KWANGYEON KIM JAEMIN SHIN As a result, this year’s report has both CSV and CSR sections. New to this year’s report, the CSV section contains information on HMC’ SEHOON KIM DONGWOO SHIN s activities and achievement in five key concept areas which are the creation of a new automotive culture, recycling cars, realization UNGGONG KIM JAIAN WANG AHN KANG KIM CHANGHO YOO of energy justice, fostering a global workforce and Happy Together (Win-win partnership). The CSR section has two main subsections: EUNJUNG KIM KYUSIK YOON ‘environmental performance management and the development of environmentally friendly vehicles’ and ‘improving the quality of life JONGWOOK KIM YOUNGIN YOON JUNGHO KIM SANGHO YOON for customers, employees, suppliers and local communities’. A new ‘TOPICS’ page was created for each subsection with highlights from KYUNGPYO KIM MIDOL YU HMC’s global operation. Overall, the changes were made to make the report more friendly for our stakeholders. NAMHOUNG KIM YOUNGSU YUN We have also endeavored to make the report more visually pleasing. ‘Star’ was this year’s main design theme and it was used on the cover and the pages between sections. The ‘star’ theme was inspired by HMC’s ‘Polaris’ eco-friendly vehicle project. The ‘Star’ symbolizes HMC’s future potential to be a world leader in automotive technology. HMC feels inspired to become a ‘star’. In ancient times, the ability to handle steel and create wheels was regarded as the epitome of technological prowess and a source of power. The image of ‘making wheels using steel’ represents Hyundai’s vision of realizing resource recycling and energy justice, as well as HMC’s dream of creating a better world through automotive technology. CONTACT INFORMATION Whilst preparing this year’s report with the new CSV sections, we realized that some of our CSV activities are rather short-term in Technical Management team, nature, making it hard to see any concrete business outcomes in the near future. We sincerely hope that this report will increase our Management Strategy Office Hyundai Motor Company stakeholders’ interest in the automotive industry and all related issues, and in turn help us to continue making progress in creating shared value. 12 Hunreung-ro (Yangjae-dong) Seocho-Gu, Seoul, Korea Tel : 82-2-3464-2150 June 2013 Fax : 82-2-3464-8796 Technical Management team, Hyundai Motor Company Email : HMCSR@hyundai.com This report was printed on environmental friendly paper using soybean-based ink.
