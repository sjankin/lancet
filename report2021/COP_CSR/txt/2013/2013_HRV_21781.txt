Social Responsibility Report Zagreb, 2013 Contents: 1. Introductory note by the President of the Management Board 2. Report by Global Compact 3. Report by GRI 3 • Company profile • Management, obligations, involvement • Access to management and performance indicators • Indirect economic effects • General indicators • Company • Product responsibility 2 Introductory note by the President of the Management Board Dalekovod d.d. was in 2012 in many ways involved in the creation of socially responsible atmosphere in the environment and society. With respect to the recession that has seized the entire economy and therefore our company as well, in 2012 we attempted to keep good cooperation with the local community, but also to offer our employees better education and extracurricular activities concerning sport, recreation and culture. Difficult economic situation in Croatia demanded from us to adjust our expectations in the business results that were in 2012 significantly more modest as opposed to the previous years. By having reduced investments, we were forced to turn to foreign markets even more, and more specifically to Norway, Albania, Sweden, Ukraine, Montenegro, Great Britain, countries of the Middle and Near East etc., while we managed to keep the cooperation with the majority of countries to which we export our products. This report unites the indicators for the most significant activities on the level of socially responsible operation in 2012. Thereby we wanted to be included in the group of companies that not only recognize the need of serious action within the area of social responsibility, but that also, by reporting according to internationally accepted principles, open the possibility to share responsibilities for the further development of Dalekovod with all its business partners, collaborators, institutions and other participants.

The Group companies often act within the consortium organized for an individual project, which additionally may result in reduction of establishing a direct contact of the Group company with customer and/or community. Therefore, besides customers, employees may be recognized as key participants (including labor unions in which they are associated), suppliers and public sector (acting double role of a person ordering a product and business conditions regulator). Key participants are identified through an analysis of business processes and circumstances and risks brought about by relationships with individual participants. There is a continuous communication conducted with key participants through meetings and while conducting business, their legitimate interests are to be appreciated. Within activities connected with social responsibility, a wide range of representatives of civil society and individuals are communicated with. During the year 2009, we shall attempt to organize and make the internal web page accessible as a means of communication and exchange of information among the employees. Communication with employees is conducted though e-mail svi@dalekovod.hr and through different notices and decisions by the Company. Web pages are recognized as an important method of communicating with partners in the local country and abroad, but also the public in general. In addition to the existing web sites www.dalekovod.com www.dalekovod.tim.com, the following website www.dalekovodpro.com was created for www.dalekovod-cincaonica.com, www.dalekovod.tks.com, www.dalekovod-projekt.com . This is the reason why this kind of communication is to be paid a great importance with an intention that information on the page should be timely, accurate and suitable to the media used. In compliance with market requirements and needs, the web site of Dalekovod d.d. and all above-mentioned companies within the Dalekovod Group is translated in the two languages (Croatian and English). A special, internal web intended for employees, containing several directories with documents enabling information sharing, has been created. The key topics arisen from the communication with participants include the future development of the company and safety of the employment, professional development of the employees, the manner and dynamics of the privatization of the parent company and dependent or affiliated companies and satisfaction of growing market, environmental and regulatory standards required for acting on (especially international) markets. 16 Approach to management and performance indicators Economic dimension Dalekovod d.d. is traditionally assigned a role of one of the key economic entities in the production sector in Croatia – not only owing to its size, but also its presence on the international markets, technological potential and multiplicative effects on other companies, participants and the entire society. Despite great changes in the surrounding and organization, during the period of transition, Dalekovod d.d. retained its stability in business operation and during the last few years it has strengthened its market position. Its future development is based on the investments into new technologies, development of new products and ever greater presence on international markets. Besides, it is necessary to permanently develop operating systems that will enable optimum resource management and timely recognition and an answer to risks and circumstances in the organization and surrounding. This is the way how preconditions for increase in revenues and profitability are created. The socially responsible operation is connected with donations and other types of investments in the community that also depend on the available resources. In the future, the system of processes relating to donation awards for the purpose of transparency and efficient connecting with business strategy, wherever possible, will be considered. 17 > Economic effect indicators Direct, generated and distributed economic value, including revenues, operational expenses, fees to employees, donations and other investments in the community, retained profit and disbursements to those who introduced capital and other payables to the state.

Dalekovod d.d. acts in power supply, road, railway, telecommunication industry, and the factors that affect the investments in such industries are not directly influenced by financial depression and depression on the real estate market. Just contrary, as a result of ever greater demand for energy and ever greater investment cycles in the region focused on the transport infrastructure, Dalekovod d.d. looks forward to long-term sustainable investment cycles in roads, railways and power supply infrastructure not only in the countries of the region, but even in the wider area. › Financial aid received by the government Table 10. in .000 HRK2009 2010 2011 2012 State subsidies 350 350 168 350 Dalekovod d.d. did not in 2007 receive any significant financial aid from the Government or central state authorities. Smaller subsidy amounts and support are related with support when exhibiting products at international fairs. Contracts entered into with public companies (or any other representatives of the public sector) referring to delivery of goods and/or providing services are in compliance with law, at public tenders and they are not aided by state subsidies. › Difference in ratio between typical beginners’ payroll in comparison with local minimum payroll in important operational places Table 11.

At the same time all applicable legal regulations in a specific country and on a specific market are to be complied with. Indirect economic effects Owing to professional and efficient carrying out of projects for clients from the public sector in Croatia and abroad, Dalekovod d.d. directly affects the quality of infrastructure and provision of public services.

Development of wind power plants contributes to the use of renewable energy sources which play a very important role for the community. › Environmental dimension The management of environmental impact is attached a special importance in the entire Dalekovod Group. Dalekovod d.d. has a defined environmental management policy which is publicly accessible at web page http://www.dalekovod.com/ (under ‘Social responsibility’) and all employees are made familiar with it. Dalekovod d.d. manages all environmental aspects, reducing thus negative influences of its activities, permanently improving achieved results in the area of environmental management, completely complying with Croatian laws and regulations and applying international standards. › Policy, practice and share of consumption on products and services of local suppliers in important business places Dalekovod d.d. collects all necessary inputs required for performing its activities on the local and international supply market. Regarding total supply, import participates with around 22%, which mainly relates to a supply of non-ferrous metals (iron metallurgy). Table 12.

The share of foreign suppliers is in compliance with the construction site requirements. 25 THE FOLLOWING IS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OPERATIONAL DIMENSION AIMS: ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECT INDICATORS One of the products based on renewable energy is wind power plant project. Energetic efficiency as a principle is to be applied wherever it is technologically and economically feasible. When initiatives undertaken by Dalekovod d.d. are concerned, we need to mention that Dalekovod Production d.o.o. (member of the Dalekovod Group) uses technologies selected as the one which will least impact the environment during the process of production, that is, galvanization. Dalekovod d.d. tracks the consumption of strategic raw materials (steel, aluminum alloys, bronze, brass) and their rational consumption is taken care of. In the event of generation of faulty products during the casting process, they are re-used in the production in ratio strictly prescribed by the procedure. Strategic materials (raw materials) are produced during the process that uses waste metal and are partially recycled at the same time. Consumption of electricity is more important owing to a great number of machines in production which are used. A growth in air-conditioners – devices that affect the consumption growth is great. Rationalization of the consumption is implemented in production by automatic monitoring and elimination of excess energy-using devices. In accordance with the Croatian energy strategy that defines the share of renewable energy sources of 20% by 2020, a wind farm construction plan has been established and elaboration of a preliminary design for procurement of a site development certificate is underway. The annual water consumption is monitored by sites. At the moment there are measures undertaken for the purpose of water consumption at the Žitnjak location through recording and reconstruction of worn out water pipelines. Water is used in production process to minimum quantities for Dalekovod d.d., so there is no need for its recycling and re-use. BIOLOGIC VARIETIES One of the main activities of Dalekovod d.d. is the construction of power supply transmission lines. The construction of utilities is carried out in natural environment. The construction is carried out following obtaining of all required permits and in compliance with all prescribed conditions that were met during the stage of project design. In this way, any negative impact on protected areas, even including biological varieties, is avoided. With its products, Dalekovod d.d. meets the highest safety standards for equipment, it delivers, exerting minimum environmental impact. To date, in that area there have been no objections and incidents recorded. PRODUCTS AND SERVICES Within the scope of researches and product development, we attempt to reduce environmental impact on products by using state-of-the-art technologies which are more efficient in terms of energy supply, require reduced consumption of resources, emit fewer waste substances and generally have less impact on the environment during its use. Products produced in Dalekovod d.d. do not negatively impact the environment. Packaging of delivered products is returned and re-used. 26 COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION REGULATIONS Monitoring legal regulations is systematically performed and no significant fines or nonmonetary sanction as a consequence of non-compliance with laws and environmental protection regulations have been recorded. ................. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECT INDICATORS ASPECT: MATERIAL EN 1/ EN 2 Due to the separation of a business unit production in the company Dalekovod Proizvodnja d.o.o., we have no grounds to monitor this category. ASPECT: ENERGY EN 3 /EN4 By systematical informing of employees about the efficient use of energy, employees’ awareness is impacted for the purpose of their personal involvement and engagement in saving when using electrical energy. Graphical display of consumption on the location Žitnjak: Graphical display of consumption: 27 EN 6 In accordance with the energy strategy that defines the share of renewable energy sources by 20% by 2020 and 9-10% of installed wind energy program design and construction of wind farms, which aims to increase the overall percentage of renewable energy sources, is underway. The projects are in various stages of development, as shown in the table.

Monitoring is used as an instrument for taking corrective measures in case of significant deviations from the planned weekly consumption. Undertaking measures through setting goals and programmes for decreasing water consumption has led to a significant decrease in water consumption, and by that to significant financial savings. Water is used minimally in the production process of Dalekovod d.d., so there is no need to recycle it, nor to reuse it. Absolute rationalisation in water consumption is evident from the charts below. ASPECT: BIODIVERSITY EN 11 /12/13 One of the main activities of Dalekovod d.d. is the construction of power supply transmission lines. The construction of utilities is carried out in natural environment by obtaining all required permits, and in compliance with all the prescribed conditions, which were already met during the project design stage. In this way, any negative impact on protected areas, including biodiversity, is avoided 29 ASPECT: EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER, WASTE EN16/17/18 EN 19 In Dalekovod d.d. there is no significant source of an ozone-damaging substance emission. EN 20 EN 21 Wastewater from the Marijana Čavića 4 location are released in the Zagreb public drainage system. Potentially oily precipitation is purified in the built-in oil-water separator before the release. Canteen water is purified in the new oil trap. Monitoring results at P1 control shaft for key pollutants (chemical oxygen consumption – KPK, biochemical oxygen consumption – BPK, iron and zinc) are shown in the graph below.

OVERALL QUANTITIES OF WASTE AT DALEKOVOD d.d. 32 EN 23 There have been no extraordinary pollutions. ASPECT: PRODUCTS AND SERVICES EN 26/27 Products of Dalekovod d.d. do not impact the environment negatively. Delivered products packaging is taken back and re-used. ASPECT: COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS EN 28 Monitoring legal regulations is performed systematically. The procedure is the following: Every day Narodne novine website (Official gazette) is checked (www.nn.hr) to see if a new number has been published. Its content is verified and legal regulation related to management systems extracted. Extracted document is then put on the Dalekovod internal server. All users are sent the information on new changes by e-mail. 33 Dalekovod created its own list of laws and bylaws related to environmental management, which are relevant for its activities. The list is upgraded by systematic monitoring. Regular inspection visits (water supply inspection, environmental protection inspection) have not resulted in any fines or sanctions. 34 WORK RELATIONS AND RESPECTABLE WORK INDICATORS ASPECT: HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK EMPLOYMENT AND DIGNIFIED WORK INDICATORS ASPECT: OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY LA6 Occupational Health and Safety Committee has been established in the last three years, with all the Business Units’ directors and workers’ representatives being included in the Committee’s work. Occupational Health and Safety Central Committee enforces the following activities: 1.
