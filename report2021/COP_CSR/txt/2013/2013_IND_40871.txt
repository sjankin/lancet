Conclusion Based on the 'work performed' in line with the 'scope of assurance', 'limitations and exclusions', nothing has come to our attention for us to not believe that Report meets the requirements of GRI principles for deﬁning report content and quality as follows:  Materiality: Mahindra has adopted a structured methodology for materiality assessment, followed by creation of measurable performance indicators for prioritized material issues. These issues have also been included as a part of annual KRAs (key result areas) for Mahindra's Senior Management.

Further, Mahindra has also provided an update on its activities related to six out of eight missions of India's National Action Plan on Climate Change.  Completeness: This year Mahindra First Choice Services Limited and Mahindra Research Valley have been included in the report scope and boundary.

We are taking a closer look at our key sustainability parameters and strategically addressing one issue at a time starting with 360o water management. THE ROADMAP In the second year of our sustainability journey a clear and structured roadmap was developed with modest targets for 3-5 years time frame. This helped all our businesses to create a common launch pad and make a meaningful start. Last year we reported that most of our commitments for ﬁve years were surpassed in 3 years. During the year under report and review (2012-13) we have maintained the momentum. This has given us the conﬁdence to scientiﬁcally set goals and to hace better understanding of issues material and critical to us as well as our stakeholders.

Its the practice of shaping and delivering to the expectations of the myriad stakeholders that a business possesses. The number of stakeholders and the complexity of their expectations increase manifold when it concerns a group like Mahindra. Thus, it is no surprise that at Mahindra, stakeholder engagement forms the cornerstone of all sustainability initiatives. Over the years we have developed a battery of efﬁcient and innovative, formal and informal stakeholder engagement mechanisms and like in previous years, this year too we continued to engage with our stakeholder segments via these mechanisms. ENGAGING WITH SUPPLIERS, PARTNERS AND DEALERS IS A PART OF OUR FOCUSSED APPROACH TO INSTITUTIONALISE GREEN SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT. Many of our businesses and divisions raised the benchmark in legacy mechanisms while some of them introduced new exciting mechanisms which were experiential and interactive in nature. Below is a glimpse of some new and ongoing initiatives undertaken during the current reporting year. EMPLOYEES We are an employee-driven organisation. Our employees are our eyes and ears for the external environment and represent the face of Mahindra to the world outside. This year, we continued to actively engage with our employees in order to better understand their dreams, desires and expectations and how we can dovetail them with the organisational goals. The following are some of the new initiatives started during reporting year 2012-13: Trackathon | AD Mahindra Auto Quotient (AQ) conducted an event called Trackathon that provided employees with an opportunity to learn about Mahindra vehicles as well as experience them in action.

We believe, the solutions to this problem could already be within Mahindra, just in need of the right mentoring and opportunity to learn. At Mahindra, we blend motivation and targeted training to create an able workforce that shows improved productivity. Our endeavour is to be on every employees list of good employers. We have multiple training programmes that include topics such as building positive attitude, stress management, creativity, team effectiveness, employee engagement, safety and environment, quality tools, TPM, dexterity and enhancing technical capabilities. Following is a brief snapshot of these programmes: Career Customisation: Mpower at AFS Mpower is an algorithm driven career There are two major advantages of Mpower for employees: simulation tool that allows employees to explore a plethora of career Helps them create a dream career path by choosing the roles they aspire for. options available in various functions Helps them understand the developmental gap between their current role at AFS and create a path for their and the role that they aim for and hence, make an individual development dream career. plan accordingly. 44 Based on the current proﬁle of an employee, Mpower selects and displays certain roles in the organisation which it sees as a match. The employee can select any of the roles he is interested in. A maximum of three roles can be selected to make a dream career path. After every role is selected, subsequent roles displayed are always one level above the current role and hence, provides the employee an opportunity to create a progressive career ladder. The tool was launched in AFS and is made available to the employees in the Manufacturing Divisions. Development Centres As in the previous years, this year too, our Talent Management Team organised the Development Centres with an aim to cover all leaders in the top three levels of management across the Mahindra Group. In the reporting year, the 'Development Centre' programme was conducted for 91 leaders. Managerial Transition Programme – First Time Managers (FTM) A second batch of the Managerial Transition Programme  First Time Managers (FTM) commenced on 22nd February 2013.

Our vision is to help farmers go beyond the plough, use tractors and embrace modern technology. While the project is still ongoing, its success can be gauged from the fact that in employee engagement surveys, Farm Passion scored 4.08 out of 5. The farm business is like building a cathedral.

The objective is to encourage and enthuse the Mahindraites to give their best, every day. To instil this philosophy in the DNA of Mahindraites, eight HR projects were designed with clear objectives, which were met signiﬁcantly. Mentioned below is a snapshot of achievements of each project: Communication and Internalisation Mahindra Rise Portal was initiated to inculcate the spirit of Rise in the existing employees. It received a great response with 490,000+ hits in the ﬁrst ten months. And till date, more than 350 Rise stories have been shared. Recruitment In accordance with the spirit of Rise, people were hired for attitude and trained for skills. A competency-based interview process was launched across the Group and more than 500 managers were trained to implement it. Induction and on-boarding Once on-board, these recruits were exposed to an induction module in line with Rise philosophy. Talent Management The Rise philosophy has been comprehensively embedded in our talent management process that continually guides our employees to push limits, think alternatively, and drive positive change. Performance Management System (PMS) The principles of Rise have been integrated in the PMS, so as to positively inﬂuence the performance and engagement of the employees. Learning & Development For building a pipeline of leaders, who can exhibit and mentor Rise behaviour, a learning & development module has been created transforming Mahindra into a learning organisation. Leadership Competencies A leadership framework has been developing that imbibes the Rise philosophy. A unique competency framework, cutting across diverse Mahindra businesses has been developed, covering more than 20,000 employees through online and ofﬂine channels.

This we do by adhering to the terms and timelines of the Montreal Protocol. Incorporating the regulation of emission of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) like Chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFC), Halons and Hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons (HCFCs), and implementation of environmental management programmes in our processes are the many ways in which we have been able to substantially reduce the use of ODS. In 2012-13, the Non-ODS (R134a) consumption stood at 97.64 tonne vis-a-vis 95.61 tonne in 2011-12. 88 Greenhouse Gases We at Mahindra, have always worked on the principle of 'What gets measured, gets managed', to enhance the efﬁcacy of our operations. We continually take up measures to monitor and manage the emissions, so as to circumscribe them. This year too, we are reporting our emissions across all three scopes: Absolute GHG Emissions 140,535 127,979 143,820 2010-11 Scope 1 2011-12 All direct GHG emissions in CO2. tCO2e 2012-13 669,798 609,844 611,737 Scope 2 Indirect GHG emissions from consumption of purchased electricity. tCO2e 376,183 285,374 220,664 Scope 3 Other indirect emissions, such as inbound & outbound logistics, air travel, daily commutation, paper consumption and transport-related activities. tCO2e Note: The increase in absolute GHG emissions as compared to the previous year is due to increase in production/service as well as increase in the scope of reporting. This is likely to happen year-on-year as we enhance the scope of our reporting. As a continual improvement, sectors have improved their depth of reporting and have devised processes to capture Scope 3 consumption in detail. This has resulted in the increase of scope 3 emissions compared to the previous year.

It comprises diversity at three levels: genetic diversity (within species), species diversity (between species) and ecosystem diversity. India accounts for approximately 8% of all the recorded species of the world. We, at Mahindra, are also contributing in our small way to nurture and protect the rich biodiversity of India. Project Hariyali Project Hariyali is a step towards nurturing biodiversity. Initiated in 2007, with an objective to plant one million trees by October 2008, this humble initiative surpassed the target by a good 22% and the total trees planted were 1,221,118. To carry the momentum forward, a target was set to plant one million trees every year. In 2011-2012, we again surpassed the annual target by 20% by planting 1,205,879 trees. In 2012-13, we planted 1,746,418 trees surpassing the assigned target by an impressive 74%. This was possible only with ample support from our employees and community partners. We are fully aware that plantation is just the ﬁrst step in the long journey of transforming saplings into trees of the future. Hence, we closely nurture their growth and replant the ones that wither away.

The sanctuary has been declared an International Bird Area (IBA). Club Mahindra Tusker Trails, located on the edge of the Periyar Tiger reserves, has been playing a facilitating role by helping identify 19 endangered bird species out of which four are near threatened, ﬁve vulnerable, seven least concern, one endangered and two are critically endangered birds. It has developed a plan to conserve these species over the next few years. This has been done through the below mentioned efforts: The CMTT team provided for nest boxes for birds like Mynas and Owls to have a safe roosting and nesting space. Aiding in building safe Bat roosting spaces. Building materials like cotton and coconut fibre are regularly provided to aid the birds in building nesting homes. Installing bird and fish feeders to provide them food. Planting of roosting trees for birds and other afforestation initiatives. Carrying out awareness campaigns and drives, that involve participation of guests as volunteers and enabling them to connect to the local communities. Providing and publishing information booklets on birds, butterflies and plants in and around the resort. Encouraging guided boat cruises around the lake for promoting the importance of the lake ecosystem.

Right from plugging the water tap gaps to bridging the gap in groundwater levels; from recharging existing bore wells to replenishing dried-up water bodies; from recycling wastewater to harvesting rainwater there are myriad ways to ensure perennial accessibility of fresh water. At Mahindra, our aim is to change the water equation from H2O to H2. Water conservation has always been an integral part of Mahindra's sustainability initiatives. But in the light of the massive and disastrous hydrological drought in Maharashtra, the importance of water and the sensitivity towards its conservation has increased manifolds. Last year, we had undertaken a water footprinting exercise. Based on it, we identiﬁed opportunities to reduce, reuse and recycle water and planned strategies to address the same across sectors. Implementation of the various water conservation projects have resulted in the better utilisation of this resource in many sectors this year.

To enable the HIV+ positive people to rise and live a digniﬁed life, Mahindra Unfortunately, this disease often AD approached the programme through two key planks: falls prey to ignorance rather than sensitisation. 1 Prevention 2 Rehabilitation 1 The Prevention Drive Our ﬁrst step to ensure HIV / AIDS prevention was mass awareness through various platforms like: AIDS Education Maximum prevalence of HIV+ in Nashik District was found in young population below 24 years. Hence, we targeted schools and colleges ﬁrst, to infuse credible knowledge about AIDS. Red Ribbon Clubs We also established Red Ribbon Clubs in 14 schools / colleges across Nashik. The clubs were driven by teachers and students, specially trained by NGOs and district health authorities on creating AIDS awareness. Bridge Population Bridge population refers to the population of truckers and migrants who owing to their transitory nature of work, often fall prey to unprotected relationships and hence face the risk of HIV transmission. Condom Vending Machine Installations Mahindra & Mahindra is the ﬁrst factory in Nashik to put up condom vending machines & also distribute free condoms through discreetly kept take away boxes. Factories & Municipal Wards AIDS awareness has been cascaded across all 108 municipal wards through various means including rallies, street plays and wall paintings. 124 The Rehabilitation Drive After persistently pursuing the awareness campaign for 28 months, the team leapt forward to ensure a digniﬁed life for them. The aim was to mainstream the affected people into the society and empower them with good health and ﬁnancial freedom. We focused on rehabilitation via three key enablers: counselling services, vocational training and nutritional support. Nutritional Packages A growing body of evidence demonstrates how children living with HIV / AIDS (CLHAs) are especially vulnerable to infections and diseases. To ensure better immunity and vitality for 100 such children, nutritional packages are being provided. Furthermore, we also visit the abode of these children to monitor the adequacy of nutritious food available to them. Vocational Training Vocational training on candle making, warli painting, craft, lanterns and bag making was provided by experts to the people affected by HIV to help them become self sustainable. Team Prayas also ensured suitable markets for the products made by HIV+ persons. Employing PLHAs Taking the initiative further, the M&M volunteers and NGOs with the help of our numerous suppliers & vendors made a pitch for employment of trained / semi-skilled People Living with HIV / AIDS (PLHA) in local industries of Nashik. Counselling Centre Opened at Mahindra premises in 2007, today we have MSW qualiﬁed counsellors and modern audio-visual aids to support. A total of 220 HIV+ people have already registered with the counselling centre so far.

One such programme is the Village Electriﬁcation Project. In 2012, under this programme a total of 168 solar street lights were set up in the villages of Jalna, Aurangabad, Nanded and Naigaon in Maharashtra. A detailed study was conducted after which these villages were zeroed in on. A site survey was conducted to locate where exactly these street lights should be setup and identify the unlit areas, so that maximum beneﬁt could be brought to the villagers. In Vizapur Taluka for e.g., streetlights were setup near the village temple, public toilets, at the cremation ground and the village chaupal, areas that were frequented by the residents and were high density meeting spots. A local team including the panchayat was also consulted, to be able to correctly locate the right areas for setting up the lights. For the same, an amount of INR 4,710,000 was given to the Mahindra Foundation to carry out the project. The objective of the VEP is primarily to help the less fortunate in the remote parts of rural India where there is no electricity reach. Being a rural ﬁnancing company, Mahindra Finance has reach in the interiors of India. This helps the team perform an authentic need assessment before undertaking VEP. An organisation cannot prosper unless it looks after the welfare of all the stakeholders that it interacts with. The Village Electriﬁcation Project brought double beneﬁts of providing light to the unlit villages along with using a form of renewable energy, that does not harm the environment. Identifying the genuine needs of the people and taking cognizance of the fact that these villages were remote and Government initiatives lacked in providing electricity, the same were identiﬁed. The objective of this project was perfectly aligned with our mission of transforming rural lives and Solar Street Lamp at Hatnur Kannad, driving positive change in these communities. Aurangabad Continuing with the Village Electriﬁcation Project, Mahindra Finance has also identiﬁed some villages in Tamil Nadu for setting up solar street lights, this year. A minimum of six street lights will be installed in each village, so that we are able to make a substantial impact, instead of just increasing the count of villages without actually being able to make a difference. 127 EDUCATION SUPPORT KCMET's Girl Child Education Story Education is a versatile virtue a source of self-sufﬁciency, a cradle for awareness Statistically Speaking and a gateway to innovation.

HEALTH SUPPORT Overview India is one nation, with two diverse realities. While the better half of India enjoys the fruits of progress and development, the other half is denied of even basic rights, like the right to good health. At Mahindra, we are committed to resolve this conﬂict of duality and strive to bring basic healthcare access to the lower strata of society, in the remotest of regions of the country. 133 Lifeline Express At Mahindra, our deﬁnition of out-patient care is going out to wherever the patient is. A vanguard of this premise is the Lifeline Express. This unique hospital-on-rails reaches out to the remotest-of-the-remote hinterlands in India which are bereft of medical attention. The Mahindra Group, over the years, has supported the Lifeline Express with not only ﬁnancial assistance, but also by contributing its time and efforts via its employee volunteering programme Esops. This mobile hospital brings free medical care to people whose geographical location, ﬁnancial means or disability prevents them from going to a formal hospital. It is a full-ﬂedged hospital with fully air-conditioned and well-equipped coaches that include two operation theatres, a recovery room, a diagnostic centre and other advanced medical & surgical facilities.

The project aims to make a holistic achievement while addressing following key issues: 1 Improving water availability by constructing watershed structures 2 Restoring ecological balance by conserving and developing natural resources i.e. soil, water and vegetation Phase 2 of IWMP, spanning over 3 years, 3 Mobilising community through formation of community-based organisations covers 9,660 hectares of area, where the water 4 Increasing area under cultivation and its crop production intensity table is 45 feet deep and 5 Creating livelihood and self-sustenance will directly impact 20,000 Bringing about holistic development through interventions in health, Indians across 32 villages 6 sanitation and education in the Damoh district of Madhya Pradesh 7 Increasing per capita income by at least two folds Intervention The process began with the formation Community empowerment was facilitated through the following of a 19-member team in our project de-centralised organisations: location. The team's primary objective was to create awareness about the Watershed Committees programme, enrol participation from Decision-making body comprising local villagers. Through our Participatory Rural the community and ensure successful Appraisal, they participate in the ideation of the development plans and are pivotal execution of the programme. The in implementing the planned activity. team then conducted key baseline activities like household surveys and User Groups net planning of the entire project area. Groups comprising local villagers who are responsible for taking care of the These helped form the raw data and structures built. They also maintain bank accounts for user charges. It will ensure 5-year development targets for the sustainability of the structures. action areas. 139 Community Development Ofﬁcers Our Community Development Ofﬁcers go to the villages and help in formation of Self Help Groups (SHGs). They are trained in livelihood enhancing activities like sewing, goat-rearing, etc., and are provided with revolving funds to start these activities as a micro-enterprise. More than 200 SHGs have been formed so far and 40 have been granted revolving funds. Others are in the processes of development. These enterprises are helping the women's groups earn up to INR 3,000 per month. The Project Team The project team conducts regular meetings involving community in the development work for planning and execution. Visits of Government ofﬁcials and agri-scientists to the area help in creating awareness within the project area about various government schemes. Seed Production Societies Groups of farmers are formed, who will make available breeder seeds and high yielding gen-1 and gen-2 seeds. These seeds will be distributed to the other farmers in the project area and adjoining ﬁelds. Apart from these multi-level interventions, we conduct visits for farmers to nearby districts for exposure to irrigation avenues and also visits to agricultural universities, and invite people from village communities to share their experiences of gainful agriculture ventures by optimisation of resources. Impact We completed 32 high impact Entry Point Activities like reconstructing school's boundary walls, cement concrete roads and crematoriums which have helped the community participate in the development work. A total of 52 hectare of land has been brought under vegetation and horticulture development. The core work in Watershed Development is construction of Soil and Water conservation structures. So far we have constructed eight check dams, 17 ponds and tanks, 1,100 soil conservation structures like stone outlets and gully plugs, trenches which run up to 80,000 meters and water storage spaces of capacity 450 million litres. Also, more than 1,200 farmers received an improved variety of seeds in the Rabi (Wheat) and Kharif cycle (Paddy, Pigeon pea, Black gram and soya bean) in 2012. Most farmers have registered productivity acceleration by 25-30%. Long Term Goals Our project will help create a forest cover on 1,000 hectare of land. This will also be instrumental in conserving natural resources and maintaining environmental balance. 3 With our water conservation structures, we aim to create 42 million m of waterstoring capacity in the area. This will increase water table level in the area. The soil and water conservation measures will reduce the erosion of the fertile top layer of the soil improving soil health, helping maintaining humidity, recharge water in the ground and increase in yield. Encouraging and accelerating the adoption of micro-irrigation systems like Drip and Sprinkler will help farmers use irrigation water more prudently. 140 ANNEXURES MEMBERSHIPS All India Management Association, New Delhi Indian Green Building Council The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry Indo American Chamber of Commerce of India (ASSOCHAM) Indo French Chamber of Commerce and Industries Bombay Chamber of Commerce & Industries Indo German Chamber of Commerce Bombay First IIT Bombay BMTPC Building Materials and Technology Promotion Council Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management Bureau of Energy Efﬁciency (BEE) New Delhi Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Childlink India Foundation Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry (Mumbai & Pune) CII Apex Council of Afﬁrmative Action Mumbai Waste Management Association (MWML), Taloja CII Western Regional Council Mumbai Cricket Association CII National Committee of Indian MNCs National HRD Network CCI Clinton Climate Initiatives National Safety Council Central Pollution Control Board Population First Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) SIAM New Delhi Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) Hyderabad SOIL (School of Inspired Leadership) Consortium Confederation of Indian Industries Mumbai The Council of EU Chambers of Commerce CREDA (Chennai) The Indian Hotels DST Department of Science and Technology TCB Conference Board Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) United Nations Global Compact and Harvard Business School(I) Research Centre Global Compact Network India Indian Council on Global Relations Walchand Talent First Limited 141 G3.1 CONTENT INDEX STANDARD DISCLOSURES PART I: Profile Disclosures Strategy and Analysis Profile Description Reported Cross-reference/ If applicable, indicate Reason for Explanation Disclosure Direct answer the part not reported omission 1.1 Statement from the most senior decisionFully 1-2 maker of the organization. 1.2 Description of key impacts, risks, and Fully 27-29 opportunities.
