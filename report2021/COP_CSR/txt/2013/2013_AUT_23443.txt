Because coming generations will benefit even more from our sustainable business approach. E VOILNUITNIO NO N ON N OVAVA A T I T IOT INO V N IN NO A good working environment is the foundation for our future. We challenge and encourage our employees. To make sure we can expect top performance, we invest in a safe and motivating working environment. We have significantly reduced the number of work accidents since 2010 and, with 12 accidents per million hours worked in 2012, moved closer to our goal of less than 10 accidents by 2015. As an employer in many, in part structurally weak regions, we want to offer stable employment relationships. The long service length of 12.9 years and a low number of days lost through work stoppages speak a clear language. IN N OVALTI IO N F E C YC O N INN LE VA T I OV I N NO AT ION A long life requires amazingly little energy. A house made of Wienerberger building materials is an investment for coming generations. The core of our sustainability strategy is the long service life of our products. At the same time, we implement measures to reduce the environmental impact of our production processes. Our activities are focused not only on reducing energy consumption, but also on improving our ecological footprint by using fewer raw materials and increasing the use of recycled products. IN N OVA T IO N R ELI A V A T I O N I N NBO ILIT Y IN N O VA T IO N We don’t think about tomorrow. We’re already there. The sustainability of our products is underscored by their long service life. Outstanding technical properties are another exceptional feature: ceramic building materials are free of pollutants. They not only provide good thermal insulation, but also protection against noise and fire, and create a healthy, comfortable indoor climate. With continuous innovation, we make sure our pipes can meet any challenge – above all in the areas of health and supply security. R E STPI OON NISNIBNO ILVI T Y A AT IO O V I N N N N IN OV AT ION Success can’t always be measured in numbers. We believe we can help best in areas related to our core expertise. That’s why we are active, above all, in two main areas. First, in the construction of housing for the needy and help in the event of disasters near our plants. And second, in cooperation with the Vienna University of Economics and Business, we give young, talented men and women an opportunity to obtain additional technical training in sustainable construction.

Climate protection The frequently discussed climate change is attributable primarily to the sharp rise in CO2 and climate change emissions from the burning of fossil fuels such as crude oil and natural gas. In order to limit global as central concerns warming to a tolerable level, we must reduce CO2 emissions, use energy more efficiently and convert to non-fossil energy sources – and all that as quickly and completely as possible. Nearly zero-energy The energy consumption of buildings plays a major role in this process. The building sector standard mandatory in in the EU is currently responsible for roughly 40% of total energy consumption. As a result, the the EU starting in 2021 EU issued a directive that requires all buildings built after January 1, 2021 to meet “nearly ­zero-energy” standards 1). e4-Brickhouse 2020 Our e4-Brickhouse 2020 already meets these requirements today. It can save 4,200 tons of already meets this CO2 per year compared with a conventional single family house because it produces more energy standard today than it uses. In order to verify this claim, the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) will monitor the first e4-Brickhouse 2020 up to 2014. This house was built in the Lower Austrian town of Zwettl by a family of four, who moved in during the past year. Healthy living In addition to the energy efficiency of buildings, I see healthy living as one of the most (e.g. interior air) as a important issues for the future of modern housing. People in the western industrial countries key issue for the future of housing spend roughly 90% of their time indoors – and the quality of the interior air generally leaves a lot to be desired: pollutants, dry air, dust and mold not only have a negative influence on the indoor climate, but also represent a major health risk. Today, asthma is the most frequently diagnosed disease among children in Europe. It is no coincidence that bricks have been used as a building material for thousands of years – their outstanding properties create an optimal quality of living for residents. Bricks are absolutely free of pollutants. They are also permeable, which means they equalize the humidity in the room and, in this way, create a healthy indoor climate. Bricks also help to save energy, both in heating and cooling, because of their natural air conditioning properties. The accumulation capacity of bricks evens out temperature fluctuations by absorbing heat during the daytime and releasing it in the night, or vice versa. Bricks are therefore one of the best building materials for the creation of a pleasant and comfortable atmosphere. 1) Directive 2010/31/EU from May 19, 2010 on the energy performance of buildings 8 Heimo Scheuch, Chief Executive Officer of Wienerberger AG The consequences of climate change and the resulting heavier rainfall over shorter periods Special pipe system to of time represent a new challenge, above all for urban areas. Flooding has become a growing prevent flooding in cities problem because sufficient drainage areas are frequently not available and sewage systems are not designed to handle the higher water volumes. With our innovative RaineoTM pipe system, we have developed a solution for this problem. Our products have a proven service life of more than 100 years. This creates value for Long service life of our generations, but also brings a great deal of responsibility. Therefore, one of our main goals is to products brings responsibility for anticipate trends and developments to offer our customers innovative and affordable solutions for continued development residential construction, infrastructure and renovation that guarantee long-term comfort, health and innovation and security. Innovation is one of the guiding principles of our strategy to generate organic growth and create maximum value for all our stakeholders, above all our customers. This is our course for the future. Our goal is to increase the share of innovative products from the current level of 23% to 30% of revenues by 2015. Sustainable management has been a key part of the Wienerberger corporate culture for many First-time announcement years and is integrated in all areas of the company. In order to make our activities even more of sustainability goals in this report to improve transparent, we have decided to announce our sustainability goals for various areas for the first transparency time in this report and will report to you on our progress in the future. I invite you to form your own opinion of our efforts in sustainability management and to join us on a sustainable course into the future. 9 Wienerberger at a Glance The Wienerberger History From an Austrian brick Wienerberger was founded in 1819 by Alois Miesbach on the Wienerberg in Vienna. This manufacturer … Austrian brick manufacturer became one of the first companies to trade on the Vienna Stock Exchange with its initial public offering in 1869. In spite of this listing, Wienerberger remained a local company for over one hundred years. The first internationalization step was taken in 1986 with the acquisition of the German Oltmanns Group and continued with successful expansion into Eastern Europe, France and the Benelux countries during the 1990s. The founding of P ­ ipelife (plastic pipes) as joint venture with a Belgian partner and the development of the Group’s ceramic pipe and concrete paver activities also occurred during this time. … through a number Further growth steps in Europe were followed by Wienerberger’s development into a global of expansion steps … player with the takeover of General Shale in the USA during 1999. Another key strategic milestone was set in 2003 with the Group’s entry into the roofing systems market through the acquisition of Koramic and the steady expansion of this business in the following years. … and restructuring After many years of strong, expansive growth, Wienerberger was hit hard by the global measures … economic crisis in 2009 because of its heavy dependence on cyclical new residential construction. Heimo Scheuch took over as chief executive officer of the Wienerberger Group in summer 2009 and implemented an extensive restructuring program through the end of 2010 that adjusted corporate structures to reflect the difficult market conditions. The end of the restructuring process was followed by a strategic reorientation, which focused the company on financial discipline and organic growth through innovative and premium products. The expansion steps after 2009 were directed, above all, to less cyclical business areas like roof tiles and pipe systems in order to ensure the sustainable generation of stable earnings. Company Profile … to an international With the full takeover of the plastic pipe producer Pipelife in 2012, Wienerberger completed system provider of its transformation into an international supplier of building material systems. Business activities building materials are now aggregated in two divisions: Bricks & Tiles and Pipes & Pavers. The Bricks & Tiles ­Division covers the clay block, facing brick and clay roof tile product groups. Wienerberger is the world’s largest producer of clay blocks, number one in facing bricks in Europe and the USA and the market leader for clay roof tiles in Europe. The Pipes & Pavers Division includes our activities in the areas of plastic pipes, ceramic pipes and concrete pavers. Wienerberger is one of the leading suppliers of plastic pipes, ceramic pipes and concrete pavers (only in Central-East Europe) in Europe. Clay blocks: No. 1 worldwide Facing bricks: No. 1 in Europe, co-leader in the USA Clay roof tiles: No. 1 in Europe Plastic pipes: Leading position in Europe Ceramic pipes: No. 1 in Europe Concrete pavers: No. 1 in Central-East Europe 10 Wienerberger AG Wienerberger at a Glance Sustainability Report 2012 History and Profile Strategy and Business Model Strategy and Business Model The goal of our business model is to create and maintain a sustainable increase in the value Sustainable creation of the company in accordance with ecological, social and economic principles. Accordingly, we of added value as top corporate goal want to create added value for all our stakeholders. For Wienerberger, the years since the crisis have been characterized, above all, by a difficult Completion of strategic new residential construction market and an internal focus on cash generation. Extensive restrucreorientation from an expansion-driven to a turing measures were implemented in 2009 as a reaction to the global financial crisis, which cut market-oriented company fixed costs by approx. € 200 million, substantially reduced working capital and gradually decreased the company’s debt. The restructuring phase was followed by a strategic reorientation from a primarily expansion-driven to a market-oriented company with a focus on organic growth. Our customers are the focal point of our actions – we want to create added value for them with innovative, high-quality and application-oriented system solutions. Comprehensive advising and service for our customers, starting with the project planning stage, are an important part of our improved sales activities. The strategy for our core business is designed to establish and extend leading positions in all markets in which we are present. In order to reduce Wienerberger’s dependence on new residential construction over the Strategic expansion medium-term, we have been working for several years to expand the core business through a through development of pipe systems stronger concentration on renovation and infrastructure. Our activities in the area of pipe systems should be seen in this connection. We acquired Steinzeug-Keramo, the market leader for ceramic pipes in Europe, during 2010. In 2012 the Wienerberger Group completed its transformation to an international system provider of building materials with the full takeover of Pipelife, one of the leading European producers of plastic pipes. Both companies were acquired at comparatively low multiples and create substantial added value with a CFROI that clearly exceeds the internal hurdle rate of 11.5%. The expansion of the core business has reduced the dependence on cyclical new residential construction from approx. 70% to roughly 60% of revenues. It has also broadened Wienerberger’s strategic base and extended the potential for sustainable growth over the mediumand long-term. Our strategic focus will remain on financial discipline as well as the protection of a strong Financial discipline capital structure based on our internal goal to hold the ratio of net debt to operating EBITDA is a top strategic priority for Wienerberger below 2.5 years. The issue of an additional bond in April 2013 with a volume of € 300 million increased our liquidity reserves and further optimized the term structure of liabilities. The maintenance and protection of a strong capital structure remains a central goal for Wienerberger, which we will continue to pursue through the proactive management of liquidity and the term structure of liabilities. Wienerberger’s activities cover solutions for walls and roofs (clay blocks, facing bricks and Wienerberger Group: clay roof tiles) as well as pipe systems & paver solutions (plastic pipes, ceramic pipes and concrete EBITDA potential of € 600 million pavers). These businesses are managed by region based on the following divisions: Bricks & Tiles Europe, Pipes & Pavers Europe and North America. The Wienerberger Group has a mediumto long-term EBITDA potential of approx. € 600 million across all divisions, once the new ­residential construction market recovers. 11 The Year 2012 in Review Increase in operating Wienerberger increased revenues by 23% and operating EBITDA by 2% during 2012 in a results through difficult market environment. The Group’s results were influenced by three major developments: expansion of pipe operations in a difficult an earnings decline in the European brick business due to weaker residential construction across market environment Europe, a substantial positive contribution from the acquisition of Pipelife in May 2012 and moderate recovery on the US new residential construction market with a resulting improvement in revenues and earnings in the North America Division. The Bricks & Tiles Europe Division recorded a decline in revenues and earnings for the year because the European construction industry was again faced with the negative effects of the euro and sovereign debt crisis and new residential construction subsequently fell below the 2009 crisis year in a number of key markets. These developments were met with a restructuring program that involves non-recurring costs of approx. € 43 million, but will bring sustainable costs savings of € 50 million by year-end 2014. The costs for the restructuring program and other non-cash effective one-time expenses resulted in a loss of € 40.5 million for the year. Return of 20% Wienerberger again demonstrated its cash flow-generating strength in 2012, despite the on free cash flow difficult market environment, and increased free cash flow by 21% to € 164 million. That ­represents a free cash flow return of 20% at year-end. The Group’s strong capital structure was underscored by a ratio of net debt to operating EBITDA that equaled 2.2 years at year-end 2012. As a result a € 0.12 dividend per share for the 2012 financial year was paid to shareholders. Pipelife acquisition main The average number of employees in the Wienerberger Group rose to 13,060 during the reason for increase in reporting year. This development resulted, above all, from the initial consolidation of Pipelife as workforce of May 31, 2012. The Pipelife acquisition and compensation increases explain the rise in wages, salaries and employee benefits. Dividend and coupon on A dividend of € 0.12 per share, or a total of € 13.8 million, was paid in 2012 from profit hybrid bond lead to recorded for the 2011 financial year. As in the previous years, the payment of the hybrid coupon payments of € 46.3 million amounted to € 32.5 million. Net debt rose from € 358.8 million at year-end 2011 to € 602.0 million as of December 31, 2012, in particular due to the Pipelife acquisition, but gearing equaled a comparatively low 26% at the end of 2012. Payments of € 33.7 million Payments to the public sector, which represent taxes on income and other taxes (excluding to the public sector deferred taxes) fell slightly to € 33.7 million in 2012 due to the decline in earnings and the resulting lower tax expense. 12 Wienerberger AG Wienerberger at a Glance Sustainability Report 2012 The Year 2012 in Review Corporate Governance Cash flows to stakeholders in € mill. 2010 1) 2011 1) 2012 Change in % Public financial subsidies in % Revenues and other operating income 1,731.3 1,971.8 2,407.3 +22 Operating costs 2) -1,040.1 -1,179.0 -1,518.7 +29 3 Employee wages, salaries and benefits 3) -469.4 -525.4 -592.5 +13 1 2 Payments to providers of capital (owners) 4) -32.5 -44.2 -46.3 +5 Payments to providers of capital (creditors) -43.8 -39.5 -52.1 +32 Payments to public authorities 5) -24.4 -35.7 -33.7 -6 1) The data were adjusted to reflect a change in accounting policies 2) Production costs plus selling, administrative and other operating expenses; 1 Investments in environmental excluding wages, salaries, benefits, depreciation and amortization as well as non-income based taxes protection and occupational 3) Excluding temporary personnel and company automobiles; including employee-related restructuring costs safety 72% 4) The hybrid coupon and dividend are shown in the year in which payment was made 2 Product research and 5) Excluding deferred taxes development 16% 3 Other 12% The Wienerberger Group received public financial subsidies of € 3.2 million in 2012 (individual amounts over € 50,000 are recorded).

Corporate Governance at Wienerberger For many years Wienerberger has followed a strategy that is designed to maximize cash flows Implementation of in order to create and maintain a sustainable increase in shareholder value. Strict principles of strict principles for good management and good management and transparency as well as the continuous development of an efficient control transparency system form the basis for meeting this goal. We give the highest priority to providing all shareholders with the same comprehensive Compliance code to information. To prevent insider trading, we have released a compliance guideline that implements prevent insider trading and code of conduct for the provisions of the Issuer Compliance Code published by the Austrian Financial Market lobbying activities Authority. A compliance officer monitors the observance of these rules. A code of conduct based on the Austrian Lobbying Act covers all corporate bodies and the employees of Austrian companies in which Wienerberger AG holds a controlling interest. This code defines the principles for lobbying activities and can be reviewed on the Wienerberger website (www.wienerberger.com). Wienerberger was one of the first companies in Austria to announce its support for this code Wienerberger is the and to commit to compliance with its rules. Wienerberger met all rules and recommendations of leader for transparency the code (in the version dated July 2012) in 2012. The corporate governance report is integrated in the 2012 annual report (pages 20 to 37). Additional information on corporate governance at Wienerberger is provided in the 2012 annual report, which is also published on the company’s website (annualreport.wienerberger.com). 13 Sustainable Development at Wienerberger Wienerberger Principles of Sustainability Business as an integral Wienerberger views business as an integral part of society. Its duty is to serve people and part of society create value for everyone. Wienerberger takes its role as a responsible member of society seriously. We define responsibility as ethical actions, honest communications, active participation in the transparent development of our economic environment, personal accountability and actions that confirm our standing as a reliable and valuable member of society. Sustainable products Sustainability represents an integral part of the Wienerberger corporate culture and the are the focal point of the corporate strategy. We view sustainable management as a process that creates lasting added value sustainability strategy for all our stakeholders. Our sustainable products and system solutions form the focal point of our sustainability strategy. Wienerberger produces and sells a wide variety of building material products and solutions that are used for very different applications. One of our most important goals is to create added value for our customers with our products and solutions with their long service life, technical properties, low impact on the environment over the entire lifecycle and economy. In general, we see sustainability as a function between the service life of a product and its impact on the environment during production, transport, installation, use and disposal: SERVICE SUSTAIN ABILITY = LIFE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT The sustainability of a product increases with its service life. Increasing the service life of a product reduces the use of resources and the effects on the environment over the entire lifecycle. In this same way, a reduction in the use of resources based on a constant lifecycle makes products more sustainable. 14 Wienerberger AG Sustainable Development Sustainability Report 2012 Principles Sustainable Management The Sustainable Management Cycle At Wienerberger, sustainability is embedded in all stages of the value creation process.

The use of reusand recycling as central able raw materials and recycling are the central principles of our sustainable production. Another principles for production important focal point of our activities is the greatest possible conservation of resources. That means improving the energy and resource efficiency of production processes through optimized technologies and, in that way, and through the use of renewable energy carriers reducing CO2 emissions. We are also working to reduce the weight of our products and evaluating the use of secondary raw materials. 3. Sustainable products Long-lasting and The value of a building or a pipe system is dependent on numerous factors, not least on the innovative products products used. A central principle of product development at Wienerberger is the creation of create sustainable value sustainable value for people with long-lasting and innovative system solutions. Wienerberger brick products form an integral part of sustainable building concepts. They guarantee a high quality of living and make an active contribution to climate protection. In the area of pipes and pavers we offer system solutions for today’s challenges, including the demands on water management resulting from climate change and increasing urbanization. 4. Responsibility for society We are committed to “Building with a clear conscience” – Our belief in sustainability is also reflected in our goal social responsibility to accept responsibility for society. The protection of human rights and compliance with all relevant national and international legal regulations as well as open and transparent communications with politics and public authorities also represent an integral part of our commitment to social responsibility.

It is Sustainability report based on the standards defined by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and represents an i­ nte­gral as part of a continuous process part of a continuous process. All levels of management and our employees have taken on shared responsibility for the implementation of measures to support a continuous improvement in ­sustainability at Wienerberger. This sustainability report provides information on the current status and further measures in the areas of employees, environmental protection in production, sustain­­able products, social responsibility and stakeholder management. It not only represents a collection ­of interesting facts and figures, but also serves as an instrument to monitor the progress of our ­sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Steering Committee (SDSC) was founded in 2009 to define Transparent Wienerberger’s sustainability strategy, key indicators according to GRI and goals for sustainable communication of goals for the first time development. The SDSC meets regularly or as required to discuss progress on the sustainability process and options for further actions. It also defines goals and measures for implementation throughout the Group. In order to make our commitment to these goals transparent, we are publishing them for the first time in this sustainability report. The following chapters provide information on our goals in the respective areas. This sustainability report was released by the SDSC. The Chief Executive Officer of CEO monitors Wienerberger AG, Heimo Scheuch, is a member of the Sustainable Development Steering sustainable development Committee. He monitors the company’s sustainable development on a regular basis and ensures that sustainability always has top priority for the company. In recent years our approach to sustainability management has become substantially more Sustainability professional and more firmly anchored in the company. Responsibilities for sustainability have management is anchored in the also been clearly defined. In addition to a Group-wide sustainability officer who reports directly organization to the Chief Executive Officer of Wienerberger AG, each of our country organizations and subsidiaries has designated a person who is responsible for sustainability and the implementation of the respective Group guidelines and programs. The SDSC uses Wienerberger’s internal audit department to review major aspects of the Internal audit as sustainability program. This department, which reports directly to the Managing Board, evaluates control function the company’s operating processes each year based on an audit plan and a risk assessment. ­Monitoring the internal control system in the accounting process is one of the most important responsibilities of internal audit. Another duty is the review of compliance with legal regulations and internal guidelines, for example the guidelines on business gifts and competition law. Internal audit also evaluates compliance with Wienerberger safety standards for employees and with selected areas of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, whereby the latter is mainly a focus of activities by the external auditor. 17 Milestones in Sustainable Development 2001 Commitment to a Social Charter for compliance with the applicable agreements and recommendations of the International Labor Organization (ILO) in Geneva 2006 Wienerberger is a founding member 2003 of the Austrian UN Global Compact network respACT Austria Commitment to the UN Global Compact – a United Nations initiative established in 1999 to promote 2009 ethical behavior among companies Founding of the Wienerberger (good corporate citizenship) Sustainable Development Steering Committee to define Wienerberger’s 2004 sustainability strategy, key indicators and targeted goals for 2011 Extensive discussions of sustainability sustainable development Integration of local sustainby Wienerberger management ability m ­ anagers into a network together with external advisors; to better anchor sustainability definition of the Wienerberger mission 2010 issues in the Wienerberger country organizations statement by 80 managers from all Publication of the first Wienerberger ­country organizations Sustainability Report and implemen­tation of the defined measures, for example 2012 2005 the Environmental Action Plan and Safety Initiative 2010 Communication of goals for Communication of the defined sustainability indicators Wienerberger mission statement to all employees and implementation in all country organizations 18 Wienerberger AG Sustainable Development Sustainability Report 2012 Milestones Employees Principles Employees Principles of Sustainable Human Resources Management Our employees are the basis of our success and a key factor for the successful development Sustainable human of our company. Wienerberger is well aware of its responsibility to its employees and takes this resources management for diversity and equal responsibility seriously. We are committed to sustainable human resources management that opportunity, safety and creates the necessary requirements and conditions for our employees in the areas of diversity and health, training and a equal opportunity, occupational safety and health, training and a motivating working environmotivating working environment ment. Our human resources management is based on the following sustainability principles, which apply without limitation throughout the entire Group: – Equal opportunity independent of age, gender, culture, religion and origin – Healthy and safe workplaces – Advancement and development of each employee – High readiness to act and personal responsibility – Entrepreneurial thinking and actions With the signing of a social charter in 2001, Wienerberger formally confirmed its intention Wienerberger Social to work toward employment and working conditions in all Group companies that meet or exceed Charter guarantees fair working conditions national law or collective bargaining agreements. The company is also committed to compliance with the recommendations of the International Labor Organization (ILO), which include the prohibition of child labor and discrimination, respect for the freedom of association and the right to collective negotiations as well as the provision of safe working conditions. The Wienerberger corporate culture influences the actions and behavior of our employees. Corporate culture Our common goal is to provide people with a better quality of life through our outstanding, as success factor sustainable building material and infrastructure solutions. Expertise, passion, integrity and respect, customer orientation, entrepreneurship, quality and responsibility are the seven key factors for Wienerberger’s business success. We see the know-how of our employees as one of the most important sources of innovation “ideas & more” and the further development of existing products. In order to better utilize this potential, we to better utilize our employees’ have anchored the subject in business and work processes. The “ideas & more” internet platform potential was launched to give employees an opportunity to support the development process by sub­mitting their suggestions for improvement and their ideas for innovation. 19 Processes and Instruments for Sustainable Human Resources Management Employee development The focal point of human resources management at Wienerberger is the support and develand support as central opment of all employees in line with the Group’s strategic goals. The responsibilities of human responsibility of human resources resources include employee recruiting, international know-how transfer and exchange, talent management and succession planning, training and education platforms, appropriate compensation and bonus systems, occupational safety, internal communication and industrial relations as well as the socially responsible reduction of jobs in connection with restructuring programs. In all these areas, human resources also serves as a contact partner and advisor for employees. Succession planning Strategic succession planning represents a central challenge for sustainable human resources as part of annual management. An annual management review focuses on the evaluation of senior managers and management review succession planning for senior management positions. Wienerberger maintains a management database to provide fast access to records on the training, professional experience, salary structure and service contracts of the respective employees. This database, which covered roughly 90 men and women in 2012, supports structured and transparent career planning. SHE reporting The Safety, Health & Education (SHE) reporting system was introduced throughout the Group in 2007. This system collects quarterly data from all local Wienerberger companies on the size of the workforce, occupational safety, days lost through illness as well as training and development. The resulting indicators provide management with the necessary tools for analysis and the development of appropriate measures in the areas of occupational safety, health and training. Wienerberger safety The improvement of workplace safety in all its plants is an important goal for Wienerberger. standards In this connection, the following safety standards were implemented in 2009: 1. Introductory safety training program for all employees 2. Appointment of an occupational safety officer 3. Increased awareness for occupational safety 4. Personal protective equipment for each employee 5. Safety introduction and protective equipment for visitors 6. Regular safety training programs 7. Establishment of a working group in each plant and quarterly safety meetings 8. Plant safety audits 9. Monitoring of workplace conduct 10. Mandatory accident reporting Implementation through Wienerberger’s safety initiative provides the framework for realizing these goals. The related safety initiative investments, i.e. the purchase of protection equipment, have already been completed. Employees are now receiving special training to increase their awareness of occupational safety and change their behavior over the long-term to prevent accidents. These training programs are organized by the local companies. Progress in the area of occupational safety is monitored by SHE reporting at the Group level, which allows for the identification and implementation of additional measures as needed. 20 Wienerberger AG Employees Sustainability Report 2012 Processes and Instruments Employment Trends The following statistics include Steinzeug-Keramo beginning in 2011 and Pipelife for the full 12 months of 2012. A different method was used to calculate the number of employees, and explanations are provided in footnotes at the relevant sections. Employment Trends Number of Employees The average number of employees in the Wienerberger Group rose by 10% year-on-year to 10% workforce increase 13,060 in 2012. The Bricks & Tiles Europe and North America Divisions reported workforce in 2012 due to initial consolidation of Pipelife reductions due to the weaker development of business and resulting restructuring measures, while the number of employees doubled in the Pipes & Pavers Europe Division. This strong increase is explained, above all, by the takeover of Pipelife during the reporting period.

The conclusion of the first measures at year-end 2010 was followed by brief 1,213 stabilization in the workforce, but the necessary implementation of further restructuring measures in 2012 caused another rise in turnover. In spite of this development, the average length of service equals a relatively long 12.9 years and represents a clear vote of confidence by employees in favor 736 of their employer. 12.3 10.6 A detailed analysis of employee turnover shows the different effects of the restructuring 7.5 programs on the individual divisions. The Bricks & Tiles Europe Division reported the largest increase, with turnover rising from 6.6% in 2011 to 10.3% in 2012. This development is explained, above all, by the higher number of employees leaving companies in the Bricks & Tiles Europe 2010 2011 2012 Division as a result of the increased restructuring measures. The Pipes & Pavers Europe Division Number of persons leaving remained stable in year-on-year comparison. The Holding and Others Division was the only Turnover rate in % segment to report a sharp drop in turnover of 5 percentage points to 9.3% in 2012, which reflected the lack of involvement in restructuring measures. The employee turnover rate for the Wienerberger Group rose from 7.5% to 10.6% in 2012, above all due to the higher turnover in the Bricks & Tiles Europe Division.

The remaining 803 employees included 669 men and 134 women (excl. the North America Division). A classification by age shows the following results: 180 of these employees were under 30 years of age; the largest decline (-454) was recorded in the age group of 30 to 50 years; and 169 employees over 50 years left the company. 22 Wienerberger AG Employees Sustainability Report 2012 Employment Trends Diversity and Equal Opportunity Diversity and Equal Opportunity The principles of sustainable human resources management at Wienerberger ensure that all No reports of employees have the same rights and opportunities independent of age, gender, culture, religion, discrimination since start of data collection origin and political views. Wienerberger does not tolerate any form of discrimination whatsoever. Since the start of data collection by HR local management on possible discrimination, no such incidents were reported. Gender Wienerberger traditionally has a high share of male employees because of its concentration Share of women rose on production (heavy industry). Special efforts are therefore in progress to increase the share of slightly in 2012 women, above all in non-production areas, e.g. administration, sales and management. One of the implemented measures involves preferential treatment for women in new appointments when candidates’ qualifications are identical. The share of women in senior management for the AL 20 20 GO Wienerberger Group currently equals 8%, and the goal is to increase this indicator to 20%i iby 2020. The share of women rose slightly in all functions during 2012 to 13.7% at year-end (2011: 12.6%). We want to increase the share of women to more than 45% in administrativei AL 20 20 GO ifunctions and to 30% in sales functions by 2020.

In 2012 58% of the employees were between 30 and 50 years old, 11% were younger are between 30 and 50 years old than 30 years and 31% over 50 years. These indicators have not changed significantly in recent years. We are particularly interested in the training and education of young people. In Bricks & Tiles Germany we increased the number of apprenticeships by nearly 20% in 2012 and are planning a further increase in 2013. 23 Cultural Diversity Corporate cultural As a multinational corporation, Wienerberger believes in respect for local cultures and the identity strengthened by support of diversity. We see regionally recruited teams as an important success factor, not least regional appointments because of the local nature of our products and markets. Our human resources planning is therefore directed to the employment of local workers, plant supervisors and managers to ensure that the Group viewpoint also includes a focus on the local markets and regions. Job rotations strengthen the internationality of Group management and allow for better insight and new perspectives in many areas. This cultural diversity and these decentralized structures have a positive influence on Wienerberger’s corporate cultural identity. Occupational Safety and Health Safety initiative Wienerberger acknowledges its responsibility to provide safe working conditions and to focused on increased protect the health of employees. A safety initiative was launched in 2010 to ensure the impleawareness and change in behavior mentation of uniform safety standards throughout the Group in order to significantly reduce the number of accidents. In a number of companies, the program was initially connected with investments in protective equipment. The completion of this first important step has been followed by measures to create a greater awareness for safety among all employees and, through a change in working habits over the long-term, prevent accidents. As part of this process, the safety targets defined by the Group were broken down to the plant level in the individual regions. Specific safety targets are defined for each plant and must be reached within a defined time period. These goals are set in agreement with the respective plant managers and represent an element of variable remuneration. In addition to the legal regulations applicable in some countries, the Wienerberger safety standards call for the installation of an occupational safety committee, the assignment of responsibilities and the introduction of comprehensive training. A toolbox of successfully implemented, best practice examples is available to help the plant managers select the optimal measures to reach their goals. Occupational safety has top priority for Wienerberger. As part of our safety initiative, we continuously train our employees to create a greater awareness for this important issue. CHRISTOF DOMENIG (Deputy CEO Bricks & Tiles Europe Division) 24 Wienerberger AG Employees Sustainability Report 2012 Occupational Safety and Health SHE reporting records all accidents that lead to the loss of at least one working day. The most Decline in accident common cause of accidents is carelessness. Since the issue of safety was handled differently frequency from 20 in 2010 to 12 incidents throughout the Group prior to the start of the safety initiative, activities were initially directed per million hours to the countries and regions with the greatest potential for improvement. The commitment of worked in 2012 local management supported the fast implementation of recommended measures and led, in part, to a significant reduction in accidents, especially in Italy, Bulgaria and Romania. Both the frequency and severity of accidents have declined significantly in all divisions since 2010. We have made substantial progress in the area of occupational safety over recent years, but have still not reached our goal to completely avoid accidents. In a first step, we want to reduce the frequency ofi 20 AL 15 GO iaccidents to less than 10 per million hours worked by 2015. Accident frequency by operating segment 1) 2010 2011 2012 Bricks & Tiles Western Europe 27 22 17 Bricks & Tiles Eastern Europe 15 11 8 Bricks & Tiles Europe 23 19 14 Pipes & Pavers Western Europe 29 17 Pipes & Pavers Eastern Europe 20 13 7 Pipes & Pavers Europe 20 17 10 North America 4 4 3 Holding & Others 8 10 4 Wienerberger Group 20 17 12 1) Accident frequency: number of work accidents / number of hours worked x 1,000,000; including temporary employees and persons with limited employment contracts The Bricks & Tiles operations in Italy reduced the accident frequency from 52 in 2011 to 9 Bricks & Tiles Italy for the reporting year. This outstanding development resulted from the implementation of a strict cuts accident frequency from 52 to 9 safety management system. After an in-depth risk assessment, the initial problems were solved with safety investments, the posting of safety instructions in all production areas and intensive training courses on occupational safety. All Italian plants received the internationally recognized OHSAS 18001 certification in May 2012. Plans call for the immediate analysis of all future accidents in a personal discussion to prevent further incidents. The severity of accidents, which is measured as the number of days lost per million hours Decline in accidentworked, fell sharply from 470 in 2011 to 308 in 2012 for the entire Wienerberger Group. Only related days lost from 470 to 308 per million the North America Division recorded a slight year-on-year increase due to two severe accidents hours worked that resulted from carelessness. Despite these positive developments at the Group level, two tragic fatal accidents unfortunately occurred during the reporting year. Industrial accidents at a brick plant in Belgium and a concrete paver plant in Romania resulted in the death of two employees. We immediately investigated the reasons and made the information available to all plants to prevent similar accidents in the future. 25 Accident severity by operating segment 1) 2010 2011 2012 Bricks & Tiles Western Europe 555 472 396 Bricks & Tiles Eastern Europe 588 584 385 Bricks & Tiles Europe 566 507 393 Pipes & Pavers Western Europe 427 402 Pipes & Pavers Eastern Europe 481 699 148 Pipes & Pavers Europe 481 632 240 North America 95 76 100 Holding & Others 330 103 4 Wienerberger Group 496 470 308 1) Severity of accidents: accident-related days lost / number of hours worked x 1,000,000; including temporary employees and persons with limited employment contracts STOP TM , an accident Pipelife has followed a zero accident strategy for many years. One of the most important prevention instrument measures to reach this goal is STOP TM (Safety Training Observation Program), a program that for Pipelife plants supports accident prevention. Employees use STOP cards to identify hazards and report occupational safety issues to the responsible managers. The entire workforce is therefore actively involved in eliminating potential dangers. These measures are intended to sustainably improve working conditions and reduce the frequency of accidents, while also creating a better awareness among employees for safe behavior. Future project “Safety Semmelrock announced plans to launch a new safety program “Safety at Semmelrock” in at Semmelrock” mid-2013. Work on the first goals started before the official kick-off and includes, above all, the implementation of the AIRS reporting system (“Accident Investigation Report Semmelrock”) to centrally document, analyze and administer all accidents and incidents in the future. Annual safety Steinzeug-Keramo has reduced accidents with annual safety training programs that are coaching and training specifically designed for each workplace as well as an additional offering of courses on occupational at Steinzeug-Keramo safety and accident prevention. Health protection The Wienerberger Group offers regular physical examinations and vaccination campaigns to measures prevent illness. Employees can call on company medical staff and arrange for ergonomic workplace analyses. Support for fitness is also important. For example, events and outings for employees in Austria are frequently connected with sporting activities. Other measures include reduced fees for health club memberships and special exercise courses to prevent vertebral problems. Average of 10.6 sick-leave The average number of sick-leave days equaled 10.6 days per employee in 2012. This indicator days per employee remained within the range of 9.9 and 11.4 days that is based on the data collected since 2007. 26 Wienerberger AG Employees Sustainability Report 2012 Occupational Safety and Health Sick-leave days per employee by operating segment 1) 2010 2011 2012 Bricks & Tiles Western Europe 10.3 10.9 11.2 Bricks & Tiles Eastern Europe 10.1 9.0 9.2 Bricks & Tiles Europe 10.3 10.3 10.6 Pipes & Pavers Western Europe 9.4 10.0 Pipes & Pavers Eastern Europe 8.0 10.5 11.9 Pipes & Pavers Europe 8.0 10.1 11.0 Holding & Others 3.8 3.8 3.6 Total, excluding North America 9.9 10.1 10.6 North America 2) 2.2 2.6 3.0 1) Including temporary employees as well as persons with limited employment contracts 2) Analysis limited by special local legal regulations (on sick-leave days) Protection against Respirable Crystalline Silica In the Wienerberger Group, only the employees in the ceramic plants are exposed to Protection against ­respirable crystalline silica. The protection of these employees has top priority, whereby our goals respirable crystalline silica are to minimize the respirable crystalline silica emissions from brick production and create an increased awareness of the need for careful handling. The central office at the EU level is the European social dialogue between employees and employers under the direction of the European Commission, in which Wienerberger has been active for many years. The EU has collected comprehensive data on respirable crystalline silica from the involved NEPSI (Negotiation branches in all member states since 2008. This survey is conducted every two years through Platform on Silica) used for EU surveys NEPSI (Negotiation Platform on Silica), a shared online platform. There was no survey conducted in 2012, but the results of the latest survey can be found in our 2011 sustainability update, which is available for download on our homepage. The NEPSI system collects data, among others, on potential dangers to employees, health controls, training, the implementation of organizational measures, the distribution and use of protective equipment (e.g. the mandatory use of protective equipment) and technical measures such as the enclosure of involved production lines. Wienerberger collects relevant data on all involved Group plants that are located in the EU. The issue of respirable crystalline silica emissions not only concerns our plants in the EU Annual internal survey but all our production facilities, and we have consequently started to implement the NEPSI planned in future standard at other plant locations. Data has been collected to date from 84% of the Wienerberger AL 20 20 plants, and the goal is to reach a coverage rate of over 95% by 2020. Future plans include GO the collection of data for the NEPSI survey as well as annual internal surveys through a separate query system. This should further improve transparency at the Group level. As announced in the previous year, the data in next year‘s sustainability report will also cover Norway, the plants in the USA and Steinzeug-Keramo. 27 Training and Personnel Development Training 12.8 training hours At Wienerberger, we believe in advancing and supporting our employees as well as creating per employee a climate that encourages the cross-border exchange of knowledge. An average of 12.8 hours per employee was spent on training in 2012. This indicator includes both internal and external programs, but excludes on-the-job training. The number of training hours per employee declined in the Bricks & Tiles Europe Division due to the end of the Sales Academy program. In the Holding & Others Division, cost reduction measures led to a decline in the number of training hours. In particular, the use of external training courses was substantially reduced during the reporting year. This cutback is also reflected in the total number of training hours for the Group. Average training costs The average training costs per employee equaled € 257 in 2012, compared with € 285 in of € 257 per employee 2011. The decline in this indicator resulted from an increase in the internal training offering as well as a reduction in the total training hours per employee.

One of our key corporate goals is to intensify our and sales activities marketing and sales activities, and thereby strengthen our customer ties. In order to provide the best possible support for making this goal reality, the Sales Academy training offensive was launched in 2010. The program is designed to strengthen and improve selling activities in the local organizations through the creation of a know-how network and the international exchange of ideas. 28 Wienerberger AG Employees Sustainability Report 2012 Personnel Development The Bricks & Tiles Division also offers other internal and external training programs that Engineering Academy: give employees an opportunity to continue their professional and personal development. Of special training and international exchange of know-how note is the Wienerberger Engineering Academy, which was established as a permanent facility to by engineering personnel provide internal training in various technical areas and thereby create a sustainable competitive advantage in production. The academy offers different programs: basic modules, the Engineering Academy Advanced and the Plant Manager Course. In the basic modules, our experts transfer their international know-how on raw materials, processing, drying and firing technology as well as quality analysis to engineering employees. The Engineering Academy Advanced was developed in 2010 as a platform for the exchange of information between experienced and younger engineers on strategic issues such as plant and process optimization as well as energy and cost efficiency. In the Plant Manager Course, key employees from the production area are provided with general training. The main focal points include process optimization, basic financial management and personal development. The design of the modules for the plant manager course is also based on international know-how exchange and networking. We believe in the development and advancement of our employees. Through specially designed programs and individual measures, we support targeted development steps. MAREN FELLNER (Corporate HR Manager) A number of cross-divisional training measures were also implemented in recent years. Ready4Excellence: Together with parts of the Pipes & Pavers Division, a four-module Ready4Excellence program for training and international know-how transfer international key people was launched in May 2012 with 22 colleagues from 12 Wienerberger countries. This program is designed to communicate content and instruments based on Wienerberger’s requirements. Its objective is to support international professionalization – above all with respect to instruments and processes – and ensure targeted support for the implementation of the Wienerberger strategy. Other topics include communications and familiarization with our feedback philosophy to support personal growth and the continuous development of the corporate culture. The knowledge transfer from these modules is not only interesting for Wienerberger employees, but also for non-company persons. For this reason, Wienerberger ­allocated three places in last year’s program to the aid organization Concordia, which provides shelter for homeless children in Romania, Bulgaria and the Republic of Moldavia. 29 Pipelife Business School, The Pipes & Pavers Division also offers training programs that concentrate on specific probPipelife University and lems related to plastic pipes. The Pipelife Business School is a one-year training program that Pipeschool covers modules on management, communications, project management, self-management and finance. Selected Pipelife employees are given an opportunity to expand their knowledge in these areas and to apply this know-how in specific projects. In addition, the Pipelife University L6S and the Pipelife Pipeschool are open to all employees. L6S is a training course for employees who are involved in the implementation of Lean Six Sigma. This well-known management system is focused on the delivery of qualitatively faultless products and services that completely and ­profitably meet customers’ needs. The Pipelife Pipeschool is an online learning platform that offers lessons on general Pipelife subjects, Pipelife products, 5S and visual management. Personnel Development and Succession Planning Talent management The structures and processes for professional talent management in the Wienerberger Group to identify and advance were defined during 2012, and the first specific measures have already been implemented. The future managers goal of this program is to identify and develop qualified men and women for positions in key management functions. In this way motivated employees with suitable potential receive an opportunity for further development, while Wienerberger is able to fill management positions internally and also maintain its high management standards. In recent years, many graduates of the previous Ambassador Program have assumed managerial roles or key positions in local companies. Annual assessment Personnel development also includes annual appraisals of all employees as well as the annual of all employees management review. The latter serves to evaluate senior management and supports strategic and support for international mobility succession planning for positions at this level. International mobility is promoted by means of corresponding expatriate packages and comprehensive support on relevant issues by the local HR departments and corporate HR. Satisfied employees The wide range of measures implemented in the areas of training and personnel development as key success factor plays an important role in establishing and maintaining employee satisfaction. Well-trained and satisfied employees are a key success factor for Wienerberger. Employee satisfaction is also reflected in the relatively high average length of service – 12.9 years – which represents a clear vote of con­f idence by employees in favor of their employer. 30 Wienerberger AG Employees Sustainability Report 2012 Personnel Development Remuneration Industrial Relations Remuneration The Wienerberger Social Charter states that employees are entitled to receive wages, salaries Income that provides and benefits in line with the normal payment for similar jobs in similar branches or industrial a secure livelihood sectors in the region where the work is performed and that this remuneration should be sufficient to provide for a secure livelihood. Our employees are paid at or above the legal minimum wage or the minimum income defined by applicable collective bargaining agreements. Management compensation at Wienerberger includes both a fixed and a variable component Long-term to increase motivation and strengthen identification with corporate goals. The variable component remuneration model for top management is based on short-term remuneration as well as mediumto long-term remuneration within the framework defined by the long-term incentive (LTI) program. The short-term variable component for 2013 will be paid out over two years, whereby the second payment is dependent on the attainment of an additional goal. This modus strengthens the link between the short-term bonus and sustainable management. Additional information on the remuneration model is provided in our 2012 annual report (annualreport.wienerberger.com). A group-wide guideline forms the basis for local incentive systems. Local circumstances­ Group-wide guideline (e.g. government minimum support programs) are taken into account and the rules are adapted for design of local incentive systems to meet the respective market conditions. In addition to company pension plans, disability ­insurance and health insurance, the Wienerberger employees and managers are also covered by travel ­insurance. Industrial Relations The Wienerberger Social Charter was signed in 2001 by the Managing Board of Wienerberger Wienerberger AG and the chairman of the European Employees’ Council in Strasburg to formally confirm the Social Charter company’s intent to comply with the relevant agreements and recommendations of the International Labor Organization (ILO). With this charter, Wienerberger demonstrates its global ­commitment, among others, to human rights, to sufficient remuneration, against excessive working hours, to permanent employment and to respect for the freedom of association and the right to collective negotiations. The European Employees’ Council was founded in 2011 on the basis of the European Forum, Installation of a social partnership board. It addresses European issues such as strategy, investments, reorganizaEuropean Employees’ Council in 2011 tion and rationalization measures. The goals of the European Employees’ Council are constructive social dialogue and the creation of networks for employees’ representation committees. Currently, 10 countries are represented by 26 delegates. The steering committee of the European Employees’ Council is headed by Karl Sauer and includes five elected delegates from Austria, the Netherlands, Germany and Poland. The European Employees’ Council meets twice and its managing board at least twice per year. Appropriate adjustments to the European Employees’ Council are planned to reflect the acquisition of Pipelife. 31 Improvement of The most important objectives of the European Employees’ Council are to improve workplace workplaces and conditions and health protection. Another concern is to reduce the physical burden for older health protection employees as a result of the increasing retirement age by providing jobs that require less physical labor. This has already been realized at some Wienerberger locations. The European Employees’ Council also works to achieve fair and just remuneration. National employees’ In Austria, for example, employees’ councils have been installed at all locations. There are councils based on 54 employee representatives. These representatives elect a central council, which consists of four Austrian example persons and is headed by Karl Sauer. Elections for the employee representatives and the central council are held every four years. The employee representatives hold one conference each year, while the central council meets at least four times or more often as needed. Similar structures can be found in other European countries. Company agreements, Different regulations apply to employees in Europe, including collective bargaining agreecollective agreements ments, laws and directives, union contracts and company or individual employment agreements. or at least legal requirements All employee representatives of Wienerberger AG are located in countries that recognize the right of employees to free assembly and collective negotiations. Future Measures Implementation of Group-wide HR standards will be introduced in order to ensure uniform practices. In Group-wide HR ­addition, talent management and the training programs for sales management will be expanded. standards Respirable crystalline Plans for 2013 include the annual collection of relevant data on respirable crystalline silica silica: internal survey with a separate query system to further increase transparency at the Group level. system in addition to NEPSI and integration Additionally, as announced in the previous year, the survey on respirable crystalline silica will be of further plants expanded f­or the 2013 sustainability report to cover the plants in Norway and the USA as well as Steinzeug-Keramo. Further measures to Additional measures will also be implemented to improve workplace health and safety. improve workplace Among others, Semmelrock is expected to launch its new program “Safety at Semmelrock” in safety mid-2013. Data collection in the plants will then be used to design future measures and start specially designed safety programs. Specific long-term goals Wienerberger has set a number of long-term goals in the area of human resources: to increase for the future the share of women by 2020 to 20% in the Group’s senior management, to more than 45% in administrative functions and to 30% in sales functions, to reduce the accident frequency to less than 10 per million hours worked by 2015 and to expand data collection on respirable crystalline silica to cover more than 95% of the relevant Group plants by 2020. 32 Wienerberger AG Employees Sustainability Report 2012 Future Measures Environmental Protection in Production Principles Environmental Protection in Production Principles of Sustainable Production Environmental protection in production is a matter of great importance to Wienerberger. Production in harmony We are well aware that industrial production processes always involve a certain degree of interferwith the environment ence with the natural environment. Our goal is to minimize the environmental impact of our production processes. The responsible interaction with clay extraction sites, the best possible conservation of resources and an increase in the share of recycling materials are the central ­principles of our sustainable production. The use of recyclable raw materials and the responsible interaction with clay extraction Responsible clay sites: The methods used by Wienerberger to extract and process clay, the recyclable raw material extraction and professional restoration that is used for our ceramic products, are designed to minimize the impact on the environment of mining sites and to conserve resources. Responsible interaction with clay mining sites means preventing negative effects on neighboring residents during extraction (in the form of noise or dust) as well as protecting the environment (e.g. by maintaining local biodiversity). The clay reserves in our extraction sites are used to the greatest extent possible. Responsible interaction with clay ­extraction sites at the end of their useful life means professional restoration – often in cooperation with environmental NGOs like the WWF – or transfer to another use. Specifically designed restoration concepts allow for the ecologically friendly utilization of exhausted clay pits and often help to increase biodiversity. Greatest possible conservation of resources: The conservation of resources starts at the Resource conservation beginning of the production chain. Our ceramic plants generally process local raw materials like in the production of ceramic products … clay, loam and sand. Since the clay pits are usually located close to our production facilities, transport routes tend to be short. The use of these resources is optimized continuously, while product quality is maintained or improved at the same time. These results are achieved, for example, with the use of recycled ceramic materials. Another important resource for the ceramic production process is energy, which generates the high temperatures required for drying and firing. We work to make these processes as environmentally compatible as possible by optimizing our production technology and using renewable energy sources. Resource conservation is also a focal point in the production of our plastic pipes. We work … as well as plastic pipes to reduce product weight and increase the share of recycling materials in the mix, while maintaining the same high level of quality. Energy consumption plays a less important role in the production of plastic pipes than in our ceramic business. However, a comparatively large amount of water is required to cool this production machinery. Our goal is to minimize water ­consumption, above all the amount of water drawn from public supply networks. 33 Processes and Instruments for Sustainable Production Research and development R&D in production Research and development (R&D) form an integral part of strategic planning at Wienerberger is a focus of and represent key activities for the Group. In these areas we work to optimize production processes strategic planning and to continuously improve and develop our products and system solutions. R&D at Wienerberger is managed centrally in the individual business units, but implemented locally based on close cooperation between the various R&D departments and on-site management and engineers. This ensures the fast and efficient rollout of successful developments throughout the Group. In 2012 R&D expenditures in the Wienerberger Group amounted to € 9.0 million. Process optimization The improvement of production processes represents the main focus of research for our to improve sustainability ceramic products. A central engineering department is working, above all, on projects to reduce of ceramic products energy consumption. Drying and firing comprise a significant amount of the energy requirements for our production, and many assignments therefore concentrate on optimization in this area. Other research projects involve resource conservation in production, the responsible processing of raw materials and the use of recycled materials. Use of recycling R&D activities for plastic pipes are located at our research center in the Netherlands, which materials and reduction works together with universities and external experts from various disciplines. Research is concenin weight of plastic pipes trated on the refinement of formulas for the raw material mix and the optimization of the production process. Our production-related projects target the increased use of recycled products as raw materials and the reduction of product weight. Research projects for our concrete pavers are focused on the composition of raw material mixtures and, above all, on the reduction of the cement content. Environmental Management Ecologically relevant The environmentally relevant aspects of our workplaces, e.g. the management of waste and aspects in QMS residual materials or the prevention of noise and dust emissions, were integrated in the existing quality management systems (QMS). The QMSs in nearly all plants are certified according to ISO 9001. The criteria defined in the QMS form the starting point for the demands on production and the related processes. Environmental officers ensure the implementation of the relevant standards. A number of plants have been certified according to ISO 14001, but there are no plans for additional Group-wide certification under ISO 14001 or EMAS. Wienerberger believes t­ he current QMS provides appropriate control and management for processes and their en­viron­mental impact. Technical Controlling System Production data A technical controlling system has been implemented in all production areas of the collected by technical Wienerberger Group. This system collects the production-related data required for controlling controlling system activities and internal benchmarking among the plants. Statistics are compiled on production volumes, product quality, machine efficiency, energy consumption and, if relevant, CO2 emissions. The resulting analyses indicate the effectiveness of measures implemented to reduce the environmental impact of our production processes. 34 Wienerberger AG Environmental Protection Sustainability Report 2012 in Production Processes and Instruments Key Data Key Data on Sustainable Production Energy Consumption The key data presented in this sustainability report were adjusted to reflect the new c­ orporate structure. The following statistics therefore cover the entire Wienerberger Group, including our pipe activities. This data includes our ceramic pipe activities starting in 2011 and our plastic pipe activities beginning in June 2012.

This development resulted, above all, from declined by 13% a decline in natural gas consumption. Natural gas is used primarily in ceramic production to generate the high temperatures required for the firing process. The decline in the use of natural gas during 2012 can be explained by a 9% volume decrease in the Bricks & Tiles Europe Division and an improvement in specific energy consumption in the clay block, clay roof tile and ceramic pipe product groups. We are currently working on projects to identify other energy sources as substitutes for coal and heating oil in order to reduce CO2 emissions and costs. The slight rise in electricity consumption resulted from the initial consolidation of Pipelife, where the production process is driven almost entirely by electrical energy. Renewable energy sources as a share of total electricity consumption declined from 43% in the prior year to 31% in 2012 due to the inclusion of the pipe business.

This is a very ambitious target, since we have already reduced energy consumption significantly during the past 10 to 15 years. We have made sound progress in clay block, roof tile and ceramic pipe production in recent years, but our efforts in the facade brick area are just beginning. CO2 Emissions Data collection on CO2 emissions is based on the method defined by the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS system), which only records direct CO2 emissions. Accordingly, only the CO2 emissions from our ceramic production (bricks and ceramic pipes) are relevant. The CO2 emissions from primary energy sources change in line with energy consumption, while the emissions from the production process result from raw materials and in the case of clay blocks from the use of pore-forming agents. Electrical energy is used in the production of plastic pipes and concrete pavers, and the related CO2 emissions are attributable to the electric power producer.

The most extraction and important raw material for our ceramic products (clay blocks, facing bricks, roof tiles and ceramic professional restoration of mining sites pipes) is the recyclable raw material clay. Wienerberger places high value on protecting endangered animal and plant species as well as rare, sensible ecosystems. The greatest possible conservation of resources in clay extraction is just as important as the expert restoration of former clay mining sites. There are generally several possible alternatives for the restoration of clay pits, e.g. conversion for agricultural use, residential or commercial construction, nature conservation or use as recreational areas. Wienerberger works to return former clay mining sites to nature wherever possible, since these restored areas often become substitute habitats for protected animal and plant species that would otherwise be lost. Short transport routes Since the clay pits are usually located close to our production facilities, transport routes tend from clay pits to plants to be short. After extraction, the clay is prepared through a grinding and milling process. Water, sand and, for some products, pore-forming agents (e.g. sawdust, paper fiber) are then added. Wienerberger has issued a group-wide guideline for the use of additives. It ensures that our plants only use additives that meet local environmental requirements and applicable health and legal regulations. Drying and firing process After brief storage in a mud house, the clay is ready for shaping. It is pressed through dies into the desired shape by extruders or compressed into forms. The cut products are then transported on palettes to the dryer. The drying process removes the moisture from the soft products and prepares them for firing. Depending on the type of the product, the drying period lasts between four and 45 hours. The moisture content drops to below 2% during this time. After drying the products are transferred to a kiln, where they are fired at a temperature of 800 to 1,200°C over a period of six to 36 hours. The drying and firing time can be longer for technically demanding products. Firing gives the products a permanent strength and makes them permanently nonflammable and fire-safe. In packaging our products, we use particularly thin foils. Transport routes to our customers are short because of our regional, decentralized plant network, which also reduces the impact of our business on the environment. Energy Consumption and CO2 Emissions Thermal energy is used Most of the energy used in ceramic production is thermal energy (natural and liquid gas, oil for drying and firing or coal). This energy is used mainly to heat the tunnel kilns, whereby the heat released during the cooling process is recovered and returned to the drying process. Electrical energy plays only a limited role in ceramic production (e.g. to mix and prepare the raw materials, for extrusion and grinding and in transportation). 38 Wienerberger AG Environmental Protection Sustainability Report 2012 in Production Ceramic Production Energy consumption was lower in 2012, in part because of the decline in production volumes. Pilot projects for However, we also implemented a number of measures to optimize the dryer-kiln-heat system substitution of fossil energy sources and thereby reduced the specific energy consumption for clay block, roof tile and ceramic pipe production. We are also working to substitute alternative fuels for fossil energy sources. A biogas plant was built near one of our ceramic pipe plants, which is fueled with biomass from the surrounding area. This biogas is used to operate a combined heat and power station, and the residual heat is used to dry the clay pipes. At our plant in India, we converted part of our energy sources to biomass during the reporting year, and in Italy and Germany we are using electrical energy generated by our own photovoltaic equipment. In Switzerland and the USA we are gradually replacing heating oil and coal with natural gas, which produces significantly lower CO2 emissions and is also less expensive. We have defined our goals for energy-efficient, environmentally compatible and resourceEnvironmental Action conserving production in an Environmental Action Plan (EAP). In particular, it includes our goal Plan defines measures to reduce energy to achieve a 20% reduction in specific energy consumption and specific CO2 emissions in ceramic consumption production by 2020. The core of the EAP is formed by a package of measures to optimize the drying and firing process, optimize the dryer-kiln-heat system, recover heat through the installation of heat exchangers, improve and target thermal insulation, reduce the water content of clay, cut production weight, optimize the raw material mixture, increase the use of biogenic fuels and use stretch foils in packaging. A program to implement these measures was launched at nine plants in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland during 2010. The EAP has since been rolled out to 51 plants and will be introduced at other Wienerberger locations in the future. We also invest continuously in technological optimization measures to make our production process as environmentally compatible as possible, above all through the use of renewable energy. Our measures to reduce the use of energy in ceramic production, above all through the optimization of the dryer-kiln-heat system, have already produced the first positive results and we now intend to implement this program at other plants in the future. JOSEF BIRNGRUBER (Head of Process Technology in the Bricks & Tiles Europe Division) Over the coming years these measures should help us to reach our ambitious goals – to Goal: 20% reduction in achieve a 20% reduction in specific energy consumption and specific CO2 emissions in ceramic indicators by 2020 production below the 2010 level by 2020. 39 Waste and Recycling Nearly all ceramic Nearly all the waste resulting from ceramic production is non-hazardous. It is separated, production waste collected and recycled or disposed. Hazardous waste appears in only very small quantities, e.g. is non-hazardous as workshop waste (oily rags). Recycling materials are Internal production scrap such as broken or imperfect products can be reprocessed and added to raw materials recycled and is therefore not classified as waste. External recycling materials are used as additives mixture for certain product groups and are generally processed together with the raw material mixture during preparation. Typical recycling materials from biogenic sources include sawdust, hay, sunflower seed shells and paper fiber, which are used to create the pores in clay blocks. In the production of ceramic pipes, we also use rock grain from gravel production and ceramic scrap from the production of clinkers, roof tiles, tiles and other ceramic products that cannot be recycled in these areas. We now use up to 40% ceramic recycling products in our raw material mixture for specific ceramic pipes. That makes an important contribution to resource efficiency. GERNOT SCHÖBITZ (CEO Steinzeug-Keramo) Clean separation of External recycling materials can only be used if they are separated correctly when buildings materials and awareness are demolished. Wienerberger works to increase the awareness of construction personnel for in construction industry are required for recycling recycling and plays an active role in designing a legal and normative framework that will make the use of recycled building materials easier and more economically feasible in the future. Our work is also focused on the recycling of construction rubble as an input for brick production, but also to develop new opportunities for its use (e.g. in landscaping). Water Consumption Recycling of water The use of fresh water and wastewater plays a limited role in the production of ceramic products – clay blocks, roof tiles, facing bricks and ceramic pipes. Many of the Wienerberger plants recycle their process wastewater. This water drains into a collecting tank, is subsequently processed and then reused for clay preparation. Evaporation loss is replaced from public water lines or plant wells. In 2012 the specific water consumption declined slightly in brick production and remained constant for ceramic pipes. 40 Wienerberger AG Environmental Protection Sustainability Report 2012 in Production Ceramic Production Plastic Pipe Production Plastic Pipe Production In the plastic pipe business, our most important raw materials include PVC, PP and PE PVC, PP and PE as granulates. We only use materials that do not represent a risk for the environment during the raw material granulates production, use or disposal of the pipes. No plasticizers are used. As a member of local initiatives like Responsible Care in Austria, we regularly evaluate the health, environmental and safety impact of our raw materials and products. The plastic raw materials are first mixed together to create the properties for a specific Materials are heated, product group and then heated. The melting process requires a temperature of approx. 200°C, then shaped with an extruder depending on the raw material mixture. The heating takes place directly in an extruder, which presses the hot moldable plastic mass through a die to shape the pipes. In the so-called casing head, a calibrator ensures the desired diameter, which can range from several millimeters up to 2.5 meters. The accessories for our pipes are shaped in forms after the raw materials are heated. After shaping, the pipes are cooled and hardened in a water bath. The continuous pipe string Cooling in water bath is then cut to the desired length, whereby a length of up to 600 meters can be produced for certain and final cutting of pipes applications. The pipes are then packed and delivered to the customer. A decentralized network of 27 plastic pipe plants in 27 countries positions us close to our customers and normally provides for short transport routes. Energy Consumption and CO2 Emissions Electricity is the main energy source for the production of plastic pipes. It is used to operate No direct CO 2 emissions the machinery and equipment and heat the granulates. There are no direct CO2 emissions from from plastic pipe production plastic pipe production, which is the reason our plastic pipe activities are not registered in the European Emissions Trading System. In 2012 we reduced the specific energy consumption in plastic pipes by 2% with the regular monitoring of energy consumption and optimization measures. At our plant in Turkey, transparent spaces were installed in the roof of the production hall. The resulting inflow of daylight generally eliminates the need for artificial light during the daytime. Waste and Recycling Waste plays only a limited role in the production of plastic pipes. More than 50% of this Waste plays only waste is recyclable, and is collected and reused. a limited role A major goal in the plastic pipe area is to increase the share of recycling products in the raw Goal: Increase in the materials mix. Our research center in the Netherlands is working on projects to increase the use share of recycling materials of secondary raw materials, while maintaining the same high product quality. The share of ­recycling materials per produced ton rose by 11% to approx. 60 kg in 2012. 41 Pipelife is collection point Recycling materials from external sources must first be collected and prepared. Through its for recycling materials membership in national associations, Pipelife plays an active role in creating a greater aware­­ness in Austria for the importance of recycling. The Pipelife plants in Austria, for example, serve as collec­t ­ing points for used pipes and fittings. The Austrian plastic pipe industry set a new record by collecting approx. 1,500 tons of used pipes. That represents CO2 savings of roughly 9.2 million auto­mobile kilometers. Water Consumption Cooling in closed Water plays an important role in the production of plastic pipes because it is used to cool water cycles the hot extruded products. Our plants generally use closed water cycles and heat exchangers, which prevent the cooling water from becoming contaminated. At a plant in Ireland, our location allows us to use river water in a closed cycle to cool the pipes. This water is returned to the river after the cooling process without any problem. Water is sourced mainly Pipelife uses water from its own wells or ponds (rainwater) whenever possible. Roughly 80% from company wells of the water used in production comes from these sources. In 2012 continuous optimization and ponds measures in the water cycle supported a 4% reduction in specific water consumption. We monitor our water consumption continuously and took a number of steps in 2012 to further reduce the use of external water supplies. ZORAN DAVIDOVSKI (Vice President Marketing, Innovation & Sustainability at Pipelife) Concrete Paver Production Cement, sand, rock grain Concrete is a moldable building product that is made of several basic natural raw materials: and water are most cement, sand, rock grain and water. Semmelrock purchases these raw materials from local important raw materials producers based on pre-defined quality standards. Pavers are dried at The first step in the production of concrete pavers is the mixing of the raw materials. Our room temperature research and development activities for the production area are focused on reducing the cement content. After mixing, the concrete is shaped by pressing or pouring. The products are then dried at room temperature over a period of roughly 24 hours. Certain products receive special surface treatment before or after the drying process, such as washing, grinding, sanding or sealing. The finished products are then packaged and delivered to our customers. 42 Wienerberger AG Environmental Protection Sustainability Report 2012 in Production Plastic Pipe Production Concrete Paver Production Future Measures Energy Consumption and CO2 Emissions The production process for our concrete pavers requires comparatively low amounts of energy No direct CO 2 emissions to drive the machinery. Electricity, which does not cause any direct CO2 emissions, is the only energy source used. Waste and Recycling Scrap from the production of concrete pavers is returned to production. Broken or imperfect Most waste is items can normally not be recycled. However, nearly all the waste from concrete paver production non-hazardous is non-hazardous and can be recycled or disposed. Water Consumption In the production of concrete pavers, water is used as a raw material and in special surface Water used as raw treatments (e.g. the washing of slabs). Semmelrock recycles part of the washing water into producmaterial and for surface treatment tion to minimize wastewater. Most of the plants have implemented a water management system, and our plans call for the step-by-step implementation of water management systems in all plants. Future Measures Plans for 2013 call for the even stronger integration of energy reporting in the SAP system Stronger integration to increase the automated collection of data. of energy reporting In the ceramics area, we will continue to roll out the measures defined in the Environmental Continued roll-out Action Plan to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The facing brick product group of measures to improve energy efficiency will represent a special focal point for the coming years. We want to make our production processes in ceramic production even more energy-efficient and increase resource conservation in the future. All ceramic pipe products will be certified according to the cradle to cradle concept in 2013. Cradle to cradle This underscores the continuous improvement of our production processes in the interest of certification for ceramic pipes sustainability. Numerous smaller measures will be implemented in the plastic pipe area over the coming Numerous smaller years, for example to gradually reduce energy consumption by insulating casing heads and thereby measures for plastic pipes preventing heat loss. We will also continue to invest in technological improvements that lead to an increase in energy efficiency. 43 Sustainable Products Principles of Sustainable Products Creation of sustainable A central principle of product development at Wienerberger is the creation of sustainable value with high-quality value for our customers with long-lasting and innovative system solutions. We view sustainability building material solutions as a function of the service life of a product and its impact on the environment during production, transport, installation, use and disposal. Wienerberger brick products form an integral part of sustainable building concepts. They guarantee a high quality of living and make an active contribution to climate protection. In the area of pipes and pavers we offer system solutions for today’s challenges, including the demands on water management resulting from climate change or increasing urbanization. Energy efficiency and Wienerberger’s innovative products and system solutions for bricks meet the wide variety of climate protection, challenges presented by modern, sustainable construction. As a recyclable product made of clay raw material efficiency, healthy living, safety and based on its long service life of up to 100 years, the brick – whether in the form of clay blocks, and economy as central roof tiles or facing bricks – meets today’s demands for ecological, economical and social sustaindemands on modern ability like no other building product. In the area of energy efficiency and climate protection, our brick construction high thermal insulating clay blocks help building users to reduce energy costs and CO2 emissions. Complete housing concepts also optimize energy efficiency over the entire product life cycle. Our high thermal insulating clay blocks filled with mineral wool or perlite already meet all EU requirements for 2020. We are continuously increasing the raw material efficiency of our products by optimizing their design to reduce the weight and the amount of materials required, while maintaining or improving the static and thermal insulating properties. Another focal point in this respect is the reduction of energy consumption in production. The high accumulation capacity of brick walls keeps rooms cool in the summer and pleasantly warm in the winter. Our bricks attain excellent values for interior air quality and a healthy room climate, and create lasting value in the form of high-quality, healthy homes. Another closely related subject is safety, an area where our products stand out by providing high protection against fire and earthquakes. In order to combine maximum quality and affordability, a special focus of our efforts is continuous improvement in the economy of our brick solutions. We work to reduce laying time and simplify construction with product innovation and systems. For example, our Dryfix ® aerosol glue reduces construction time by up to 50% compared with conventional masonry methods. 44 Wienerberger AG Sustainable Products Sustainability Report 2012 Principles Housing is a very long-term investment. For that reason, we should base construction on building materials with a long service life like our ceramic products. An analysis of housing in Belgium shows that over 20% of all brick homes are more than 100 years old. ANITA ORY (Sustainability Manager in Belgium) At Pipelife, our specialist for plastic pipe systems, the R&D and marketing departments work Outstanding mechanical closely together to meet customers’ needs with fast reaction times and short development periods. properties, high resistance to chemicals Our lightweight, flexible and easy to install pipes can be used in a wide variety of solutions for and protection against fresh water and wastewater management, residential construction, industrial facilities and public corrosion make plastic supply infrastructure. Outstanding mechanical properties like high pressure resistance, particupipes long-lasting and economical larly smooth surfaces and high resistance to many chemicals make these products especially long-lasting and economical. They are also absolutely corrosion-free. With solutions for water management (fresh water, wastewater and irrigation systems), energy supply, electrical wiring and telecommunications, Pipelife products and system solutions represent an integral part of the answers to the megatrends of the coming decades. Concrete pavers made by Semmelrock create lasting value with their variety, high resistance, Sustainable concrete durability and wide range of applications. Concrete is a moldable building material that is made paver products of natural raw materials – cement, sand, rock grain and water. Steinzeug-Keramo ceramic pipes also meet important demands for ecological and eco­nomical Ceramic pipe sustainability. Vitrified clay pipes have a service life of more than 100 years, are virtually mainsystems are suitable for trenchless tenance-free, retain their shape and are highly resistant to corrosive chemicals because of their installation and glaze. Vitrified clay pipes do not cause any reaction between the building section and the environmentally friendly surrounding earth or ground water, can be installed in an environmentally-friendly manner without trenches and are completely recyclable. Therefore, the use of ceramic pipe systems is extremely eco-friendly and economical. 45 System solutions The many diverse demands on modern buildings from users, developers and regulatory for energy-efficient requirements such as the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) have made the construction as competitive advantage systems approach a key focal point of construction. Integrated system solutions can optimally combine and utilize the outstanding properties of individual products in the Wienerberger portfolio with products from partners in building technology. iOur goal is to increase the share ofi 20 iGroup revenues generated by innovative and sustainable products from 20% in 2010 toi AL 15 GO i30% in 2015.i The share of revenues from the sale of premium products increased slightly in the Bricks & Tiles segment in 2012. On the Group level this key figure remained constant at 23.4% due to the initial consolidation of Pipelife, which shows a long-time share of revenue by­ innovative products of 20%. Processes and Instruments for Sustainable Product Development Research & Development Market-oriented Research and development (R&D) form an integral part of strategic planning at Wienerberger product development and represent key activities for the Group. In these areas we work to continuously improve and is focus of R&D develop our products and system solutions in all our application areas – from energy-efficient building concepts to environmentally compatible pavers and supply and sewerage systems. We want to protect and further expand our market positions through product innovation and move closer to the decision-makers in the construction process to support the timely exchange of information. Our research centers maintain an ongoing dialogue with universities and experts in various disciplines. Product development at Wienerberger is managed centrally in the individual business units, but is always market-oriented and therefore implemented in the individual countries. In addition to legal requirements and standards at the European or national level, a new product must harmonize with local building traditions. Product development must recognize cultural factors as well as the local cost structure of comparable construction methods and systems. Innovation as Result of Research and Development Product development Wienerberger operates three research centers for Bricks & Tiles that are specialized by and innovations product group: clay blocks, facing bricks and clay roof tiles. Our product management experts for bricks work closely with the various marketing and sales departments to ensure that new developments always meet the needs of our customers. One of the R&D focal points in 2012 was to minimize thermal conductivity and optimize the thermal insulating properties of clay blocks. These activities led to the creation of the new mineral wool-filled PTH 30 W.i. Objekt, which was developed especially for multi-story buildings. It combines low wall thickness to maximize usable space and high compressive strength with excellent thermal insulation. Wienerberger is also pursuing a “light brick” strategy for infill masonry. These clay blocks have 25% less weight, which reduces raw material, transport and energy costs and also increases the living space. Light bricks are used to fill the space between the load-bearing sections of a building and create a pleasant and healthy interior room climate. 46 Wienerberger AG Sustainable Products Sustainability Report 2012 Principles Processes and Instruments Resource efficiency represents the focus of product development for roof tiles. In 2012 Goal for new roof Wienerberger introduced a so-called FEM (finite element method) calculation for the ­optimization tiles: optimal resource efficiency of the geometry of roof tiles. Two models were successfully used in Switzerland during 2012, and a third model is currently being implemented. The goal is a 10% reduction in the weight of the roof tile with constant bending load bearing capacity, which will decrease raw material requirements and energy consumption and also optimize the transport weight. Development projects for TERCA facade solutions were concentrated primarily on renovaFacade developments tion in 2012. The responsible revitalization of existing buildings and the optimization of energy focused on solutions for renovation and efficiency are two important goals in this area. The development of the Eco-brick® or SlimBrick® space optimization product lines provides two-layer wall systems with higher thermal insulation and a maintenancefree service life for the facade over many decades. Ceramic facade boards for rear-ventilated facades from the ArGeTon® product line can be combined with a variety of other building ­materials and are particularly well-suited for multi-story residential construction. The special development ArGeLite® saves space and reduces the use of raw materials. R&D activities for plastic pipes are located at our research center in the Netherlands, which Product development works together with universities and external experts from various disciplines. Research is concenand innovation for plastic pipes trated on the development of new products as well as the refinement of formulas for the raw material mix. One recent development by Pipelife is the Halovolt Low Friction EMC, an electrical installation pipe that minimizes electromagnetic radiation in the immediate surroundings. This solution sets a new environmentally friendly and healthy standard for public and private buildings. Pipelife is also a leader in the development and production of oversized pipes (LLLD pipes) with a length of up to 600 meters and a diameter of up to 2.5 meters for industrial applications. Special products in the Soluforce Heavy line are used in high pressure applications by the oil and gas industry. Steel wire reinforcement and high corrosion resistance make these pipes long-lasting, more resource-efficient and economical. The special plastic liner can also withstand a wide variety of aggressive chemicals and handle the safe collection and drainage of toxic waste water. The optimization of technical properties represents the focal point of R&D for ceramic pipes. Ceramic jacking pipes One result is the development of ceramic jacking pipes that are suitable for trenchless installation. allow for trenchless installation The pipes are inserted into a starting shaft and then pushed to the target shaft by means of a tunneling machine. This procedure allows the pipes to be installed with only minimal earth movements and without disturbing the existing infrastructure. Steinzeug-Keramo set a milestone in 2012 by installing the first ceramic jacking pipe in a curve drive for a project in Singapore. This technique can also be used to replace existing pipelines without digging new trenches. 47 Development of surface Research projects for concrete pavers are directed to improving the surface designs and structures to extend developing new technologies for the surface structure to extend the service life and increase service life and improve economy product economy. Semmelrock Premium Protect ®, a special surface shield, seals the stones and thereby provides for long-lasting color protection and easy maintenance, even on areas that are exposed to heavy soiling. Einstein®, an innovative jointing system, was developed to meet the high demands on heavily trafficked areas. This fully interlocking system with integrated protection against shifting prevents the paved areas from displacing, tilting or warping, even under high stress. Our innovative surface treatments create modern and attractive paver solutions, and also extend the service life of our products. ROBERT F. HOLZER (CEO Semmelrock) Wienerberger System Solutions Combining the outstanding properties of individual products into specially designed system solutions for the many diverse demands on modern construction is one of the central challenges for Wienerberger as an application-oriented and innovative building materials producer. e4-Brickhouse 2020 The e4-Brickhouse: The building concept for the e4-Brickhouse 2020, which includes all Wienerberger product a leading and groups, illustrates the principle of a complete system solution. In the Lower Austrian town of comprehensive concept for the affordable home Zwettl, Wienerberger is demonstrating this principle in practice. A family of four moved into the of the future first e4-Brickhouse 2020 during 2012 – a home that already meets all requirements of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 2020, which requires all buildings constructed after 2020 to have a positive energy balance. The e4-Brickhouse The e4-Brickhouse 2020 produces more energy than it uses during a year, which results in has a positive CO 2 a positive CO2 and energy balance. Experts have calculated that 33,600 kg of CO2 can be saved and energy balance with this house by 2020. The heart of the e4-Brickhouse 2020 is a thermal building shell made of high thermal insulating POROTHERM W.i. bricks that are filled with mineral wool and, in monolithic construction, can reach a U-value of ≤ 0.13 W/m 2K on the exterior wall (including plaster). The plane ground bricks are laid with the time-saving Dryfix® system, an aerosol masonry glue that makes fast masonry work possible at temperatures down to -5°C. The wall temperation heating system developed together with Pipelife creates a pleasant room climate and leads to lower energy consumption by reducing heating requirements (see below). The exterior walls are covered with TERCA facade bricks and ArGeTon® brick slabs. Semmelrock supplied the concrete pavers for the outside areas. The products from our Koramic line create a long-lasting, attractive appearance of the roof and additionally cover more than 100% of the electricity requirements with photovoltaic equipment from our offering of complete solutions. 48 Wienerberger AG Sustainable Products Sustainability Report 2012 System Solutions Brick Wall Temperation The high accumulation capacity of brick walls keeps rooms cool in the summer and pleasantly Energy savings warm in the winter. As a system solution combining plastic pipes and clay blocks the brick wall and a healthier room climate with brick temperation manages and increases this effect. The brick wall is thermally activated by an intewall temperation grated pipe system. The air temperature can be reduced by increasing the surface temperature of the wall, without impairing the perceived room temperature. This can result in energy savings of up to 20% compared with convector heating. The lower interior air temperature increases the humidity in the room and reduces dust convection, which has a positive influence on the health of the building users. Three pilot projects were realized with this newly developed wall heating system in 2012, one of which is the e4-Brickhouse 2020. RaineoTM ends Flooding in Inner City Areas Climate change and the increasing development of green areas have led to a growing incidence System solution of flooding in inner city areas. With RaineoTM , Pipelife has developed an extremely efficient to prevent flooding in inner city areas system to solve this problem. It is installed underground and creates the necessary space for rainwater to drain off quickly. The system covers collection, preparation, storage and recycling or the diversion and disposal of the water. The heart of the system is the so-called “Stormbox”, a large plastic box that is installed under built-up areas to collect excess water. When the rain is heavy, the water overload flows into the box and, in this way, the system prevents flooding. Our Raineo TM water management system provides solutions to meet the challenges of climate change and helps to mitigate and prevent flooding in urban areas. NIELS RUNE SOLGAARD-NIELSEN (CEO Pipelife) 49 The Energy-Independent House Prof. Timo Leukefeldi on the energy-independent housei made of Wienerberger bricks:i “The Helma energy-independent house is a possible answer to the question of how we want to live in the future. It uses the free, crisis-proof ‘raw material sun’ to generate electricity and heat and also support our mobility. The result is complete energy independence – with no need for fossil fuels or electricity from public supply networks. That is what I call modern high-tech.” Technical concept: The energy-independent house with monolithic brick walls by Wienerberger provides a possible answer to the future of housing design and concepts that include complete energy self-sufficiency (i.e. no connections to the public supply ­network are required). These energy-efficient houses use solar energy to generate electricity and heat and power motor vehicles. Although the amount of available solar energy can fluctuate considerably from day to day, this energy (solar electricity and solar heat) can be stored to ensure long-term supplies. That provides sufficient energy for heating, household electricity and powering an e-car over an entire year, which also leads to a substantial reduction in costs. The brick is a proven, successful wall building material for energy-independent houses. This is demonstrated by various features, above all thermal storage capacity. Since temperature fluctuations are only transferred to the living areas over a longer period of time, a brick wall is a natural balancing accumulator and therefore the ideal building material for an energy-independent house. In addition, a modern brick provides perfect insulation. The need for heating is reduced considerably: the house stays warm in the winter and cool in the summer. The remaining energy requirements are minimal and can be covered by solar equipment combined with a long-term heat storage system. Solar heat and bricks in this combination produce the most effective houses currently on the market in Europe and could serve as a guiding vision for the European homes of 2020. These energy-independent buildings achieve ratings nearly 80% below the standard passive house for primary energy consumption, CO2 emissions and annual heating costs. 50 Wienerberger AG Sustainable Products Sustainability Report 2012 The Energy-Independent House System Solutions Ecobalance Koramic Complete Solutions for Roofs The system approach represents the focal point for R&D on roof tiles. Together with our Koramic complete durable, colorfast and stable clay roof tiles, we also offer a complete line of accessories. This solutions for roofs underscores Wienerberger’s positioning as a complete supplier for roofs and a competent partner for the planning phase. Wienerberger expanded its product line in 2012 to include a Koramic system solution with optimized thermal insulation that is marketed together with the necessary components such as insulation elements and coordinated accessories. We also expanded our offering as a one-stop shop with a service to calculate the energy performance of our roof s­ olutions. Starting in Germany, this service will be successively rolled out in other Wienerberger countries. Climate change and the resulting extreme weather conditions have also led to increasing demands on the resistance of roofs. Wienerberger has met this challenge with the patented sturmFIX system, which uses special fixation hooks to protect roof tiles from even the strongest storms. Ecobalance and Development of Environmental Product Declarations The preparation of ecobalances and environmental product declarations (EPDs) for all Long-standing, active product lines has been a focus of activities at Wienerberger for many years. The European role in preparation of ecobalances and Construction Products Directive (CPR) and the work of the European Committee for StandardEPDs, and European ization (CEN TC 350) will make these declarations mandatory for all building materials producers harmonization over the coming years. In Belgium, the respective regulations will take effect on January 1, 2014. of standards EPDs from a number of brick producers have been published in recent years. This generally took place at the association level in France, Germany, Belgium and England. The Belgian brick industry developed an EPD system as part of a research project, which defines the criteria for EPDs, and EPDs for all product lines have been issued in the Belgian product line. The brick industry in Austria decided to prepare differentiated branch EPDs by product category, i.e. for clay blocks, facing bricks and roof tiles. This project will be completed in the near future. With these measures, a large part of Wienerberger’s brick product line is directly covered by EPDs or included in branch solutions. Wienerberger is a leader on this issue in the above-mentioned countries and, through the positions of the Wienerberger Managing Board and employees in the Tiles and Bricks Europe association (TBE), works actively on the preparation of ecobalances and EPDs as well as the harmonization of national rules throughout Europe. 51 Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) in Bricks & Tiles Europe Division EPDs EPDs in preparation no EPDs Project to develop Wienerberger started a pilot project in 2010 to collect ecobalance data on all its roof tile ecobalance database plants and completed this work in 2011. These ecobalances form the basis for the preparation of for all plants launched in 2012 EPDs. In 2012 we started a project to create a Wienerberger database for the collection of eco­balance data in all our plants. This will move us closer to meeting our goal – the preparation of EPDs for all product groups – and we can then use this comprehensive database to demonstrate our compliance with national or European regulations. Cradle to cradle The cradle to cradle concept (C2C) is modeled on nature’s processes. It is designed to create certification waste-free systems by not disposing of products as waste after their use, but returning them to continuous production cycles for new products. This concept is also based on the use of renewable energy and the support of diversity. Certification and the related continuous development of products and production processes in the sense of sustainable environmental protection anchor the cradle to cradle principle in companies. Steinzeug-Keramo has already received C2C certification for part of its product line and is now working to achieve certification for the remaining 52 Wienerberger AG Sustainable Products Sustainability Report 2012 Ecobalance Future Measures products. In the Bricks & Tiles Europe Division, all clay block products in Belgium have been certified under C2C since 2012, and preparations are now in progress for the certification of selected roof tile and facing brick products. In the plastic pipe industry, the focus is on the preparation of environmental product declaTEPPFA leader in the rations by the producers’ association. The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association preparation of EPDs for functional areas (TEPPFA) is using life cycle assessments (LCAs) to develop environmental product declarations for functional areas based on ISO 14025. One example of a functional area for heating is the total amount of plastic pipes and fittings required to heat a 100 m² housing unit. TEPPFA members can reference the EPDs for these functional areas. Nineteen environmental product declarations have been completed and the preparation of further EPDs is scheduled for 2013. Niels Rune Solgaard-Nielsen, the CEO of Pipelife, is actively involved in the rapid, goal-oriented ­implementation in his role as president of TEPPFA. Future Measures Our future measures for sustainable products are focused on the (further) development of system solutions, including an improvement in economy and efficiency, as well as the development of solutions for modern, energy-efficient and urbane construction. Wienerberger will also collect ecobalance data from all its plants and work on the preparation of EPDs for the entire product line, and make an important contribution to the harmonization of standards throughout Europe. In our brick business, we want to further expand the one-stop shop approach that has already Expansion of one-stop proven successful in the roof segment. We will also continue our work on projects that combine shop concept and development of solutions the outstanding properties of Wienerberger products into system solutions with concepts like the for multi-story housing e4-Brickhouse, also with the inclusion of external partners from branches such as heating and ventilation technology. Our goal is to provide solutions from a single hand that not only comply with all relevant building regulations, but also meet our customers’ demands for healthy living, comfort and affordability in construction and use. We are therefore focusing on system solutions that help to reduce construction time and optimize construction logistics. Another central objective is the expansion of our offering for multi-story residential construction. Our efforts in this area will concentrate on our slim infill clay blocks for load-bearing exterior walls and our special lightweight bricks for infill masonry and innovative facade solutions. Steinzeug-Keramo will complete the certification of its ceramic products according to the Product certification and cradle to cradle principle in 2013. In addition to ongoing R&D projects to further generate 20% improvement in economy and service life as focus of revenues from innovative products, Pipelife is working on the collection of ecobalance data and for Pipes & Pavers the preparation of EPDs. Activities at Semmelrock involve the improvement of economy through innovative laying systems as well as the extension of the product lifecycle through an increase in durability, color retention and surface stability. In 2012 23.4% of Group revenues were generated by innovative products and system soluGoal: 30% of revenues tions. Our goal is to increase this indicator to 30% by 2015. from innovative products by 2015 53 Corporate Social Responsibility Wienerberger Principles of Corporate Social Responsibility The economy as an Wienerberger views the economy as an integral part of society.

Habitat for Humanity is an international organization that is dedicated to providing poor and disadvantaged people throughout the world with safe and affordable housing. This three-year cooperation program was launched with the “Big Build 2012” in Craiova, Romania, from October 1 to 5, 2012. Together with the involved families, volunteers from all over the world built five brick homes in five days. We believe affordable housing is a basic human right. I am therefore particularly pleased that we are able to build homes for the needy together with Habitat for Humanity. GERHARD KOCH (Head of European Affairs & Sustainability Management) Development of The principles underlying the donation guideline formed the basis for the development of a WISBA training program specialized training concept in 2012, which led to the creation of the Wienerberger Sustainable Building Academy (WISBA). This European training program is focused on sustainable construction and was created together with Vienna University of Economics and Business and in cooperation with technical colleges. WISBA is directed to master’s degree students in architecture or civil engineering, who can demonstrate a significant interest and special achievements in sustainable construction. Wienerberger supports this target group by financing the international training, which can be credited in full to the respective degree program (5 ECTS points). The participants also have an opportunity for practical training at Wienerberger. The first course will start during 20 the autumn semester 2013/14 with students from Austria, Germany and Poland. iPlans call fori AL 15 GO ithe expansion of WISBA to 12 countries by 2015.i Selected Charitable Projects Unbureaucratic help We regularly support and promote a variety of social projects in nearly all countries where in disaster situations Wienerberger is present. In addition to the planning and realization of charitable projects together with aid organizations, we believe it is important to provide fast and unbureaucratic relief in emergencies. We help where we can make a real contribution and are certain this help will arrive at the right place. 56 Wienerberger AG Corporate Social Responsibility Sustainability Report 2012 Charitable Projects Compliance As part of its long-standing partnership with the Austrian Red Cross, Pipelife launched Pipelife: around the a new campaign in 2012: for 27 months, the company will support 27 humanitarian projects in world with 27 aid projects the 27 countries where it is active. The kick-off for this campaign was a unique training program carried out in cooperation with the Red Cross in Austria and the UK, which also received ­financial support from the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO). The program’s goal is to improve the skills of development aid workers to react quickly and correctly in disaster ­situations and thereby ensure supply security, above all for water. This project “Prepare to Respond” has held courses in a variety of humanitarian fields, including water, hygiene and sanitation equipment. Wienerberger also supports professional training for young men and women in sustainable Support for young construction. We supplied the products for an apprentice masons’ competition in Austria, and masons’ competition in Austria the winner of the national contest will take part in the World Skills 2013 in Leipzig. This ­initiative will help make the masonry profession more attractive for future generations. Affordable housing for the people living near our plant has been an important issue ever Affordable since our market entry in India. Together with an external partner, we carried out a study on the housing in India needs of the local population in 2012. We then developed a concept for affordable housing that provides sufficient living space for a family. In a next step we want to work together with NGOs to support residents in their search for financing. Compliance The term “compliance”, which originated in Anglo-American law, is understood to cover all Measures to measures required to ensure adherence to the relevant legal regulations and prohibitions by a ensure legally compliant behavior company and its employees. A commitment to compliance with all applicable national and international legal standards represents a central principle for the Wienerberger Group. Individual legal issues are so important that Wienerberger has issued separate guidelines in these areas and places a special focus on compliance. These areas include the prevention of corruption and compliance with competition law as well as compliance with national guidelines and regulations, which are described in the following sections. Prevention of Corruption Wienerberger is committed to free and fair competition, and rejects any form of corruption. Difference between However, the differentiation between well-meant business gifts and corrupt behavior is often business gifts and corrupt behavior difficult to determine in individual cases. This applies, above all, to procurement and sales­ because of the increased contact between the respective staffs and public authorities or private business partners. 57 Guideline on In order to inform employees of legally compliant behavior, Wienerberger issued a group business gifts guideline that covers business gifts. This guideline is intended to serve as guidance for employees by defining the cases in which the granting or accepting of business gifts could pose a problem under criminal law. It defines the term “business gifts” and differentiates this term from other types of presents. The guideline also distinguishes between gifts to persons in the public sector and the private sphere, and provides standards for acceptable behavior. In conclusion, the guideline defines cases in which the granting or acceptance of business gifts must be reported to the Managing Board or company management. Instructions for In connection with the implementation of this guideline, the top managers and managing managing directors directors of the country organizations (approx. 40 persons) were instructed on the correct ­procedures for dealing with business gifts. This included instructions to ensure full compliance with the guideline in every company. Local management is responsible for passing this information on to employees through special training courses, which are regularly monitored by the corporate headquarters. Internal audit The duties of internal audit also include reviewing compliance with legal regulations and as control function internal guidelines. Audits were conducted in 35 companies during 2012, which focused on organization, procurement, materials management, sales and personnel as well as corruption ­and antitrust law. The audited companies represent roughly half the operating units in the­ Wienerberger Group. These reviews confirmed that all internal guidelines had been implemented in all c­ ompanies and that employees had been instructed accordingly. Any deviations were reported to the Managing Board and the Audit Committee, and appropriate corrective measures, such as the improvement of documentation processes, were developed together with the ­responsible management. Dual controls for Another important instrument for the prevention of corruption is the principle of dual business transactions controls for signatures in business transactions with third parties. This principle calls for signatures by two authorized persons in the local unit when rights and obligations are created, amended or cancelled. Group guidelines also include this rule, which supports the prevention of corruption on an international basis. Sanctions for violations Legally compliant behavior is expected from all Wienerberger employees, and any violations represent a breach of the obligations under labor law. If the suspicion of a violation is confirmed, it will lead to consequences under labor and civil law that reflect the scope of damages to the Group. In 2012 no charges were filed against Wienerberger based on a suspicion of corruption and no criminal penalties were paid for related violations. 58 Wienerberger AG Corporate Social Responsibility Sustainability Report 2012 Compliance Prevention of Anti-competitive Behavior Competition law ensures compliance with free and fair competition. Management is Fair competition convinced that business policies based on free competition are in the best interest of the company as basis for our business and also in the best interest of shareholders and employees. The Wienerberger Group introduced an antitrust compliance program many years ago.­ Antitrust compliance This guideline forms the basis for increasing the awareness of our employees for compliance with program antitrust regulations. The rules of conduct defined in the guideline provide guidance for dealing with sensitive subjects in the area of competition law and must be strictly observed. Special rules regulate contacts with competitors and deal with issues such as market allocation, the exchange of information, the design of prices and delivery conditions and other possible forms of ­cooperation. The interaction with customers, sales partner and suppliers is, among others, regulated with respect to the determination of resale prices and related restrictions as well as exclusivity ­agreements. The guideline also contains regulations concerning intellectual property rights and merger controls. Regular training sessions are scheduled for employees as part of the antitrust compliance Control through program. Local management is responsible for organizing these programs and selecting the internal audit employees. The realization of the training sessions and compliance with the guideline are ­monitored by internal audit. Due to the position of the Wienerberger Group in individual markets, the pricing policies Pending antitrust of our subsidiaries are actively monitored by antitrust authorities. Antitrust proceedings are proceedings in Germany, searches in the offices of pending in Bricks & Tiles Germany and, in the event of a conviction, could lead to a fine. A plastic pipe producers ­provision has already been recognized for a possible antitrust penalty, but we assume Wienerberger was not involved in any illegal actions. In addition, the EU Commission ordered searches at the offices of plastic pipe and fitting producers during June 2012 in connection with alleged ­agreements in violation of antitrust law, which also included Pipelife. The responsible authorities have not issued any findings to date. It should be noted that price-fixing agreements are not part of Wienerberger business policies; internal guidelines expressly prohibit such activities and call for sanctions in the event of violations. 59 Compliance with National Guidelines and Regulations Environmental, health Wienerberger is subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental, health and and safety regulations safety laws in many countries, which can lead to investments for compliance with these regulations. The failure to comply with these regulations could result in administrative fines, the ­assessment of damages or the suspension of operating permits. Responsibility with local In accordance with the decentralized structure of the Wienerberger Group, local m ­ anagement management is responsible for implementing and monitoring the applicable national guidelines and directives. Officers have therefore been appointed at the country level in agreement with the relevant national laws. These persons are responsible for evaluating and reporting on legal compliance to local authorities and to the Wienerberger Managing Board. Internal audit reviews compliance with these processes on a regular basis and reports to the Managing and Supervisory Boards on the results of these audits.

In the interim periods, we will issue an update that presents the latest facts and figures as well as our progress in specific areas. The contents of this sustainability report are based on the fully consolidated subsidiaries in Reporting threshold: the wall, roof, facade, ceramic pipe, plastic pipe and concrete paver product groups.

This engagement is subject to the “General Conditions of Contract for the Public Accounting Professions” (AAB 2011) as amended February 21, 2011, issued by the Austrian Chamber of Public Accountants and Tax Advisors. Our liability towards the Company and also towards third parties is limited in accordance with section 8 of the AAB 2011. We draw attention to the fact that the English translation of this Report on the independent limited assurance engagement is presented for the convenience of the reader only and that the German wording is the only legally binding version. Responsibility of the management The preparation of the Sustainability-Report 2012 in accordance with the criteria set out in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3 of the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI criteria”) – Materiality – Clarity – Stakeholder inclusiveness – Accuracy – Sustainability context – Timeliness – Completeness – Comparability – Balance – Reliability is the responsibility of the management of Wienerberger AG. This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods for preparing the Sustainability-Report 2012, making assumptions and estimates of individual sustainability disclosures that are plausible under the given circumstances, as well as designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes where relevant for the preparation of the Sustainability-Report 2012. Limitation of the scope of the engagement Our responsibility is to give an assessment, based on our work, on whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the quantitative disclosures in chapter “Environmental Protection in Production” on the issues of “Energy Consumption and Emissions” (pp. 35 to 37), as well as in chapter “Employees” on the issues “Occupational Safety and Health” (pp. 24 to 27) of the Sustainability-Report 2012 have not been prepared in accordance with the GRI criteria as set out in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3. Our review was limited to the key performance indicators in the cited areas of focus. We also performed the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Application Level Check to comprehend the application level declared by Wienerberger AG. Responsibility of the independent auditor We have performed our engagement in accordance with Expert Opinion KFS/PG 13 for assurance engagements. This standard requires us to comply with our professional standards and to plan and perform the engagement in a way that enables us to draw conclusions in accordance with KFS/PG 13. Engagement approach In a limited assurance engagement, the work performed is less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement and, therefore, less assurance is obtained. We performed our work, using appropriate random samples, based on our due judgment and to the extent required to obtain limited assurance. In the course of our engagement, we therefore obtained relevant evidence based on risk and materiality assessments in order to obtain this limited assurance on the compliance of the disclosures according to the scope of the engagement with the GRI criteria mentioned above. In doing so, our work performed at the headquarters of Wienerberger AG in Vienna, Austria, particularly included the following: – Inspection of relevant documentation of the process for preparing the Sustainability-Report 2012, as well as of existing documents and systems on the sustainability management and their sample testing – Interviewing employees materially involved in the preparation of the report contents from the departments Corporate Controlling, Corporate Engineering, Human Resource Management and European Affairs of Wienerberger AG in Vienna as well as the sustainability coordinators of the entities Pipelife and Steinzeug-Keramo – Sample comparison for a selection of disclosures included in the Sustainability-Report 2012 according to the scope of the engagement with records provided by country organizations and recorded centrally, as well as any side calculations – Reviewing the declaration of Wienerberger AG on the compliance with Level B+ of the GRI G3 guidelines Conclusion Based on our work, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the quantitative disclosures in chapter “Environmental Protection in Production” on the issues of “Energy Consumption and Emissions” (pp. 35 to 37), as well as in chapter “Employees” on the issues “Occupational Safety and Health” (pp. 24 to 27) of the Sustainability-Report 2012, in all material respects, have not been prepared in accordance with the criteria materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, completeness, balance, clarity, accuracy, timeliness, comparability and reliability of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3 of GRI. Based on our work, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability-Report 2012 of Wienerberger AG does not meet the requirements according to GRI Application Level B+.
