Recycling and Energy: CONSUKORRA Company takes the lead in wastes recycling field; as it sells a system for transforming industrial wastes to energy that can be reused in the factory in a way that saves much energy, recycles those wastes and finally gets rid of them safely. For example, establishment of an incinerator for industrial wastes with retrieval of ensuing heat; for generating ice water in Eastern Company located in 6th October city. This incinerator is deemed an P P environmentally friend model; as it is considered the first tangible application ever in Egypt. Moreover, it is considered the biggest incinerator for industrial wastes in Egypt, where it consists of the following:  An industrial incinerator with the capacity of a ton per hour for solid wastes and one hundred liters per hour for liquid wastes that makes best use of heat existing in chimney of wastes burning to generate saturated steam ( seven tons per hour) at pressure of eight bar through a steam boiler running on chimney of wastes burning. This steam can be utilized in running a chiller with an absorption capacity sufficient for generating ice with capacity of 2000 tons.  Design of the incinerator allows for burning different types of solid and liquid wastes, while 50% fifty percent of wastes, that is supposed to be burnt, must be smoke dust till latent heat in wastes resulted from burning reaches the prerequisite level for generating quantity of steams sufficient for running the chiller; and for reaching the demanded cooling capacity (2000 tons).  The incinerator allows getting rid of about 95% (ninety five Percent) of wastes quantity – solid and liquid – and the rest 5% (five percent) of wastes as ashes resulting from burning process that is easily rid of by whatever means.  Burning system is characterized by a distinctive feature (automatic removal of burning ashes); as there is a belt designed especially for removing ashes automatically, at the end of each round of wastes burning, where it takes ashes out of the incinerator body; to be gathered and to be rid of, in a way that prevents accumulation of ashes in incinerator body and prolongs non – stop operation period for wastes burning.  Such type of incinerators has been designed by CONSUKORRA Company, specifically energy systems unit responsible for the engineering design, supplying and installing equipment as well as other electromechanical contract works related to parts and running process of the incinerator.  Engineering design of the industrial incinerator project depends on making best use of latent heat in exhaust of wastes burning in generating ice water.

Hence, Consukorra carried out projects of numerous environmental contributions. For example protecting clients of Eastern Company products; because during carrying wastes process from industrial compound to dumping areas, quantities of industrial wastes have been smuggled to illegal factories for recycling defected products under the name of Eastern Company; with the pretence of saving high costs for Eastern Company such as costs of wastes transportation and burning outside industrial compound, in addition to saving operation costs of any other sources for having the same cooling capacity produced by this project(2000 tons). Moreover, this project can be carried out on a large scale for burning wastes of neighboring factories, and consequently it would be a profitable activity for Eastern Company. 2. Saving highly consumed electric power from the state electrical grid: In case of generating prerequisite cooling capacity through an alternative source, this will require a direct electric consumption from electricity grid and subsequently will result in wasting power in generating, carrying as well as distributing prerequisite electric power. 3. Saving vast areas of land: The daily burning of industrial wastes considerably contributed in saving vast areas used before to store wastes waiting to be carried to dumps and subsequently reduce man labor responsible for storing and following up wastes carrying and ridding. 4. Reducing thermal emissions by generating the necessary energy through using wastes instead of the traditional methods, especially that burning wastes contributes to the reduction of emissions rating 21:1 comparing with the traditional landfill methods which produce the Methane the most harmful to Ozone layer and Greenhouse.
