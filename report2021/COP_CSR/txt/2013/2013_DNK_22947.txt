The report is a key communication tool, part of our commitment to openness and accountability. The report is thus intended to serve as our Communication on Progress (COP) report to UN Global Compact and ensures compliance with section 99a of the Danish Financial Statements Act regarding corporate responsibility reporting. DLH’s Annual Report and CSR Report complement one another, as the former provides an insight into the group’s financial statements while the CSR report provides an overview of non-financial statements material to our business. DLH’s Annual Report 2012 can be downloaded from the website. 5 Corporate Social Responsibility 2012Taking the lead Reporting Period and Cycle The reporting period is the calendar year 2012 and Reporting Principles the reporting cycle is annual.

In 2010, we aligned our CSR strategy with the principles of UN Global Compact and further developed our CSR policies. In 2012, we launched the new and innovative Good Supplier Programme, which is the group’s supplier risk-assessment tool. As we strengthen our CSR work, our reporting will benefit from improved progress measurement and performance communication. Reporting Scope and Boundary Unless otherwise noted for specific data, the report addresses all DLH’s sales, procurement offices and warehouse facilities worldwide. For a list of facilities, please see p. 91 on the Annual Report. The report also addresses our relations with suppliers with regards to the implementation of The Good Supplier Programme. The CSR Report 2012 has the same content structure and design of previous reports. Stakeholders will therefore be able to follow progress easily. 6 Corporate Social Responsibility 2012Taking the lead STRATEGY & ENGAGEMENTS Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility at DLH Our business relies upon wood At DLH, we have long-term standards.

Positive results were achieved and several of the concession holders are now in the process of becoming FSC certified with the assistance of TBI. TBI has currently 3.4 million hectares in the process of becoming FSC certified in Indonesia Learn more about TBI here: www.theborneoinitiative.org 8 Corporate Social Responsibility 2012Taking the lead ENVIRONMENT The world’s forests Every year large areas of tropical forests are being converted to commercial agriculture due to the increasing demand and rising prices for food, plants oils and biofuels. Deforestation is thus one of the major contributors to climate change accounting for 18% of global carbon emissions. Illegal and destructive logging activities also threaten the conservation of forests. But forestry activities, if conducted in accordance with local laws and international environmental standards, do not contribute to deforestation. Well-managed forests are forests that can continue to perform the numerous valuable services they provide to the global community: climate regulation, natural carbon sinks, biodiversity protection and contribution to the livelihood of 1.6 billion people. Therefore, ensuring that the timber we source has been legally harvested constitute one of the major challenges of our business. Our overriding goal is to contribute to the conservation of the world’s forest and battle against climate change by promoting legality and sustainable forest management. We explain how in the following paragraphs. 9 Corporate Social Responsibility 2012Taking the lead Our Suppliers Quick Facts about DLH’s Environmental Policy on Suppliers  All our suppliers must commit to and comply with DLH’s environment policy.  All our suppliers must complete our Good Supplier Program (GSP) questionnaire and undergo due diligence. Participation in GSP is a pre-requisite for becoming a DLH Supplier.  We will work with our suppliers on knowledge sharing and capacity building. We will use our position as one of the market leaders in certified tropical hardwoods in order to support them in achieving VLO and FSC certification.

Vice President Peter K. Kristensen visiting a supplier in Gabon. Visiting suppliers is an important part of the due diligence process. 10 Corporate Social Responsibility 2012Taking the lead Our Products Quick Facts about DLH’s Environmental Policy on Product  DLH strives to purchase as much certified timber as possible and we want to continue to be the leading supplier of certified tropical hardwood in the future.  Our long term target is to only source sustainable timber. The success of this target is dependent on many factors, few of which we have any influence on. We therefore cannot set a fixed deadline for when we will reach this target.  Promote greater uptake of certified products. Over the last decade, DLH’s ambition has been to be a leading supplier of tropical hardwoods originating in well managed forests. Since 2000, DLH has been Chain of Custody certified and has, therefore, been permitted to trade in certified timber. Since 2008, DLH has also been Generic Chain of Custody certified and has, therefore, also been able to trade in timber with third-party verification of legal origin and legal compliance claims. Purchases of verified and certified timber In 2012, 28% of all procured timber (by volume) was third-party verified or certified. Approximately Total volume of timber purchased 24% was covered by the certification scheme FSC PEFC – this is a 6 percentage point increase from 2011. Other 3% FSC 1% 24% Approximately 3% of purchases were covered by PEFC, and 1% by other verification schemes such as VLO, TLTV, MTCS and FSC CW. These two categories have decreased from 5 and 8 percent respective share of total timber purchases in 2011.

Our Forest Footprint of relevance of the subject to the group’s DLH was recognized as leader in its sector in the stakeholders. Forest Footprint Disclosure (FFD) Annual Review 2012. This is the third year the group has been The 2010 carbon figures showed that international awarded such recognition for the management of transport was the largest single contributor to the its forest footprint.

Approximately 50% of our sourcing activities are conducted in countries considered of risk. Therefore it is our responsibility to ensure that we do not directly or indirectly benefit from, contribute to, endorse, or in any way facilitate violations. DLH recognises the importance of the UN Human Rights Council’s “Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights”, written by the UN Special Representative John Ruggie. We therefore support that the Guiding Principles is incorporated into the revised OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the revised International Finance Corporation (IFC) Sustainability Policy and the corresponding Performance Standards, and the ISO 26000. The Guiding Principles have in other words become a global reference framework for the management of business and human rights challenges. As stated by John Ruggie, the “appropriate response by an enterprise to the risk of contributing to human rights abuse through its supply chain is for it to conduct due diligence on its supply chain relationships to identify risks of actual and potential adverse impacts, and to prevent or mitigate both risks and impacts where they arise”1 With the launching of the new GSP in 2012, which is the group’s supplier risk assessment tool, DLH aims to conduct more systematic human rights due diligence in the upcoming years. 1 Ruggie, John. 2010.

The program is part of the group´s growing CSR commitments, which began in 2010 with the alignment of the CSR policies with the principles of UN Global Compact. With the new European Union Timber Regulation entering into force in 2013, the 2008 amendments to the US Lacey Act, and the Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights endorsed by UN in 2011, new guidelines have been defined for responsible business. They consider due diligence to be the appropriate action that responsible companies should exercise in order to manage and mitigate environmental, social and human rights risks. It is our goal that the new GSP will help set an industry standard and assist the group to consolidate its market position as the preferred supplier of responsible timber. In other words, DLH wants to take the industry lead. 19 Corporate Social Responsibility 2012Taking the lead GRI INDEX TABLE This report follows the Global Reporting Initiative Report, as well as their correspondence with the (GRI) guidelines G3, application level “C”.
