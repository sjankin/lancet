Business concept NOTE is a local North European manufacturing and logistics partner with an international platform for manufacturing of electronics-based products that require high technology competence and flexibility across large parts of product lifecycles. Strategy and business targets NOTE will be the best collaboration partner in the sector with high delivery precision and quality for a competitive total cost. To make the market’s most competitive offering, NOTE should achieve good profitability, actively contribute to safeguarding the customer’s value chains and sharpening their competitiveness through flexibility, competence and professional conduct. Profitable growth will be achieved by:  Expanding NOTE’s customer base with new accounts with complex products and high standards.  Strengthening NOTE’s services offering to existing customers.  Sharpening competitiveness through sector-leading quality and delivery precision, further improvements to the sourcing and logistics operation, optimising capacity utilisation and enhancing internal administrative processes.  Executing carefully selected production take-overs and acquisitions. Financial targets Growth target NOTE will increase its market shares organically and through acquisitions. Profitability target NOTE will grow with profitability. Its target is for a minimum return on operating capital of 20 percent. For the long term and over a business cycle, profitability will also exceed the average of other mid-sized international and comparable competitors. Capital structure target The minimum equity ratio should be 30 percent. Dividend target NOTE’s dividend should be adapted to average profit levels over a business cycle, and for the long term, be 30–50 percent of profit after tax. Dividends should also be available for modifying the capital structure. 8 NOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2012 NOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2012 9 INTRODUCTION OPER ATIONS THE NOTE SHARE FORMAL ANNUAL ACCOUNTS Business model NOTE is a specialised manufacturing and logistics partner for producing electronics-based products that require high technology competence and flexibility.

Note 3 Segment reporting Significant key figures for NOTE’s operating segments are in the following table, in accordance with the application of IFRS 8. Essentially, these consist of Nearsourcing Centres and Industrial Plants. Nearsourcing Centres are the selling units in Sweden, Norway, Finland and the UK, where development-oriented work is conducted close to customers. Industrial Plants are largely manufacturing units in Estonia and China. Other units consist of business-support, group-wide operations. Essentially, the provision for bad debt made in the fourth quarter affected the profitability of Industrial Plants.
