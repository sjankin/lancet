For a long time, we looked forward to a political change in our country that could meet the needs and problems caused by the emergence of new challenges with continually more global and aggressive competition that, in many cases, does not Chief Executive Officer’s respect the rules that Sabaf has imposed with its code of ethics. Now that this letter to stakeholders desire for change seems to have been realized in one way or another with the results of the latest political elections last February, the worrisome fallout is that we are at an impasse that makes some decisions even more difficult than in the past. My unfortunate feeling is that there are few men and companies who fully dedicate themselves to their work lately while everyone else is blocked, waiting for the future, but by doing so push it off further and further. The tax burden, which we have expected to decrease for years through the TaxCut Fund where profits from the fight against tax evasion are deposited, remains excessive and penalizes both companies and employees whose purchase power is no longer able to sustain internal demand. Regarding investments, tax reduction provisions would be helpful to increase the growth of undercapitalized companies Alberto Bartoli and improve their credibility abroad. We feel that, despite everything, Italy could continue to be one of the best countries in terms of investing in and operating companies but growth and streamlining opportunities are constantly wasted. Because complex challenges on the global market can only be dealt with by using group strategies and policies, the fact that we only operate individually does not help us compete on large international markets. On one hand, the numbers are unequivocal: Europe is growing much slower than the rest of the world: analysts estimate that between now and 2014, European walls, the model is no longer company-centric with all input and external flows growth will be around 1% while China and India will surpass 7%.

The 2012 analysis by product family shows, for the first time, sales of At local level, Sabaf has sought to establish an open dialogue with the various CECED (European Committee of Domestic Equipment Manufacturers) with to produce heat in fact permits much higher yields than those achievable with light alloy valves were higher than sales of brass valves, confirming the gradual authorities to create harmonious industrial development. For this reason, the associated scientific, legal and institutional implications in the household electric cooking appliances.

An increase in electric hobs would cause an increase in peak electricity consumption, typically around meal times, further increasing electricity demand Litigation which is already difficult to meet. Series III, AE and AEO burners Charity initiatives There are no significant lawsuits pending with public organisations or other Environmental policy, Series III burners offer much higher yields than standard burners (65% vs. and donations representatives of society. 52%). The greater efficiency of the Sabaf Series III burner means lower gas programme and objectives consumption (some 20% less) and less time to reach the desired cooking temperature. Greater efficiency and lower consumption also translate into a In 2012 donations totalled around €45,000 (€76,000 in 2011), and mainly halving of carbon monoxide emissions and a significant reduction in carbon supported local social and humanitarian initiatives. Sabaf has always been mindful of the environment, constantly seeking to dioxide emissions. reduce the impact of its industrial operations.

This new platform is compatible with both Long-distance adoption constant progress in the Company’s environmental performance. the AE (high efficiency) and AEO (brass high efficiency) versions, without the need to modify the structure of the appliance or change the grill height.

HE burners also stand out because they and students are almost completely interchangeable with Series II burners. Product innovation and Sabaf systematically organises company visits for groups of students and environmental sustainability showcases CSR best practice during major conferences in various Italian cities.
