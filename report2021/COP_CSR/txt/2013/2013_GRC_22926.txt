AIA addresses noise issues responsibly by taking measures aiming to reduce annoyance to the neighbours to a minimum. AIA has installed a NOise MOnitoring System (NOMOS) consisting of 10 permanent and 1 mobile Noise Monitoring Terminals (ΝΜΤs) which provide a detailed profile of the noise pattern for the residential areas along flight routes. This system is connected with the HCAA radar so that correlations can be made based on the actual flight track information. Since airport opening, in collaboration with HCAA and other state entities, airlines and representatives from the local communities, AIA has defined Noise Abatement Procedures for the reduction of noise levels in the residential areas around the airport and along flight paths. The Airport Strategic Noise Map (SNM) was revised in 2012 in accordance with the requirements of the relevant European and national legislation, the results of which indicate that no revision of the relevant action plan is required. Since noise exposure is one of the primary environmental aspects impacting airport vicinity residents, AIA holds periodic meetings with representatives from local authorities and groups. AIA has established and operates – on a 24 hour basisa dedicated telephone line (“We Listen”) for concerned citizens who may further visit AIA’s web site in order to register their complaints or request clarifications on noise related issues. In 2012, 20 related complaints were submitted.
