As a result, we have worked intensely during the past two years to implement a structured customer process through which we increasingly ask customers about their requirements to identify how we can enhance our performance. The positive effects of this programme are clearly visible. The tenant retention rate – meaning how large a percentage of our tenants choose to extend their lease – rose substantially. Compared with previous levels, recent years have seen a 50 per cent reduction in the number of tenants wishing to relocate. One factor underlying customer satisfaction is that we, via our with this project is to create the most attractive office workplace local offices, consistently work close to our customers, making it location in Scandinavia. Similarly, we are developing and profileasier to identify requests and changes in requirements.

Our aim precedential (but not Fabege-related) Cyprus case, Fabege 2 Fabege 2012 MESSAGE FROM THE CEO decided to post a provision of SEK 1.9bn to cover our ongoing tax cases. The processes are proceeding in the Administrative Court of Appeal and we expect the matter to be finalised during 2013. Macroeconomic conditions are currently uncertain. Nevertheless, I see many reasons for being optimistic regarding Fabege’s development. Stockholm is expanding faster than any other city in Sweden and the service sector is stable. We have a strong position, with modern properties in compact portfolios in attractive locations. The overall portfolio is well adapted to current and future demand. I also see substantial potential in our future project portfolio. During 2013, we plan to further strengthen relations with our tenants, and to develop our locations with considerable understanding of what our customers want. I am convinced that this will result in continuing high net letting and retention rates. We already know with great certainty that we will have rising income and stable costs during 2013. Thus, the conditions favour continuing robust earnings. Another reason that I am not uneasy about the macroeconomic trend is that economic fluctuations create opportunities in the property market. Our current position is so strong that we can be proactive when such opportunities arise. Stockholm, February 2013 CHRISTIAN HERMELIN Chief Executive Officer Fabege customers Fabege aims to be a more customer-oriented company. We are continuing our efforts to enhance customer relations to ensure tenants elect not to relocate. This will be our primary focus during the years ahead. 3 Business model and strategic focus Fabege’s business model aims to generate value through property management, development and transactions. The company owns and manages commercial properties concentrated in Stockholm inner city, Solna and Hammarby Sjöstad. Operations are to be characterised by active, customeroriented management.

One such step was the opening of Friends Arena, which generated sharply increased public attention for the area. Fabege Vattenfall In September, Vattenfall (a major Swedish power producer) moved into its new headquarters in the Uarda 5 property in Arenastaden. The approximately 2,300 employees were previously dispersed among three locations in Stockholm. The property consists of four buildings inspired by the four elements, and linked by a glazed atrium. The workplaces are located furthest out in the buildings, with open spaces with couches and tables close to the atrium. A pervading theme is to create conditions for communication and spontaneous meetings. A number of the customer’s basic requirements for the new headquarters were good transport links and an environmentally classiﬁed building.

Fabege works closely with its customers and is receptive to their changing needs. The risk of increased vacancies in the investment-property portfolio is deemed minor considering the portfolio’s central locations and stable customers. The lease portfolio is spread among many different sectors and companies of differing sizes. The largest tenants are all stable companies and account for a limited portion of the total number of tenants. Fabege’s credit policy governs the checks and assessments that are made of the customers’ ability to pay with the aim of limiting the credit risk. The tenants are highly solvent and rent losses are negligible. This is partly due to favourable credit ratings and partly due to excellent procedures that quickly identify late payers. Fabege’s portfolio of modern office premises in central locations generates a stable cash flow from management operations.

Heating consumption was 50% below the industry average 95% renewable energy 44 Fabege 2012 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT A few words from the CEO Solid commitment to sustainability The company works proactively, together with our customers, to promote sustainable urban development. Two areas in which we have major opportunities to make a significant impact are without doubt the energy consumption of existing properties and innovative solutions in projects. I am proud of our achievements in these areas. Through working with structured optimisation of operations over a ten-year period, we have succeeded in reducing energy consumption per sqm by approximately 4.5 per cent per year. This has been achieved in parallel with an increase in the use of cooling, which is highly energy intensive. I can still see major opportunities for us to become even more energy efficient by, for example, encouraging behavioural changes and investments in new technology. A key driving force behind these major improvements comprises the environmental gains that so clearly go hand-in-hand with cost savings for both Fabege and our customers. This also applies to Green Leases which, in partnership with our tenants, we use as a tool to place the focus on and to collaborate around environmental issues. As part of furnishing our properties with a clear environmental profile, we use various environmental classification systems and certification systems. For example, in 2012, we decided that from 2013, all new builds of office buildings are to be constructed so that they conform to the requirements of the BREEAM environmental system, in parallel, the minimum requirements for major redevelopments are to comply with the GreenBuilding level and the Silver level of the Sweden Green Building Council. I would also like to mention that Vattenfall’s new head office in Arenastaden won several accolades for energy consumption. During the year, we continued to develop our purchasing work. This resulted in a more efficient procedure and enhanced control of suppliers. As part of the on-going efforts to raise supply quality and to ensure that suppliers meet Fabege’s new, raised requirements, about 20 suppliers were subjected to a detailed examination from a sustainability perspective. The examination showed that these suppliers are working actively with sustainability issues. Our relationships with customers, employees, suppliers, contractors and the public must be characterised by responsibility and good business ethics. In 2011, as part of this strategy, Fabege joined the UN initiative Global Compact, whose policies continue to serve as guidelines for our behaviour with regard to human rights, labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption. I am proud of the commitment to sustainability issues that exists in our organisation. CHRISTIAN HERMELIN Chief Executive Officer 45 Successful environmental initiatives Fabege pursues goal-oriented, systematic and preventive environmental work.

Energy efﬁciency offers the best opportunity to achieve this objective. Fabege’s aims are: A minimum reduction of 20 per cent by 31 December 2014, based on energy consumption levels in 2009, with unchanged indoor climate conditions. This amounts to an annual reduction of about 4 per cent. From 2002 to 2009, energy consumption was reduced by about 5 per cent annually. From 2010 to 2012, the annual reduction was 4 per cent. This means that Fabege is meeting the target in 2014. This positive trend is attributable to intensive work focused on operational optimisation and investments in energy-efﬁcient technology. 46 Fabege 2012 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT leases.

During the past year, Fabege commenced cooperation with Clowns Without Borders.
