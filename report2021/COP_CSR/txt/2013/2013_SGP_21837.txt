The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited The Royal Bank of Scotland plc United Overseas Bank Limited City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 31 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE City Developments Limited (“CDL” or the “Company”) is committed to maintaining good corporate governance and business integrity in all its business activities. To demonstrate its commitment to uphold the highest standards of corporate governance, CDL had joined the Securities Investors Association Singapore (“SIAS”) and its partners since 2010 in making the following public Statement of Support, which was reiterated at the 3rd Singapore Corporate Governance Week 2012 (organised by the SIAS) in October 2012: “As an Organisation, we are committed to upholding high standards of corporate governance to enhance shareholder value. We believe, practising good corporate governance is central to the health and stability of our financial markets and economy.” At the SIAS Investors’ Choice Awards 2012 in October 2012, CDL received the Singapore Corporate Governance Award 2012 2nd Runner-Up (Big Cap) and the Singapore Most Transparent Company Award Runner-Up (Real Estate Category). Concurrently, Mr Kwek Leng Beng, Executive Chairman, and Mr Kwek Leng Joo, Managing Director, emerged joint winners as “Partners in the Office of the CEO” in the Brendan Wood International SIAS TopGun CEO Designation Award. The Award is accorded to CEOs who are best in class rated by shareholders. CDL adheres closely to the principles and guidelines of the Code of Corporate Governance 2005 (“2005 Code”). Whilst the revised Code of Corporate Governance 2012 (“2012 Code”) will only be applicable to CDL in respect of its financial year commencing 1 January 2013, CDL has commenced compliance with a number of the key revised guidelines under the 2012 Code and will further review its corporate governance practices to bring the same in line with the recommendations under the 2012 Code. This report thus sets out CDL’s main corporate governance practices with reference to the 2005 Code and additionally, where applicable, the 2012 Code. BOARD MATTERS Principle 1: The Board’s Conduct of Affairs Primary Functions of the Board The Board oversees the Company’s business and its performance. Its primary functions are to set broad policies, provide guidance on and approve strategic direction and plans for the Company, review the Company’s performance, satisfy itself as to the adequacy and effectiveness of the framework and processes for internal controls (including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls) and risk management for the safeguarding of shareholders’ interests and the Company’s assets and assume responsibility for good corporate governance. Independent Judgement All Directors are required to objectively discharge their duties and responsibilities in the interests of the Company. Directors who are in any way, directly or indirectly, interested in a transaction or proposed transaction will declare the nature of their interests in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, Chapter 50, and also voluntarily abstain from deliberation on the same. The assessment criteria used by the Company’s Nominating Committee in its annual evaluation of the Directors takes into account the individual Director’s objectivity, independent thinking and judgement. Delegation by the Board The primary functions of the Board are either carried out directly by the Board or through committees established by the Board, namely, the Board Committee (“BC”), the Audit & Risk Committee (“ARC”), the Nominating Committee (“NC”), the Remuneration Committee (“RC”) and the Corporate Social Responsibility & Corporate Governance Committee (“CSR & CG Committee”), all collectively referred to hereafter as the “Committees”. Clear written terms of reference for the Committees set out the authority and duties of the Committees. All terms of reference for the Committees are approved by the Board and reviewed periodically to ensure their continued relevance. The composition of each Committee can be found under the ‘Corporate Directory’ section in this Annual Report 2012 (“AR”). The delegation of authority by the Board to the Committees enables the Board to achieve operational efficiency by empowering these Committees to decide on matters within their respective written terms of reference and/or limits of delegated authority, and yet without abdicating its responsibility. Please refer to the sections on Principles 4, 5, 7 and 11 in this report for further information on the activities of the NC, RC and ARC. Information on the activities of the CSR & CG Committee can be found under the ‘Corporate Social Responsibility’ section in this report. Board Processes Board and Committee meetings are held regularly, with the Board meeting no less than 4 times a year. The proposed meetings for the Board and all Committees for each new calendar year are set out in a schedule of meetings and notified to all Board members before the start of the calendar year with a view to facilitate attendance by Board members. Additional 32 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 meetings are convened as and when circumstances warrant. Records of all such meetings including discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken are maintained by the Company Secretary. The Company’s Articles of Association allow for the meetings of its Board and the Committees to be held via teleconferencing. The Board and the Committees may also make decisions by way of circulating resolutions. The attendance of the Directors at meetings of the Board and the Committees, as well as the frequency of such meetings during 2012, is disclosed below. Notwithstanding such disclosure, the Board is of the view that the contribution of each Director should not be focused only on his attendance at meetings of the Board and/or the Committees. A Director’s contribution also extends beyond the confines of the formal environment of such meetings, through the sharing of views, advice, experience and strategic networking relationships which would further the interests of the Company.

(3) Mr Chan Soon Hee Eric was appointed a Director and a member of the ARC on 26 July 2012. Board Approval The Board has in place an internal guide wherein certain key matters are specifically reserved for approval by the Board such as the setting of strategic direction or policies or financial objectives which have or may have material impact on the profitability or performance of the Group, decisions to commence, discontinue or modify significantly any business activity or to enter or withdraw from a particular market sector, corporate or financial restructuring, decisions over new borrowings or significant amendments to the terms and conditions of existing borrowings other than in the ordinary course of business, material acquisition and disposal of assets, adoption of corporate governance policies and any other matters which require Board approval as prescribed under the relevant legislations and regulations as well as the provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association. The BC comprises 5 Directors with the majority of its members being non-executive. The BC’s principal responsibility as set out in its written terms of reference, approved by the Board, is to assist the Board in the discharge of its duties by deliberating on matters requiring Board review that may arise between Board meetings. Its duties include, in particular, assisting the Board in approving banking-related matters such as the opening, closing and maintenance of banking accounts of the Company and the acceptance up to certain limits of banking facilities extended to the Company, operational matters relating to property development activities and other matters determined by the Board from time to time. Board Orientation and Training Every newly appointed Director receives a formal letter, setting out his general duties and obligations as a Director pursuant to the relevant legislations and regulations. The new Director will also receive an induction pack containing information and documents relating to the role and responsibilities of a director, the Group’s principal businesses, the Company’s Board processes and corporate governance practices, relevant company policies and procedures as well as a board meeting calendar for the year with a brief of the routine agenda for each meeting. The Company also conducts a comprehensive induction programme for newly appointed Directors and for existing Directors pursuant to their appointments to any of the Committees, which seeks to familiarise Directors with the Group’s principal businesses, the Company’s board processes, internal controls and governance practices. The induction programme includes meetings with various key executives of the Management to allow the new Directors to be acquainted with the Management team and to facilitate their independent access in future to the Management team. The programme also includes briefings by the Management team on key areas of the Company’s operations. Mr Tan Poay Seng and Mr Chan Soon Hee Eric, who were both appointed in 2012, were given detailed briefings by Senior Management in respect of the Group’s business and operations, and by the Company Secretary on the Company’s internal corporate governance practices, and director’s duties and responsibilities pursuant to relevant legislations. City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 33 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE In addition, Mr Chan Soon Hee Eric, who was appointed to the ARC, was also briefed by the Group General Manager, Chief Financial Officer and the Head of Internal Audit on internal controls and risk management as well as financial matters of the Group. The Directors are also provided with updates and/or briefings from time to time by professional advisers, auditors, Management and the Company Secretary in areas such as directors’ duties and responsibilities, corporate governance practices and changes in financial reporting standards. During 2012, the Board was also briefed by the Company Secretary on the 2012 Code, and its implications for the Company. The Directors are regularly kept informed by the Company Secretary of the availability of appropriate courses, conferences and seminars such as those conducted by the Singapore Institute of Directors, and the Directors are encouraged to attend such training at the Company’s expense. Two in-house seminars were conducted by invited speakers in 2012, one on key changes introduced by the 2012 Code and highlights on the Risk Governance for Listed Boards released in May 2012 and the other, on the changing tax landscape and developments in financial reporting standards. In addition to the training courses/programmes, Directors are also at liberty to approach Management should they require any further information or clarification concerning the Company’s operations. Principle 2: Board Composition and Guidance Board Independence The Board currently comprises 9 members. All members of the Board, except for the Chairman and the Managing Director, are non-executive Directors (“NEDs”). Of the 7 NEDs, the Board considers 6 of them, being more than half of the Board, to be independent, thus providing for a strong and independent element on the Board capable of exercising objective judgement on the corporate affairs of the Company. No individual or small group of individuals dominates the Board’s decision making. In addition to the annual review by the NC of the Directors’ independence, each independent NED also submits an annual declaration regarding his independence. The independent NEDs are Messrs Chee Keng Soon, Foo See Juan, Tang See Chim, Yeo Liat Kok Philip, Tan Poay Seng and Chan Soon Hee Eric. Mr Foo See Juan is a partner of a legal firm which is on the panel of the Company’s lawyers and renders professional legal services to the Group from time to time. Nevertheless, the NC and the Board (excluding Mr Foo in respect of the deliberation of his own independence) have considered Mr Foo to be independent as he is capable of maintaining his objectivity and independence at all times in the carrying out of his duties and responsibilities as an independent Director. All of the independent NEDs are also independent from the substantial shareholders of the Company, not being substantial shareholders themselves nor directly associated with any substantial shareholder. Board Composition and Size The NC reviews the size and composition of the Board and the Committees, and the skills and core competencies of the Board members annually. The Board comprises business leaders and professionals with real estate, hospitality, financial (including audit and accounting), legal and business management backgrounds. The members of the Board with their combined business, management and professional experience, knowledge and expertise, provide the core competencies to allow for diverse and objective perspectives on the Group’s business and direction. Taking into account the scope and nature of the operations of the Group, the Board is satisfied that the current composition and size of the Board provide for sufficient diversity and yet allow for effective decision making. NEDs’ Participation NEDs are encouraged to participate actively at Board meetings in the development of the Company’s strategic plans and direction, and in the review and monitoring of Management’s performance against targets. To facilitate this, they are kept informed of the Company’s businesses and performance through monthly and quarterly reports from the Management, and have unrestricted access to the Management. They also sit on various Committees established by the Board to provide constructive input and the necessary review and monitoring of performance of the Company and Management. Principle 3: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Role of Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer The Chairman of the Board, Mr Kwek Leng Beng, is also the Executive Chairman. Mr Kwek Leng Beng plays an instrumental role in providing the Company with strong leadership and vision, assisting the Board to develop policies and strategies, and ensuring that these are implemented effectively. As Chairman of the Board, he bears primary responsibility for the workings of the Board, by ensuring effectiveness on all aspects of its role including setting agenda for Board meetings with input from Management, ensuring that sufficient time is allocated for discussion of agenda items at Board meetings, promoting an open environment within the Board room for constructive debate, encouraging the NEDs to speak freely, and exercising control over the quality, quantity and timeliness of information flow between the Board and Management. At annual general meetings and other shareholders’ meetings, he plays a pivotal role in fostering constructive dialogue between shareholders, the Board and Management. As Executive Chairman, he is the most senior executive in the Company and bears executive responsibility for the Group’s business. 34 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Mr Kwek Leng Beng is assisted by his brother, Mr Kwek Leng Joo, the Managing Director of the Company, in charting broad direction, strategies and policies of the Group. The Managing Director also has charge of the overall co-ordination of the Management team for the effective implementation of business strategies and policies and is supported by the Group General Manager of the Company in the management of the day to day operations of the Group. The Group General Manager, Mr Chia Ngiang Hong, is not related to the Chairman or the Managing Director. The Board recognises that best practices of corporate governance advocate that the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer should in principle be separate persons to ensure an appropriate balance of power, increased accountability and greater capacity of the board for independent decision making. The Board also recognises that there may be instances where the two roles may be performed by one person for valid reasons, and that such a practice is not uncommon both locally and in other developed jurisdictions. The holding of the role of Executive Chairman by Mr Kwek Leng Beng, together with the strengths brought to this role by a person of Mr Kwek’s stature and experience, has been considered by the Board. With the establishment of various Committees with power and authority to perform key functions beyond the authority of, or without the undue influence from, the Chairman or the Managing Director, and the putting in place of internal controls to allow effective oversight by the Board of the Company’s business, the Board is of the view that these enable the Board to exercise objective decision making in the interests of the Company. The Board is further of the view that it is currently unnecessary to effect a separation of the roles of the Chairman of the Board from that of the Executive Chairman to facilitate the Group’s decision making and implementation process. Lead Independent Director Taking cognizance of the non-separation of the roles of the Chairman of the Board and the Executive Chairman, the Board has appointed Mr Chee Keng Soon as Lead Independent Director (“Lead ID”) to serve as a sounding board for the Chairman and also as an intermediary between the NEDs and the Chairman. The role of the Lead ID is set out under the written terms of reference for the Lead ID, which has been approved by the Board. Under the chairmanship of the Lead ID, a meeting of the independent NEDs was convened in February 2013 without the presence of Management or the Chairman. Principle 4: Board Membership NC Composition and Role 2 out of the 3 members of the NC, including the NC chairman, are independent. Please refer to the ‘Corporate Directory’ section of this AR for the composition of the NC. The NC’s responsibilities as set out in its written terms of reference approved by the Board, is to review all Board and Committee composition and membership, determine Director’s independence, evaluate performance of the Board as a whole, its Board Committees and the individual Directors, review appointments and resignations of Senior Management which includes the Executive Chairman, Managing Director, the Group General Manager, the Chief Financial Officer and other relevant senior management staff and review Directors’ training and continuous professional development programme. The Company Secretary maintains records of all NC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken. Re-nomination of Directors The NC reviews annually the nomination of the relevant Directors for re-election and re-appointment as well as the independence of Directors. When considering the nomination of Directors for re-election and re-appointment, the NC takes into account their contribution to the effectiveness of the Board (which includes their participation and candour at Board and Committee meetings) as well as their time commitment especially for Directors who have multiple board representations and also reviews their independence. The recommendation of the NC on the annual nomination of the Directors for reelection and re-appointment is submitted to the Board for decision and thereafter tabled at the annual general meeting of the Company for consideration and approval by shareholders. The Articles of Association of the Company provide that not less than one-third of the Directors for the time being, other than the Managing Director, shall retire as Directors at each annual general meeting of the Company (“AGM”). All new Directors appointed by the Board shall hold office until the next AGM, and are eligible for re-election at the said AGM. The Managing Director is appointed by the Board for such period (except that where an appointment is for a fixed term, such term shall not exceed five years) and upon such terms as the Board thinks fit. Excluding the Directors above 70 years of age who are subject to annual re-nomination, namely Mr Kwek Leng Beng, Mr Chee Keng Soon, Mr Foo See Juan and Mr Tang See Chim, the remaining Directors of the Company will retire about once in every two to three years. In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company, Mr Yeo Liat Kok Philip is due to retire by rotation at the forthcoming AGM (“2013 AGM”) and has offered himself for re-election at the 2013 AGM. Mr Chan Soon Hee Eric, being a Director appointed by the Board in 2012, will also retire and has offered himself for re-election at the 2013 AGM. City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 35 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Annual Review of Directors’ Independence The NC reviews the independence of Directors annually according to the criteria on independence set out in the internal guidelines on independence which are based on the 2005 Code. Based on the review, 6 out of the current 9 Directors are considered by the NC to be independent which is more than half of the Board, thus providing for a strong and independent element on the Board capable of exercising objective judgement on corporate affairs of the Company. When considering the independence of the Directors, the NC also reviews the Directors’ other directorships, the annual declaration by the independent NEDs regarding their independence, the Directors’ disclosures of interests in transactions in which they have a direct/indirect interest, their ability to avoid any apparent conflicts of interests especially by abstaining from deliberation on such transactions, and their ability to maintain objectivity in their conduct as Directors of the Company. Directors’ Time Commitments When considering the nomination of Directors for appointment or re-election/re-appointment, the NC also takes into account the competing time commitments faced by Directors with multiple board representations. An analysis of the directorships held by the Directors is reviewed annually by the NC. Each Director is also required to confirm annually to the NC as to whether he has any issue with competing time commitments which may impact his ability to provide sufficient time and attention to his duties as a Director of the Company. Based on the analysis, the Directors’ annual confirmation and the Directors’ commitments and contributions to the Company which is also evident in their level of attendance and participation at Board and Committee meetings, the NC is satisfied that all Directors are able to carry out and have been adequately carrying out their duties as a Director of the Company. Criteria and Process for Nomination and Selection of New Directors Selection of candidates to be considered for appointment as Directors is facilitated through recommendations from the Directors, Management or external parties including the Company’s contacts in related industries, and finance, legal and accounting professions. The NC meets with the shortlisted candidates to assess their suitability before formally considering and recommending them for appointment to the Board and where applicable, to the Committees. In reviewing and recommending to the Board any new Director appointments, the NC considers: (a) the candidate’s independence, in the case of the appointment of an independent NED; (b) the composition requirements for the Board and Committees (if the candidate is proposed to be appointed to any of the Committees); (c) the candidate’s age, track record, experience and capabilities and such other relevant factors as may be determined by the NC which would contribute to the Board’s collective skills; and (d) any competing time commitments if the candidate has multiple board representations. Key Information on Directors Please refer to the ‘Board of Directors’ section in the AR for key information on the Directors, and the Notice of AGM for Directors proposed for re-election and re-appointment at the 2013 AGM. Currently, no alternate Directors have been appointed in respect of any of the Directors. Succession Planning for the Board and Executive Chairman The Board believes in carrying out succession planning for itself and the Executive Chairman to ensure continuity of leadership. Board renewal is a continuing process and in this regard, the NC reviews the composition of the Board, which includes size and mix, annually and recommends to the Board the selection and appointment of new Directors, whether in addition to the existing Board members or as replacement of retiring Board members, with a view to identifying any gaps in the Board’s skills set taking into account the Group’s business operations. The Board will be able to function smoothly notwithstanding any resignation or retirement of any Director given the present number of members and mix of competencies on the Board. Principle 5: Board Performance Board Evaluation Process The Company has in place a formal process for assessment of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and the contribution by each Director to the effectiveness of the Board. The NC assesses the Board’s performance as a whole annually, using objective and appropriate quantitative and qualitative criteria which were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board. When assessing the overall Board performance, the NC takes into consideration the feedback from individual Directors on areas relating to the Board’s competencies and effectiveness. The results of the overall evaluation of the Board by the NC, including its recommendation, if any, for improvements, are presented to the Board. The annual evaluation process for the individual Director’s performance comprises three parts: (a) background information concerning the Director including his attendance records at Board and Committee meetings; (b) questionnaire for completion by each individual Board member; and (c) NC’s evaluation based on certain assessment parameters. The questionnaires 36 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 and the assessment parameters were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board. The completed questionnaires are then reviewed by the NC before the NC completes its evaluation of the individual Directors. When deliberating on the performance of a particular Director who is also a member of the NC, that member abstains from the discussions in order to avoid any conflict of interests. The results of the individual evaluation of the Directors are also used by the NC, in its consultation with the Chairman of the Board (who is also a member of the NC), to review, where appropriate, the composition of the Board and Committees, and to support its proposals, if any, for appointment of new members and its recommendations for the re-appointment and re-election of retiring Directors. Comments from the Directors, if any, concerning the Board as a whole and the general performance of the Directors, are also presented to the Board. Board Evaluation Criteria The qualitative criteria is set out in a questionnaire covering three main areas relating to board composition, roles and responsibilities, conduct of meetings and access to information. The quantitative criteria used to evaluate the overall Board performance comprises quarterly performance indicators which include a comparison of the Company’s performance (including segmental performance) for the financial period under review against the Company’s performance for the corresponding period in previous years and also vis-à-vis industry peers and industry averages, and other indicators such as the Company’s share price performance over a historical period and vis-à-vis industry peers. Individual Director Evaluation Criteria Factors taken into account in the assessment of a Director’s performance include his abilities and competencies, his objectivity and the level of participation at Board and Committee meetings including his contribution to Board processes and the business strategies and performance of the Group. Principle 6: Access to Information Complete, Adequate and Timely Information and Access to Management Prior to each meeting, members of the Board and the Committees are provided with the meeting agenda and the relevant papers submitted by the Management, containing complete, adequate and timely information to enable full deliberation on the issues to be considered at the respective meetings. Management, the Company’s auditors and professional advisers who can provide additional insight into the matters for discussion are also invited from time to time to attend such meetings. Directors have separate and independent access to Management. Draft agendas for Board and Committee meetings are circulated to the Chairman of the Board and the chairmen of the Committees respectively, in advance, for them to review and suggest items for the agenda. The Board and Committees are also furnished routine reports, where applicable, from the Management. Each of the chairmen of the ARC, NC and RC provides an annual report of the respective Committees’ activities during the year under review to the Board. The minutes of meetings of the Committees are circulated to all Board members. Company Secretary The Company Secretaries, whose appointment and removal are subject to Board’s approval, attend all Board and Committee meetings and ensure that all Board procedures are followed. The Company Secretaries, together with Management, also ensure that the Company complies with all applicable statutory and regulatory rules. Together with the Management, the Company Secretaries also advise the Board Chairman, the Board and Committees on corporate governance matters and assist to implement and strengthen corporate governance practices and processes, including facilitating orientation for newly appointed Directors and appointments to Committees, and continuing training and development for the Directors. On an ongoing basis, the Directors have separate and independent access to the Company Secretaries, whose duties and responsibilities are clearly defined. Independent Professional Advice The Directors, whether as a group or individually, are entitled to take independent professional advice at the expense of the Company, in furtherance of their duties and in the event that circumstances warrant the same. The Company has in place internal guidelines allowing the Directors to seek independent professional advice. REMUNERATION MATTERS Principle 7: Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies RC Composition and Role The RC comprises three NEDs, all of whom including the chairman of the RC are independent. The RC’s principal responsibilities as set out in its written terms of reference approved by the Board are to review and recommend, for the endorsement of the Board, a framework of remuneration and the specific remuneration packages for each Board member and the Company’s key management personnel (“KMP”). The Company has in place a remuneration framework for the Directors and the KMP. The Company currently identified the executive Directors and the Group General Manager who is City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 37 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE the most senior member of the Management team outside the Board as its KMP. On an annual basis, the RC reviews the annual increments, year-end and variable bonuses to be granted to the KMP. The Company Secretary maintains records of all RC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken. Principle 8: Level and Mix of Remuneration Remuneration of Directors and KMP In reviewing the remuneration packages of the KMP, the RC, with the assistance of the human resource advisers or consultants within and outside the Group, if required, considers the level of remuneration based on the Company’s remuneration policy which comprises the following distinct objectives: • to ensure that the remuneration packages are competitive in attracting and retaining employees capable of meeting the Company’s needs; • to reward employees for achieving corporate and individual performance targets in a fair and equitable way; and • to ensure that the remuneration reflects the employees’ duties and responsibilities. When reviewing the structure and level of Directors’ fees, the RC takes into consideration the Directors’ respective roles and responsibilities on the Board and Committees, changes in the business, corporate governance practices and regulatory roles and the impact of these changes on the Directors’ roles and responsibilities. Other factors taken into consideration in the fee review include the frequency of Board and Committee meetings, corporate performance for the financial year under review as well as the corporate and economic outlook in the new financial year, and the interval since the last fee review and changes. The comparability of the Company’s fee structure and level with other companies of comparable size and structure is also taken into account. No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration. Whilst the Company currently does not have a share option scheme in place, it will consider the establishment of other forms of longer term incentive schemes, as and when appropriate. The structure of the fees paid or payable to Directors of the Company for FY 2012 is as follows: Appointment Per annum Board of Directors Base fee $35,000 Audit & Risk Committee ARC Chairman’s fee $55,000* ARC Member’s fee $45,000* Nominating Committee NC Chairman’s fee $6,000 NC Member’s fee $4,000 Remuneration Committee RC Chairman’s fee $6,000 RC Member’s fee $4,000 Lead Independent Director's fee $10,000** * The RC has recommended that the ARC Chairman’s fee and ARC Member’s fee for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 be increased from $55,000 to $70,000 and from $45,000 to $55,000 respectively. ** Following the appointment of the Lead ID in February 2012, the RC has recommended a fee of $10,000 per annum. Principle 9: Disclosure of Remuneration Disclosure of Remuneration The total compensation packages for employees including the Executive Chairman, the Managing Director and the Group General Manager comprise a fixed component (in the form of a base salary and fixed allowances) and a variable component (which includes year-end and variable bonuses, and benefits-in-kind, where applicable), taking into account amongst other factors, the individual’s performance, the performance of the Group and industry practices. Each of the Directors receives a base Director’s fee. Directors who serve on the various Committees (other than the BC and the CSR & CG Committee) also receive additional fees in respect of each Committee that they serve on, with the chairmen of the Committees (other than the BC and the CSR & CG Committee) receiving a higher fee in respect of their service as chairman of the Committee. 38 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 The breakdown (in percentage terms) of the Directors’ remuneration for FY 2012 is set out below.

ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT Principle 10: Accountability Accountability of the Board and Management The Board provides shareholders with quarterly and annual financial results. Results for the first, second and third quarters are released to shareholders within 45 days of the end of each quarter whilst annual results are released within 60 days from the financial year end. In presenting the Group’s annual and quarterly results, the Board aims to provide shareholders with a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s performance and financial position with a commentary at the date of the announcement of the significant trends and competitive conditions of the industry in which it operates. For the financial year under review, the Chief Financial Officer provided assurance to the ARC on the integrity of the quarterly City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 39 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE unaudited financial statements and the Board in turn provided a negative assurance confirmation in respect of the unaudited financial statements for the first, second and third quarters in accordance with the regulatory requirements. The Management provides all Directors with monthly financial summary of the Group’s performance. Principle 11: Audit & Risk Committee Composition of the ARC The ARC comprises four NEDs, all of whom including the chairman of the ARC are independent. The chairman of the ARC and at least one other member of the ARC possess the relevant audit, accounting or related financial management expertise and experience, whilst the remaining members of the ARC have legal backgrounds. With the current composition, the ARC believes that it has the relevant accounting and related financial management expertise and experience to discharge its functions within its written terms of reference which has been approved by the Board. Powers and Duties of the ARC The ARC is authorised by the Board to investigate any matters it deems appropriate within its terms of reference and has direct and unrestricted access to the external auditors and the internal auditors. It may invite any Director, Management, officer or employee of the Company to attend its meetings. It is also authorised to engage any firm of accountants, lawyers or other professionals as it sees fit to provide independent counsel and advice to assist in the review or investigation on such matters within its terms of reference as it deems appropriate at the Company’s expense. The principal responsibility of the ARC is to assist the Board in maintaining a high standard of corporate governance, particularly by providing an independent review of the effectiveness of the Group’s financial reporting process (including reviewing the accounting policies and practices of the Company and the Group on a consolidated basis) and key internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance, information technology (“IT”) and risk management controls. Other duties within its written terms of reference include: • to review with Management and, where appropriate, with the external auditors the quarterly and full year financial statements to be issued by the Group before their submission to the Board to ensure their completeness, consistency and fairness; • to review the integrity of the financial statements of the Company to be announced or reported and any other formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial performance; • to review and approve the annual audit plans of the external and internal auditors; • to review, on an annual basis, the scope and results of the external audit and its cost-effectiveness and the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, and also to review on a periodic basis the nature and extent of any non-audit services provided by the external auditors to the Group; • to assess the role and effectiveness of the internal audit (“IA”) function in the overall context of the Group’s internal controls and risk management systems; • to review annually with Management, the internal and external auditors the results of their review and evaluation of the Company’s internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance and IT controls, and risk management policies and systems and report to the Board annually the adequacy and effectiveness of such internal controls; • to make recommendations to the Board on the nomination for the appointment, re-appointment and removal of external auditors, and to approve the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors; • to approve the appointment, resignation or dismissal of the Head of IA; • to review interested person transactions falling within the scope of Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual; and • to review the Company’s whistle-blowing policy and arrangements put in place for raising concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or any other matters. The ARC held 7 meetings during the year and carried out its duties as set out within its terms of reference. The Company Secretary maintains records of all ARC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken. The ARC meets with the internal and external auditors, each separately without the presence of Management, annually. For the financial year under review, the ARC conducted a self-assessment of its own effectiveness in the discharge of its roles and responsibilities. The assessment was facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist (“ARC SelfAssessment Checklist”) based on the guidance from the Guidebook for Audit Committees in Singapore issued in October 2008 (“ACGC Guidebook”). 40 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 The ARC Self-Assessment Checklist covered the ARC terms of reference, composition, meetings, training and resources, financial reporting, internal financial controls and risk management systems, internal and external audit processes, whistleblowing, relationships with the Board, communication with shareholders and contribution of ARC members to the ARC’s deliberation and decision making process. Based on the self-assessment, the ARC believes that it has fulfilled its responsibilities and discharged its duties as set out in its terms of reference. External Auditors Taking cognizance that the external auditors should be free from any business or other relationships with the Group that could materially interfere with their ability to act with integrity and objectivity, the ARC undertook a review of the independence of KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) and gave careful consideration to the Group’s relationships with them during 2012. In determining the independence of KPMG, the ARC reviewed all aspects of their relationships with them including the processes, policies and safeguards adopted by the Group and KPMG relating to audit independence. The ARC also considered the nature of the provision of the non-audit services in 2012 and the corresponding fees and is of the opinion that such non-audit fees did not impair or threaten the audit independence. Based on the review, the ARC is of the opinion that KPMG is, and is perceived to be, independent for the purpose of the Group’s statutory financial audit. For details of the fees paid and/or payable by the Group in respect of audit and non-audit services for FY 2012, please refer to note 29 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. In reviewing the nomination of KPMG for re-appointment for the financial year ending 31 December 2013, the ARC had considered the adequacy of the resources, experience and competence of KPMG. Consideration was also given to the experience of the engagement partner and key team members in handling the audit of multi-listed entities under different jurisdictions and in the real estate and hospitality segments. The size and complexity of the audit of the Group, and the number and experience of the supervisory and professional staff assigned were taken into account. The ARC had also considered the audit team’s ability to work in a co-operative manner with Management whilst maintaining integrity and objectivity and to deliver their services professionally and within agreed time-lines. KPMG has confirmed that they are registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. The Company is thus in compliance with Rule 712 and Rule 715 (read with Rule 716) of the Listing Manual in relation to the appointment of its auditors. On the basis of the above, the ARC has recommended to the Board the nomination of KPMG for re-appointment as external auditors at the 2013 AGM. Interested person transactions On 29 May 2003, the Company obtained shareholders’ approval for the Company, its subsidiaries and its associated companies not listed on the SGX-ST or an approved exchange, over which the Company, its subsidiaries and/or interested persons have control, to enter into transactions within the categories of Interested Person Transactions set out in the Company’s circular to shareholders dated 28 April 2003, with such persons within the class or classes of Interested Persons as described in the said circular, provided that such transactions are entered into in accordance with the review procedures set out in the said circular (the “IPT Mandate”). The IPT Mandate was last renewed by the shareholders on 27 April 2012 and given that such Interested Person Transactions are expected to occur with some degree of frequency and may arise at any time, and to allow the Group to undertake such transactions in an expeditious manner, shareholders’ approval will be sought at the 2013 AGM of the Company for the renewal of the IPT Mandate. The ARC has confirmed that an independent financial adviser’s opinion is not required for the renewal of the IPT Mandate as the methods and procedures for determining the transaction prices of the Interested Person Transactions conducted under the IPT Mandate have not changed since the IPT Mandate was obtained on 29 May 2003, and such methods and procedures continue to be sufficient to ensure that these Interested Person Transactions will be carried out on normal commercial terms and will not be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority shareholders. City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 41 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Particulars of interested person transactions required to be disclosed under Rule 907 of the Listing Manual are as follows: Interested Persons Aggregate value of all interested person Aggregate value of all interested person transactions in FY 2012 (excluding transactions conducted in FY 2012 under transactions less than $100,000 and the IPT Mandate pursuant to Rule 920 transactions conducted under the IPT (excluding transactions less than $100,000) Mandate pursuant to Rule 920) $’000 $’000 Hong Leong 291,705* Property-related 26,811 Investment (a) provision to interested Holdings Pte.

These transactions were announced pursuant to Rule 916(2). ** The figure comprise the value of transaction of the sale of property units in the Group’s development project to a relative of a Director of the Company, which transaction was announced on 22 January 2013. The above interested person transactions were carried out on normal commercial terms and were not prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority shareholders. Whistle-blowing Policy CDL has in place a whistle-blowing procedure where staff of the Company and other persons can raise in confidence, whether anonymously or otherwise, concerns on possible improprieties relating to accounting, financial reporting, internal controls and auditing matters as well as any breach of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, without fear of reprisals in any form. The ARC has the responsibility of overseeing this policy which is administered with the assistance of the Head of IA. Under these procedures, arrangements are in place for independent investigation of such matters raised and for appropriate follow-up action to be taken. The Company is committed to maintaining procedures for the confidential and anonymous submission of reports and the anonymity of the whistle-blower concerned will be maintained where so requested by the whistle-blower who lodged the report. Investigations of such reports will be handled on a confidential basis to the extent permissible or deemed appropriate under the circumstances, and involve persons who need to be involved in order to properly carry out the investigation and will, on a best efforts basis, be carried out in a timely manner. In order to facilitate and encourage the reporting of such matters, the policy was amended in 2011 to provide for dedicated communication channels which include a whistle-blowing email account at cdl.ethics.hotline@cdl.com.sg and specific 42 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 contact numbers which are secure. Details on the dedicated channels of communication have also been made available on the Company’s website in 2012. The whistle-blowing policy, which is reviewed by the ARC from time to time to ensure that it remains current, is available on the Company’s website and intranet and is easily accessible by all employees and other persons. The ARC has also recently approved the guidelines set out in the Whistle-blowing Investigation Procedures which formalises the procedures for investigating reports received and for taking appropriate follow-up action. Principle 12: Internal Controls Internal Controls The Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility to ensure proper financial reporting for the Group and effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance and IT controls, and risk management policies and systems. The boards of the Group’s separately listed subsidiaries are responsible for the oversight of their respective groups’ internal controls and risk management systems and the Directors rely on the Company’s nominees to the boards of these listed subsidiaries to provide oversight together with the other board members of these listed subsidiaries on the adoption and implementation of appropriate corporate governance practices, internal controls and risk management systems. The internal controls structure of the Group has been designed and put in place by the Group’s business units to provide reasonable assurance against material financial misstatements or loss, for the safeguarding of assets, for the maintenance of proper accounting records, for the provision of financial and other information with integrity, reliability and relevance, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, no internal controls system can provide absolute assurance in view of inherent limitations of any internal controls system against the occurrence of human and system errors, poor judgement in decision making, losses, fraud or other irregularities. The Company’s approach to risk management is set out in the “Risk Management” section on pages 46 to 48 of the AR. As part of the internal and external audit program, the IA and the external auditors report to the ARC any audit findings relating to internal controls, and the ARC reviews the adequacy of the actions taken by Management to address the recommendations of the IA and the external auditors. The ARC reviewed the adequacy of the Group’s internal controls that address the Group’s financial, operational, compliance and IT risks, with the assistance of the internal and external auditors and the Management. Based on the work performed by IA during the financial year, as well as the statutory audit by the external auditors, and the written assurance from Management, the Board, with the concurrence of the ARC, is of the opinion that the system of internal controls in place as at 31 December 2012 is adequate to address in all material respects the financial, operational, compliance and IT risks within the current scope of the Group’s business operations. Management will continue to review and strengthen the Group’s control environment and devote resources and expertise towards improving its internal policies and procedures to maintain a high level of governance and internal controls. Principle 13: Internal Audit Reporting Line and Qualification The IA function is independent of the activities it audits. The Head of IA’s primary reporting line is to the chairman of the ARC with an administrative line of reporting to the Managing Director of the Company. The appointment, resignation and dismissal of the Head of IA is reviewed and approved by the ARC. The ARC also provides input on the annual performance appraisal of the Head of IA. The ARC meets the Head of IA at least once annually without the presence of Management. The Head of IA has unfettered access to the ARC, the Board and Management. IA operates within the framework stated in its IA Charter which is approved by the ARC and reviewed on an annual basis. The standards of the IA Charter are consistent with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by The Institute of Internal Auditors. The Head of IA and Audit Managers are all Certified Internal Auditors accredited by The Institute of Internal Auditors. Role and Activities of IA The primary role of IA is to assist the Board to evaluate the reliability, adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management processes of the Company, reviewing the internal controls of the Company to ensure prompt and accurate recording of transactions and proper safeguarding of assets and reviewing that the Company complies with the relevant laws, regulations and policies established by the Company. The ARC approved the annual IA plan in February 2012 and received regular reports during 2012 on the progress of the audit work under the IA plan. All IA reports are given to the ARC, the Chairman of the Board, the Managing Director, Group General Manager, Chief Financial Officer, Company Secretary and the heads of the relevant departments. IA observations on control, operational and human lapses and recommendations to address them were also reviewed and discussed at ARC meetings. The ARC was satisfied that recommendations made were dealt with by the Management in a timely manner, with outstanding exceptions or recommendations being closely monitored and reported back to the ARC. City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 43 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The ARC reviewed the effectiveness and adequacy of the IA function through a review of the IA activities on a quarterly basis as well as its annual assessment of the IA function. The assessment was facilitated through the use of an evaluation framework modeled on the framework recommended in the ACGC Guidebook. The evaluation framework is comprehensive and covers IA organisation, resources and continuing training, audit plans work scope, quality of reports and recommendations, IA Charter and IA internal control assessment. Based on the assessment, the ARC is satisfied with the quality and effectiveness of the IA function and that the IA function is currently adequately resourced and has appropriate standing within the Group to perform its functions properly. COMMUNICATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS Principle 14: Communication with Shareholders The Company announces its quarterly and full-year results within the mandatory period. The financial statements and other presentation materials presented at the Company’s general meetings, including material and price-sensitive information, are disseminated and publicly released via SGXNET on a timely basis. All shareholders of the Company receive the annual report of the Company and the notice of AGM, which notice is also advertised in the press and released via SGXNET. Shareholders and investors can access information on the Company at its website at www.cdl.com.sg which provides, inter alia, corporate announcements, press releases and the latest financial results as disclosed by the Company on SGXNET. From time to time, the Company’s Senior Management holds briefings with analysts and the media to coincide with the release of the Group’s half-year and full-year results. Media presentation slides are also released on SGXNET and available on the Company’s website. In addition, the Management takes an active role in investor relations, meeting local and foreign fund managers regularly as well as participating in roadshows and conferences both locally and overseas. Further, the Company has formalised its dividend policy which aims to provide a return to shareholders at least once a year through the payment of dividends, after taking into account the Group’s financial performance, short and long term capital requirements, future investment plans, general global and business economic conditions and any regulatory factors. The Board endeavours to maintain a balance between meeting shareholders’ expectations and prudent capital management with a sustainable dividend policy. The Board will review the dividend policy from time to time and reserves the right to modify, amend and update the policy. Principle 15: Greater Shareholder Participation At general meetings of the Company, shareholders are given the opportunity to communicate their views and encouraged to ask the Directors and the Management questions regarding matters affecting the Company. The chairmen of the ARC, NC and RC and the external auditors were present at the last AGM, and will endeavour to be present at the 2013 AGM to assist the Directors in addressing queries raised by the shareholders. The Company provides for separate resolutions at general meetings on each substantial issue, including treating the reelection or re-appointment of each Director as a separate subject matter. Detailed information on each item in the AGM agenda is provided in the explanatory notes to the notice of AGM in the AR. The Company also maintains minutes of the AGM, which includes the key comments and queries raised by shareholders and the responses from the Board, Management and/or the external auditors. In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company, shareholders may appoint one or two proxies to attend and vote at general meetings in their absence. All shareholders are allowed to vote in person or by proxy. CPF investors of the Company’s securities may attend shareholders’ meetings as observers provided they have submitted their requests to do so through their agent banks within a specified timeframe. As the authentication of shareholder identity information and other related integrity issues still remain a concern, the Company has decided, for the time being, not to implement voting in absentia by mail or electronic means. Pursuant to the Articles of Association of the Company, all resolutions put to the vote at a general meeting of the Company shall be decided on a show of hands unless before or upon the declaration of the result, a poll is demanded as follows: (i) by the Chairman of the meeting; or (ii) by not less than five members present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting; or (iii) by a member or members present in person or by proxy and representing not less than 10 per cent. of the total voting rights of all members having the right to vote at the meeting; or (iv) by a member or members present in person or by proxy and representing not less that 10 per cent. of the total number of paid-up shares of the Company (excluding treasury shares). The Chairman of the Meeting will be exercising his rights under Article 56 of the Company’s Articles of Association for all resolutions proposed at the 2013 AGM and at any adjournment thereof to be put to the vote by way of poll. Accordingly, each resolution at the 2013 AGM will be voted on by way of a poll. In support of greater transparency and to allow for a more efficient voting system, the Company had introduced electronic poll voting instead of voting by show of hands at the 2012 AGM and would continue to do so in respect of all resolutions proposed at the 2013 AGM. With electronic poll voting, shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the 44 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 meeting will be entitled to vote on a ‘one-share, one-vote’ basis. The voting results of all votes cast in respect of each resolution will also be instantaneously displayed at the meeting and announced via SGXNET after the 2013 AGM. The rules including voting procedures that govern general meetings of shareholders are attached with the notice of the 2013 AGM. Corporate Values and Conduct of Business The Board and Senior Management are committed to conducting business with integrity and consistent with high standards of business ethics, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements. The Company has adopted an internal code of business conduct and ethics which sets out the Company’s ethical values and business principles and provides a communicable and understandable framework for staff to observe these values and principles such as honesty, integrity, responsibility and accountability at all levels of the organisation.

These policies are available on the Company’s intranet and have also been disseminated to officers and employees of the Group’s key subsidiaries. Internal Code on Dealings in Securities The Company has in place an internal code on securities trading which sets out the implications of insider trading and provides guidance and internal regulation with regard to dealings in the Company’s securities by its Directors and officers. These guidelines prohibit dealing in the Company’s securities (a) on short-term considerations, (b) while in possession of unpublished material price-sensitive information in relation to such securities, and (c) during the “closed period”, which is defined as two weeks before the date of announcement of results for the first, second and third quarter of the Company’s financial year and one month before the date of announcement of the full-year financial results, and ending on the date of the announcement of the relevant results.

Except to the extent required to obtain the United Kingdom Inland Revenue approval, the Approved and Unapproved parts of the M&C 2003 Scheme are in all material aspects identical.

Under the terms of the LTIP, M&C is permitted to make both Performance Share Awards and Deferred Share Bonus Awards to an employee (including an executive director) of M&C or its subsidiaries. The level of awards made under the terms of the LTIP are determined by M&C’s Remuneration Committee. Vesting of Performance Share Awards is subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets. For awards made in 2006 to 2010, earnings per share (EPS) targets were chosen so that participants are incentivised to deliver significant earnings growth. In 2011, the Remuneration Committee amended the performance conditions so that half of the awards are subject to EPS growth targets and half are subject to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) targets. The revised performance targets are designed to incentivise management to deliver significant earnings growth and align the interests of management with shareholders. The performance condition applying to Performance Share Awards require M&C’s EPS to grow, in real terms, over a period of three consecutive financial years after award. Performance Share Awards will vest on the third anniversary of the award being made, subject to the EPS growth targets being met. TSR targets measure M&C relative TSR performance over a three-year period against a comparator group comprising companies in the FTSE 250 index participating companies (excluding investment trusts). Awards will not be subject to re-testing. During the financial year under review, Performance Share Awards were made over 673,455 ordinary shares of £0.30 each in M&C.

Management’s responsibility for the financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act, Chapter 50 (the Act) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair profit and loss accounts and balance sheets and to maintain accountability of assets. Auditors’ responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Act and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2012 and the results, changes in equity and cash flows of the Group for the year ended on that date. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiaries incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the Company’s functional currency. All financial information has been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. Information about critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are described in the following note: Note 2.2 Assessment of ability to control or exert significant influence over partly-owned investments Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year are described in the following notes: Note 2.18 Measurement of profit attributable to properties under development Note 2.21 Estimation of provisions for current and deferred taxation Notes 3 and 4 Measurement of recoverable amounts of property, plant and equipment and investment properties Note 5 Measurement of recoverable amounts of investments in and balances with subsidiaries Note 8 Impairment of available-for-sale equity investments Note 10 Measurement of realisable amounts of development properties Note 23 Valuation of defined benefit obligations Note 37 Valuation of financial instruments that are not actively traded The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities.

In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in the income statement. Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in the income statement. For non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets in the event of liquidation, the Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure them at fair value, or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, at the acquisition date. All other non-controlling interests are measured at acquisition-date fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in another standard. When share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are exchanged for awards held by the acquiree’s employees (acquiree’s awards) and relate to past services, then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer’s replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based value of the replacement awards compared with the market-based value of the acquiree’s awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to past and/or future service. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance. Upon the loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in the income statement. If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equityaccounted investee or as an available-for-sale financial asset depending on the level of influence retained. Associates and jointly-controlled entities Associates are companies in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over their financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. Jointly-controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. Associates and jointly-controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost. The cost of the investments includes transaction cost. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of associates and jointly-controlled entities, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases. 100 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.2 Basis of consolidation (cont’d) Associates and jointly-controlled entities (cont’d) When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate or a jointly-controlled entity, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate or jointly-controlled entity) is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee. Jointly-controlled assets Joint venture arrangements which involve the use of the assets that are jointly-controlled (whether or not owned jointly), without the establishment of a separate entity, are referred to as jointly-controlled assets. The Group recognises its interests in jointly-controlled assets using proportionate consolidation. The Group combines its share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the joint venture with the similar items, line by line, in its consolidated financial statements. Consistent accounting policies are applied for like transactions and events in similar circumstances. The joint venture is proportionately consolidated until the date on which the Group ceases to have joint control over the jointly-controlled assets. Acquisitions of non-controlling interests Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the adjustment to non-controlling interests and the fair value of consideration paid is recognised directly in equity and presented as part of equity attributable to owners of the Company. Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income or expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly-controlled entities are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Accounting for subsidiaries, associates and jointly-controlled entities by the Company Investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly-controlled entities are stated in the Company’s statement of financial position at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 2.3 Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currencies at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 101 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.3 Foreign currencies (cont’d) Foreign currency transactions (cont’d) Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currencies at the exchange rates at the date on which their fair values were determined. Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, except for differences arising on the translation of monetary items that in substance form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign operation (see below), available-for-sale equity instruments, a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation (see below) or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, excluding goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Singapore dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Singapore dollars at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations on or after 1 January 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. For acquisitions prior to 1 January 2005, the exchange rates at the date of acquisition were used. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. However, if the foreign operation is a non-wholly owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to the non-controlling interests. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or jointly-controlled entity that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to the income statement. Net investment in a foreign operation When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised in other comprehensive income, and are presented within equity in the foreign currency translation reserve. When the foreign operation is disposed of, the cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation reserve is transferred to the income statement as part of profit or loss on disposal. Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation Foreign currency differences arising on the translation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the Group’s net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective, and are presented within equity in the foreign currency translation reserve. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, such differences are recognised in the income statement. When the hedged net investment is disposed of, the cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation reserve is transferred to the income statement as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal. 102 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.4 Property, plant and equipment Owned assets Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the cost of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located, and capitalised borrowing costs. Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised net in the income statement. Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure is recognised in the carrying amount of the asset if it is probable that future economic benefits embodied within the expenditure will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. All other subsequent expenditure are recognised in the income statement when incurred. Depreciation No depreciation is provided on freehold and 999-year leasehold land. For freehold and leasehold properties under development and renovation-in-progress, no depreciation is provided until these items have been completed. Depreciation is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives (or lease term, if shorter) of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows: Freehold and leasehold land and buildings • Core component of hotel buildings – 50 years, or lease term if shorter • Surface finishes and services of hotel buildings – 30 years, or lease term if shorter • Leasehold land (other than 999-year leasehold land) – Lease term Furniture, fittings, plant and equipment and improvements – 3 to 20 years Residual values ascribed to the core component of hotel buildings depend on the nature, location and tenure of each hotel property. No residual values are ascribed to surface finishes and services of hotel buildings. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each reporting date. 2.5 Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill and negative goodwill arise on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and jointly-controlled entities. Acquisitions prior to 1 January 2001 Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree. Goodwill and negative goodwill on acquisitions were written off against reserves in the year of acquisition. Goodwill and negative goodwill that had previously been taken to reserves are not taken to the income statement when (a) the business is disposed of or (b) the goodwill is impaired. City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 103 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.5 Intangible assets (cont’d) Acquisitions occurring between 1 January 2001 and 1 January 2005 There was no goodwill arising from acquisition of subsidiaries occurring between 1 January 2001 and 1 January 2005. Acquisitions occurring between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2009 Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented in intangible assets. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates and jointly-controlled entities is presented together with investments in associates and jointly-controlled entities. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, and tested for impairment (Note 2.12). Negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement. Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010 Goodwill represents the excess of: • the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus • the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus • if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree, over the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented in intangible assets. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates and jointly-controlled entities is presented together with investments in associates and jointly-controlled entities. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, and tested for impairment (Note 2.12). When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Other intangible assets (comprise mainly technology, trade name and customer relationship), are amortised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 15 years, from the date on which they are available for use. 2.6 Investment properties Investment properties are properties held either to earn rental income or capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, or used in the production nor those used for the supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes. Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on disposal of an investment property are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of investment property, and are recognised net in the income statement. Depreciation No depreciation is provided on freehold and 999-year leasehold land included in the investment properties. Depreciation is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives (or lease terms, if shorter) of each component of the investment properties. 104 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.6 Investment properties (cont’d) The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold and leasehold properties – 50 years, or lease term if shorter Leasehold land (other than 999-year leasehold land) – Lease term ranging from 85 to 97 years Furniture, fittings, plant and equipment and improvements – 3 to 20 years Depreciation methods and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each reporting date. Transfers Transfers to, or from, investment properties are made where there is a change in use, evidenced by: • commencement of owner-occupation, for a transfer from investment properties to property, plant and equipment; • commencement of development with a view to sell, for a transfer from investment properties to development properties; and • end of owner-occupation, for a transfer from property, plant and equipment to investment properties. 2.7 Leased assets Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Other leases are operating leases, and except for investment properties and lease premium prepayment, the leased assets are not recognised in the statement of financial position. Lease premium prepayment relates to upfront premium paid in respect of long leasehold land where substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are not anticipated to pass to the Group. It is classified appropriately between current and non-current assets and is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Interest attributable to finance the purchase of lease of land is capitalised to the cost of lease. 2.8 Financial instruments Non-derivative financial assets The Group initially recognises loans and receivables on the date that they are originated. All other financial assets (including assets designated at fair value through profit or loss) are recognised initially on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Group has the following categories of non-derivative financial assets: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available-for-sale financial assets. City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 105 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.8 Financial instruments (cont’d) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset is classified at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held for trading or is designated as such upon initial recognition. Financial assets are designated at fair value through profit or loss if the Group manages such investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy. Upon initial recognition, attributable transaction costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in the income statement. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Loans and receivables comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables excluding prepayments and tax recoverable, and other non-current assets excluding deferred tax assets, deferred expenditure, prepayment and intangible assets. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and bank deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified in any of the above categories of financial assets. The Group’s investments in certain equity securities and certain debt securities are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses (see note 2.12) and foreign currency differences on available-for-sale monetary items (see note 2.3), are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the fair value reserve. When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement. Where an investment in equity securities classified as available for sale does not have a quoted market price in an active market and other methods of determining fair value do not result in a reasonable estimate, the investment is measured at cost less impairment losses. Non-derivative financial liabilities The Group initially recognises all financial liabilities on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Group has the following non-derivative financial liabilities: borrowings, other liabilities and trade and other payables excluding deferred income and derivative financial liabilities. Such financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 106 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.8 Financial instruments (cont’d) Derivative financial instruments, including hedging activities The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in the income statement when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described below. Cash flow hedges When a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, then the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the income statement (i.e. when interest income or expense is recognised). For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, then the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement. Separable embedded derivatives Changes in the fair value of separable embedded derivatives are recognised immediately in the income statement. Other non-trading derivatives When a derivative financial instrument is not designated in a hedge relationship that qualifies for hedge accounting, all changes in its fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement. 2.9 Interest-free intercompany loans Loans to subsidiaries Intercompany loans to subsidiaries for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and are, in substance, a part of the Company’s net investment in those subsidiaries, are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Such balances are eliminated in full in the consolidated financial statements. City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 107 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.10 Development properties Development properties are those properties which are held with the intention of development and sale in the ordinary course of business. They are stated at the lower of cost plus, where appropriate, a portion of attributable profit, and estimated net realisable value, net of progress billings. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs to be incurred in selling the property. The cost of properties under development comprise specifically identified costs, including acquisition costs, development expenditure, borrowing costs and other related expenditure. Borrowing costs payable on loans funding a development property are also capitalised, on a specific identification basis, as part of the cost of the development property until the completion of development. 2.11 Consumable stocks Consumable stocks comprise principally food and beverage and other hotel related consumable stocks. Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a first-in first-out principle. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. 2.12 Impairment Impairment of non-derivative financial assets A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more loss events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably. An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. An impairment loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset is the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any principal repayment and amortisation, and the current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement. Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. All impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses on available-for-sale financial asset are recognised by transferring the cumulative loss that has been recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the fair value reserve in equity, to the income statement. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. For financial assets measured at amortised cost and available-for-sale debt securities, the reversal is recognised in the income statement. For available-for-sale financial assets that are equity securities, an impairment loss once recognised in the income statement is not reversed through the income statement. Any subsequent increase in fair value of such assets is recognised in other comprehensive income. Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than development properties, consumable stocks and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets’ recoverable amounts are estimated. For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date, and as and when indicators of impairment are identified. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value-in-use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cash-generating unit. 108 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.12 Impairment (cont’d) Impairment of non-financial assets (cont’d) An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that largely are independent from other assets and groups. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 2.13 Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are remeasured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Thereafter generally the assets, or disposal group, are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to consumable stocks, financial assets, deferred tax assets and investment properties, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the income statement. Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss. Property, plant and equipment and investment property once classified as held for sale are not depreciated. 2.14 Share capital Ordinary shares Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. Preference shares Preference shares are classified as equity if they are non-redeemable, or are redeemable only at the option of the Company and dividend payments are discretionary. Dividends thereon are recognised as distributions within equity. Dividends on non-redeemable preference shares are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared. 2.15 Employee benefits Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 109 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.15 Employee benefits (cont’d) Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply to any plan in the Group. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the income statement. The Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income and all expenses related to defined benefit plans in the income statement. Other long-term employee benefits The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits, other than pension plans is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in current and prior periods. The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. Share-based payment transactions The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its equity instruments of the Group entities are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Group. 110 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.15 Employee benefits (cont’d) Share-based payment transactions (cont’d) Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employees as measured at the date of modification. Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally. 2.16 Provisions A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost. Beijing indemnity A provision for tax indemnity to the former shareholders of Grand Millennium Beijing which the Group acquired an additional 40% interest in 2010. Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. Capital expenditure A provision for capital expenditure is recognised for the Group’s contractual obligation to incur capital expenditure under the terms of the hotel operating agreements. Legal Provision for legal fees is recognised in relation to disputes in several United States hotels, credit card issues and management contract disagreement. Dilapidation Provision for dilapidation costs is recognised in respect of the expected costs to be incurred on termination of a leasehold asset. 2.17 Financial guarantee contracts Financial guarantees are financial instruments issued by the Group that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for the loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to meet payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are accounted for as insurance contracts. A provision is recognised based on the Group’s estimate of the ultimate cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the reporting date. The provision is assessed by reviewing individual claims and tested for adequacy by comparing the amount recognised and the amount that would be required to settle the guarantee contract. City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 111 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.18 Revenue recognition Development properties for sale Revenue from sales of development properties is recognised using the percentage of completion method when the Group determines that (a) control and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the work-in-progress transfer to the buyer in its current state as construction progresses, (b) sales price is fixed and collectible, (c) the percentage of completion can be measured reliably, (d) there is no significant uncertainty as to the ability of the Group to complete the development, and (e) costs incurred or to be incurred can be measured reliably. In all other instances, revenue from sales of development properties is only recognised upon the transfer of control and significant risks and rewards of ownership of the property to the buyer. This generally coincides with the point in time when the development unit is delivered to the buyer. No revenue is recognised when there is significant uncertainty as to the collectibility of consideration due or the possible return of units sold. The percentage of completion is measured by reference to the work performed, based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs. Profits are recognised only in respect of finalised sales contracts to the extent that such profits relate to the progress of the construction work. Rental and car park income Rental income (net of any lease incentives) is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals, which include gross turnover rental, are recognised as income in the accounting period on a receipt basis. Car park income is recognised on an accrual basis. Hotel income Revenue from hotel operations is recognised on an accrual basis, upon rendering of the relevant services. Dividends Dividend income is recognised in the income statement when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established. 2.19 Operating leases Where the Group has the use of assets under operating leases, payments made under the leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease payments made. Contingent rentals are charged to the income statement in the accounting period in which they are incurred. 2.20 Finance income and costs Finance income comprises mainly interest income on funds invested and mark-to-market gain on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Finance costs comprise mainly interest expense on borrowings, amortisation of transaction costs capitalised, mark-tomarket loss on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and loss on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement. All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method, except to the extent that they are capitalised as being directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset which necessarily takes a substantial period of time to be prepared for its intended use or sale. 112 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.21 Income tax Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, jointly-controlled entities and associates to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements about future events. New information may become available that causes the Group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such a determination is made. 2.22 Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for the dilutive effect arising from the conversion of the non-redeemable convertible non-cumulative preference shares. 2.23 Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the board of directors to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.

The piece of land in India was impaired following a decision by the management of the M&C Group not to proceed with building two hotels as a result of changing market conditions. For the remaining hotels, the estimates of recoverable amounts were based on the value-in-use of the said properties determined by either professional valuers or management of the M&C Group using discount rates ranging from 10.5% to 14.0%. In addition, the Group reversed impairment loss of $2,313,000 in 2011 which was recognised in prior years in respect of one hotel in United States of America held by the M&C Group due to improved trading performances. The estimate of the recoverable amount was determined by management of the M&C Group using discount rate of 13.5%. Included in property, plant and equipment are certain hotel properties of the Group with carrying value totalling $418,950,000 (2011: $374,542,000) which are mortgaged to certain financial institutions to secure credit facilities (refer to Notes 20 and 21 for more details of the facilities). 116 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 4 Investment properties Note Group Company $’000 $’000 Cost At 1 January 2011 3,539,838 608,338 Additions 194,952 4,469 Disposals (29) – Transfers to property, plant and equipment 3 (3,328) – Written off during the year (436) (18) Translation differences on consolidation 6,303 – At 31 December 2011 3,737,300 612,789 Additions 49,306 3,766 Acquisition of subsidiaries 35 222,820 – Disposals (63,611) – Transfers to assets classified as held for sale 11 (107,813) – Written off during the year (1,618) (1,611) Translation differences on consolidation (64,482) – At 31 December 2012 3,771,902 614,944 Accumulated depreciation and impairment losses At 1 January 2011 754,931 77,430 Charge for the year 29 59,413 10,207 Disposals (15) – Transfers to property, plant and equipment 3 (1,551) – Written off during the year (428) (12) Impairment losses 29 14,056 – Translation differences on consolidation 3,713 – At 31 December 2011 830,119 87,625 Charge for the year 29 64,897 10,279 Disposals (20,577) – Transfers to assets classified as held for sale 11 (10,830) – Written off during the year (1,616) (1,611) Impairment loss 29 6,009 – Translation differences on consolidation (12,293) – At 31 December 2012 855,709 96,293 Carrying amounts At 1 January 2011 2,784,907 530,908 At 31 December 2011 2,907,181 525,164 At 31 December 2012 2,916,193 518,651 Fair value At 31 December 2011 6,480,627 1,167,331 At 31 December 2012 6,692,283 1,188,101 Investment properties comprise commercial, residential and industrial properties that are leased to external customers. Generally, each of the leases is fixed for a period of 1 to 5 years, and subsequent renewals are negotiated at prevailing market rates and terms. City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 117 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 4 Investment properties (cont’d) The fair values of investment properties located in Singapore are based on in-house valuations conducted by a licensed appraiser who is also an officer of the Company. The licensed appraiser has appropriate recognised professional qualifications and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment properties being valued. The fair value is based on market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction. The valuation is based on the income method which takes into consideration the estimated net rent (using the current and projected average rental rates and occupancy), and a capitalisation rate applicable to the nature and type of asset in question. As a check, a comparison is made against relevant market transactions. In March 2013, the Group entered into a sale and purchase agreement to dispose one of its investment properties for a consideration of $150,951,000. The transaction is expected to be completed in May 2013. The fair value of the investment property as at 31 December 2012 is based on the best quote offered by the potential buyer. The fair value of investment properties located overseas is determined by independent licensed appraisers who have appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the investment properties being valued. Fair values are determined having regard to recent market transactions for similar properties in the same locations. In 2012, upon the Group and the Company identifying indications of impairment and thereafter assessing the carrying values of their investment properties, the Group recognised impairment loss of $6,009,000 (2011: $14,056,000). The impairment loss of $6,009,000 (2011: $14,056,000) was in relation to a property in Japan. The estimate of recoverable amount of the said property was based on its fair value as determined by an independent licensed appraiser. Investment properties of the Group with a total carrying amount of $1,146,017,000 (2011: $1,063,797,000) are mortgaged to certain financial institutions to secure credit facilities (refer to Notes 20 and 21 for more details of the facilities). 5 Investments in and balances with subsidiaries Company Note 2012 2011 $’000 $’000 Investments in subsidiaries Unquoted shares, at cost 2,278,068 2,278,068 Discount implicit in non-current inter-company balances 7,095 7,095 Impairment losses (61,728) (63,358) 2,223,435 2,221,805 Balances with subsidiaries Amounts owing by subsidiaries – trade, interest-free 7,453 6,890 – non-trade, interest-free 2,016,583 1,884,187 – non-trade, interest-bearing 3,075,571 2,215,992 5,099,607 4,107,069 Impairment losses (57,123) (55,017) 5,042,484 4,052,052 Receivable within 1 year 12 4,614,257 3,818,904 Receivable after 1 year 9 428,227 233,148 5,042,484 4,052,052 Amounts owing to subsidiaries – trade, interest-free 1,034 1,070 – non-trade, interest-free 938,978 823,548 – non-trade, interest-bearing 383,733 200,695 1,323,745 1,025,313 Repayable within 1 year 27 1,223,745 875,313 Repayable after 1 year 24 100,000 150,000 1,323,745 1,025,313 118 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 5 Investments in and balances with subsidiaries (cont’d) During the year, the Company assessed the carrying amount of its investments in subsidiaries for indications of impairment. Based on this assessment, the Company reversed impairment loss of $1,630,000 on its investment in a subsidiary which had disposed off its proportionate interest in industrial land parcels located at Jalan Lam Huat and recognised a profit from the sale. Accordingly, the impairment loss previously recognised for the investment of this subsidiary was reversed fully. In 2011, the Company recognised impairment losses of $56,812,000 on its investments in three subsidiaries. Impairment losses of $40,512,000 were made in relation to its investment in two of the subsidiaries as a result of dividend payments made by these subsidiaries to the Company in 2011 following the disposal of their underlying investments. The remaining impairment loss of $16,300,000 was made in relation to its investment in a wholly-owned subsidiary, which had proceeded with voluntary liquidation in 2011. Prior to the liquidation, the Company forgave the loan provided and recognised the waiver of the loan as an increase in its cost of investment. The non-trade amounts owing by and to subsidiaries are unsecured. In respect of interest-bearing amounts owing by and to subsidiaries, interest was charged at 0.51% to 3.57% (2011: 0.42% to 13.00%) and at 1.00% to 3.57% (2011: 1.34% to 3.57%) per annum respectively. The non-trade balances with subsidiaries that are presented as receivable or repayable within one year are receivable or repayable on demand. Included in amounts owing by subsidiaries receivable after one year are loans to subsidiaries with carrying amounts of $428,227,000 (2011: $227,657,000) for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. As the amounts are in substance a part of the Company’s net investment in subsidiaries, they are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The remaining non-current receivables from subsidiaries are not expected to be repaid within the next one year. Impairment losses The change in impairment losses in respect of amounts owing by subsidiaries during the year is as follows: Company 2012 2011 $’000 $’000 At 1 January 55,017 55,647 Charge/(Write-back) of impairment losses 2,106 (630) At 31 December 57,123 55,017 Further details regarding subsidiaries are set out in Note 40.

In respect of the interest-bearing amounts owing by an associate, interest was charged at 2.87% to 3.24% (2011: 2.75% to 3.01%). For interest-bearing the amounts owing to an associate, interest was charged at 6.90% to 7.54% (2011: 7.54%). The non-trade balances with associates that are presented as receivable within one year are receivable on demand.

The Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Sharesave Scheme 1996 which was a United Kingdom Inland Revenue approved scheme designed for the executive directors of M&C and the M&C Group employees, expired in 2006. Options which remained exercisable under the scheme beyond the expiry date lapsed on 1 January 2011. (i) Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme (a) The Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme (M&C 2003 Scheme) was approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of M&C held on 21 May 2002. There are two parts of the M&C 2003 Scheme, namely the “Approved” part for which approval from the United Kingdom Inland Revenue has been obtained, and the “Unapproved” part which is not designed for the United Kingdom Inland Revenue approval and which is used primarily where employees have more than £30,000 worth of outstanding approved options or are not based in the United Kingdom. Except to the extent required to obtain the United Kingdom Inland Revenue approval, the Approved and Unapproved parts of the M&C 2003 Scheme are in all material aspects identical. City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 131 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 18 Equity compensation benefits (cont’d) (i) Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme (cont’d) (b) Under the terms of the M&C 2003 Scheme, (i) All employees of M&C, its subsidiaries and joint ventures (including directors who are required to devote substantially the whole of their working time to the business of the M&C Group who are not within six months of contractual retirement ages) will be eligible to participate in the M&C 2003 Scheme. (ii) No option may be granted to an individual if it would cause the aggregate exercise price of options granted to him in any year under the M&C 2003 Scheme to exceed 200% of his basic salary, other than in exceptional circumstances (where the limit is 400% of basic salary). (iii) No payment will be required for the grant of an option. Acquisition price upon the exercise of an option will not be less than the higher of: – the average of the middle-market quotations of a share on the London Stock Exchange on the three dealing days immediately prior to grant date, provided that no such dealing day may fall prior to the date on which M&C last announced its results for any period; and – the nominal value of a share (unless the option is expressed to relate only to existing shares). (c) No options may be granted which would cause the number of shares issued or issuable pursuant to options granted in the previous ten years under the M&C 2003 Scheme or under any other share option scheme, or issued in that period under any employee share scheme (other than an option scheme) to exceed 10% of M&C’s issued ordinary share capital from time to time. Not more than 5% of M&C’s issued ordinary share capital from time to time may relate to discretionary share schemes. (ii) Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Sharesave Scheme 2006 (a) The Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Sharesave Scheme 2006 (M&C Sharesave Scheme) is the United Kingdom Inland Revenue approved scheme under which the executive directors of M&C and the M&C Group employees are eligible to participate. (b) Under the terms of the M&C Sharesave Scheme, M&C Group employees were to enter into a threeyear or five-year savings contract, with an option to purchase shares at a pre-determined exercise price on maturity of the savings contract. The M&C Sharesave Scheme was approved by the shareholders at M&C’s Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2006. (c) No payment is required for the grant of an option. (d) The options may be exercised upon maturity provided that the monies agreed under the savings contract are fully paid and the participant continues to hold office or employment with M&C. The M&C Sharesave Scheme provides that shares in M&C can be purchased at the option price up to the value of the accrued savings and interests in the event of retirement at normal retirement age, redundancy, injury, disability or by the employees’ estate in the event of their death. (e) M&C may grant options up to the value of a savings contract at maturity. Participants cannot enter into contracts where their savings, in aggregate, would exceed £250 per month. 132 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 18 Equity compensation benefits (cont’d) (iii) Millennium & Copthorne Hotels 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan The Millennium & Copthorne Hotels 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was approved at M&C’s Annual General Meeting held on 4 May 2006. Under the terms of the LTIP, M&C is permitted to make both Performance Share Awards and Deferred Share Bonus Awards to an employee (including an executive director) of M&C or its subsidiaries. The level of awards made under the terms of the LTIP are determined by M&C’s Remuneration Committee. Vesting of Performance Share Awards is subject to the achievement of stretch performance targets. For awards made in 2006 to 2010, earnings per share (EPS) targets were chosen so that participants are incentivised to deliver significant earnings growth. In 2011, the Remuneration Committee amended the performance conditions so that half of the awards are subject to EPS growth targets and half are subject to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) targets. The revised performance targets are designed to incentivise management to deliver significant earnings growth and align the interests of management with shareholders. The performance condition applying to Performance Share Awards require M&C’s EPS to grow, in real terms, over a period of three consecutive financial years after the award. Performance Share Awards will vest on the third anniversary of the award being made, subject to the EPS growth targets being met. TSR targets measure M&C’s relative TSR performance over a three-year period against a comparator group comprising companies in the FTSE 250 index participating companies (excluding investment trusts). Awards will not be subject to re-testing. City e-Solutions Limited (CES) The City e-Solutions Limited Share Option Scheme (CES Scheme) was adopted by the shareholders of CES at the Annual General Meeting of CES held on 27 April 2005. The subscription price of the CES shares under the CES Scheme shall be a price determined by the CES Scheme Committee at its absolute discretion which may require the achievement of performance targets by the Grantee as specified by the CES Scheme Committee. The subscription price shall not be less than the highest of: (i) the official closing price of the CES shares as stated in the daily quotations sheet of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on the Offer Date; (ii) the average of the official closing price of the CES shares as stated in the daily quotations sheets of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for the five business days immediately preceding the Offer Date; and (iii) the nominal value of a CES share. During the financial year under review, (i) no options were granted to subscribe for ordinary shares of HK$1.00 each in CES; and (ii) no ordinary shares of HK$1.00 each in CES were issued pursuant to the CES Scheme. As at the end of the financial year, there were no unissued shares under options pursuant to the CES Scheme. The options granted by CES and M&C do not entitle the holders of the options, by virtue of such holding, to any rights to participate in any share issue of any other company.

Options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year. The options outstanding as at 31 December 2012 had an exercise price in the range of £1.54 to £5.20 (2011: £1.54 to £5.20) and a weighted average contractual life of 1.89 years (2011: 1.89 years). The LTIP and Sharesave awards, which are subject to an EPS performance condition, were valued using the BlackScholes valuation method. The LTIP awards which are subject to a share price related performance condition (i.e. TSR) were valued using the Monte Carlo valuation method. The share option pricing model involves six variables, namely the exercise price, share price at grant date, expected life of option, expected volatility of share price, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield.

The principal causes for the UK Plan actuarial loss in 2011 were positive impacts from reduced inflation and a change to Consumer Prices Index net of unfavourable fall in equities and taking into account the £2.4 million impact of guaranteed minimum pension (GMP) underpin from the defined contribution scheme, refer below. The life expectancies underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the UK Plan, based on retirement age of 65, are as follows: 2012 2011 Years Years Males 25 25 Females 27 27 The Group operates various funded pension schemes which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned. The most significant funds are described below: United Kingdom (UK) The Group makes contributions to a pension scheme for its UK employees, which was set up in 1993. The plan operates a funded defined benefit arrangement together with a defined contribution plan, both with different categories of membership. The defined benefit section of the plan was closed to new entrants in 2001 and at the same time rights to a GMP under the defined contribution scheme also ceased. The contributions required are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method. The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 5 April 2011 and this has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2012. The contributions of the Group during the year were 5.0% (2011: 21.6%) of pensionable salary, plus enhanced contributions of £3.0 million (approximately $6.0 million) (2011: £1.4 million (approximately $2.8 million)) per annum to reduce the UK Plan’s deficit. As the defined benefit section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to mortality, the discount rate and the rate of increase in salaries and pensions. At 31 December 2011, the defined contribution plan section relating to GMP underpin did not have sufficient assets to meet the GMP liabilities. There was a deficit of £2.4 million (approximately $4.8 million) on the £7.5 million (approximately $15.3 million) defined contribution plan assets relating to those members with a GMP. As such, this section of the plan is now accounted for as a defined benefit scheme as it exhibits the traits of a defined benefit plan. The impact of this in 2011 is shown in the analysis above which in summary is to introduce £7.5 million (approximately $15.3 million) into both UK Plan assets and UK Plan liabilities and, additionally, to record an actuarial loss of £2.4 million (approximately $4.8 million) within defined benefit losses. At 31 December 2012, the plan has been included as part of the overall defined benefit scheme and not separately disclosed. South Korea The Group makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Korea. The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2012. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and the rate of increase in salaries. 144 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 23 Employee benefits (cont’d) Taiwan The Group makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Taiwan. The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2012. The contributions of the Group were 6.0% (2011: 6.0%) of the employees’ earnings. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and the rate of increase in salaries. The assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal assumptions: 2012 2012 2012 2011 2011 2011 UK South Korea Taiwan UK South Korea Taiwan Inflation rate 2.9% – – 3.1% – – Discount rate* 4.4% 3.8% 1.8% 4.7% 4.8% 1.9% Rate of salary increase 3.4% 5.0% 3.0% 3.6% 4.0% 2.5% Rate of pension increases 2.9% – – 3.1% – – Rate of revaluation 2.1% – – 2.1% – – Annual expected return on plan assets 5.1% 4.2% 1.8% 5.1% 4.2% 1.8% * The discount rate used in respect of the UK Plan of 4.4% (2011: 4.7%) was based on the yield of the Merrill Lynch over-15 year AA rated corporate bond index. The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not be necessarily borne out in practice. The present values of the schemes’ liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain. The expected annual return on UK defined benefit plan assets for 2012 of 5.1% (2011: 5.1%) has been calculated using a 5.4% (2011: 5.4%) return on equity representing 67.0% (2011: 63.0%) of plan assets and a 4.4% (2011: 4.7%) return on cash and bonds representing 33.0% (2011: 37.0%) of plan assets.

City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 165 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 37 Financial risk management Financial risk management objectives and policies The Group is exposed to financial risks arising from its operations and the use of financial instruments. The key financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, such as interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and equity price risk. The Group has a system of controls in place to maintain an acceptable balance between the cost of risks occurring and the cost of managing the risks. The management continually monitors the Group’s risk management process to ensure that an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Audit Committee provides independent oversight of the effectiveness of the financial risk management process. It is, and has been throughout the current and previous financial year, the Group’s policy that no derivatives shall be undertaken for speculative purposes except for its use as hedging instruments where appropriate and cost efficient. Credit risk The Group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. The Group does not require collateral in respect of these financial assets. Transactions involving financial instruments are entered into only with counterparties that are of acceptable credit quality. Cash and fixed deposits are placed with banks and financial institutions which are regulated. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of the specific loss component in respect of trade and other receivables. The allowance account in respect of trade receivables and other receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible. At that point, the financial asset is considered irrecoverable and the amount charged to the allowance account is written off against the carrying amount of the impaired financial asset. At the reporting date, there is no significant concentration of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset at the reporting date. 166 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Liquidity risk The Group monitors its liquidity risk and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents and credit facilities deemed adequate by management to finance the Group’s operations and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. The following are the expected contractual undiscounted cash outflows of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements: After 1 year Carrying Contractual Within but within After amount cash flows 1 year 5 years 5 years $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Group 2012 Term loans 2,520,715 2,655,033 384,282 2,270,751 – Bonds and notes 1,758,422 1,907,530 481,550 1,046,969 379,011 Bank loans 152,863 152,935 152,935 – – Trade and other payables * 911,335 913,956 913,956 – – Bank overdrafts 34,871 35,202 35,202 – – Finance lease creditors 57 57 11 46 – Other liabilities * 140,103 143,266 2,019 140,000 1,247 5,518,366 5,807,979 1,969,955 3,457,766 380,258 2011 Term loans 2,416,278 2,521,984 939,489 1,582,495 – Bonds and notes 1,819,133 1,931,831 436,438 1,444,018 51,375 Bank loans 54,991 55,011 55,011 – – Trade and other payables * 872,840 873,582 871,712 1,870 – Bank overdrafts 115,425 116,184 116,184 – – Finance lease creditors 3 3 3 – – Other liabilities * 96,973 102,057 1,878 98,888 1,291 5,375,643 5,600,652 2,420,715 3,127,271 52,666 * Excluding deferred income.

It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts. Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. Interest rate risk The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its interest-bearing financial assets and debt obligations. The Group adopts a policy of managing its interest rate exposure by maintaining a debt portfolio with both fixed and floating interest rates. Where appropriate, the Group uses interest rate derivatives to hedge its interest rate exposure for specific underlying debt obligations. Interest rate derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk, to the extent that the perceived cost is considered to outweigh the benefit from the flexibility of variable rate borrowings, and the Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives. Where used, interest rate derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value within the Group’s statement of financial position. Further details of interest rate derivatives in place at 31 December 2012 are provided below: 168 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Cash flow hedges A subsidiary of the Group has entered into a number of interest rate swaps in 2010 to fix the interest relating to the payment of quarterly interest charges arising on floating rate unsecured bonds totalling US$50 million, and designated these as cash flow hedges. The risk being hedged is the variability of cash flows arising from movements in interest rates. The hedges are in place until the bonds mature in March 2013. The fair value of the interest rate swaps as at 31 December 2012 was a £0.1 million (approximately $183,000) liability (2011: £0.3 million (approximately $674,000) liability). The cash flows occur on a quarterly basis until the loan balance matures in March 2013 and the hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, which are considered to be highly effective. The carrying value of the hedging instruments is restated to its fair value at each reporting date, with the effective portion of changes in fair value since inception being taken to the hedging reserve. The gain recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of the change in fair value of these hedging instruments was £0.2 million (approximately $474,000) (2011: £0.1 million (approximately $255,000)). There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arose from this cash flow hedge.

Sensitivity analysis For the variable rate financial assets and liabilities, a 100 basis points (bp) increase at the reporting date would have the impact as shown below. A decrease in 100 bp in interest rate would have an equal but opposite effect. This analysis, which is based on reporting date of each interest-bearing financial asset and liability, assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and does not take into account the effect of qualifying borrowing costs allowed for capitalisation and tax effect.

City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 171 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of the Group’s entities. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the United States Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Thai Baht, Hong Kong Dollar, Japanese Yen, Sterling Pound and Renminbi. The Group has a decentralised approach to the management of foreign exchange risk. The Group manages its foreign exchange exposure by adopting a policy of matching receipts and payments, and asset purchases and borrowings, in the currency of the relevant entity, where possible. Entities in the Group may have different approaches to the identification and management of this risk. Entities in the Group may borrow in currencies other than their functional currencies to fund investments that are denominated in their borrowing currencies. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used purely as a hedging tool, where an active market for the relevant currency exists, to minimise the Group’s exposure to movements in exchange rates on firm commitments and specific transactions. Hedging of transaction exposure is undertaken with approved counterparties and within designated limits, using spot or short-term forward contracts to buy or sell the currency concerned, once the timing and the underlying amount of exposure have been determined. Foreign exchange derivatives may also be used to hedge specific transaction exposure where appropriate. Further details of foreign exchange derivatives in place at 31 December 2012 are provided below: Cash flow hedges A number of forward cross currency swaps were executed in February 2010 by a subsidiary of the Group to hedge the foreign currency risk in respect of the repayment in February 2013 of a US$30 million loan using Korean Won. This loan was extended to a subsidiary in Korea, whose functional currency is Korean Won. The proceeds of the US dollar loan were converted into Korean Won on inception, and the risk being hedged is the variability of the cash flow associated with the repayment of the US$30 million loan principal on its maturity date in February 2013, arising from movement of Korean Won against the US dollar over that 3-year period. The hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, which are considered to be highly effective. The carrying value of the hedging instruments is restated to its fair value at each reporting date, with the effective portion of changes in fair value since inception being taken to the hedging reserve. The loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of the change in fair value of these hedging instruments was £1.6 million (approximately $3,267,000) (2011: £0.2 million (approximately $551,000) gain). Amounts recognised in equity are recycled to the income statement to offset gains and losses when the underlying debt instrument is retranslated at the exchange rate applicable at each period end, and there was no ineffectiveness recognised in the year as a charge in the income statement. 172 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Foreign currency risk (cont’d) The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to foreign currencies are as follows: United Hong States Singapore Thai Kong Japanese Sterling Dollar Dollar Baht Dollar Yen Pound Renminbi Others $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Group 2012 Financial assets 1,265 – – 140 – 11,808 – 619 Trade and other receivables* 96 492 1,216 – 347 – 2,047 9 Cash and cash equivalents 26,373 5,013 169 1,316 – 25,295 15,986 392 Amount owing (to)/by subsidiaries (net) (39,753) (520,970) 272,331 132,114 39,541 686 (381) (43) Interest-bearing borrowings (77,040) (50,000) – (64,025) (87,230) – – – Trade and other payables** (229) (198) – (31) (22) – (109) (7) (89,288) (565,663) 273,716 69,514 (47,364) 37,789 17,543 970 2011 Financial assets 1,333 – – 253 – 9,471 – 729 Trade and other receivables* 39,148 297,870 1,266 – – – 3,539 6 Cash and cash equivalents 64,761 76,118 – 1,619 – 25,024 16,140 207 Amount owing (to)/by subsidiaries (net) (26,364) (358,579) 108,339 129,980 51,234 5,137 1,247 (58) Interest-bearing borrowings (351,754) (136,000) – (67,578) (103,089) – – – Trade and other payables** (319) (737) – (30) (19) – (74) (8) (273,195) (121,328) 109,605 64,244 (51,874) 39,632 20,852 876 * Excluding prepayments. ** Excluding deferred income.

An increase in the underlying equity prices of the above investments at the reporting date by 10% (2011: 10%) and 5% (2011: 5%) for the Group and the Company, respectively, would increase profit, and accumulated profits, and other components of equity before any tax effect by the amounts shown below. Similarly, a decrease in the underlying equity prices by 10% (2011: 10%) and 5% (2011: 5%) for the Group and the Company respectively would have an equal but opposite effect.

When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability. Investments in equity and convertible notes The fair values of quoted investments that are classified as available for sale and held for trading are their quoted bid prices at the reporting date. The fair values of unquoted equity investments held for trading are estimated using the applicable price to earnings ratios for similar listed companies adjusted for the specific circumstances of the issuer. The fair values of unquoted equity investments available for sale (except as described below) are estimated using valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions that are not evidenced by prices from observable current market transactions. Instead, they are based on unobservable inputs reflecting assumptions about the way assets would be priced. The fair values of certain unquoted equity investments available for sale have not been determined as the fair value cannot be determined reliably. As a result, the variability in the range of recoverable fair value estimates derived from valuation techniques is expected to be significant. City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 177 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Fair values (cont’d) Fair values versus carrying amounts (cont’d) Investments in equity and convertible notes (cont’d) The fair value of convertible notes is determined using the Black-Scholes model. Measurement inputs include the fair value of the convertible notes issuer’s shares on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historic volatility of publicly available information), weighted average expected life of the instrument (based on general noteholder behaviour), expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate. Amounts owing by and to subsidiaries, associates and jointly-controlled entities The fair values of amounts owing by and to subsidiaries, associates and jointly-controlled entities are estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates. Non-derivative financial assets and liabilities The fair values of borrowings which reprice after six months and other non-derivative financial assets and liabilities, determined for disclosure purposes, are calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar agreements. The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than one year (including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables, and interest-bearing borrowings) or those which reprice within six months are assumed to approximate their fair values because of the short period to maturity or repricing. All other financial assets and liabilities are discounted to determine their fair values. Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate. For interest rate swaps, bank valuations are used. Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows: • Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and • Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 178 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Fair values (cont’d) Fair value hierarchy (cont’d) Note Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Group 2012 Available-for-sale financial assets 39,007 – 9,012 48,019 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 8 31,375 – 1,210 32,585 70,382 – 10,222 80,604 Derivative financial liabilities 27 – (4,647) – (4,647) 70,382 (4,647) 10,222 75,957 2011 Available-for-sale financial assets 37,166 – 9,307 46,473 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 8 24,888 – 1,400 26,288 62,054 – 10,707 72,761 Derivative financial liabilities 27 – (1,870) – (1,870) 62,054 (1,870) 10,707 70,891 Company 2012 Available-for-sale financial assets 8 23,057 – – 23,057 2011 Available-for-sale financial assets 8 19,122 – – 19,122 During the financial year ended 31 December 2012, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value of these financial instruments are measured using valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions that are not evidenced by prices from observable current market transactions. Instead, they are based on ‘unobservable’ inputs reflecting management’s ‘own assumptions’ about the way assets would be priced. Although the Group believes that its estimate of fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could lead to different measurements of fair value. There is no sensitivity analysis prepared as the Group’s exposure to the effect on fair value changes for 2011 and 2012 is insignificant. 180 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 38 Operating segments Information reported to the Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performances is specifically focused on the functionality of services provided. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments: • Property development – develops and purchases properties for sale • Hotel operations – owns and manages hotels • Rental properties – develops and purchases investment properties for lease • Others – comprises club operator and owner, investment in shares, property management, project management and consultancy services and provider of information technology and procurement services. None of these segments meet any of the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments in 2012 and 2011. Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment profit before income tax, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.

City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 185 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 39 New standards and interpretations not adopted A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2012, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. Those new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements of the Group and the Company in future financial periods, and which the Group does not plan to early adopt except as otherwise indicated below, are set out below. Applicable for the Group’s 2013 financial statements • FRS 19 Employee Benefits (revised 2011), which revises certain principles of the current FRS 19, including the elimination of the option to defer recognition of re-measurement gains and losses for defined benefit plans and requiring these re-measurements to be presented in other comprehensive income. The standard also requires a re-assessment of the basis used for determining the income or expense related to defined benefit plans. In addition, there are changes to the definition of employee benefits as short-term or other long-term employee benefits. The Group does not expect any significant impact to the Group’s financial statements when it adopts FRS 19 (revised) in 2013. • FRS 113 Fair Value Measurement, which replaces the existing guidance on fair value measurement in different FRSs with a single definition of fair value. The standard also establishes a framework for measuring fair values and sets out the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The adoption of this standard will require the Group to re-assess the bases used for determining the fair values computed for both measurement and disclosures purposes and would result in more extensive disclosures on fair value measurements. On initial application of the standard, the Group does not expect substantial changes to the bases used for determining fair values. Applicable for the Group’s 2014 financial statements • FRS 110 Consolidated Financial Statements, which changes the definition of control such that an investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power with the investee. FRS 110 introduces a single control model with a series of indicators to assess control. FRS 110 also adds additional context, explanation and application guidance based on the principle of control. The Group is presently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on the Group’s financial statements. • FRS 111 Joint Arrangements, which establishes the principles for classification and accounting of joint arrangements. The adoption of this standard would require the Group to re-assess and classify its joint arrangements as either joint operations or joint ventures based on its rights and obligations arising from the joint arrangements. Under this standard, interests in joint ventures will be accounted for using the equity method whilst interests in joint operations will be accounted for using the applicable FRSs relating to the underlying assets, liabilities, revenue and expense items arising from the joint operations. The Group has several investments in joint arrangements. The Group has re-evaluated the rights and obligations of the parties to these joint arrangements and has determined that the parties in this joint arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Accordingly, these joint arrangements will be classified as joint ventures under FRS 111 and will be accounted for using the equity method. Currently, the Group’s joint arrangements are accounted for as jointly-controlled entities under FRS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures using the equity method. As the Group is already applying the equity method of accounting, there will be no impact to the Group’s financial statements when the Group adopts FRS 111 in 2014. • FRS 112 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, which sets out the disclosures required to be made in respect of all forms of an entity’s interests in other entities, including subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and unconsolidated structured entities. The adoption of this standard would result in more extensive disclosures being made in the Group’s financial statements in respect of its interests in other entities; as FRS 112 is primarily a disclosure standard, there will be no financial impact on the results and financial position of the Group and the Company upon adoption of this standard by the Group in 2014. 186 City Developments Limited Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2012 40 Significant investments The following are the Group’s significant investments: Country of Effective Group Principal Activity Incorporation Interest 2012 2011 % % Subsidiaries Direct/Indirect Subsidiaries of the Company * 100G Pasir Panjang Road Pte Ltd Property holding Singapore 99 99 * Allinvest Holding Pte Ltd Property owner and investment Singapore 100 100 holding * Aston Properties Pte Ltd Property owner, developer and Singapore 100 100 investment holding * Bloomsville Investments Pte Ltd Property owner, developer and Singapore 100 100 investment holding * CBM Pte.
