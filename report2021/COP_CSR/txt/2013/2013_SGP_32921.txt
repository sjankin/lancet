Independent Assurance Statement 119 Independent Assurance Statement Findings and observations Evaluation of the adherence to AA1000 AccountAbility Principles Inclusivity How the organisation engages with stakeholders and enables their participation in identifying issues and finding solutions. Keppel Land’s level of engagement with its stakeholders has remained steady since the previous reporting period. There is evidence of strong engagement platforms for employees, such as surveys, group and personal meetings (sessions with CEO), appointment of engagement champions within each department as well as online channels for information sharing and feedback. In line with the new safety roadmap, engagement with suppliers has been further strengthened in 2012. This is evidenced by additional training programmes, awareness channels and sharing events for contractors in Singapore and overseas. We have also seen evidence of partnerships forged between the company and local government/non-government agencies, the selection of which is based on the initiative’s sustainability and partner accountability. We have however seen little evidence of frequent or formalised inclusion of stakeholder groups’ representatives in decision-making. Materiality How the organisation recognises issues that are relevant and significant to it and its stakeholders. Keppel Land shows frequent and structured processes to identify relevant and significant issues, including a materiality test conducted by an external consultant in 2012. Evidence of engagement on key sustainability issues at top management level is reflected in the policies and boardlevel KPIs on human resource, corporate governance and EHS. We particularly commend the new clause on human rights that has been inserted in all formal construction contract documents. Although the current policy only covers the human rights topic of child labour, it represents significant progress in setting new criteria that are material to the construction sector. We expect further issues, gaps and preventive or corrective measures to be identified in the near future through other processes or initiatives implemented in 2012, such as the CSR Committees formed in China and Vietnam, the system on Behavioural Management of Safety and the Project Management and Sustainable Design Department. Responsiveness How the organisation responds to stakeholder issues and feedback through decisions, actions, performance and communication. We have found evidence of processes to develop actions in response to concerns of stakeholders. These include group meetings to share and discuss the results of the group-wide Organisational Climate Survey and complimentary energy audits conducted for tenants. Another example of the company’s response to customer concerns is the case of the water discharge in Bangalore. 120 Keppel Land Limited Sustainability Report 2012 Communications channels are substantiated at all levels of the company and include training and awareness sessions covering key sustainability issues, such as environment, health and safety, human rights and code of conduct. Keppel Land also has comprehensive intranet portals and website, where most of its key policies, feedback channels and sustainability performance can be found. Evaluation of adherence to the GRI Reporting Principles Improvements seen in the Report include the insertion of all GRI standard disclosures and indicators from the Construction and Real Estate sector supplement, although a small portion of the indicators are not fully disclosed. With the disclosure of additional negative aspects, the Report provides a more balanced view of the company’s overall performance compared to previous years. The recurrent format of the sections and tables with historical data allow a good evaluation of performance through the years. Despite some repeated statements, the Report content is reasonably clear and accurate. Clarity could be further improved in the People Review section, where it is not always obvious whether policies and practices apply to the corporate office’s employees only or also to overseas employees. Disclosure on performance and management approaches comprises the key aspects that are material to the sustainability context of the company, covering local and overseas operations. We commend the new alignment of the disclosure on CO2 emissions with the Carbon Disclosure Project. Through the data verification process, we have not found any major inconsistencies between the data sources provided by the data owners and the reported statements and figures. Where mismatches were found, corrections were promptly applied by the reporting team following our recommendations. Conclusion Based on our assurance work, Ere-S is satisfied that the claims in Keppel Land’s Sustainability Report 2012 provide a credible and fair representation of the company’s sustainability profile and a reasonable application of the AA1000 and GRI Principles. The assurance findings also provide confidence, within the limits of a moderate assurance, that the Report’s statement and figures achieve an adequate level of reliability and accuracy. Moving forward 1. While Keppel Land maintains solid engagement channels with its key stakeholder groups, we recommend additional effort to include stakeholder representatives in decision-making processes on a more consistent basis. The greatest progress in this aspect can be made in the social dimension and the company’s supply chain management. More disclosure on the inclusivity of communities impacted by the company’s operations, especially for new projects overseas, will also improve the quality of future reports. Independent Assurance Statement 121 Independent Assurance Statement 2. We recommend sustained efforts toward a more comprehensive inclusion of control and reporting processes covering other aspects of human rights beside safety and child labour in the supply chain. However, we understand that establishing these management approaches will represent a significant challenge. 3. Although Keppel Land has strengthened some of its KPIs in sustainabilityrelated topics, such as corporate governance, safety and environment, top-management accountability for sustainability performance could be further evidenced. This can be achieved by setting additional personal key performance indicators, particularly at top-management level, covering other key material areas such as stakeholder engagement, human rights and community impact. 4. Finally, we commend the improvement in the number of indicators disclosed in this year’s Report. However, further efforts in providing comprehensive disclosure of performance should remain high. This can be achieved through full disclosure of all GRI indicators, inclusion of additional scopes from the Carbon Disclosure Project and more reporting of negative performance. We also recommend better alignment of the details and amount of reported information between the corporate office and the overseas subsidiaries, especially in the labour dimension. The above findings and additional suggestions for improvement have been presented to the management of Keppel Land in a more detailed assurance report.
