Our company motto of “Value Technology, Value People, Value the Earth” encompasses an extremely broad and This outline is based on our Company Motto and framework, which underlie the activities it describes. varied range of CSR areas, elements, and activities. In this outline, we have identified compliance as the group of items Reaching the apex of the triangle is not simple, but rather something that is accomplished one step at a time by that holds the highest propriety for the company out of all the elements included in the motto. In short, the important steadily taking the time and expending the effort to work as hard as is possible in light of the company’s level of ability and compliance group targets the Ethics Charter and Code of Conduct (see page 4). We used to use the word “compliance” resources. This outline serves as a guidepost pointing the way toward CSR and a sustained contribution to development to include everything in the motto, but some of those elements properly belong to the CSR category that falls higher up through our business while coming together to increase our corporate competitiveness based on management-level in the triangle, making it necessary to draw a distinction. This CSR outline breaks down the term “compliance” into categoleadership. The following explains its content one level at a time. ries and organizes associated concepts in line with those areas. <Compliance> <Risk management> The area of compliance consists of imperatives that the company must at a minimum put into practice. In addition to Since establishing the CSR Department in 2006, we have consistently focused our resources and attentiveness on legal compliance with such laws and regulations as financial regulations, the Company Act, the Financial Instruments and companywide risk assessment activities in the areas of compliance and risk assessment. This comprehensive program Exchange Act, the Antimonopoly Act, and the Act against Delay in Payment of Subcontract Proceeds, Etc. to Subcontrachas included articulating clear companywide policies; creating organizational structures; assigning and training persontors, compliance encompasses internal controls.

As globalization accelerates and the business environment becomes more unforgiving, it will be essential to manage risk in an efficacious and effective manner. In particular, Takuma cannot afford even a moment of carelessness in managCSR Activities ing the risks that affect its stakeholders, which include local governments, communities, residents, and others. The keys to our approach to risk management are (1) identifying priority risk management areas for the entire company and Takuma’s CSR Management and Contributing to Sustained Development for the Future thoroughly implementing management structures and specific implementation manuals; (2) sharing and managing information about changes in risks; (3) fostering organic connections among Takuma and its group companies, business divisions, employees, plants, and construction sites to facilitate self-management and initiative; and (4) implementing forward-looking preventive measures while exercising due care and diligence. Although leadership from top manageShareholders Global environment ment, companywide organizational structures, and management rules and manuals play an important role, we believe that the most critical factor is each and every employee’s stance and mindset with regard to risk management.

Because this uppermost area is normally objectives expressed using terminology associated with a broad range of concepts and fields, there are many options for its content, and it is important that companies take the initiative to choose their own priority issues. As a straightforward example, our Trust from Trust of Company Motto of “Value Technology, Value People, Value the Earth” is an example of an expression that signifies this society society uppermost category. The ideals of good corporate citizenship and harmony with society as expressed in our Ethics CharVoluntary contributions to society and ter and Code of Conduct are also concepts that belong in this uppermost area. For example, the description in the Ethics the global environment that go beyond Charter about good corporate citizenship states, “We shall strive for proactive social contribution while establishing a Promotion of legal and voluntary compliance and Promotion of harmonious coexistence with the global environment as good corporate citizens.” stakeholder ethical outlook stakeholder engagement engagement The CSR triangular framework diagram was created to organize concepts and terminology such as these to create a shared understanding within the company as part of an ongoing effort to formulate a series of guidelines on future CSR activities.

I visited K City the other day and was told they As a result, I feel that the businesses pursued by environmental systems manufacturers are changing. It find not only your technology, but also Takuma as a company, trustworthy. They were adamant that that seems these companies are shifting into new fields. you are more sincere than any other company they deal with, that you respond quickly to their requests, and that they feel peace of mind when they entrust projects to you. I feel that you deal with the Society in Future prospects of the environmental systems industry the same serious manner. I think Takuma has a wonderful, sincere organizational culture that can be Mr. Kakuta: Specifically, what are some of these new fields? trusted, but the flip side of those characteristics is an impression that you’re a bit conservative. Why not Mr. Okuyama: Manufacturers are expanding into new energy fields such as biomass. My sense is that they are gradually more actively embrace the challenge of new fields?

It goes without saying that these an era when it is difficult to trace out a vision for the environmental systems business. You have pointed out that areas cannot be pursued in a manner that is unrelated to social business. future growth will be impossible unless we embrace the challenge of new fields.

I may be making a logical leap here, but due to limits on On the Great East Japan Earthquake how much can be accomplished Mr. Yagi: Two years have already passed since the Great East Japan by initiatives undertaken on the Earthquake, and while the journey toward reconstruction in normal governmental basis in affected areas has begun, I sense that there are fewer the event of a major earthquake, articles on the subject in newspapers recently. There are it may be necessary to enact a limits to people’s memory. Since tragic earthquakes and law outlining special measures even war experiences of the past weather as the years that allow the designation of go by, it is necessary to leave a record of the Great East special disaster zones so that Japan Earthquake for future generations.

Mr. Yagi: I have also investigated how Japanese technology and experience relating to waste and the 3Rs can be Stakeholder Dialog Mr. Kakuta: Are you saying that we have to adopt a different approach communicated overseas. Since Japan’s technology concerning waste and the 3Rs is the world’s best, the to processing debris from the Great East Japan EarthJapanese side is prone to assume that it will be accepted everywhere in the world. However, for example, quake than has been used in the past? while facilities for treating leachate must be built at final disposal sites in Japan due to the country’s large Mr. Yagi: Because the Great East Japan Earthquake was accompaamount of rainfall, there is no need for such facilities in the arid regions of interior Asia, where heat is more nied by a tsunami, it did an enormous amount of of a concern than rainfall. Additionally, the distinction between usable and unusable (waste) materials varies damage. Reconstruction efforts require huge amounts of with the level of economic development. I think you first have to understand that there are differences earthwork materials for building embankments in the between Japan and other countries in terms of climate, custom, culture, and history. Failure to do so means course of constructing seawalls and breakwaters, raising facilities constructed through Japanese ODA cooperation and other means may go unused. levees around residential areas, and relocating houses to Mr. Kakuta: So there are limits to applying domestic business models overseas. higher ground. If this is the case, I believe we should Mr. Yagi: Japanese local governments tend to accept high-end, high-cost facilities with service guarantees from the focus on ways to turn debris into the earthwork materials that we need in partnership with civil engineering manufacturer but to falter on maintenance costs. In other countries, it’s standard to clarify the extent of companies. If, for example, in the course of constructing seawalls, breakwaters, higher-elevation shelters, manufacturer guarantees and to pursue a rational cost basis for such projects. The author Saburo and other projects it is possible to build concrete structures whose strength and water-tightness are on par Shiroyama said, “What’s common sense in Japan is not common sense elsewhere in the world. And what’s with isolated-type waste treatment sites, then it would be possible with a little innovation to add functionality common sense elsewhere in the world is not common sense in Japan.” Along the same lines, I don’t think so that these structures could serve as disposal sites. Furthermore, examples such as treatment to contain you can simply bring Japanese business practices to other countries and succeed. When European and organic mercury in Minamata Bay may provide useful clues for how to deal with harmful treatment residue. American companies enter markets in Asia where there are cultural and religious differences, I understand Mr. Kakuta: Such an approach would bring Japan’s technological strengths to bear on the reconstruction process. they send their most talented people. Perhaps because we admire Europe and the U.S., Japan sends its Mr. Yagi: First, it is necessary to carefully assess the differences between the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake and talented people there.

Mr. Kakuta: They’ve had a hard time of it in the affected areas.
