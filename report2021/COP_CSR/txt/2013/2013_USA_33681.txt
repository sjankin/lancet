We have committed to embed the Global Compact and its principles into our strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company, and to engage in collaborative projects which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Millennium Development Goals. Our commitment to a more sustainable world not only translates our ideas into actions, but it resides in our vision and business model. From day one, Goby’s mission has been to apply a sustainability lens to real estate portfolio in order to create real value. We break the value drivers into operational efficiencies, marketing/social awareness, and unlocking strategic value. As we accelerate the pace of our expansion, we will make certain to develop our activities according to the UN Global Compact and its sustainability principles.” The United Nations Global Compact Principles Human Rights Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 1 make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.

Principle 6 Environment Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 7 undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 8 encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Principle 9 Anti-Corruption Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Principle 10 Goby: sustainable mission Everyone Matters Our mission is to provide real estate owners, managers, and users respected, unbiased expertise in cost efficient, high impact sustainability planning, monitoring, and implementation for their commercial, office, and real estate operations.

Energy Star Expertise How does your building, office, hotel, or retail space compare? Goby's first step in any sustainability program is performing an Energy Star benchmark in order to determine the most appropriate next steps. First and foremost, an Energy Star benchmark allows us to optimize operations and reduce operating expenses. In addition, many states or cities are enacting ordinances and mandates which require Energy Star reporting – by planning ahead now, you can be prepared for pending legislation and mandatory reporting. Finally, many major corporations and the GSA require offices located in Energy Star rated buildings. Goby is in the top 10% of Energy Star providers nation-wide. We have benchmarked and certified more than 250M ft² of Energy Star space. Our action plans have resulted in millions of dollars in operational savings. This includes commercial real estate, hotels, retail, industrial, and corporate users. Goby has also become one of the few Licensed Professional firms for the EPA’s Energy Star Portfolio Manager. This level of achievement is a testament to not only our Energy Star expertise but the dedication that we exude in continual sustainability excellence. “Achieving LEED status is no simple easy task. We needed assistance in the analysis of the Building and the LEED Application process. Goby’s team has the experience, certifications and pragmatic approach towards achieving the LEED status.” Jeb Scherb |Owner | 211 W.

Sustainability in our operations The success of Goby depends on our responsible environmental mindfulness and stewardship in all of our activities. We continuously commit ourselves to develop and implement best management practices for a sustainable, yet profitable existence. This commitment arises from a sense of concerned citizenship and moral duty. Goby has a desire to lead by example and extend our influence to improve the environment. As a role model, we need to endorse our own recommendation; therefore, Goby is committed to implementing its own sustainability policy. We firmly believe a company’s responsibility no matter its size is essential to how it operates. This begins with the day-to-day relationships it maintains with employees, customers, partners, suppliers, non-governmental associations and society as a whole. We are committed to our sustainability progress by launching this program, collecting the data and reporting the progress for transparency. Environment We believe that preventing global warming is a great challenge for humankind and every company as small as they may be should contribute and take actions to reverse climate change. At Goby, we are willing to incorporate climate change issues into business decisions and conduct our corporate activities with controlled environmental impacts to fully meet our responsibility and stewardship as a corporate citizen. As such, we have engaged policies to control our impact on the environment. We encourage our employees to develop reasonable and eco-friendly consumption. Under the responsibility of managers, all employees play an active role in adhering to environmental procedures in their day-to-day tasks. Goby is planning to dynamically control its environmental footprint from year to year and step by step. Our environmental protection policy particularly emphasizes global compact principles 3,4,5,7, 8 and 9 around four key areas: Air Quality Management: with a strong focus on controlling business travel and enabling responsible mobility. Energy Management: with priority to efficient use of energy in our office. Waste Management: with priority to responsible printing and waste recycling . Sustainable Purchasing: with a strong focus on products that minimize negative environmental impacts. Dynamic Workplace Bolstered by the talent and expertise of our 20+ employees, Goby's human resources policy focuses on the welfare of employees and training to motivate staff and boost performance. Competitive pay and benefits, career development in sustainable training (LEED certifications) and equal opportunities are fundamental to attracting and supporting employees. Goby helps employees to balance work and home commitments by offering flexible work options. Goby offers a comprehensive Wellness programs via our healthcare provider that includes gym membership discounts, among its plethora of perks. Health insurance is the core of wellness and as such Goby covers the cost of employees’ plans 100%. We holistically believe in providing a safe and healthy working environment for employees as well as outside the Goby organization. Air Quality Management First and foremost, Goby’s headquarters is located within a LEED certified building which complies with higher standards of Air Quality Management for its employees. Further, as mobility is essential to our business operations, it is important that we make ecologically sound and efficient choices to moderate the negative effects of business travel to the greatest extent possible. Control Business Travels: Priority to Web Conferencing over Flying and Bundling of Trips Emissions produced by business travel are one of the major direct environmental impacts generated by service firms. We have engaged initiatives to control business travel and the environmental impact of our employees’ daily work commutes. Goby is aware of the impact on the environment of the employees’ daily commute to work. This is why Goby makes sure its offices are located in areas easily accessible to public transportation. Our LEED Gold Office Building provides secure bike lock-up as well as locker room to entice Gobies to commute via bicycle. In fact, we participated in the Chicago Green Office Challenge this year. Gobies were encouraged to bike to/from work and compete against other businesses in terms of green commuting. 100% of Goby employees use environmental-friendly transportation for their daily commute, whether its public transit, walking or biking we are doing the green thing! Energy Management Goby recognizes that implementing processes to improve energy efficiency has positive impact: at the economical level (lower energy costs), at the environmental level (reduced greenhouse gas emissions) and at the social level (enhanced comfort for employees). Goby’s environmental policy in terms of energy management primarily aims to efficiently use energy in our office. We have retro-fitted the lighting with energy efficient lighting which has reduced energy costs by 25%. Even further, we utilize motion censored lighting in our common spaces and inform employees of best practices in shutting down power at the end of each work day. Further, all Goby employees are issued Energy Star certified Laptops that efficiently use power. We are consistently looking to technology reduce our carbon footprint. Waste Management At Goby, we strive to operate our daily office activities with as little impact on the environment as possible. Our environmental policy in terms of waste management is as follows: Recycling: we have dedicated paper, and can/bottle recycling stations on our office in common areas for all to use. We also engage in quarterly e-waste recycling for better management of electronics recycling. Priority to Paperless Communication: we are committed to greater use of recycled paper, both in our everyday business as well as for our communications (presentations, client meetings, product fact sheets, etc.). Responsible Printing: double sided printing, with emphasis on printing only if needed. Pages that can be reused are placed in the recycled printing paper bin for future reuse. Sustainable Purchasing At Goby, our environmental stewardship expands into purchasing products that minimize our negative environmental impact. We utilize green purchasing practices and evaluate the entire life cycle of the products and materials we purchase. Developed and implemented ENERGY STAR certified appliance/equipment purchasing guidelines. Purchase office products that are environmentally preferred considering not only the product but its packaging as well. We will not utilize suppliers that don’t execute generally accepted child labour laws as Goby supports the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour and the effective abolition of child labor. Further we support our client Carlson Rezidor in their philanthropic efforts against child trafficking.
