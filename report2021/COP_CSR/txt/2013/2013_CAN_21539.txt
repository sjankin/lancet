In 2012, we got better at finding ways to enable people to remain on-the-job with modified duties, during recovery from injury that kept them from performing regular duties. The number of plans for re-integrations of this type increased by nearly 40 per cent from 2011. For both financial and social reasons, people typically prefer to remain at work if they can, increase in workplace and continued activity often assists with injury recovery. This improvement also reduced both the Re-integration number of lost-time injuries and the injury severity that would otherwise have occurred in 2012.

This lagoon is not required to meet effluent quality standards due to the installation of additional treatment infrastructure at the mill in 1993 and subsequent production closures. TSS and BOD levels in late 2012 remained well below permit levels of 5.84 and 3.25 kg/adt respectively, which in turn are less than half the standard permit levels applicable at other mills in British Columbia.

Legislation in both Canada and the U.S. requires facilities such as Catalyst’s to annually report releases of any of a large number of substances if they exceed defined thresholds, including releases to air, water and land, and volumes sent for disposal or recycling. Reported volumes are based on actual measurement or estimates arrived at using defensible methodologies. This information is compiled by Environment Canada in the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI), and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), and is available via www.ec.gc.ca/inrp-npri and www.epa.gov/tri. The table above shows the combined total of all releases reported to the NPRI and TRI for all of Catalyst’s operations. Full-year releases from Snowflake are included for 2008 (see measures marked with an asterisk*), notwithstanding the acquisition date of April 10. Since releases are reported in the spring for the previous calendar year, 2012 data were not yet available when this report was prepared. Data are not included [ – ] in instances where reporting was not required by the regulator.
