The acquisition of a 100% stake in TNK–BP by Rosneft, announced in 2012, became the largest transaction of the year in the global mergers and acquisitions market. It helped us become the world’s largest public oil and gas company in terms of production of both oil and hydrocarbons as a whole, and also increase our lead over other public companies in the industry in terms of proved oil reserves. As a result of the transaction, ВР with its 19.75% interest became our second largest shareholder after the Russian Government. Rosneft continued to develop cooperation with international partners — a process, which was started with establishing a partnership with ExxonMobil. In 2012, the Company signed strategic cooperation agreements with the global oil and gas companies ENI and Statoil. These partnerships help the Company successfully implement new major projects in complicated geographic conditions and substantially expand its involvement in projects outside Russia. The Company is the largest user of subsoil resources on the Russian continental shelf. The Sakhalin projects in the Far East helped it gain extensive experience of offshore operations. The year 2012 was marked by the beginning of large–scale geological exploration and research works on A M e s s a g e f r o m C h a i rm a n o f t h e B o a r d o f D i r e c to r s o f R o s n e f t O i l C o m pa n y 5 the Arctic shelf of Russia. These projects are implemented with the involvement of our international partners and provide a platform for sharing assets, technologies, and best practices. The effects of our planned investment in the development of hydrocarbon resources on the shelf will be felt on a global scale. Rosneft and its partners committed to localize the manufacturing of a significant portion of the necessary equipment in Russia and already started designing a drilling platform for geological exploration in the Arctic, which will be built by a Russian shipyard using state–of–the–art international technologies. The Company expands oil production at the Vankor field — a staple of the new oil province in Eastern Siberia. It also continues a major modernization of its Russian refineries. In future, as a result of the modernization, Rosneft intends to use hydrocarbon resources more efficiently, start manufacturing petroleum products compliant with the Euro 5 environmental standard, and expand the range of its products. Sustainability has become particularly important to the Company in its new role as the global leader of the industry. As earlier, Rosneft is guided by the highest standards in the field of environmental protection, industrial safety, occupational health and safety, as well as relations with employees and the regions where it operates. However, now the Company has to not only comply with the existing standards, but also create best practices for the industry, and we hope that the partnership with the industry’s leading companies will help us in this effort. Technology development is Rosneft’s another priority over the next few years. The main objectives in this area include more efficient development of mature fields and fields with low–permeability reservoirs. The Company already uses state–of–the–art techniques, develops unique solutions in–house, and uses solutions from the leading Russian R&D centers. We are going to continue making progress. The Company faces difficult challenges: to carry out a successful integration of TNK–BP assets and continue the development of strategic projects. But we realize that the future is created today and it depends on the decision we make. We have an enormous responsibility, since those decisions will shape the future of our children. Alexander Nekipelov, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Rosneft Oil Company 6 R o s n e f t S u s ta i n a b i l i t y R e p o r t 2 012 A Message from Igor Sechin, President of Rosneft Oil Company In 2012, the Company continued implementing the strategic initiatives it had planned earlier. The acquisition of TNK–BP assets, implementation of strategic agreements with ExxonMobil, ENI, and Statoil with regard to offshore projects on the Russian shelf and development of hard–to–recover reserves, entering new foreign assets — all these developments give rise to new objectives for the Company and require new management approaches. Environmental and industrial safety, OHS, and innovation become increasingly important to the Company, entering the list of its top priorities. In 2012, Rosneft successfully continued putting its activities in those areas on a systematic footing in order to make them fully consistent with the Company’s objectives. To emphasize the significance of these aspects, the year 2012 was declared the Year of Health, Safety, and Environment at Rosneft. As a result of our efforts in this area, we were able to reduce the number of occupational injuries, counting this among our most important achievements. A M e s s a g e f r o m Pr e s i d e n t o f R o s n e f t O i l C o m pa n y 7 Together with its partners — ExxonMobil and Statoil — Rosneft developed and signed a declaration on environmentally sound operations on the Arctic shelf. Furthermore, the Company signed a memorandum of cooperation with the Agency for Strategic Initiatives intended to facilitate the innovation–based development of both the Company’s business and the entire industry. The Company continued systematic implementation of all its targeted programs including those in the field of environmental management, industrial safety, and innovation, among others. In 2012, the Company’s overall investments under the Innovation Development Program amounted to RUB 9.9 bn, or 16% more than in the previous year. As a result of the Program activities, the Company filed 18 patent applications. Investments in OHS and industrial safety were RUB 3.5 bn — a 51% increase compared to 2011. Environmental expenditures amounted to RUB 11.5 bn, or 57% higher than in the previous year. In 2012, Rosneft’s engagement in socio–economic development of its regions of operation was raised to a new level. The Company’s subsidiaries operate in all federal districts of Russia, and it has become necessary to develop cooperation not only at the local and regional levels, but also at the level of larger administrative units — federal districts. In 2012, Rosneft signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the Ministry for Development of the Russian Far East and a strategic partnership agreement for socio–economic development of the Urals Federal District. In the past year, the Company invested over RUB 2.8 bn within the framework of regional socio– economic cooperation agreements. Once again it became the largest taxpayer in Russia, providing RUB 1.7 trillion to budgets at all levels, including RUB 171 bn paid to regional budgets. Rosneft facilitates the development of the national economy: in the past year, it purchased some 85% of necessary goods and services from Russian providers. The Company employs over 175 thousand persons1. To ensure development and decent remuneration of the staff — Rosneft’s most significant asset — all subsidiaries have numerous training, incentive, and motivation programs. The Company continues to maintain the corporate candidate pool and support the development of young professionals as a foundation of its human resource potential. The Company is a participant of a number of Russian and international sustainability initiatives. For example, it is a member of the UN Global Compact, and as such supports its principles and goals. The Company is an active participant of the international integrated reporting initiative and the interagency working group for the preparation of a concept of non–financial reporting development in Russia, which functions under the auspices of the Russian Ministry for Economic Development. In 2013, the Company will have to address a number of ambitious objectives, the most important of them being the integration of TNK–BP assets. Rosneft has to carry out the integration in such a way that the consolidated company conforms to the industry’s best international standards.

Rosneft Oil Company publishes its sustainability reports on an annual basis; the previous one — Rosneft Sustainability Report 2011 — was published in the summer 2012. The target audience of this Report includes stakeholder groups described in Rosneft Sustainability Reports for 2008–2011 together with methods used to engage with them. All those reports and additional information about various aspects of the Company’s sustainability performance are available on the corporate website. This Report, like the previous year’s one, comprises two parts. The first part covers performance of the Company as a whole, whereas the second part takes a regional perspective, presenting information by federal districts of Russia. This Report does not duplicate detailed information provided in Rosneft Annual Report 2012; a brief summary with appropriate references is provided instead. The Company further develops its approaches towards sustainability reporting and data collection. In 2012, a decision was made to create an integrated automated system for the collection and analysis of environmental, health, safety, and emergency preparedness data. The Company plans to implement a project for the creation of the system in 2013 and complete its deployment in 2014. To ensure effective feedback with regard to its sustainability performance, the Company carries out stakeholder meetings in its regions of operation on an annual basis (for more details see section Stakeholder Engagement). Furthermore, an online feedback form is available in the Sustainable Development section of the corporate website (www.rosneft.com) for any reader to send his or her comments and suggestions to the Company. Reporting principles Rosneft’s sustainability reporting process is based on the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines by the Global Reporting Initiative (hereinafter — the GRI Guidelines), version 3.1. The Company accepts and applies the reporting principles defined in the GRI Guidelines and described in Rosneft Sustainability Report 2008. This Report contains information on all indicators defined in the GRI Oil and Gas Sector Supplement. Furthermore, in the process of preparing this report, the Company analyzed requirements of the upcoming fourth version of the GRI Guidelines, which is planned to be released in 2013. In preparing its sustainability reports, the Company also considers the basic performance indicators for non–financial reporting developed by the RUIE (Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs), and the Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting by IPIECA/ API (2010). This Report also reflects the Company’s progress in implementing the principles of the UN Global Compact. This Report has been prepared in accordance with A+ GRI application level and undergone an independent assurance by Ernst & Young (CIS) B.V. The independent assurance report is available on pp. 96–97 of this Report. As part of the process of integrating TNK–BP assets, the Company plans to analyze sustainability reporting approaches of both companies and adopt the best practices identified in the process. About This Report 15 Reporting Rosneft prepares its sustainability reports at the company–wide level, covering all of its major operboundaries ating subsidiaries. The 2012 Report covers main subsidiaries controlled by the Company and OJSC Tomskneft managed on a parity basis. The Company continues to develop its internal sustainability reporting procedures, gradually implementing its plan for the transition to a single sustainability reporting boundary. In 2012, consolidation boundaries with regard to HR management, social performance, and OHS did not undergo significant changes: LLC RN–Energo (the asset was sold) was excluded, whereas CJSC Eastern Petrochemical Company and OJSC Far Eastern Bank were included into the boundary. The reporting boundary with regard to environmental performance also underwent insignificant changes: a number of refining and service operations — LLC Purneftepererabotka, CJSC Eastern Petrochemical Company, LLC RN–Bunker, and CJSC RN–Energoneft — were added; the list of marketing companies included in the boundary was partially revised. There were no significant changes in the scope of reporting (economic, social, and environmental aspects of sustainability) compared to the previous reports. 16 R o s n e f t S u s ta i n a b i l i t y R e p o r t 2 012 Company Performance 10 10 This Sustainability Report contains only brief information on the topics covered in this section.

The key sectors of Rosneft’s business include the exploration and production of oil and gas, manufacturing of petroleum products and petrochemicals, and marketing of outputs. The Company has been included in the list of strategic Russian enterprises. As of December 31, 2012, is largest shareholder (75.16% of the equity) was OJSC Rosneftegaz, fully owned by the Russian Government. The geography of Rosneft’s exploration and production operations encompasses all the key oil and gas regions of Russia, including Western Siberia, Southern and Central Russia, Timan–Pechora, Eastern Siberia, the Far East, and the Arctic shelf. The Company is also engaged in projects in Kazakhstan, Algeria, Venezuela, and the UAE. Rosneft’s seven major refineries are spread across Russia, from the Black Sea coast to the Far East, whereas the Company’s retail network encompasses 46 Russian regions. At the end of 2012, the acquisition of TNK–BP by Rosneft was announced. As a result of the transactions completed in March 2013, Rosneft Oil Company became the global leader among public oil and gas companies in terms of hydrocarbon production and confirmed its leading positions in terms of proved oil reserves. BP, in its turn, substantially increased its stake in the Company, becoming the second largest shareholder with a 19.75% interest after the Russian Government. C o m pa n y P e r f o rm a n c e 19 Acquisition of the The acquisition of the TNK–ВР Group is a transaction on a unique scale by both Russian and TNK–BP Group global standards. After the integration of TNK–BP assets, Rosneft’s production assets will be supplemented by the Samotlor field, and by production operations in Khanty–Mansi and Yamalo–Nenets Autonomous Areas, Tyumen, Orenburg and Samara Regions, and Krasnoyarsk Territory. The united Company will carry out production and exploration at over 830 license areas. ABC1+C2 recoverable reserves will be over 11 bn tonnes of oil and condensate and 5.8 tscm of gas. The Company will run 11 refineries in Russia and 6 outside Russia (holding stakes in 4 refineries based in Germany, the Mozyr Refinery in Belarus, and the Lisichansk Refinery in Ukraine), and will sell petroleum products through a retail network of 2,43511 filling stations. Furthermore, the acquisition of TNK–BP will help Rosneft expand its international business, adding projects in Brazil and Vietnam and bringing the number of projects being simultaneously implemented in Venezuela to five. In 2013, the Company will face a challenge: to create, within the shortest timeframe possible, an integrated company consistent with Rosneft’s strategic development plans and the leading international standards not only in terms of operational and economic performance, but also in such fields as environmental and industrial safety, OHS, human resource management, development of regions of operation etc The process of integrating TNK–BP assets will include the following:   reparation and planning for the integration, when necessary working groups will be created p and a methodology of integration will be developed;  detailed planning of the integration and steps necessary to realize the joint potential;  the integration proper and the creation of a unified company. It is planned that the main changes to the organizational structure and business processes will be implemented by the end of 2013, whereas the process of complete integration is expected to continue until mid–2014. 11 With newly acquired assets in Ukraine and Belarus taken into account, the number of filling stations is 2,625  20 R o s n e f t S u s ta i n a b i l i t y R e p o r t 2 012 Upstream Business of Rosneft Oil Company and TNK-BP Timano-Pechora License Blocks Messoyakha Polar Lights WestSevernaya Neft Zapolyarnoye Vankor Moscow Beregovoye Pyreinoye Rospan Khadyryakhinskoye Nyagan Kharampurskoye Gubkinskoye Kynsko-Chaselsko Purneftegaz Udmurtneft Yuganskneftegaz Megionneftegaz Samotlor Nizhnevartovskneftega Samaraneftegaz Priazovneft Orenburgneft Uvat Krasnodarneftegaz Tomskneft Stavropolneftegaz Caspian Oil Company Grozneftegaz Astrakhan Region License Blocks Dagneft Rosneft assets Oil production assets Exploration assets Gas projects TNK-BP assets Oil production assets Exploration assets Gas projects Itera assets Gas projects C o m pa n y P e r f o rm a n c e 21 Suzunskoye and Tagulskoye Russkoye ye Kuyumbinskoye Taas-Yuriakh Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye Irkutsk Region Sakhalin-1,3,5 z License Blocks Krasnoyarsk Region Sakhalinmorneftegaz License Blocks Verkhnechonskoye International Projects of Rosneft and TNK-BP 1.

In 2012, Rosneft was recognized the Company of the Year in the category International Offshore Projects in the Arctic of the competition Business Results 2012. Partnership with ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil, a company having a longtime experience of the development of hard–to–recover oil reserves, including offshore oil fields in the North, has become the first strategic partner of Rosneft. The two companies plan to implement a number of joint projects for the exploration and development of hydrocarbon reserves in Russia, the US, and other countries. In 2011, they signed an agreement on the exploration and development of several fields, including East Prinovozemelsky–1, –2 and –3 in the Kara Sea and the Tuapse license area in the Black Sea. In 2012, as part of strategic partnership between Rosneft and ExxonMobil, an agreement concerning pilot development of Bazhenov and Achimov formations in West Siberia was signed. The two companies also agreed on the participation of ExxonMobil in the Arctic Research and Design Center for Offshore Development and signed the declaration concerning the development of hydrocarbon resources on the Russian Arctic Shelf in an environmentally sound manner. Partnership with Statoil. Rosneft signed a number of agreements with Statoil for the creation of a joint venture to work at Rosneft’s license areas in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Barents Sea, and for the joint appraisal of hard–to–recover oil reserves at the Company‘s fields in Western Siberia and Stavropol Territory. At the end of 2012, Statoil joined the Declaration on the Protection of the Environment and Conservation of Biodiversity during the Exploration and Development of Mineral Resources on the Russian Arctic Continental Shelf. Partnership with Eni. In 2012, Rosneft signed an agreement with Eni for the creation of a joint venture to develop license areas on the Russian shelf in the Barents and Black Seas. Eni will fully finance the geological exploration and reimburse most of the historical costs. C o m pa n y P e r f o rm a n c e 23 Sustainability Governance and Management Rosneft Oil Company’s corporate governance system12 includes the General Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of Directors, a collegial executive body (the Management Board) and a chief executive officer (the Company President). In 2012, Igor Sechin became Rosneft President. As in the previous years, the top executive responsible for the coordination of the Company’s sustainability activities was Vice President for HR and Social Policy. At the level of the Board of Directors, these issues are overseen by the Board’s HR and Remuneration Committee. In 2012, in accordance with directives of the Russian Government, a Board meeting was held to discuss and approve the Company’s approach towards the application of voluntary environmental responsibility mechanisms and corporate sustainability reporting based on the international standards. The Company’s President was made responsible for:  preparation and publication of annual sustainability reports;  development of a stakeholder engagement and dialogue system;  development of an integrated corporate database of sustainability performance indicators. The corporate departments immediately responsible for the management of operational and environmental safety include the Environmental Safety and Technology Department and the Safety and Health Department. In 2012, those two departments and the Energy Department were consolidated under a single corporate unit. At the Board level, the issues of health, safety, and environment are supervised by the Board’s Strategic Planning Committee. All senior executives of the Company report to the Board of Directors in terms of key performance indicators (KPIs). The size of bonuses paid to the executives depends on meeting their respective KPI targets. The KPIs are defined based on the Company’s specific objectives, which encompass, among others, such areas as transparency, environmental performance, occupational health and safety, social security of employees, and engagement with the society. Sustainability Policy The Company has a Sustainability Policy, which defines Rosneft’s sustainability goals, objectives, and principles, as well as approaches to stakeholder engagement and sustainability reporting principles. The document is available in the Sustainable Development section of the corporate website Code of Business Rosneft has the Code of Business Ethics, compliance with which is mandatory for all executives, ofEthics ficials, and employees of the Company. The Company maintains a system for reporting breaches of the Code of Business Ethics electronically; complaints can be sent to the address code@rosneft.ru 12 The Company’s corporate governance system is described in detail in Rosneft Annual Report and the previous sustainability reports 24 R o s n e f t S u s ta i n a b i l i t y R e p o r t 2 012 Risk Management Development of the In 2012, Rosneft started the implementation of an integrated risk management system. The ComRisk Management pany’s Risk Department, a unit established in the reporting year, prepared a roadmap for the system development. To support the implementation of the risk management system, an action plan System consistent with the scale of Rosneft’s business was developed. A Risk Management System Concept has been drafted; currently the document undergoes the approval process. The Concept encompasses the determination of risk appetite by senior management, identification and assessment of risks, risk management actions and their relation to the Company’s management processes, relevant reporting, and raising awareness of the risks among internal and external stakeholders. Building on the Concept, efforts to develop a risk classification scheme and identify the Company’s key risks were started. The most significant risks were selected for subsequent detailed analysis and quantitative assessment. The risk screening process relied on the expertise of risk management consultants working with the real sector and specifically oil and gas industry, and on the results of a preliminary qualitative assessment of risks and their key parameters. Rosneft’s own experts having profound knowledge of various aspects of the Company’s operations were also involved in the risk screening process. The upcoming integration of TNK–BP assets will require further adjustments to the risk management system in order to accommodate the Company’s new needs. Key risks associated with This Report contains a detailed discussion of sustainability–related risks to which the Company the Company’s operations is exposed. Those include risks related to environmental impacts, industrial safety, occupational health and safety, HR management, and relations with regional stakeholders. Industry, country and regional, as well as financial and legal risks also mentioned below are discussed in detail in quarterly issuer’s reports available on the Company’s website. Risks related to prices for crude oil, gas, and petroleum products: A decline in product prices may lead to a reduction in the amount of oil and gas that the Company can produce profitably, which, in turn, may lead to a reduction in the volume of reserves that can be developed in an economically sound manner, and to a lower economic efficiency of the Company’s prospecting and exploration programs. Risks related to the dependence on monopolistic provides of oil, gas, and petroleum product transportation services and on their tariffs: Rosneft depends on such monopolistic providers of product transportation services as Transneft, Russian Railways, and Gazprom, and has no control over the infrastructure operated by them and their rates. Risks related to geographic and climatic conditions: Abnormally low winter temperatures in a number of northern regions may complicate operations of the Company’s oil production enterprises. Low winter temperatures, as well as complicated ice and wave conditions in northern seas lead to increased risks affecting the safety of offshore exploration operations, which, in turn, may result in delays in project implementation. Exports via Black Sea terminals to Mediterranean ports may be constrained by the throughput of the Bosphorus and by weather conditions (storm winds) in the Black Sea during the autumn. Also, complicated ice conditions during the winter may lead to a suspension of operations of export terminals on the Baltic Sea and at De–Kastri. An extended delay in the functioning of export terminals may have adverse effect on the Company’s operating performance and financial position. Risks related to sales of gas produced by the Company: Virtually all natural gas produced in Russia is transported through the United Gas Supply System (UGSS) owned and operated by Gazprom. A further increase in the Company’s gas production and its sales to independent C o m pa n y P e r f o rm a n c e 25 regional traders and independent industrial customers will depend on sufficient access to the UGSS, whereas at present there are no guarantees of such access in the future. Risks related to insufficient accuracy of oil and gas reserves estimates: The data on oil and gas reserves used by the Company are estimates based mainly on the results of internal analytical work by the company D&M, an independent consultant to Rosneft on petroleum engineering issues. The actual size of reserves may differ from those estimates substantially. Risks related to competition: The oil and gas industry is intensely competitive. Rosneft competes mainly with other Russian leading oil and gas companies and is one of the industry leaders both nationally and globally, which significantly strengthens its competitive positions. The Company’s substantial portfolio of new projects will help it maintain and strengthen its competitive edge in the future. Risks related to environmental impacts, industrial safety, and OHS, which may lead to substantial costs: All types of the Company’s core operations, including exploration, production, processing and transportation of oil, petroleum products, and gas, may cause adverse environmental impacts and pose threats to employees’ lives and health. Such threats may stem from different sources, including the human factor (e.g. failure to comply with workplace safety requirements), equipment failure, natural disasters, or illicit third–party activities. This risk type is particularly significant when carrying out operations in complicated climatic and geographic conditions, e.g. when developing offshore license areas. The realization of such risks may result in a significant damage to the environment and a threat to human life and health, since most processes used by the Company involve large amounts of oil, gas, and petroleum products — substances posing a fire and explosion hazard. As a result, the Company may be exposed not only to major losses and additional costs, but also to the risk of closure of some of its facilities and a serious reputational damage. Risks associated with insufficient effectiveness of the emergency response system: The Company’s industrial processes are characterized by a high probability of incidents and accidents. Therefore accident response plans have been developed for all process or facilities where such probability is significant. The ineffectiveness of the developed plan or a failure to comply it may amplify adverse effects of the incident or accident. This may lead to significant additional expenditures on the recovery and restoration of normal production operations. Risks related to potential failure to attract or retain highly–skilled workforce: The Company’s employees are a key factor of its success. The Company meets its strategic objectives and performance targets through coordinated efforts of its team. Insufficient skills among the staff or the scarcity of necessary human resources may lead to the Company’s inability to meet its strategic objectives and financial performance targets, as well as additional costs for the recruitment and replacement of staff and a reputational damage Risks related to the development of alternative energy sources: Whereas alternative energy is presently at an early phase of its development, many traditional energy companies are already investing actively in alternative energy projects. Today such projects are driven mainly by marketing considerations, but in the future they may become a source of competitive advantage. Then the underdevelopment of alternative energy projects may lead to additional financial losses and adversely affect the Company’s reputation. Country and regional risks: The Company operates in all federal districts of the Russian Federation, and its activities should be consistent with the respective regional development strategies. Furthermore, the Company is exposed to risks associated with its business outside of the Russian Federation. Most of the Company’s foreign operations are based in developing economics characterized by more serious political, economic, social, and legal risks than countries with more developed markets. In many regards, the risks of doing business in such countries are similar to or more significant than those typical to Russia.  26 R o s n e f t S u s ta i n a b i l i t y R e p o r t 2 012 Financial risks: The Company actively expands its business using both its own resources and borrowed funds. Most of Rosneft’s gross revenue is generated from export of crude oil and petroleum products. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the ruble affect the Company’s financial performance, exposing the Company to currency risk. The Company’s currency risk is mitigated to a significant extent by the existence of costs and loans denominated in foreign currencies. Being a major borrower, the Company is also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates. Legal risks: The Company’s business is exposed to a number of legal risks, including those associated with potential changes in tax legislation, customs rules and duties, requirements with regard to the licensing of the Company’s core operations and the use of limited–availability resources (including natural resources), regulation of land use and urban development, and judicial practice in the areas relevant to the Company’s business (including licensing issues). Such changes may adversely affect the Company’s performance and outcomes of pending court cases in which it is involved. Another type of relevant legal risks is the risks associated with violation of anti–monopoly laws, which may lead to substantial fines determined as a percentage (starting from 8%) of annual sales in a certain market. A special category of legal risks is those associated with changes in environmental and operational safety legislation. For example, the Federal Law No. 287 (dated December 30, 2012) “On Amendments to the Federal Law on the Continental Shelf of the Russian Federation and the Federal Law on Inland Seas, Territorial Waters and the Zone Adjoining the Russian Federation” sets out requirements for the operation and use of artificial islands, units, facilities, underwater pipelines, and for the performance of drilling works on the continental shelf, in inland seas and territorial waters. The Federal Law, which enters into force on July 1, 2013, introduces additional requirements with regard to the prevention and remediation of oil and petroleum product spills at sea. The Company will be significantly affected by the requirements concerning financial resources to be set aside and guarantees to be provided by companies operating the facilities to which the new law applies. Insurance The Company views insurance as a risk management tool that allows to transfer financial losses from the realization of the risks insured against to professional insurance organizations. The most significant risks are insured against in the international reinsurance market. The Company concludes insurance contracts covering risks associated with exploration, processing, and storage of oil and petroleum products; the contracts are extended on an annual basis. The production and processing facilities, as well as construction and installation works are also covered by insurance. In accordance with the Russian legislation, Rosneft participates in compulsory liability insurance schemes. The Company has a risk insurance program for its key assets, which includes property insurance, insurance against equipment failure and business interruption, and integrated risk insurance for construction and installation works within the framework of the refinery modernization program. In 2012, Rosneft introduced a comprehensive liability insurance program covering the Company’s operations in Russia and abroad, including insurance against damages associated with onshore and offshore production operations C o m pa n y P e r f o rm a n c e 27 Stakeholder Engagement Stakeholder Engagement with regard to New Projects At the SPIEF 2012, Igor Sechin, head of Rosneft, said: “Now we have a real window of opportunity for global cooperation. I urge politicians, companies, financial institutions to work towards closer coordination, since we have an enormous responsibility for the reliability of energy supply” In the context of its offshore development projects, the Company not only carries out public engagement activities within the framework of the environmental impact assessment process, but also participates in the existing thematic initiatives and working groups. The Company participates in the activities of the Expert Advisory Group for the conservation and study of the Atlantic walrus in the southeastern Barents Sea and adjacent waters — a non–governmental body established by the Marine Mammal Council and WWF Russia. In cooperation with the group, Rosneft developed actions to prevent threats to the walrus population associated with offshore seismic surveying, which were approved by the expert community. Seismic surveys at the South–Russky and East Prinovozemelsky–1, –2 and –3 license areas were carried out in full compliance with the approved action plan. The cooperation with non–governmental and research organizations within the framework of the Expert Advisory Group helps the Company address biodiversity conservation issues in the broad context of its offshore operations. Within the framework of its offshore projects in the Kara Sea, the Company carried out a number of meetings with local communities to present its proposed seismic survey program. The public hearings were focused on the discussion of proposed programs for two license areas in Kara Sea developed in partnership with ExxonMobil . Local community members and interested NGOs were able to meet developers of the seismic survey program and independent environmental experts, ask questions of interest to them, and express their opinion on the proposed program using special questionnaire forms. Materials on the proposed works were made publicly available, and all stakeholders were able to review them in advance. In Salekhard, Rosneft carried out a working meeting hosted by the government of Yamalo–Nenets Autonomous Area and attended by representatives of relevant regional departments, municipal authorities, and non–governmental activists. At the meeting, Company representatives informed participants about proposed seismic survey programs for the East Prinovozemelsky–1 28 R o s n e f t S u s ta i n a b i l i t y R e p o r t 2 012 and –2 license areas and presented the positive experience of implementing offshore projects in complicated natural conditions of the Russian Far East. The results of the public hearings carried out by the Company were submitted for the state environmental expert review as part of project materials Stakeholder In 2012, Company carried out the sixth annual series of traditional roundtable meetings with its Roundtable Meetings stakeholders in the key regions of operation. A total of 34 Rosneft subsidiaries took part in the events held in 15 Russian regions. The format and the main objectives of the events remained in the Key Regions of unchanged from the previous series: the meetings were focused on open discussion of the key Operation issues faced by local communities and the Company with the involvement of all stakeholder groups. Based on the outcomes of the events, a summary analysis of the results of all stakeholder meetings held in 2012 was carried out, typical objectives were identified, and proposals on possible ways to achieve those objectives were prepared. Actions taken by the Company in response to the issues identified are described in the sections of this Report dedicated to activities of Rosneft subsidiaries in their regions of operation. The most significant trend observed during the sixth series of stakeholder meetings was the shifting of the focus from environmental concerns to the aspects of regional socio–economic development and the Company’s contribution to that development. This was a result, firstly, of significant progress of the Company and its subsidiaries in managing their environmental impacts, and secondly, better day–to–day collaboration with state supervisory authorities. Another new trend was the stakeholders’ perception of the Company and its subsidiaries as a significant factor of social and political stability in their regions of operation. This reflects significant contribution to regional economies and social development made by Company subsidiaries, typically being among the largest regional taxpayers and employers, and contracting local businesses on a large scale. One concern raised at many roundtable meetings was insufficient transparency of Company subsidiaries Roundtable meeting in Krasnodar C o m pa n y P e r f o rm a n c e 29 Regions where roundtable meetings with stakeholders to discuss Rosneft’s sustainability performance have been held Meetings in Region City Meetings in 2012 2007 — 2011 Altai Territory Barnaul 1 Archangelsk Region Archangelsk 3 + Irkutsk Region Angarsk 4 + Krasnodar 2 + Krasnodar Territory Tuapse 4 + Achinsk 2 Krasnoyarsk Territory Krasnoyarsk 2 + Primorsky Territory Nakhodka – + Komi Republic Usinsk 5 + Udmurt Republic Izhevsk 4 + Novokuibyshevsk 1 Samara Region Samara 4 + Sakhalin Region Yuzhno–Sakhalinsk 5 + Smolensk Region Smolensk 1 + Stavropol Territory Stavropol 2 + Komsomolsk–on–Amur 3 + Khabarovsk Territory Khabarovsk 2 Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Nefteyugansk 5 + Area Yamalo–Nenets Autonomous Gubkinsky 4 + Area 30 R o s n e f t S u s ta i n a b i l i t y R e p o r t 2 012 Innovation Development In 2012, innovation activities at the Company were focused on the effective implementation of its Innovation Development Program.13 Particular attention was paid to the commercial use of R&D results and securing intellectual property rights. As a result of targeted R&D projects, 18 patent applications were filed. Development In December 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the Innovation Policy of Rosneft Oil of the Innovation Company. The Policy establishes general requirements for the management of innovation activities at the Company. The areas covered by the document include organizational aspects of innovaManagement System tion management, key approaches in the field, decision–making criteria, and the general scheme of allocation of responsibilities among all participants of innovation processes. The document also defines key types of innovation activities at the Company and types of corporate targeted innovation projects. To facilitate the implementation of the Innovation Development Program, the most promising areas of R&D were identified; five special–purpose projects focused on the production and refining of unconventional and hard–to–recover hydrocarbon resources were selected. The projects will be implemented in partnership with research institutes and organizations of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In the reporting period, Rosneft embarked on a joint project with Rostec State Corporation to create an information bank on technologies used in the global oil industry. At the beginning of 2012, Rosneft acquired a research institute, which was included in the corporate structure as LLC RN–R&D Center. This helped the Company secure access to a number of advanced solutions and techniques in the field of oil production and refining, petrochemical and gas chemical industry. In the reporting year, the new center was integrated into the Company’s overall business, and a program of priority actions was adopted. The Company carried out R&D projects in such areas as alternative energy, as well as environmentally sound techniques for refining and petrochemical industries, including new material development. Rosneft and the Agency for Strategic Initiatives (ASI) signed a memorandum of cooperation for the promotion of new innovation projects and joint R&D activities in the areas relevant to the Company. Memorandum of In 2012, the Company and the ASI signed a Memorandum of Cooperation aimed at the promoCooperation with the tion of new innovation projects by medium–sized businesses and joint R&D activities in the areas Agency for Strategic relevant to the Company’s business. Initiatives It is planned that the ASI’s specialists and experts, who already have the experience of preparing innovation roadmaps for a number of business areas, will participate in the processes of expert review of the Company’s innovation projects and assessment of their efficiency, commercialization and promotion of project results both at the Company’s operations and across the entire industry. The priority areas of cooperation will encompass all areas of the Company’s business. For each area, priority R&D topics were selected including, among others:  d  evelopment of hard–to–recover resources (super–low permeability reservoirs, oil and gas shales, natural bitumen); 13 For more details about the Program see Rosneft Sustainability Report 2011. C o m pa n y P e r f o rm a n c e 31  i mprovement of the reliability and efficiency of energy equipment, development of autonomous energy sources, including alternative–energy based, for remote production sites;  e fficient recovery and use of associated petroleum gas, recovery and disposal of oil waste, minimization of adverse environmental impacts;  d  evelopment of state–of–the–art catalysts for refining and petrochemical processes, production of synthetic hydrocarbons etc. Environmental The key priorities of the Company’s targeted innovation projects with an environmental focus innovation projects include:   roviding the Company’s production entities with state–of–the–art solutions for comprehensive p treatment and disposal of oily and drilling waste;  d  eveloping state–of–the–art techniques for cleanup and remediation of oil–contaminated and disturbed lands, including those located in a cold climate. One example is a special–purpose innovation project for the development of a technique for the processing of oily waste and drill cuttings into construction materials. It is expected that the project will result in the designing of an industrial unit for the comprehensive processing of oily and drilling waste and production of construction materials suited for the use in complicated conditions at a variety of the Company’s oil production sites. This will not only help reduce waste management costs due to the production of marketable materials, but also contribute to addressing the problem of oil sludge and drill cuttings accumulation and disposal at the Company’s sites. Other innovation projects currently being at various implementation stages include:   evelopment of techniques for biological remediation of oil–contaminated sea and coastal d areas located in a cold climate;  d  evelopment of an integrated technique for remediation of soils salinized as a result of human activities;  c reation of a test site for the study of impact of oil spills on biocenoses of Northern Siberia and pilot testing of remediation techniques at sites with permafrost soils, among others. Construction of a pilot The Company has started the designing of a pilot production GTL (Gas to Liquids) unit. GTL is a production GTL unit process for converting natural gas and associated petroleum gas into synthetic liquid hydrocarbons having a higher quality than their natural analogues. Due to the relatively low capacity of the units, it will be possible to use them in remote areas where centralized APG collection and recovery on a large scale is unfeasible. The use of such units will make a significant contribution to achieving the target APG recovery rate at the Company’s facilities. The project is being implemented by RN–R&D Center, which has become a resident of the Skolkovo Foundation for the implementation of the GTL unit project.  32 R o s n e f t S u s ta i n a b i l i t y R e p o r t 2 012 A pilot GTL unit at the Novokuibyhevsk refinery A site for the installation of the first GTL unit at the Novokuibyshevsk Refinery has been already selected; the unit is planned to be commissioned in 2014. Innovation in the field Currently the Company implements two innovation projects for the development of alternative of alternative energy energy sources:   evelopment of new–generation solar panels on the basis of various types of metal oxide solar d cells, more efficient and less costly compared to the traditional ones. In is planned to install such panels in Sochi region by the end of 2013;  s tudy and development of techniques for the production of bio–oil and synthetic oil from recycled materials and waste. Both projects are implemented in partnership with the Emanuel Institute of Biochemical Physics (Russian Academy of Sciences) and currently are at the R&D stage. Activities of the Arctic In 2011, the Company established the Arctic Research and Design Center for Offshore DevelResearch and Design opment, a wholly owned subsidiary of OJSC Rosneft Oil Company. The creation of the center Center for Offshore was an important step toward the strategic development of offshore fields. Given complicated geological and engineering conditions for offshore development, particularly in the Arctic, the Development center’s main objective is providing research, development, and design support (through the development of new technologies, among other means) for all phases of the development of Arctic offshore oil and gas fields. An important priority of the center is ensuring environmental safety of offshore projects. Among other activities, it will provide a technology platform for environmental monitoring of the projects. Furthermore, the center will support the entire range of activities for ensuring industrial safety of offshore operations — it is planned that it will host the Company’s Offshore Emergency Prevention, Response, and Recovery Service. C o m pa n y P e r f o rm a n c e 33 In 2012, the center carried out the following environmental studies focused on offshore license areas in the Kara Sea:  unique expedition studies of the hydrometeorological and ice regimes of the Kara Sea;  i nstallation of automatic meteorological stations capable of transmitting data to the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology in the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago;   ilot tests of a satellite monitoring system supporting the observation of offshore license p areas and interpretation of satellite images for the purpose of designing an ice protection system, and of a satellite–based system supporting data exchange between onshore facilities and vessels;  a desk study of seabed materials and geological threats at the license areas. All these actions will contribute to a safer development of offshore fields in the Kara Sea. In 2012, an agreement on the participation of ExxonMobil in the activities of the Arctic Research and Design Center for Offshore Development was reached. The two companies jointly determined priorities of the center’s activities, designed research programs, approved a center development program until 2016 and the center’s budget for 2013. The Arctic shelf is one of the most difficult and environmentally vulnerable regions for oil field development 34 R o s n e f t S u s ta i n a b i l i t y R e p o r t 2 012 Performance in the In 2012, the Company commissioned several major facilities and developed a number new technoloField of Innovation gies including: Management in 2012  a unit for the preparation of associated petroleum gas for transportation via a pipeline, which will help address the problem of the recovery of APG with a high hydrogen sulphide content at small and medium–sized oil fields;  a software package for petroleum engineering — a toolbox for field development planning.

Therefore, many tests of new technologies and equipment were carried out not within the framework of the NTS but under specific pilot testing programs. C o m pa n y P e r f o rm a n c e 35 Environment The year 2012 was declared the Year of Health, Safety, and Environment at Rosneft and its subsidiaries. The initiative involved various events intended to raise awareness of OHS and environmental safety among employees and their family members and strengthen their responsibility for the respective aspects of the operations. Environmental cooperation with international partners increasingly becomes a foundation for ensuring environmental safety of the Company’s major projects, particularly offshore ones. Development of In 2012, the Company prepared a draft Environmental Safety Strategy of Rosneft Oil Company the Environmental until 2020, a document defining priority areas, actions, and mechanisms intended to bring environmental activities at the Company to the level of the respective international industry stanManagement System dards. The document is based on a comprehensive analysis of the Company’s current operations, international best practices, including approaches of Rosneft’s partners, and objectives associated with new projects. A number of new developments, including the acquisition of TNK–BP assets, development of international partnerships, and expansion of offshore operations, led to significant changes in the scale of the Company’s activities, influence, and responsibility, making it necessary to revise a number of important assumptions incorporated into the draft Strategy. Therefore it was decided to update not only the draft Strategy, but also the Company’s overall policy with regard to environmental safety. Alongside the process of re–assessing environmental risks in order to accommodate the expanded scale of the Company’s operations, this has become one of Rosneft’s priorities in the field of environmental management for 2013. Compliance with In 2012, Rosneft’s Integrated HSE Management System was re–certified for the next three– international management year period as compliant with the international standards ISO 14001:2004 Environmental system standards Management Systems and OHSAS 18001:2007 Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems. Development of International Environmental Cooperation. In 2012, the Company paid particular attention to environmental aspects of its offshore development projects. An important step in that regard was the signing of the Declaration on the Protection of the Environment and Conservation of Biodiversity during the Exploration and Development of Mineral Resources on the Russian Arctic Continental Shelf. The document was prepared on the Company’s initiative jointly with its partners: ExxonMobil, Statoil, an Eni. To ensure environmental safety of exploration operations carried out in partnership with ExxonMobil at license areas in the Kara Sea, the two companies established a joint Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) Committee for joint projects. The Committee serves as a platform for elaborating optimal solutions to mitigate environmental impacts associated with the operations. In 2012, a HSE plan was developed and a risk assessment was carried out for hydrometeorological studies at the license areas, which were successfully completed in the same year. 36 R o s n e f t S u s ta i n a b i l i t y R e p o r t 2 012 In August 2012, Igor Sechin, Rosneft President, and Helge Lund, Statoil CEO, signed a number of agreements defining conditions of cooperation between the two companies In 2012, under its agreement with Statoil concerning joint project on the Norwegian continental shelf, the Company applied for a pre–qualification in terms of environmental safety with a view to obtaining a permission to participate in a tender announced by the Norwegian Government. Declaration on the ProtecRecognizing that the Arctic environment comprises fragile ecosystems with unique natural feation of the Environment and tures and resources, the Company initiated the development of the Declaration on the ProtecConservation of Biodiversity tion of the Environment and Conservation of Biodiversity during the Exploration and Development of Mineral Resources on the Russian Arctic Continental Shelf. Alongside Rosneft, the during the Exploration and document was signed by ExxonMobil and Statoil; Eni declared its willingness to sign it. At presDevelopment of Mineral ent, the Company works together with ministries and governmental agencies to ensure effective Resources on the Russian implementation of the Declaration provisions, e.g. regarding the creation of effective cooperaArctic Continental Shelf tion mechanisms for the prevention of and coordinated response to emergencies, conservation of the environment and the biota. The document provides for the development of uniform approaches towards environmental safety of offshore operations, ongoing monitoring of changes in the state of Arctic landscapes and seas, and the development of international cooperation with the environmental strategy for the Arctic taken into account. Operations in Protected and Environmentally Vulnerable Areas. As the Company expands its operations, the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems becomes increasingly important. The top priority in this regard is environmental safety of operations in protected areas and their buffer zones. The Company has created and maintains a registry of protected natural areas potentially affected by operations of its subsidiaries. The registry is intended to support the monitoring and management of impacts of the Company’s operations on protected environmental features. The registry contains information about the Company’s relevant facilities (or license areas); specific operations carried out in protected areas and associated impact mitigation measures; engagement of the respective subsidiary with local authorities; and results of environmental inspections by regulators. The Company collects information on its industrial and infrastructure facilities adjacent to protected natural areas. C o m pa n y P e r f o rm a n c e 37 A sea lion cub enjoys getting photographed by staff members of SakhalinmorNIPIneft, participants of the environmental campaign For Clean Sakhalin Another important priority is the implementation of a system of measures for the conservation of biodiversity and prevention of adverse environmental impacts in the context of offshore projects:  e nvironmental impact assessment prior to the commencement of work, which includes public consultations, identification of biodiversity conservation measures and other actions to prevent or mitigate environmental impacts, and calculation of compensation for environmental damage;  o  btaining licenses and permits required by the legislation, including a positive conclusion of the state environmental expert review;  e ngagement with international and regional environmental NGOs, relevant authorities, and the expert community;  a broad range of environmental assessment and protection works, including an assessment of the background state of the natural environment and the biota, integrated environmental monitoring, self–monitoring, studies of marine ecology, and special measures to protect marine mammals;  p  lanning and development of specific internal regulations and standards addressing the specifics of offshore operations and taking into account risk assessment results for both exploration and production phases. 38 R o s n e f t S u s ta i n a b i l i t y R e p o r t 2 012 Environmental Emissions into air.

In 2012, the development of methodological guidelines for the inventory of greenhouse gas emissions at the Company level continued. At present, the development of the document has been completed, and it is pending approval. The Company also continued joint implementation (JI) projects focused on the recovery of associated petroleum gas at the Kharampurskoye, Khasyreiskoye, and Priobskoye fields operated by the Company. At the end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCC, emission reductions achieved by Rosneft’s JI projects were identified and the number of carbon units to be issued was determined. Overall emission reductions over the period of the projects implementations were:  at the Kharampurskoye field — some 70 thousand tonnes of CO2–eq;  at the Priobskoye field — some 2,837 thousand tonnes of CO2–eq;  at the Khasyreiskoye field — 543 thousand tonnes of CO2–eq. Thus, as a result of those projects alone, the Company was able to reduce its GHG emissions by over 3.4 mln tonnes of CO2–equivalent.

In 2013, it is planned to expand Rosneft’s candidate pool, update its composition, and build a pool of candidates for all positions essential to the functioning of the Company’s subsidiaries. Furthermore, it is planned to make significant efforts towards the integration of TNK–BP assets and making effective use of its human resource potential. The integration will be based on a mixed model — a part of TNK–BP’s executives will join Rosneft corporate headquarters. Working with the youth. Since 2005, the Company has maintained its continuous education system “School — University — Company” to ensure the inflow of highly educated, talented, well– trained young people with active life attitude. The first level of the system is the network of Rosneft Classes, which are active at the best schools in all strategic regions of the Company’s operation. The geography of the program has been expanding each year. In 2012, new Rosneft Classes were opened in Rostov–on–Don, the settlement of Iskateley (Komi Republic), Nefteyugansk and the settlement of Poykovsky (Khanty Mansi Autonomous Area — Yugra), and the settlement of Wrangel (Primorsky Territory). The tenth–graders newly admitted to Rosneft Classes are offered team–building workshops titled The Ladder to Success, where experienced trainers provide information about the Company and its subsidiaries, conduct vocational guidance events, and help school students make a conscious career choice, considering a possibility of their future work with the Company. In 2012, 8 team–building workshops for some 1 thousand students of Rosneft Classes from 18 Russian regions were carried out. Furthermore, skills upgrading workshops for principals, psychologists, and teachers of schools hosting Rosneft Classes were conducted. Rosneft continues working with talented young people when they enter universities. The Company’s objective in this area is to build an external candidate pool of best university students who have a good level of skills and knowledge, while being loyal to the Company and interested in professional growth and effective work at Rosneft. The Company has long–term partnership agreements with 27 Russian universities, 8 of them having the status of Rosneft’s strategic partners. The Company has built a system for working with students of partner universities intended to identify the best ones and motivate them for employment with Rosneft.

Young professionals are another priority target group of the Company’s HR policy. In 2012, 76 subsidiaries within the Company boundary collectively employed some 3 thousand young professionals. All newly employed young professionals receive adaptation courses designed to facilitate their adaptation, introduce them to the system of corporate values, and foster their motivation for effective work. Various business games, conferences, contests, trainings, and festivals targeting this employee group are carried out on a regular basis. The Company maintains a system of mentorship whereby each newly employed young professional is assigned an experienced mentor.

In the reporting year, Young Professionals’ Councils were established at 10 Rosneft enterprises, bringing the total number of subsidiaries having such councils to 56. The development of methodological guidelines for Young Professionals’ Councils started in the reporting period. Seeking to foster scientific and engineering creativity of young professionals and facilitate their engagement into corporate innovation processes, the Company has carried out science and technology conferences on an annual basis. In 2012, it held the 7th Inter–Regional Science and Technology Conference (IRSTC) of young professionals with over 200 participants representing more than 50 Rosneft subsidiaries. As a result of the IRSTC, 68 participants from 29 enterprises were selected as winners; over 50 best works were recommended for practical implementation. Overall, 1,400 young professionals from 73 subsidiaries took part in science and technology conferences at various levels. The Company’s young professionals has traditionally participated in the TEC Contest by the Russian Ministry of Energy — an annual competition of science and technology projects for the fuel and energy sector by young employees. Rosneft maintains a conducive environment for career growth and professional development of its young employees. In 2012, in order to identify prospective young leaders, five business games with specific focus on employee assessment were carried out at three corporate sites based in Moscow, Nefteyugansk, and Otradny. As a result of the games, 82 young professionals with a high level of corporate competencies (effective communication, team leadership, systems thinking) and leadership qualities were selected. They received training according to the program Personal Effectiveness of a Manager focused on the development of corporate competencies and building motivation for the further improvement of leadership and management skills. After the assessment procedures and training, most of those selected were recommended for the inclusion in candidate pools for management positions at the respective subsidiaries. In the reporting year, winners and nominees of the 6th Inter–Regional Science and Technology Conference held in 2011 were offered work placements at relevant units of the Company’s headquarters. Based on their performance during work placements, some of them were transferred to the corporate headquarters, promoted, or included in the corporate training program to facilitate their further professional development.

The Company implements a system of measures aimed at ensuring decent working conditions, including amenities and services available to employees in the workplace. In 2012, the Company provided catering and cleaning services, as well a set of other services at its facilities in the production and refining sectors, and in shift camps. Rosneft subsidiaries implement a number of projects for the overhaul, modernization, and construction of workplace amenities and service facilities, including projects initiated based on the results of internal inspections at the Company’s enterprises. Some 16 thousand persons of the Company’s employees work on a rotational basis, living in 65 camps during their shifts. Therefore, providing access to adequate amenities, healthcare and other services for persons staying in those camps is an important aspect of the Company’s activities for ensuring decent working conditions. Supporting employee health. The Company implements an integrated program for supporting and protecting employee health. The program is intended to provide employees with timely and quality health services; build corporate health improvement, health resort treatment, and convalescence care systems; and facilitate actions for disease prevention and promotion of healthy lifestyle among employees and their family members.

In 2012, some 500 families obtained housing within the framework of the program, the Company’s associated expenditures being about RUB 700 mln. In February 2012, the Russian Regional Development Bank launched a new mortgage project specifically targeting employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The project provides access to mortgage loans for employees who previously were not eligible for socially–oriented mortgage schemes. Home loans under the new project are available to virtually any employee of the Company who is a citizen of the Russian Federation 21 years old or older but under the statutory pension age, has a proof of permanent income, and has a total work experience of at least two years, including at least one year in the current job. Standardization of benefits available to employees. In 2012, the Company continued to follow its policy of partnership with labor unions active at its operations. As a result of joint efforts, new collective agreements based on company–wide guidelines were concluded at most subsidiary companies. The process of revising collective agreements is focused on strengthening social security of employees and improving their standard of living. The priority aspects of the model collective agreement recommended to the Company’s subsidiaries include:  assistance to employees’ families with many children and low–income families;  support of pensioners;  a ttraction and retention of employees in the regions of operation with severe climate and in jobs with hazardous working conditions;  assistance to employees in a difficult life situation. The scope and size of social benefits provided by the Company are above statutory requirements and determined taking into account regional circumstances, the subsidiary’s priorities, and the nature of the specific job. Corporate pension program and care for veterans. The corporate pension program offers employees an extended set of options for building up their pension savings using their own funds. These options include personal pension plans and participation in the government pension co–financing program. C o m pa n y P e r f o rm a n c e 59 At the beginning of 2012, a revised version of the corporate standard for occupational pension programs was approved. In 2012, a total of RUB 3.36 bn was transferred to the “Neftegarant” Non–State Pension Fund under the corporate pension program, including RUB 0.41 bn transferred under a project for strengthening social security of the Company’s veterans. As part of that project, in 2012, over 13 thousand veterans of Rosneft subsidiaries who had received payments within the framework of the respective collective bargaining agreements started receiving payments through the “Neftegarant” fund. As a result of that reform, the size of the monthly occupational pension paid to veterans increased on average by 40%. Furthermore, the Company subsidiaries collectively spent RUB 180 mln on subsidized health resort treatment of their veterans and various forms of allowances associated with holidays and special family circumstances.

RN–Severnaya Neft uses APG in three ways — as a fuel for oil preheaters and boilers, for the heating of administrative, utility, and living premises, and for in–house power generation using gas–fueled reciprocating and diesel units. The subsidiary was one of the first companies in the region to use gas–fueled reciprocating engines for power generation. At present, it runs five such units with a total capacity of 3.8 MW at the Sandiveyskoye field. Since their commissioning, the units produced 146 mln kWh of power, using 42.3 mscm of APG and thus saving 30 thousand tonnes of diesel fuel. At the Khasyreiskoye field, the company runs a gas turbine power plant, which supplies electricity for all oil fields of the Val Gamburtseva group. After the commissioning of extra generating capacities, the plant will be able to also supply “northern” fields, which are currently at an early development stage. At present, Severnaya Neft meets some 70% of the overall power demand of its oil fields using associated petroleum gas. Since 2010, Severnaya Neft has been retrofitting diesel power plants at a number of its “southern” fields with dual fuel engines capable of using both APG and diesel fuels. In 2012, the subsidiary was implementing a project for the construction of two gas–fueled diesel units and three APG–fueled reciprocating generators at the Srednemakarikhinskoye field.

At these stages, fields they typically show a rapid decline in base production and a at Udmurtneft significant increase in water cut. This brings to the forefront the objective of the identification and adoption of new technologies capable of increasing the output and reducing operating costs. As part of its innovation–related activities, in 2012 Udmurtneft tested 17 new technologies (3 of them within the framework of Rosneft’s New Technology System and 14 — within the framework of pilot testing programs). In 2012, the key projects implemented within the framework of the New Technology System were focused on further development of multi–zone well completion — a technology allowing to keep a low–yield well in operation by means of tapping into additional reservoirs. This helps reduce operating costs and enhance profitability of the production. Udmurtneft was the first Rosneft subsidiary to start developing this technology. Ten technologies of those tested in 2012 were approved and recommended for commercial use. The additional oil production achieved due to the introduction of new technologies is estimated at some 3.2 thousand tonnes. Prospective areas for the further introduction of new technologies by Udmurtneft include:  well drilling;  more efficient oil production equipment;  enhancement of well yields, identification of new types of well workover activities;  measures to maintain reservoir pressure;  squeeze cementing to prevent water and gas from leaking into the well. In 2013, Udmurtneft plans to test 17 new technologies at a planned cost of RUB 80.7 mln. Young professionals of the subsidiary play an important role in its innovation–related activities. At the the 7th Inter–Regional Science and Technology Conference of Rosneft’s young professionals, they won in seven categories and placed second in another two. Due to its continued efforts for the introduction of innovative technologies, Udmurtneft has been able to maintain a growth in its oil output over the last few years. 82 R o s n e f t S u s ta i n a b i l i t y R e p o r t 2 012 Samareneftegaz won an The competition was carried out within the framework of the targeted program Energy award in the category Conservation and Efficiency Improvement in Samara Region approved by the regional Best Energy–Conserving government; it was supported by the regional energy conservation agency.

For example, one of the key objectives of the cooperation agreement with Primorsky Territory is ensuring secure and reliable supply of petroleum products to regional customers achieved, among other means, through the construction of facilities for manufacturing and distribution of petroleum products and the development of infrastructure for their transshipment and storage. Among specific projects, the agreement provides for the construction of a combined heat and power plant at the industrial site of the Eastern Petrochemical Company. It is expected that the plant will supply electricity and heat not only for the company, but also for Nakhodka Municipal District and other communities located close to the site. The cooperation agreement with Sakhalin Region pays special attention to environmental projects within the region. In partnership with the regional government, Rosneft will continue implementing a system of measures to protect the environment and improve its state, modernize and enhance the engineering infrastructure preventing spills of oil and petroleum products. The agreement also covers such areas as support of social development, job creation, and sports.

To address the complaints, on the initiative of Igor Sechin, Rosneft President, the Company sent an extended commission headed by Igor Pavlov, Vice President of Rosneft, to the site. The commission comprised heads of the Company’s relevant units, industrial safety and environmental experts, specialists from R&D institutions, as well as representatives of licensor organizations, equipment manufacturers and contractors. The commission was given broad discretion in handling the situation, being authorized even to suspend the operation of the unit in case of its non–compliance with environmental standards. The commission conducted an inspection of the delayed coking unit and carried out additional measurements of the refinery’s emissions. No violations of air quality standards were found. T h e C o m pa n y ’ s Ac t i v i t i e s i n i t s R e g i o n s o f O p e r at i o n 93 A major modernization project is going on at the Komsomolsk refinery The commission also reviewed the progress of implementing the decision regarding the accelerated commissioning of a liquefied hydrocarbon gases storage — a necessary pre– requisite for the complete processing of those gases. The storage was commissioned in 2012. Furthermore, to prevent hydrocarbon emissions into air, in 2012 the refinery replaced two obsolete open–type oil separators installed in 1979 with two new closed separators meeting modern environmental requirements. The refinery also converted its labyrinth water treatment system into an enclosed one. The operation of the open system led to evaporation of odorous sulphur compounds, which, in turn, affected the level of smell both at the industrial site and in residential areas. The enclosing of the system helped reduce the smell substantially. At present, the refinery is taking steps to make its flaring systems capable of smokeless operation. The respective actions have been included in the action plan for 2013; necessary design documentation is being prepared; tendering procedures have been initiated. It is planned to purchase additional equipment for the refinery’s laboratory in order to make it capable of measuring the content of an extended range of air pollutants (up to 27 substances). Until the laboratory is fully equipped with necessary reagents, materials, and equipment, all necessary air quality parameters are measured by an independent laboratory contracted by the refinery. To keep residents of Komsomolsk–on–Amur adequately informed of the quality of the environment, the Company allocated RUB 14 mln for the purchase of extra monitoring equipment that will make it possible to monitor 56 air quality indicators, including mercaptan concentration. Furthermore, real–time data from four automatic air quality monitoring stations will be transmitted to the city’s civil defense and emergency response control center. The Komsomolsk Refinery follows the policy of transparency with regard to its environmental impacts, actively engages with regional and city authorities, mass media, and the general public, cooperates with members of the regional Civic Chamber. 94 R o s n e f t S u s ta i n a b i l i t y R e p o r t 2 012 RN– RN–Nakhodkanefteprodukt, like other Rosneft subsidiaries operating hazardous industrial Nakhodkanefteprodukt facilities, has the status of a strategically important enterprise. The fact that the subsidiary’s initiated an interagency business involves the handling and storage of large amounts of flammable petroleum products makes its potentially vulnerable to terrorist attacks and sabotage. Therefore, the conference on the development and implementation of a system of effective prevention measures is a strategic antiterrorist and priority to RN–Nakhodkanefteprodukt. countersabotage protection of its In 2012, the subsidiary initiated an interagency conference on the antiterrorist and transportation facilities countersabotage protection of its transportation facilities, inviting heads of respective regional departments and representatives of law enforcement and defense agencies. The conference adopted a joint action plan for the enterprise and government agencies, a scheme of coordination and specific actions in response to a terrorist threat. Additional surveillance procedures were introduced; the guarding and inspection of tank cars was organized; a schedule of countersabotage exercises was developed. In 2012, RN– The recognition of the subsidiary’s achievements in the field of social partnership was a result Sakhalinmorneftegaz of the systematic implementation of its strategic initiatives aimed at supporting education, became a winner in the sports, healthcare, environmental protection, and indigenous communities within its area of operation. category High Social Effectiveness Organization The subsidiary provides support to local Rosneft Classes and partners with a number of of the annual competition universities, including the Sakhalin State University, Ufa State Technical University, and Tomsk Charity Provider Polytechnic University. In 2012, it financed vocational guidance activities, learning equipment of the Year and materials for schools, workshops for students, instructors, and principals of educational institutions, and prizes to winners of regional academic contests. Young employees of the subsidiary took active part in the environmental campaign Clean Springs, which involved a waste removal action at a mineral spring site in the settlement of Goryachiye Klyuchi (Nogliki District of Sakhalin Region). Such actions have been conducted in the district for four years already. In 2012, the action was initiated by local environmental activists and supported by young employees of RN–Sakhalinmorneftegaz. The company helped children’s homes of Northern Sakhalin to organize decent New Year festivals for the children; it provided financial aid to veteran associations and other NGOs of Okha and Nogliki. Supporting sports has been a traditional priority of charity activities of RN–Sakhalinmorneftegaz. In 2012, it donated over RUB 500 thousand to the Okha Olympic Reserve School. Operating in the areas where indigenous communities have traditionally lived, the subsidiary pays special attention to their needs. In the reporting year, the subsidiary sponsored the 5th Ethnic Sports Championship of Sakhalin Region among children from indigenous communities, which was conducted in the settlement of Nekrasovka (Okha District, Sakhalin Region). Some RUB 500 thousand was spent on the preparation of an ethnic sports school for the opening; another RUB 300 thousand was provided to finance participation of winners of the Sakhalin Region Championship in the Summer Ethnic Sports Championship of Khabarovsk Territory.

The subsidiary actively engages with universities to meet its significant workforce demand: at the first stage alone, the new enterprise will have to recruit almost 1,700 persons. Petrochemical industry and refining are new to Primorsky Territory, and the necessary skill sets are scarce in the region. At the company’s request, the Far Eastern Federal University has already introduced new training programs. The specialties demanded by the Eastern Petrochemical Company include “Chemical technology of natural energy resources and hydrocarbon materials”, “Essential processes and IT in the chemical industry”, “Environmental protection and efficient natural resource management” etc. The subsidiary provides work placements for university students. Currently the enterprise is at an early stage of its development, and this is the best time for a young person to join the company. Newly employed young persons receive much attention — they are assigned experienced mentors, offered internships and skills upgrading courses with relevant companies in Russia and abroad.
