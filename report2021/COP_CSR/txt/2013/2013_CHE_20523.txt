Plan-les-Ouates, 17 January 2013 Dear Stakeholders, We are pleased to confirm that LEM supports the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact. This commitment to follow the Ten Principles related to Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption is embedded in all our actions, from our strategy to our day-to-day activities. As for Principles related to Human Rights, Labour and Anti-Corruption, LEM reviewed the staff handbooks of our main sites, thus strengthening the messages already emphasized in our Code of Ethics. Furthermore, I personally reaffirmed our zero tolerance to non-respect of Human Rights and Labour equality. Finally, we increased our assurance that our suppliers adhere to the Ten Principles. We monitor this strict application through regular ISO 9001 audits, health and safety audits, internal audits, or finally through a frequent employee survey (which we conducted anonymously on 75% of our employees). As far as Environment is concerned, LEM is at the heart of renewable activities and sustainable development: indeed, we develop and manufacture components in order to measure and reduce energy consumption in customer applications, whether electrical motors, hybrid vehicles or environmentallyfriendly technologies (such as windmills and solar). The ecodesign is also fully integrated in our conception, with raw materials with minimum environmental impact, lower consumption and stronger recyclability (see website). As proof of our philosophy, all our production sites are ISO 14001 certified. Finally, all these four areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and AntiCorruption are key in our recently enhanced Risk Management and our internal controls.
