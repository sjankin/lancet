Analysis Our global NPS is up 6 points from 49 in 2011 to 55 in 2012. NPS gauges customer support for the Consumer Banking products and services we provide. We ask our customers ‘How likely are you to recommend Standard Chartered to a friend or colleague?’ and apply a 10-point-scale where one is not likely at all and 10 is most likely. We then derive the NPS by subtracting the percentage of detractors (those who score one to five) from the percentage of promoters (those who score eight to 10). It operates on a scale from -100 (all detractors) to +100 (all promoters). 1 ‘Net Promoter Score’ and ‘NPS’ are trademarks of Satmetrix Systems Inc., Bain & Company, and Fred Reichheld.
