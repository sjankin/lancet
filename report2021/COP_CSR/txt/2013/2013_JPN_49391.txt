During fiscal 2012, the year ended March 31, 2013, Daibiru began construction of the New Shin Daibiru Building (provisional name) in August 2012, and construction of the Daibiru-Honkan Building was completed in February 2013 as initially scheduled. In the market for nursing homes for the elderly in Japan, we acquired Granda Shakujii-Koen, our second property following the acquisition of Clara Saginuma in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 was the final year of the “Daibiru-3D” Project Phase-II, the mediumTakehiko Yamamoto term management plan formulated in May President Executive Officer 2010, and in October 2013 Daibiru will celebrate its 90th anniversary. Based on Company’s performance versus the targets laid out in the medium-term management plan, and given the fact that Daibiru views the coming 10 years until its 100th anniversary as a period of preparation to design the path for the next 100 years, we have formulated the next medium-term management plan “Design 100” Phase-I, which will span the 5 years from April 2013 through March 2018. As a pioneer in the office leasing industry, and based on the expertise we have built up over the years, we will create a path for a new 100 years through steady conviction and advances onto the global stage. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 02 DAIBIRU CORPORATION Question 1 Please discuss the financial results for fiscal 2012. Answer 1 In fiscal 2012, the Japanese economy saw firm public-sector investment and in the fiscal second half there was a correction to the yen’s appreciation and a pickup in stock prices. However, exports struggled due to slowdowns in overseas economies. Consequently, the Japanese economy moved sideways. In the office building industry, vacancy rates remained high in our main business areas, the business districts of Tokyo and Osaka. As of March 31, 2012, the average vacancy rate was 9.04% in the Tokyo area and 10.27% in the Osaka area, while as of March 31, 2013, the average vacancy rate was 8.56% in the Tokyo area and 11.25% in the Osaka area. Consequently, rent levels continued to be soft. Amid this environment, the Daibiru Group carried out proactive marketing activities, while remodeling the Awajimachi Daibiru Building. Also, in order to further improve our high-quality building management services and further boost our competitiveness, we worked to make additional improvements to tenant services, including having building management staff and sales work together to improve the quality of services at each building. These efforts enabled the Company to maintain high overall occupancy rates. The Daibiru-Honkan Building (Kita-ku, Osaka, 22 stories above ground, 2 below, total floor area: 48,198 m2) was completed as initially planned in February 2013 and its operations have gotten off to a smooth start. Also, we have entered the property leasing market for nursing homes for the elderly in Japan as a part of the growth strategy laid out in the medium-term management plan “Daibiru-3D” Project Phase-II. In August 2012 we acquired nursing home property Granda Shakujii-Koen (Nerima-ku, Tokyo, 3 stories above ground, total floor area: 2,319 m2), which marks the second acquisition in this field following the earlier acquisition of Clara Saginuma.

As another large rebuilding project, in August 2012 construction work began on the New Shin Daibiru Building (provisional name). We have been constantly talking with numerous major tenant candidates, targeting a high occupancy rate from the time the construction is completed and the building is opened. Moreover, in June 2012 we launched a Brand Strategy Promotion Committee, which is working to increase recognition of the Daibiru Brand, especially in the Tokyo metropolitan area. As a result of the above, we posted consolidated revenue from operations of ¥34,206 million, up ¥535 million, or 1.6%, year on year. Operating income declined by ¥334 million, or 3.3%, to ¥9,828 million. Income before income taxes was ¥8,107 million, a year-on-year increase of ¥222 million, or 2.8%. Net income climbed ¥140 million, or 2.9%, to ¥4,880 million. Question 2 What were the main stories behind the operating results in fiscal 2012? Answer 2 1. The New Shin Daibiru Building (provisional name) Construction began in August 2012 and is slated for completion in March 2015. The New Shin Daibiru Building will have 31 stories above ground, 2 stories below ground, and be 148 meters high with approximately 76,000 m2 in total floor area. The first and second floors will be a bustling commercial space, while rental meeting rooms and a cafeteria will be located on the fourth floor. The fifth through thirty-first floors will be office space. In terms of business continuity planning, the building will employ a vibration control structure to give it strong earthquake resistance. It will also be equipped with an emergency power generator capable of providing power for 72 hours in case of a power outage, allowing power to be supplied to main functions such as disaster prevention equipment, lights and restrooms, as well as electricity to some of the leased space. In consideration of the environment, the building will feature a 3,300 m2 green area called Dojima no Mori on the premises, helping to create a rich cityscape. 2. The Daibiru-Honkan Building Construction of the Daibiru-Honkan Building began in October 2010 and was completed in February 2013. The Daibiru-Honkan Building has 22 stories above ground, 2 stories below ground, and is 108 meters high with approximately 48,198 m2 in total floor area. The first and second floors are home to a bustling commercial space, while rental meeting rooms and a cafeteria will be located on the fourth floor. Floors five through twenty-two are for offices. The Daibiru-Honkan Building is designed to restore the appearance of the former Daibiru-Honkan Building built in 1925 in order to preserve this once famous historical architecture for future generations. When the former building was torn down, approximately 180,000 bricks were taken out by hand and more than 95% were reused to make up the north and west walls of the Daibiru-Honkan Building. In addition, in order to replicate the image of the former building, many of the former building’s stone carvings, which were removed one piece at a time when the building was torn down, have been reused. Inside, the design of the former building’s entrance hall was used, and original floor tiles and handrails were reused. Also, through a collaboration with Kanden Fudosan Co., Ltd., the west side of the premises will feature a green space called Nakanoshima Shikinooka. This green space will be home to a variety of trees and flowers, including plum and cherry trees. Suiting its name, this will be a place for relaxation where visitors can enjoy the nature of the four seasons. 3. Granda Shakujii-Koen One of the action plans laid out in the medium-term management plan “Daibiru-3D” Project Phase-II announced in 2010 was the penetration of growing markets. In October 2012, we acquired Granda Shakujii-Koen, with the aim of ANNUAL REPORT 2013 04 DAIBIRU CORPORATION entering the market for nursing homes for the elderly in Japan, a market where growth is expected in light of the aging of society. This property is located in a quiet residential area surrounded mainly by medium-sized detached homes, and offers excellent accessibility to the center of Tokyo. Japan’s total population began to decline in 2005, but the number of elderly people aged 65 and older is expected to rise with each passing year, creating growing societal demand for facilities catering to elderly people. Daibiru will continue to respond to this growing societal demand by acquiring and developing nursing homes for the elderly, and providing blue-chip properties to nursing care operators. Question 3 What are your initiatives going forward? Answer 3 Although the Japanese economy is showing signs of recovery based on the hopes pinned on economic policies, concerns about an overseas economic downturn triggered by the European sovereign debt crisis and other factors continue to cast a cloud of uncertainty over the economic outlook. In the office building leasing industry, we expect the environment to remain challenging, despite the increase in demand for office buildings with features such as strong earthquake resistance and emergency power sources in the wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake. The Daibiru Group will continue to maintain and further strengthen its business model based on developing and owning first-class office buildings in the prime business districts of Tokyo and Osaka, and operating them over the long term with dedicated property management resources. By so doing, we strive to achieve constant growth over the long term. Important issues in the near term include steadily attracting and negotiating with tenant candidates for the New Shin Daibiru Building (provisional name), acquiring additional properties in Vietnam in accordance with the Company’s business model, and earnestly proceeding with the acquisition and development of nursing homes for the elderly in Japan. We will also continue to work to increase the competitiveness of our buildings, such as renovating the Hibiya Daibiru Building and the Mita Nitto Daibiru Building. Question 4 What is Daibiru’s management philosophy? Answer 4 The Daibiru Group will celebrate its 90th anniversary in October 2013. In commemoration, we created a new company logo in the motif of a building we own. This logo in blue, our corporate color, and encapsulates our pride at being in the business for 90 years, as we continue to evolve as office building professionals. Over these 90 years, the Daibiru Group has built a solid track record by listening to the market and supplying office buildings that harmonize with society and cater to local needs at the time. As it was in the past, our philosophy going forward is: Constructing Buildings, Creating Towns—Pioneering a New Era. We aim to create new cityscapes and with that maximize our corporate value.
