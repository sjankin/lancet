www.sustaingroup.net Sustain Group: Statement of Social Investment Performance FY 2012-13: Appendix 1A to the UNGC COP: 9/9/13 Introduction: This is the first statement of social investment performance that the Sustain Group has issued and is for the 2012-13 financial year. In doing so we want our stakeholders to understand how serious our commitments are to the organisations we support and the social value we bring in order to help them grow and develop capability as well as capacity. In terms of calculating our social investment performance we identify the initiative and whether direct financial support and pro-bono hours have been provided. In some cases it may be a combination of both. We identify what specific expertise or support has been provided to the organisation and what baseline impact this has had in the year the support was provided. In the following 2013-14 year this will be expanded to look at both the medium and long term performance of the business in terms of social impacts via the initiatives supported. We have also gone a step further in clearly indicating whether any sales have been derived as a result of our support or direct interaction through the initiative. For example, has our involvement in a program led to a sale for a service we may offer? The next step, once all of that data has been collected, is to subtract any income directly gained or attributable to the interaction from the value of the direct and indirect financial and pro-bono support provided. In terms of calculating the hours of work undertaken we have used the following method: Role type = $ value of an hour X by the number of hours provided = $value of total hours provided X 2 (the opportunity cost: whereby time expended could have led to direct revenue gained across service lines of the business) = Total value of the invested time. It is important to the company that we subtract the value of any work won that can be attributed to our support as we believe the true social investment would otherwise be skewed and, the business is clear about transparency and managing conflicts of interest. Key facts: ≥ Number of core initiatives supported: 5 ≥ Number of subsidiary programs supported but not accounted for in this statement: 7 ≥ Number of pro-bono hours provided: 1614 ≥ Value of direct financial support provided: $41,000.00 ≥ Value of in-kind and pro-bono support provided: $1,097,260.00 This report should be read alongside our latest Communication on Progress that has been submitted to the th United Nations Global Compact on the 9 of September 2013. As Chief Executive Officer of Sustain I am very proud of the work my people undertake. We do things because we believe in them and while on some occasions that may result in a monetary return to the business the fact is we are more interested in giving what we can than in receiving. As the owner of Sustain Group my passion, and the passion of my people, is to make a change and a difference in the lives of those less fortunate than we are – if this can be done through the prism of business leadership then so be it. I submit our social investment performance to our stakeholders for scrutiny.
