I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank everyone who has offered us their invaluable support, including our stakeholders, and our customers who favored us with their ongoing patronage as we relisted our stock on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and brought an end to government support in September last year. After I accepted the request from the government and the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation of Japan and set to work on rebuilding Japan Airlines, I went around the company, exhorting employees to adhere to the basic principles of corporate management, that is, a management committed to people’s minds. My hope was that JAL would not only be revived in financial terms, but would also be reborn as an outstanding airline company we could proudly present to the world for the exceptional commitment of its employees and the stability of its management. With the help of many stakeholders, the directors and employees firmly positioned the JAL Philosophy and the divisional profitability management system as the twin pillars of the company, single-mindedly pursued their aspiration to rebuild the company, and persevered in their efforts to create the new Japan Airlines. I stepped back from the frontlines of management at the end of March this year, entrusting the future of the company to its directors and employees with these parting words: “Be humble, avoid arrogance, and continue to extend efforts. Today is the fruit of your past efforts, while the future depends on the efforts you make from this point forward.” I believe they will continue to pursue outstanding management that meets stakeholder expectations by continually reminding themselves of their resolve to create the JAL of tomorrow through their efforts. At this key juncture, we sincerely seek your continued guidance and patronage of Japan Airlines in the hope of together achieving our shared goal of prosperity and well-being. Dr. Kazuo Inamori Chairman Emeritus Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. 04 JAL REPORT 2013 Highlights Messages from Management Review of Operations Each of Us Making JAL What It Is CSR Financial Section Part with the Past and Create the New JAL Japan Airlines filed a petition for proceedings under the Corporate Reorganization Act on January 19, 2010, which caused significant inconveniences and concerns to financial institutions and other creditors, former shareholders, loyal customers, business partners and the Japanese public. Moreover, we were allowed to continue our operations as we proceeded along the path to rehabilitation. Today, as we continue to advance step by step as the reborn JAL, we are entirely indebted to the understanding, cooperation and support of a great number of stakeholders, to whom I once again express my sincere gratitude. I will always remember with a sense of appreciation having been given this last chance to rebuild the company. To repay everyone for their strong support as quickly as possible, I have poured all my efforts into developing a robust financial constitution that is highly resilient to risk. This effort could also be described as a journey for creating a reborn JAL by uniting the minds of Group employees, breaking with the value system of the past, thinking and acting in line with the JAL Philosophy to realize our new corporate policy. The culminating statement of the JAL Philosophy is “Aim High.” Over the past three years since becoming president, I have visited all domestic and overseas branch offices, meeting with many frontline employees to share my thinking, often through frank discussions, and we have all confirmed our mutual commitment to create a new JAL. Although we are only halfway there, we will always be grateful to society and our customers. The directors and employees are moving forward as one to realize our corporate policy, maintaining safe operations as the foundation for our existence and delivering unparalleled service to attain our highest aspirations of becoming the new JAL, the most preferred airline by customers. I sincerely seek your patronage and hope you will continue flying with the JAL Group. Masaru Onishi Representative Director, Chairman Japan Airlines Co., Ltd.

For example, our countdown app keeps track of the time remaining before boarding, a real-time video app displays the congestion situation in security screening areas and a guide app provides directions to the boarding gate. We intend to further enhance the breadth of information and depth of our services by expanding the use of these apps for both domestic and international flights departing from Japan in addition to the flights bound for Japan. We are thoroughly committed to providing quality time to customers by fully utilizing information devices in order to deliver a rich and rewarding travel experience. Toshiya Shimizu Planning Group, Web Sales Department 02 Giving Personal Attention to Every Customer My job is to provide easy –tounderstand explanations in response to a lot of customer feedback received by phone, email and comment cards. I also take part in incorporating this feedback into proposals for the purpose of improving our products and services. Every time I respond to feedback, I remember to show compassion for our customers so that more customers will become fans of JAL. Concrete improvements that have resulted from customer feedback include drink menus on domestic flights with photos of items and redesigned domestic flight schedule that display flight numbers in distinctive colors. In the future, when I return to in-flight duty as a cabin attendant, I hope to draw upon these experiences and be even more conscientious in offering services from the customer’s perspective.

My job is to provide services with a smile to passengers who are flying on JAL’s four regular flights to and from Japan. Smoothly guiding all of our passengers is not always easy. For example, when the flight of another airline arrives late with a passenger scheduled to take a connecting JAL flight, we do not have much time to transfer their luggage. At those times I try to put myself in the customer’s position and do my very best to coordinate with the other airline right up to the time of departure, so that the passenger and luggage will be on the same flight. I hope that JAL becomes the most preferred airline in the world by consistently delivering the quality of service established in Japan to every customer.

Our goal is to turn JAL into a full-service carrier offering a higher overall level of quality and providing first-class comfort in our business class. We set out to meet this goal with unprecedented speed and enthusiasm, confident that nothing would please us more than customers experiencing “a class above the highest quality” while sitting and sleeping on our flights. We plan to similarly upgrade the interiors of our other aircraft to provide the finest in-flight experience in the world for customers on all our routes and fully demonstrate our Japanese sensitivity for function and design.

We ask passengers to cooperate by closing the shades before deplaning, since the longer the shades are shut the more effective* the exercise will be. As an operator of public transport used by many people, the JAL Group believes it has an important role to play in conducting green activities with the cooperation of passengers. * At Haneda Airport, we can reduce the CO2 emissions of a Boeing 777 aircraft by more than 1,000 kilograms by switching from air conditioning requiring an energy-consuming APU (auxiliary power unit) to ground-based power units for 10 minutes.

Having generated such deep concern among so many of our stakeholders by our bankruptcy, we were given a last chance to revive the company. Taking that as our starting point, we are moving along the path toward a reborn JAL with the support of so many people, including customers who have continued to take our flights, those who have provided financial support, and Chairman Emeritus Inamori, who guided us sternly yet kindly with an altruistic spirit. As you have pointed out, all of us at JAL share this starting point and believe we should never forget our sense of gratitude to our stakeholders and the relentless efforts we have made over the past three years. We are resolved to firmly maintain the integrity of our management by continuing to learn and practice the JAL Philosophy and by appropriately implementing the divisional profitability management system. We intend to continue building on our efforts to Hiroyuki Hioka contribute to society in various ways through our core business of air transport and become a company that is loved Executive Officer, and needed by everyone.

Since the change of administration in Japan in December 2012, exports have continued to slowly decline, while capital investments and production resurged. Corporate earnings and employment have been showing signs of improvement. Aviation demand in this period was generally robust despite temporarily stagnating due to territorial issues. Other factors, however, including the entry of Japanese low-cost carriers (LCCs) into the market, boosted supply. In addition to rising fuel prices, the Japanese yen weakened, triggering a rise in fuel costs. As a result, the JAL Group finds itself in a tough operating environment. The State of the JAL Group Under these circumstances, the JAL Group did its utmost to provide customers with unparalleled service with a focus on maintaining safe operations, and heightened the profit consciousness of employees under the practice of JAL Philosophy and a divisional profitability management system (the Amoeba Management System) that promoted autonomous management. These measures are intended to further improve management efficiency and ultimately achieve the management targets set out in the Mid-Term Management Plan announced on February 15, 2012.

Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the financial statement audit is not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries as at March 31, 2013 and 2012, and their financial performance and cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan. Convenience Translation The U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year ended March 31, 2013 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
