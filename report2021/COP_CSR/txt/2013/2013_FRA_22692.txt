Forewords Quality, Ethic and the respect of the Environment are among the fundamental values of Sagemcom. In particular, we recognize the important role that an organisation like ours can have on sustainable development approach. One of the key challenges of sustainable development is that it demands new and innovative choices and ways of thinking. While developments in knowledge and technology are contributing to economic development, they also have the potential to help resolve the risks and threats to the sustainability of our social relations, environment, and economies. As a leader in the field of telecommunication equipments, we are engaged in the development of products embedding solutions to decrease their environmental impact, while conserving their functionalities, in the respect of the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. To do so, we act on the entire lifecycle of our products and activities, from cradle to grave. Beyond respecting regulations, Production, R&D and marketing centres mitigate their environmental impact through an ISO 14001 Management System. Significant environmental aspects are strictly controlled & reduced, as much as possible. But managing our centres is not enough. As shown by life cycle analysis, the use phase is the main impact of our products. Thus, the Energy consumption must be managed and reduced, by applying the principles of Eco design. The other phases are also taken into account during development of products. In parallel, we act for the respect of human rights and protection of our employees. The safety and the health of our workers are at the centre of our considerations as demonstrated by our health & safety policy applied in accordance with international standard OHSAS 18001. Sagemcom works in compliance with the ILO code of conduct, and ensures the commitment of its suppliers by their signing of the Sagemcom ethical charter and third party audits. 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group All of these actions, presented in this document, reflect the commitment of Sagemcom to Sustainable Development and result in significant savings, marketing differentiation and better confidence of our customers.

The Global Compact approach The United Nations Global Compact is a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to align their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. By doing so, business, as a primary driver of globalization, can help ensure that markets, commerce, technology and finance advance in ways that benefit economies and societies everywhere. As a signatory of the UN Global compact, Sagemcom SAS is committed to the respect and the promotion of its principles within its area of influence. 1 Support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Human Rights 2 Make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses Uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to 3 collective bargaining 4 Uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Labour 5 Uphold the effective abolition of child labour Uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and 6 occupation 7 Support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group Environment 8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly 9 technologies Anti10 Work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery Corruption Sagemcom SAS invites its Suppliers and subcontractors to adopt, support and apply, in their area of concern, all the fundamental values here above. Communications on progress will be posted regularly on the United Nations website. 9 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 10 3. Ethical approach The company’s goals are founded on values shared by all personnel. It is corporate policy to ensure that the conduct of business complies with high standards of honesty, integrity and professional excellence. By upholding these values the company will remain worthy of the trust placed in it by its customers, personnel, shareholders, suppliers and all of its partners. The rules outlined in the following pages are not intended to take the place of, or to revise the laws and regulations in force, but rather to provide points of reference and guidance for the conduct of professional duties. These ethical guidelines set forth the principles and standards common to the company as a whole, so that everyone in the company may refer to them under all circumstances. 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 11 3.1. Behaviour outside the company 3.1.1. Upholding the law In all the countries in which the company operates, its personnel must uphold the laws in force. It may sometimes be difficult to understand the law in a legal and cultural environment which is very different from the context in which people have previously worked. In case of doubt, employees should immediately consult a superior or the legal department. Personnel working in a subsidiary jointly owned by the company and a foreign company must uphold the law of the country in which the subsidiary is based, of the countries in which it is operating and of the country (or countries) in which its shareholders are based. The company applies international conventions on fighting the corruption of public officials. The use of business consultants or agents offers an effective means to develop company’s business, thanks to the skills they contribute to. The fees stipulated in their contract must always correspond to the actual service rendered and payment must comply with the relevant laws. All personnel must take particular care to uphold laws on competition, the final destination of products after sale, labour and employment, safety, health and environmental protection. 3.1.2. Behaviour towards customers Each employee must uphold the principles of fairness and integrity in their dealings with customers. No compromise on standards, for whatsoever reason, can be tolerated. Any situation that may seem questionable to an employee must immediately be referred to a superior or the Quality 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group manager. 3.1.3. Relations with suppliers The company chooses suppliers on the basis of objective criteria in the sole interest of the Company. The company demands high performance and excellence from its suppliers in order to fully meet the expectations of its customers. Under no circumstance will the company use suppliers involved in child or forced labour. 3.1.4. Integrity Company employees may under no circumstance damage its reputation, the integrity of its assets and its information systems. 12 Paid work of any type that personnel may have outside their job must not cause conflicts of interest with their duties inside the company. Similarly, considerable caution is required with regard to the purchase of shares, directly or via an intermediary, in companies doing business with the company. Such restrictions do not apply to listed companies, unless confidential information is used which may be construed as insider trading. Under no circumstance may company employees accept gifts or benefits, unless of a symbolic nature, from suppliers. Similarly, no one may propose or award such gifts or benefits with a view to obtain a contract. No one should display the slightest indulgence with respect to active or passive corruption. 3.1.5. Sustainable Development Today, more than ever, preserving the environment is an essential concern for all company employees, starting with product design and running through the whole industrial process. 3.1.6. Political activity The company does not fund any political party whatsoever. Any political activities in which personnel may be involved must remain exclusively outside the workplace and the working hours. 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 13 3.2. Behaviour inside the company 3.2.1. Protecting the confidential nature of certain information Everyone, in the course of their duties, has access to confidential information, which, even if partial, represents one of the company’s key assets and must not be divulged to the competition. Similarly, employees may hold information concerning National Security. It is essential to bear in mind at all times the importance of protecting such information from third parties. At the same time, everyone must make sure that the information required for the proper execution of work circulates normally inside or outside the company and that it is always accurate. 3.2.2. Respect for other people The safety and health of other people are prime objectives of all employees. As a matter of principle the company guarantees equal opportunity for all its employees. Recruitment and promotion are based exclusively on professional qualities, without any form of discrimination. The company undertakes to respect the dignity and private life of each of its employees. Furthermore one of the company’s key practices is to create the necessary conditions for everyone to achieve fulfilment in their professional life. Hierarchical authority may not be used for any other purpose than ensuring the proper running of 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group the company. It must be exercised with restraint and discernment, and must not lead to any form of abuse or harassment. 3.2.3. Compliance to ethical guidelines The company brings the contents of these ethical guidelines to the attention of each employee, requiring his or her compliance. In general, in the event of doubt about the appropriate conduct, it is up to each employee to immediately consult a superior or the company’s Legal Department. 14 3.3. Ethical Approach with suppliers Sagemcom Suppliers Ethical Approach is part of a long term improvement plan. It is one of the 5 fundamental keys of Sagemcom Purchasing Policy. 3.3.1. A little of history 2012: 456 signatories & 2007: first 69 audits ethical audits performed end of 2006: internal trainings gathering of suppliers engagement july 2006: first Sagemcom ethic charter The aim of our ethic approach is to check Action is taken within the company to that our suppliers comply with fundamental promote this approach. Internal awareness ethic values. sessions are planned throughout the year, 4 major Principles based on : International as well as training sessions for “ethical” law IOL, Universal Declaration of Human auditors. Rights and United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In view of promoting and extending its ethical approach, Sagemcom requires its 1. Human Rights suppliers to make commitments: • Child labor • by adhering to its ethical charter (in 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group • Force labor annex 5) • Discrimination • by filling out the Sagemcom self• Freedom of association & Right to assessment questionnaire collective bargaining • by accepting to be audited on the 2. Working rules correct application of the ethical • Health and safety approach of Sagemcom • Working hours • Payment/Remuneration As of today, 456 ethical charters have been • Disciplinary practices signed among our supply chain. • Accommodation • Individual conduct (bribery & corruption) 3. Environment respect 4. Bribery and corruption 15 3.3.1. Suppliers evaluation and validation Each new supplier must be associated to this approach: before placing an order to a new supplier, they have to sign the ethic Charter (or provide is own Charter which is in accordance with Sagemcom one) and to fill out our auto-evaluation questionnaire. Each year, Sagemcom is planning ethical audits in order to check the respect of the ethical rules, in addition to the follow-up audits. The suppliers’ selection, to be audited, is done by the Ethical committee (purchasing, quality & environmental departments), according to the profile of the supplier (Activity, Manual process, uses of chemical or toxic substance ...). All the actions are coordinated by the Sagemcom Suppliers Quality Manager with the ethical audits third party. Once the audit is realised, the service provider send an audit report. In the case where non conformities have been identified: If the non-conformities are prohibitive (under-aged labour, all forms of obligatory or forced labour and all kind of labour, which, by its nature or its conditions, presents an immediate danger or would be likely to endanger the employees' health and safety) and without quick corrective actions, Sagemcom would stop all business with the supplier. The supplier would be classified as Forbidden. For the other cases, Sagemcom will ask the supplier to implement corrective actions and if necessary a follow-up audit will be requested. Without any feedback from the supplier within 3 months, a follow-up audit will be conducted by our third party auditor. In the same way, if the corrective actions are no sufficient, a follow-up audit will be done too (decision being taken between the purchaser and the steering committee). 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 16 3.3.2. Audits Results Since 2007, 69 audits have been done. The audited suppliers are mainly strategic partners for high added value components, ODM partners, and critical components suppliers. Main issues during these audits were: Working hours Health and safety Juvenile workers1 management Payment and remuneration Environment Main non compliance detected during audits per type 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% payement and environment child labor juvenile forced labor health and Disciplinary Discrimination Freedom of Working hours other remuneration, workers safety practices association social management protection Action plans have been built with the suppliers to correct these problems, and follow-up audits have been set up. 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 1 Juvenile workers are workers above legal age that must be declared to the local administration, and must not work on physically demanding jobs. For example a juvenile worker in china is between 16 and 18 years old. 17 3.4. Health and Safety While the environmental approach (ISO 14001) attempts to reduce environmental impact inside and outside the company, the Occupational health and safety in the work place approach aims to restrict risks for people inside the company. If these two approaches have separate objectives, they will improve the global management of the company. International standard OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health & Safety Assessment Series) makes it possible to evaluate and certify the health and safety management system. The fundamental concept behind OHSAS 18001 is based on continuous improvements of risk control in the field of health and safety in the work place and does not establish requirements in terms of performance levels. In view of the above, this standard is compatible with ISO14001 and ISO9001. This standard allows for: the establishment of a health and safety management system to eliminate or at least reduce the risks faced by personnel and other individuals involved and likely to be exposed to the risks relating to the activities of the organization; the continuous implementation, updating and improvement of the system; guaranteed compliance with its policy; the demonstration of compliance. Risk analysis is the focal point of the system. This particularly involves the: systematic identification of the dangerous substances or preparations present in the establishment; evaluation of the dangers inherent to the listed substances and preparations; 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group evaluation of the installations, particularly those in which the listed dangerous substances and preparations are used; systematic identification of dangers and the analysis of the phenomena relating to operating conditions. We implement the occupational health & safety in the work place approach on various industrial sites on the basis of OHSAS 18001. Our production site in Tunisia is certified (see annex 4). 18 3.5. Handicaps Insertion of disabled workers is part of Sagemcom values and contributes to its ethical commitment and its approach regarding sustainable development. Sagemcom, aware that the disabled workers' employment represents a major stake of the company responsibilities, has developed the insertion of disabled workers for several years around 3 major steps: Increase hire and facilitate their integration, Accompany the disabled employees all along their professional life among the company, Promote external employment for disabled people. Beyond the legal framework and the strict legal obligations, Sagemcom ensures a quality of working environment for disabled employees. The layout of workstations is therefore at the heart of a global thinking, integrating a social and human dimension and requiring genuine involvement of the company. 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 19 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 20 4. Environmental approach Managing our environmental impact is of the utmost importance. All our activities are watched over by environmental coordinators, in order to control and reduce our daily consumptions & wastes. Sagemcom approach is based on the life cycle of the products through a certified Quality and environment management system. 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 21 4.1. Environmental Management The ISO 14001 standard prescribes the requirements for an environmental management system allowing organizations to formulate policies and objectives in view of regulatory requirements and information relating to significant environmental impact. It describes such management system and allows us to: Reduce the environmental impacts of our premises (marketing, R&D, production) Design products with less impacts on resources (raw materials, rare earth elements …), Energy Depletion (in manufacturing and use phase) and end of life (easier disassembly, recycling …) As required, the system is audited by a third party auditor each year. These audits ensure the efficiency of the system and its continuous improvement. Sagemcom, in accordance with national laws and regulations, especially those relating to classified installations, controls environmental aspects such as: soil, water & air pollution sound pollution waste production consumption of water, etc. controlling dangerous substances These provisions are implemented in our centres by environmental officers, under the responsibility of the respective Site Directors, according to continuous improvement processes. Certified sites (certificate in annex 2): Rueil-Malmaison (Headquarter) Osny (France R&D center) Vienna (Austria R&D center) 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group Ben Arous (Tunisian manufacturing center) Megrine (Tunisian R&D) 22 4.2. Green House gases emissions We made the choice of realizing a GHG report as requested by the French law Grenelle, even if we are not in its scope of duty. Information presented hereafter concern our activities in France, and related GHG emissions in 2011 (baseline). It confirms our position and understanding in the field of ecodesign, and will lead us in the establishment of our environmental policy. 2012 evaluation will be performed by mid-2013. 4.2.1. Scope Activities of Sagemcom group in France are grouped in two sites nearby Paris. Both are ISO 14001 certified. Rueil-Malmaison (92) This site holds four companies of the group : Sagemcom Holding Sagemcom SAS Sagemcom Broadband SAS Sagemcom Energy & Telecom SAS Each entity (except the holding) includes the Marketing and the Research and development services. There is no industrial production. Buildings are used for office activity. 874 employees are gathered on this site (end of 2011). It is identified as an installation to be management for environmental Protection (ICPE). 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group Osny (95) This location holds Sagemcom Documents SAS, including Marketing and research and development services.

Key figures and objectives Baseline: year 2011. 2010 figures are only informative. Sagemcom Vehicles (rented) Data type: extrapolated data The impact calculation is based on rent contracts upon the concerned year (2011). Impact data origin : manufacturers data Average impact in 2010 : 121.5 g eqCO2 / km Average impact in 2011 : 117.2 g eqCO2 / km Action: To continue the evolution of rented cars to less CO2 emitting models Average impact objective for 2012 : 116.4 g eqCO2 / km Gaz consumption (Heat) Data type: primary data Impact data origin : Base Carbone (« Gaz naturel, amont et combustion ») Impact in 2010 : 776.7 tonnes eqCO2 impact in 2011 : 631.8 tonnes eqCO2 (-18.6%) Actions: Decreasing heat automatically by night Centralisation of temperature management Objective for 2012: -10% Note: this objective is dependent upon temperatures in 2012 as gas consumption only aim is heating system. Electricity consumption 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group Data type: primary data The impact calculation is based on real figures of on-site meters Impact data origin : Base Carbone (« électricité, usage : industriel base ») Impact in 2010 : 301.6 tonnes eqCO2 Impact in 2011: 295.2 tonnes eqCO2 (-2%) Note: Very few variation of the indicator in absolute value. However, the consumption per employee has decreased by approximately 10%. Actions: Reinforce purchasing criteria of Energy using products with stronger energy criteria To study alternative for infrastructures management (75% of the consumption) Objective by 2014: -10% in absolute value. Note: The global electricity consumption is stable in 2011 compared to 2010 (-2%). Calculated per person per day, the average electricity consumption has decreased by 10,2%. 26 4.3. Ecodesign 4.3.1. Principles In addition to controlling the site approach (control of rejections, etc.), the research and development site obtained ISO 14001: 2004 certification, products oriented, for its eco design approach. Eco design accounts for the environmental impact of a product “from cradle to grave”. An ecodesigned product must be of the same quality as a standard product. No functions or performance must be sacrificed. The aim of our research teams is to reduce environmental impact, by working on all aspects of the product life cycle, and particularly raw materials and the consumption of energy during the use phase as with other stages of life cycle, including disposal. the life cycle approach 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 27 Partnerships with our customers Sagemcom wishes to move forward with its customers for all issues relating to sustainable development, to promote its ethical and environmental ideas, and to take a step beyond the simple context of the company. We work with our major order providers to create an ever-greener marketing policy, mainly for eco design. These partnerships must lead to the general distribution of information on the Ecological quality of our products. Reduction of packaging In addition to its effect on the consumption of raw vegetal substances, packaging has an effect on the environmental impact of transport. This is why we permanently attempt to optimize the weight and volume of our packaging. To give an example, changing the range of our thermal transfer faxes enabled volume to be reduced by 26% per product. This optimization, combined with improved logistic control, optimized transport, increasing pallet capacity from 64 to 120 products, i.e. requiring 47% less trucks for an equivalent quantity. Reduced energy consumption Energy consumption is a key element on all of our product lines. This aspect must be taken into account to reduce the environmental impact of electronic products to a significant degree. Accounting for energy consumption requires compliance with strict consumption criteria during the various operating modes, constant innovation (programmable / intelligent stand-by modes, etc.) and the awareness of personnel. Sagemcom has ensured that its printing products consume less energy for many years. This is why most of its products have ENERGY STAR® labels, when applicable. Functionalities 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group Innovation is a factor in improvements. This is why our teams are constantly seeking out product functions which encourage consumer eco-friendliness, or replacing these functions with product automatisms (automatic duplexing, “Toner Save” function, etc.). Significant Environmental aspects In order to set priorities, we conduct Life cycle assessment of our products. Our method consists of the analysis of existing products in qualitative (mode of assembly, etc.) and quantitative terms, by modelling the products using simplified life cycle analysis tools. Thanks to the EIME software, we obtain statistical data on environmental impact (creation of CO2, water pollution, etc.) via a multi-stage, multi-criteria process, and using a database created by the electronics industry. This enables the assessment and comparison of the impact of the products on the environment. This double qualitative / quantitative approach, avoids pollution transfers (e.g. an assembly solution which facilitates end-of-life could increase the impact of a different stage in the product life cycle). 28 The main conclusion is that the most significant environmental aspect for our products is the energy consumption during the use phase. The following examples illustrate the environmental impacts of few of our products and the results obtained with the new generations. 4.3.2. Life Cycle Analysis We perform life Cycle analysis of our products in order to identify significant environmental aspect to set priorities. These analyses take into account the whole life cycle of the product, from materials to end of life, with manufacturing, transport and use phase. Life Cycle Analysis have been realized on the main products sold in France in 2011 & 2012 thanks to the EIME software (CODDE Bureau Veritas) ; the analysis hereunder shows the importance of Eco design works compared to scope 1 and 2 in France. Products impacts are presented separately from the scope 3 for more clarity, by product category. Comparison of impact between Sagemcom emissions in 2011 (scope 1, 2 and 3 without products) and products sold the same year in France in tones eqCO2 600 000 500 000 400 000 300 000 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 200 000 100 000 0 scope 1 scope 2 scope 3 products (complete life cycle over 5 years) total scope 1 total scope 2 total scope 3 Gateways STB DECT meters MFDs 29 4.3.2.1.

Results are expressed for the following environmental impacts from EIME: Impact indicator Unit Air Acidification (AA for PEP) kg H+ eq Air toxicity (AT for PEP) m³ Energy Depletion (ED for PEP) MJ Global Warming Potential (GWP for PEP) kg CO2 eq. Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POCP for PEP) kg C2H4 eq. Raw Material Depletion (RMD for PEP) Y-1 Water Depletion (WD for PEP) dm3 Water Eutrophication (WE for PEP) kg PO4 eq. Water Toxicity (WT for PEP) m³ The ETSI TS 103 199 v1.1.1 methodology3 has been followed as much as possible. However we do not claim compliance with this standard. The following boundaries are used for our Life cycle assessments: 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group Blue: generic (secondary) data from EIME, adjusted with primary data (weight of material, surface, etc.) Green: primary data Red: estimated data Grey: out of boundaries 3 ETSI TS 103 199 v1.1.1 : Environmental Engineering (EE) ; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of ICT equipment, networks and services; General methodology and common requirements (2011-11) 30 4.3.2.2. Gateways (Sagemcom Broadband SAS) Gateways embed more and more functions as they are the central nod of the digital home. Thus, it is essential to limit the Environmental impact of these products. The main environmental aspect of such products is the Energy Consumption. That is the reason why we worked on the use phase, adjusting power consumption to the user behaviour with dynamic low power functions with new software features. Then, we optimised the global power management by replacing electronic components with last generations & power rails enhancement to decrease globally the power consumption. In three generations, we decreased the power consumption by 35% with equivalent functions. (see our COP 2011) The next step is harder to take as new features are required which are more power consuming. The graphic hereunder illustrates the differences of impact of our gateways sold in 2012 and the future model of 2013 (evaluation with French energy mix) Environmental impact comparison between 2012 and 2013 Gateways (french energy mix) 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group While embedding more functions, the new platform allows saving impacts on selected indicators. A close look to the global warming indicator (in Kg eqCO2) shows a decreasing of approximately 10% on the whole life cycle (18.5% on the use phase). However the environmental impact of the manufacturing is increasing as new features need more electronic components. 31 One could say that it may not be representative to use French Energy mix as it is low emitting (135g eqCO2 / kWh in ELCD database). A different approach with UK energy mix (665 g eqCO2 / kWh) shows better results on all indicators because of the higher environmental impact of the UK energy mix: -17% in total for the Global warming indicator. Environmental impact comparison between 2012 and 2013 Gateways (UK energy mix) If we focus on global warming in different countries, the savings are much more important due to the Energy mix. 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 32 4.3.2.3. Set-Top Boxes (Sagemcom Broadband SAS) Set Top Boxes offer the possibility to watch TV upon different kind of Tuners (IP, Terrestrial, Satellite or Cable). In addition, one can use Video on Demand Service, recording function, and other multimedia features. This increasing number of features, beyond simply watching TV, leads to increasing power consumption. The main environmental aspect of such products is the Energy Consumption. That is the reason why we worked on the use phase, adjusting power consumption to the user behaviour with dynamic low power functions with new software features. Comparison of STB generations and effect of the power features 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group The 2013 STB embed more functions and power than 2009 and 2011 products. Without power features it leads to greater power consumption & impacts. With power features enabled, the total environmental impact is nearly the same than 2011 product, and lower than 2009 product. 33 4.3.2.4. Pico projectors (Sagemcom Documents SAS) The PPX2480 Pico projector developed by Sagemcom is a small revolution. It allows to project photos, video, from a wide range of products such as smart phones, computers, USB sticks, … It is the perfect tool for nomad people who wants to share a media. Compared to standard beamers it has numerous advantages and a much more lower environmental impact as illustrated below.

That’s the basic idea of the Pico projector that gives sufficient power to reach up to 120 inches screen with 80 lumens to share photos, videos or any kind of media. The total environmental impact of the PPX2480 energy consumption is 93% lower than a standard beamer, based on a scenario of 1.5 hours per day. environmental impact of PPX2480 (EU average mix, 5 years) 100% 90% 2.06E-06 1.08E+02 80% 5.08E-03 6.28E+06 3.79E+01 6.28E-01 1.32E-02 7.50E+02 70% 1.08E+01 60% 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 1.45E-13 50% 40% 1.26E-03 2.95E-06 1.38E+02 30% 4.11E-03 5.26E+06 1.69E+01 3.24E-01 6.99E-03 2.86E+02 20% 10% 4.16E+00 0% AA AT ED GW HWP OD POC RMD WD WE WT Manufacturing Distribution Use End of life 34 4.3.2.5. Demat’box (Sagemcom Documents SAS) The ecosystem Demat'Box is a dematerialization solution without a PC, through the cloud, which allows digitizing all your documents. Combined with an operator, the user can choose any services, such as processing, analysis, or data storage. Easy to use, Demat'Box is adapted for all professional users or individuals. The transition from paper to the Cloud turns out to be revolutionary. From the environmental point of view the main advantage of this product is to allow scanning and storage without any computer or local hardware storage. However it is environmental friendly by itself with low power consumption and design integration. From power consumption point of view, low power have been designed so that user have the choice to parameter the fallback time ; allowing the product to go in deep standby as soon as possible will lead to sensitive environmental impact reduction. Comparative life cycle analysis has been realized based on different scenarios (see table) Scenario Scan / day On Idle standby N°1 – without low power mode activation 10 1% 99% N°2 – with low power mode activation 10 1% 7% 92% 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group The network activity is taken into account based on previous study in partnership with a telecommunication operator. First transmission of the document and seven distant accesses have been taken into account with a document size of 500 Ko. These scenarios should be compared to a paper management system with hard copy for use inside a company; for such management is it considered that incoming documents are copied once in their life cycle. In paper management scenario an impact per page printed is taken into account from previous Sagemcom evaluation of its multifunction device MF5571dW (see COP 2011). Paper used is made of virgin fibers, 80g/m². The use phase is modelised with an average European energy mix. 35 Impact comparison between dematerialized system and a paper management system (kg eqCO2) during 5 years 800 700 600 500 Titre de l'axe 400 300 200 100 0 demat'box (low demat'box (full printing system power activated) power) paper 1.20E+02 consumables 1.83E+01 end Of life 8.47E+00 8.47E+00 3.14E+01 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group Use 2.42E+01 9.01E+01 4.03E+02 distribution 7.42E-01 7.42E-01 8.23E+00 Manufacturing 2.81E+01 2.81E+01 1.18E+02 internet box 1.57E+01 1.57E+01 Network 1.02E+02 1.02E+02 Without power management activated, the Carbon footprint of the Demat’box solution is 245 kg eqCO2 over 5 years. If the power saving features are activated, the carbon impact is decreased by 27% (179 kg eqCO2). In total, the Demat’box can save up to 488 kg eqCO2 compared to a paper management system, while using an Energy Star printer.

The impact of plastic parts has been reduced by approximately 50%. 37 4.3.3. Mechanical parts & raw materials Selecting materials is also an important stage in the optimization of the environmental impact of our products. The combination of various types of materials can encourage or prevent the recycling of a product. This is why we ensure that we use compatible materials during recycling phases (e.g. PC and ABS plastics can be recycled together). From an assembly point of view, every action is taken to optimize the dismantling and separation times for the various fractions (plastics/metals/electronics/cabling, etc.). We are also taking a proactive approach and considering alternative materials which will reduce the exhaustion of the raw materials. We compared the environmental impact of two different types of plastic (PC and PMMA) to a plastic of reference (ABS). The benefit is that ABS has generally a lower impact to the PC for different impact categories studied; thus it is interesting to generalize the use of ABS in our product. Environmental impact comparison plastics 700% ABS PC PMMA 600% 500% 400% 300% 200% 100% 0% Air Acidification Air toxicity (AT Energy Global Warming Hazardous Ozone Depletion Photochemical Raw Material Water Depletion Water Water Toxicity (AA for PEP) for PEP) Depletion (ED for Potential (GWP Waste Potential (ODP Ozone Creation Depletion (RMD (WD for PEP) Eutrophication (WT for PEP) PEP) for PEP) Production for PEP) Potential (POCP for PEP) (WE for PEP) (HWP for PEP) for PEP) This result is illustrated by concrete case studies taking into account physical and technical parameters such as density and mechanical resistance. For example on one casing, using ABS 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group instead of PC allowed a saving of 2.8 Kg eqCO2 per product.

Encouraging recycling: marking materials In addition to financing end-of-life, measures are being taken to encourage recycling. Marking materials, particularly plastic parts, is part of these measures. By marking parts with different items of information, we allow recyclers to sort the plastic by type. This improves recycling by purifying the batch to be recycled. Thus, producers can encourage recycling by marking: The type of plastic (ABS, PC, etc.) The flame retardant (FR) The nature of this retardant 4.3.5. Alternative materials In addition to characterisation of environmental impacts of our plastic parts, we are working on use of alternative materials, based on : High rate recycled plastics (post-consumption) Bio-based plastics These materials are evaluated from technical and environmental point of view. Various references of materials have been identified and Comparison of impacts between an ABS are currently studied to ensure that environmental part (as a reference) and an alternative material part savings are real, and that technical needs are met to keep the same level of quality. Example of evaluation here under is a comparison of impact between a 85% recycled material and a standard ABS one. It takes into account the density of the materials and the design of the plastic part. Result is positive for the recycled material, while it is 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group still necessary to qualify it from a technical point of view. 39 4.4. Ecodesign partnerships Sagemcom as a leading company in Broadband equipment participates in different workshops and wishes to adopt a participative approach with stakeholders. In 2012, we participated in the ICT footprint project of the European commission, which aimed to assess the practicality of standards for life cycle assessments of ICT products. This partnership was made with a European telecommunication operator in order to evaluate the environmental impact of a video on demand service, including content management, operator network, home gateway and Set top box (optionally with a TV set). The global results are illustrated below for reference. VOD service impact repartition by product and lifecycle stage 50.0% Manufacturing Distribution software Use End of life 45.0% 40.0% 35.0% 30.0% 25.0% 20.0% 15.0% 10.0% 5.0% 0.0% -5.0% Video plateform AA Video plateform AT Video plateform ED Video plateform GW Video plateform POC Video plateform RMD Video plateform WD Video plateform WE Video plateform WT Network AA Network AT Network ED Network GW Network POC Network RMD Network WD Network WE Network WT set top box AA set top box AT set top box ED set top box GW set top box WD set top box WE set top box WT set top box POC set top box RMD gateway AA gateway AT gateway ED gateway GW gateway WD gateway WE gateway WT gateway POC gateway RMD In the end two methodologies were tested with fairly similar results. However the result is extremely CO2 (Kg eq) impact comparison for annual VOD service compared to the impac of a plasma TV dependent on who makes the study (differences in 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group set used to watch a VOD program approaches of various companies) and on which LCA 7.00E+00 tool is used (differences in databases). 6.00E+00 EoL use In addition, the comparison with a TV set highlighted 5.00E+00 transport the difficulties to compare data from different studies 4.00E+00 as the TV LCA4 was not performed with the same manufacturing methodology nor Energy mix. Further calculation and 3.00E+00 assumption have been made in order to integrate the 2.00E+00 TV set to the comparison, nevertheless the 1.00E+00 uncertainty was much higher. Last, the comparison was limited to Global warming 0.00E+00 (Kg eqCO2) as this was the only common indicator -1.00E+00 between the studies.

European regulations Several European Directives aim to prohibit or restrict the use of substances, which are dangerous for human health and the environment, in particular the REACh regulation 1907/2006 (Restriction, Evaluation, Authorisation of Chemicals) and the RoHS directive 2002/95/EC (Restriction of Hazardous Substances). We guarantee that our products comply with these directives. Particularly, the REACh regulation requires manufacturers and importers to declare the quantities of chemical substances manufactured in or imported to Europe. We have started with a complete inventory of all substances used in our activities, in coordination with the management of Material Safety Data sheets. All necessary pre-registrations have been made by the supply chain to ensure continuity of supplies. 4.5.2. Focus on SVHCs Concerning Substances of Very High Concern in our product, a traceability system has been set up to identify chemicals present in our products toward the supply chain. Sagemcom asks its suppliers to give information on chemicals contained in the components. Two possibilities for the suppliers: To connect on our dedicated web portal, or To connect on other external portals These declarations are made by uploading an IPC1752 format. This questionnaire lists: the restricted substances of REACh Annex XVII known to be used in the electronic sector (and other regulated substances), non-regulated substance suspected to have an effect on human health and / or on the environment Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC). The suppliers are asked to update this information every six months, due to evolutions of the SVHC list done by the ECHA. 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group In order to enhance the update of data, we encourage our suppliers to give a full material disclosure; meaning the chemical breakdown of the components. It will allow us to known in one declaration which are the substances included in the components. By doing this, suppliers will not have to update information every six months. Once information is uploaded by the suppliers, data are gathered in our environmental database. Thanks to that, our REACh team can analyse the bill of materials of our products to deliver a clear status of products to customers asking for information about chemicals. 41 Sagemcom Traceability system 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 4.5.3. Traceability of conflict minerals The traceability of certain minerals coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo and nearby countries is a growing concern for the electronic sector. We will initiate a traceability system about so-called conflict minerals in 2013 as per the US Dodd-Franck act. 42 4.6. Environmental Labels Eco-labels are intended to highlight the environmental qualities of products. These labels allow consumers to choose a product on an environmental friendly basis. Because there are not always labels for our product families, we chose to identify the environmental qualities of our own, when they are above average, with a clear display. 4.6.1. The «Simple Switch» PHILIPS program Products wearing the “Simple Switch” label allow reducing the costs, the energy consumption and the CO2 emissions by improving energy efficiency, packaging, hazardous substances, weight, and recycling. The range of PHILIPS fax Magic5 ECO, in the different versions as Basic, Primo, Primo Smart, Voice and Voice Smart received this label because of its environmental qualities. Our range of Thermal Transfer fax has a very low power consumption in standby. This is particularly important for telecom products, which always remains connected; standby mode represents more than 90% of operating time! Thus, with the Magic5 PHILIPS ECO range, we save energy and money. Ecodesign of this range of fax is beyond energy consumption; his design has reduced its size and weight, thus preserving natural resources by using fewer raw materials. Thus, it was possible to significantly reduce packaging size, with all consequences on the supply chain, more products per pallet for transportation, so fewer trucks on the roads, and less CO2! 4.6.2. Participation in the ENERGY STAR® program Sagemcom has ensured that its printing terminals consume less energy for many years. 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group The ENERGY STAR® program aims to promote the development and the general use of office hardware with low consumption. As a partner of ENERGY STAR®, Sagemcom develops many products satisfying the requirements of the label. You can find ENERGY STAR® compliant products on our Website http://www.sagemcom.com or on www.eu-energystar.org By using products with this label, you can help to protect the environment, while making savings! 43 4.6.3. Set-Top Boxes : The Industry Voluntary Agreement The industry Voluntary Agreement seeks to contribute to the achievement of the EU Action Plan on Energy Efficiency and in particular of the Eco design Directive 2009/125/EC, by reducing the potential environmental impact of Complex Set-top-Boxes (CSTBs), which will ultimately be beneficial to consumers and other end users. Its overall objective is to reduce the energy consumption of CSTBs in accordance with energy consumption targets and time frame, with a view to maximise the environmental benefits from improved design. The Voluntary Agreement delivers an industry-wide commitment to reduce the potential environmental impact of CSTBs. It goes beyond a “business as usual” scenario and provides for quick progress by means of rapid and cost-effective implementation, while allowing for flexible and appropriate adaptation to technological options and market sensitivities. This Voluntary Agreement sets out the means by which the Signatories, which are drawn from across the spectrum of the CSTB industry, will commit to achieve such rapid and effective implementation while continuing to invest in and develop sustainable and appropriate “best of class” CSTB products. Signatories engage in having more than 90% compliant products put on the market each year. Sagemcom Broadband SAS signed the voluntary agreement as it reflects our eco design policy; achieved results are described below. 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 44 4.6.4. Environmental labelling of DECT products Sagemcom is a stakeholder in the French experiment about disclosure of environmental information related to electronic products. In particular, the DECT phones environmental characteristics are disclosed by a French telecommunication operator in its shops & website. It includes a simplified carbon footprint of the product, and various information about raw material depletion, Eco design, … 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 45 4.7. Recycling Sagemcom commits to the recycling of all of its products. 4.7.1. Electrical & electronic equipment European Directive 2002/96/CE (known as WEEE) regulates the management of Electric and Electronic products at their end-of-life. Producers are responsible for the recycling of their products. Sagemcom is one of the founders of the eco-organization Ecologic, a company approved by the French government for the management of WEEE. (www.ecologic-france.com) 4.7.2. Packaging Sagemcom packaging satisfies the requirements of applicable regulations (European directive 94/62/CE): No heavy metal content Optimized volume of raw materials used Materials are identified to optimize recycling We finance the collection and recycling of our packages via eco-packaging systems. In addition to meet its obligations, Sagemcom permanently attempts to reduce packaging quantities. To give an example, changing the range of thermal transfer fax products reduced volume by 26%. Individual packaging is thus optimized as well as transport as an equivalent quantity of products can be carried by fewer trucks. Materials incomings being also an important question, we deploy recycled packaging in cardboard or certified, printed with vegetal inks. 4.7.3. Batteries and accumulators 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group Batteries and accumulators can represent a danger for the environment during elimination due to the dangerous substances they contain. The European directive 2006/66/EC prohibits the marketing of the least eco-friendly batteries and accumulators (limits for lead, mercury and cadmium content). It makes collection and recycling mandatory to ensure that elimination is controlled and to encourage less use of raw materials. Sagemcom contributes to the collection and recycling of batteries, particularly via its membership of eco organizations. 4.7.4. enhancing recycling : Dismantling sheets To ensure the correct recycling of its former products, Sagemcom provides recyclers with a dismantling sheet at request. This sheet contains all the information required to properly dismantle the product & recycle products in an optimum manner. To give an example of the information on the sheet: A summary of the material used (metals, plastics, electronic boards, etc.) Location of the components to be separated (according to the WEEE directive) Dismantling instructions Potential risks for recycling operators (sharp metal edges, etc.) 46 4.7.5. Consumables Sagemcom voluntarily set up a free-return system for corporate laser consumables. Eligible consumables have the “Nature by SAGEMCOM” logo. The Sagemcom collection program was set up to protect and conserve the environment. Our environmental program uses a T label which allows all users of Sagemcom cartridges to return them from anywhere in Europe. The T label is located on the packaging of your cartridge. This packaging is therefore designed to be returned to our centres. Once an empty cartridge has been returned, it is treated in a recycling centre. The T label placed on packaging enables you to manage your empty cartridges simply by sending them by post. Thanks to the re-use of cartridges via this program, you contribute to reduce industrial pollution. Sagemcom covers all postage, making this procedure useful, fast and free. To return your empty consumable, just slip the used cartridge into the bag which contained your new cartridge. Put the empty cartridge into the box of the new cartridge, then close the box and drop it off at your nearest post office. In addition, Sagemcom is partner of the French initiative CART’TOUCH in partnership with the French government. CART’TOUCH is a common take-back system set up by the major manufacturers of printers and consumables. CART’TOUCH aim is to enhance the return ratio of empty cartridges and to share best practices in consumables recycling. It gives opportunities to the enduser to send back empty consumables via 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group More information about CART’TOUCH at various means (local take back, mailing, …). www.cart-touch.org 47 4.7.6. Our approach : customer service for a lower environmental impact In addition to recycling household products and professional via Ecologic, Sagemcom has implemented a strategy of repair & refurbish for its customers. Having full control over its repair network has undeniable benefits for a group such as ours, as a client service (from the supply of the product to complete life-cycle management), but also as feedback. Our R&D and Quality services particularly appreciate this point. The study of NFF (No Fault Found) indeed appears to be the best means of ensuring that our products are constantly more reliable, effective and easy-to-use. Repair staff around the Globe 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group ASC (Authorized Service Center) feedback on user tips which our operators know backwards and forwards allows our call centre to assist clients while avoiding tedious and expensive product returns for repairs. Sales staffs are not forgotten: our refurbish lines are equipped to process thousands of products returned from a Telecommunications operator in view of serving a new subscriber. Large ASC are comparable to fully-fledged production plants as they include their own reception/acceptance units, production lines, quality control, dispatch, and purchasing services, etc. Operations are therefore similar, however, one detail differs, an ASC is unaware of which products 48 the service will need to process in advance (products are processed when they fail and cannot therefore be forecast by definition) and the aim is to ensure a rapid repair: a client is waiting for every failed product! For small ASC, the challenges mentioned above are combined with the wide range of products handled, as the Sagemcom portfolio is vast. One single operator could therefore repair set-top boxes on a morning, continue with Picopix and end the day with a few DECT. And all this time, the quality of the repair must be guaranteed, as our aim is to return a product in full working order to the client. Repair sites match the deployment of Sagemcom products to ensure effective international coverage. On this basis, Fax and Imaging products can be found in China, STB products in Brazil and Turkey, and other HGW in Brazil, Canada and Israel. Several centers are clearly set up in Europe, ranging from Sweden to Italy and from Portugal to Russia. Before concluding that the product has failed, every action is taken to ensure that our clients receive an adequate response in real-time. Our customers can access our support site, films and forums, and an on-line chat 24 hours a day, and what's more, our telephone operators are there to provide assistance. And if no solution is found despite all our efforts, our ASC will take action to ensure repair as rapidly as possible. A few figures for the client service: 49 : number of ASC spread over 29 countries 461,000 : number of repairs carried out 1,130 : number of Sagemcom product references processed in ASC 500,000: number of calls received on our hotline 27,000 number of support site pages (having generated almost 3 million pages viewed) 40,000 : number of e-mails received and processed 36,000: visits to the “get satisfaction” forum with 22,000 educational films viewed over 7,000 on-line chat sessions This approach allows the reuse of a maximum of products; depending on products types, up to 85% can put repaired and have a second life on the market. (Remaining products are non-repairable). The environmental impact is considerably reduced: Environmental impact comparison between a newly manufactured product (in green) and a refurbished product (in blue) 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 100% 90% 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% AA AT ED GW HWP OD POC RMD WD WE WT 49 30 000 634B – COP 2012 | Sagemcom group 50 5.
