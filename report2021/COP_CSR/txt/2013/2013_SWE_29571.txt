Smelters Boliden’s place in the metals’ value chain Boliden’s ﬁve smelters reﬁne metal concentrates and other raw materials, such as electronic scrap, metal scrap, metal ashes and scrap batteries, to produce both pure metals and customised alloys. Mines Boliden’s four mining areas produce ores containing zinc, copper, lead, gold and silver. The ore is processed to produce metal concentrates, the majority of which are delivered to smelters within the Group. Exploration Boliden’s exploration work focuses on identifying deposits that contain zinc, copper and precious metals. The exploration work aims to expand the mine portfolio by adding new deposits, both in the vicinity of existing mines and in completely new areas. BOLIDEN ANNUAL REPORT 2012 5 INTRODUCTION | PRESIDENT’S STATEMENT Project completion and continuous improvement Demand for Boliden’s metals has remained relatively stable during a year characterised by global uncertainty about economic trends. We continued to focus our work on enhanced efﬁciency and expansion projects and can now look back at a year in which, despite the challenges we faced, we delivered a healthy proﬁt. Market European economic performance continued to be weak in 2012 and growth rates fell in China. Global consumption of our metals simultaneously increased overall, however, and prices remained relatively stable. Terms for Boliden’s mines showed some deterioration but the smelters remained relatively constant, year on year. Base metal prices are set on the London Metal Exchange, LME, where global demand is matched with global supply. The base metals traded there have very clearly defined properties; the metals supplied by the various smelters are almost identical and customers can exchange one supplier for another. Transport costs are low relative to the value of the metals, and local price differences are quickly equalised. All of this means that Boliden can profit from global demand despite the weak demand from our local markets. Boliden is impacted not only by population growth, urbanisation and investments in infrastructure, but also by global increase in the use of electronic products. Increasing demands for responsible, sustainable recycling also benefit Boliden, which, thanks to its most recent investment, is one of the world’s biggest operators in this sphere. Stable processes Boliden operates in a global and cyclical industry in which only the best operators will survive and succeed. The most critical aspect of Boliden’s competitiveness is stable production processes as they provide the basis for value generation and for high safety levels and good environmental performance. The accident frequency in 2012 was higher than in 2011 and we are now putting additional measures in place to prevent accidents and improve the safety culture. We are working to improve every aspect of Boliden’s processes within the framework of the Group’s organisational and production philosophy, the New Boliden Way. A strong culture that enhances efficiency, eliminates unplanned stoppages, maximises recovery and cuts costs can only be created if every single employee has a genuine desire to contribute to our development in these respects. Our work with the New Boliden Way is a long-term project and we are beginning to see its results in many of our units. Two units to which we have paid particular attention in 2012 are the Odda smelter and the Tara mine. Just over a year ago, we had to decide whether to make substantial maintenance investments in Odda. Odda’s cost levels are high and a variety of alternative ways to proceed were analysed.

BOLIDEN ANNUAL REPORT 2012 9 Strategy Boliden shall achieve a leading position among medium-sized base metal companies by creating competitive mines and smelters and by being the company of choice for customers and commercial partners alike. Aitik is the world’s most efﬁcient and productive copper open-pit mine, with mine trucks that carry newly extracted ore to the crushers around the clock. The Caterpillar 795F trucks are among the biggest trucks in the world and have a load capacity of 313 tonnes. 100,000 tonnes of ore, which are processed to produce 740 tonnes of metal concentrate containing copper, gold and silver, are mined here every day. The low metal grades notwithstanding, Aitik is one of the world’s most productive copper open-pit mines, thanks to the largescale advanced and rationalised extraction methods employed.

BOLIDEN ANNUAL REPORT 2012 15 Operations Boliden extracts ore and processes it to produce concentrate in four mining areas, and produces ﬁnished metals and metal alloys in ﬁve smelters. Much of the mined production goes to the Group’s smelters, but Boliden also buys in raw materials from external suppliers in the form of both concentrate and recycled materials. The smelters’ customers, who are located in Europe, include steelworks and other producers of galvanised products and the copper-working industry.

The gold price at the end of the year was USD 1,664 per troy ounce, corresponding to a year on year increase of 6 per cent. Gold has long been an important asset class among ﬁnancial investors and is often regarded as a lower risk option when the global economy is weak. The strong interest in gold as an investment has continued in 2012 and continues to be driven by the below par performance of the global economy, a weak US dollar, concerns about the situation in many countries’ ﬁnancial sectors, and relatively low interest rates.

The geometry and composition of the ore body determine how it is mined and concentrated. The ore is crushed in several stages in the concentrator. Different minerals are then separated out from one another and from waste rock through a variety of concentration methods, of which ﬂotation is the most common for base metals.

Henrik Östberg, Senior Vice President Corporate Responsibility OPERATIONS | SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Boliden’s employees Boliden generates value by offering top quality products and services. To do this, Boliden must have employees who are skilled, committed, and secure and who accept personal responsibility. To achieve this, Boliden must, in turn, offer safe work environments, skill development programmes, opportunities to take on new challenges and for career development, and the possibility for employees to establish a balance between their professional and private lives.

BOLIDEN ANNUAL REPORT 2012 53 OPERATIONS | SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT “Excellence beyond zero” The Group’s EHS* managers, production and maintenance managers, and the Group management team – a total of 135 people – met up in March for a two-day conference on safety work. The theme was “Excellence beyond zero” and the focus of the conference was on our efforts to achieve our zero tolerance vision for accidents at work. The main message was that attitude and behaviour are vitally important and that managers must always set a good example and practice visible leadership. One of the speakers was Professor Marianne Törner from the University of Gothenburg who stated that one of the main factors that reduces safety is a rapid individual assessment, such as a desire to save time. Making the effort to behave safely instead can take longer or require a change in approach that might, at the moment in question, seem unnecessary. It is Boliden’s responsibility – and in the Group’s own interests – to work single-mindedly to ensure that every single employee places their own health and safety, and that of their colleagues, before instant gratiﬁcation at all times. * Environment, health and safety. increase knowledge sharing at the most that specialise in healthy foods, and our fessionalism, good developmental opporsenior management level, but also, in recurring “Stub it out” campaigns. tunities, good leadership and managepractical terms, to give the management Well-being also requires effective rehament, a safe work environment and a the chance to show their commitment bilitation activities – something that is long-term sustainable approach.

Successful exploration results in mineral reserves and mineral resources growing at a rate that exceeds the rate of ore production, thereby generating long-term growth. Mineral resources and reserves are affected not only by exploration, but by important factors such as mining costs and assumed metal prices. Exploration work is carried out both in the vicinity of existing mines in order to increase their lifespan, and in new areas in order to expand the mine portfolio with new assets. The end result of exploration often lies many years into the future and is associated with a degree of uncertainty and risk, and there are no guarantees that positive results from ﬁeld exploration will ultimately result in a producing asset. Positive trend in recent years Boliden’s mineral resources and mineral reserves have continued Boliden’s investments in exploration over the last 10 years have resulted to develop positively with net increases for the total resources in all in substantial increases in mineral resources and reserves, particularly at areas except Tara. Garpenberg and Aitik, but the Boliden Area has also seen very positive development in recent years. Tara currently has only marginally smaller Aitik mineral reserves than was the case 10 years ago, despite the quantities At Aitik, 34.3 Mtonnes of ore were extracted during the year.
