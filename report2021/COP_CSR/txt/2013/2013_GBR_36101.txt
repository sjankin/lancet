Our innovative tools and meticulous research enable multinational companies, ﬁnancial institutions, governments and NGOs to manage risks in a responsible way. Additionally, Maplecroft is committed to sharing its research and analysis widely, to raise awareness of human rights, environmental protection and good governance, and to educate people in addressing associated risks responsibly. Where both practical and beneﬁcial, we therefore make certain products and services available to NGOs and international organisations on a subsidised basis. Furthermore, we take our own commitment to the Principles seriously. As Maplecroft continues to rapidly expand and as we move into the next phase of growth, we look forward to providing many more beneﬁts for employees, for example, through the support of professional development.

The analysis highlights children’s vulnerabilities across the spectrum of the business environment. Importantly, the analysis evaluates the business environment using a child-sensitive approach in line with the principles and, as such, identiﬁes issues that may negatively affect the healthy survival, wellbeing and development of children. 20 PRINCIPLE 6: SUPPORT ELIMIN ATION OF DISCRIMIN ATION Our commitment or policy Maplecroft is committed to ensuring equal opportunities for all of its employees.

The brieﬁngs evaluated environmental and social risks associated with the sourcing of agricultural commodities, covering key risk areas such as water stress, child labour and poor working conditions. By combining quantitative and qualitative analysis, the brieﬁngs provided a tool for identifying key risk commodities and geographies. Maplecroft’s country risk indices were weighted according to a commodity’s unique risk proﬁle, providing a quantitative score for the sourcing of a commodity from a particular country. The commodity risk brieﬁngs also provided an overview of the value chain, as well as an explanation of the country-speciﬁc commodity scores. Commodity risk brieﬁngs are supported by additional in-depth commodity and country risk reports. 26 PRINCIPLE 9: ENCOUR AGE ENVIRONMENTALLYFRIENDLY TECHNOLOGY Our commitment or policy See Principle 7. Viewpoints of employees Relevant processes, systems, products and services Our role as an advisory business means we have the ability to inﬂuence the environmental performance of global organisations, by increasing their awareness, understanding and ability to manage environmental impacts.

The meeting formed part of the University’s Sustainable Sourcing of Global Agricultural Raw Materials project. Participation in this stakeholder meeting demonstrates how Maplecroft is supporting the UN Global Compact principles through its commitment to thought-leadership. Stakeholders from a wide range of backgrounds, including companies, government and NGOs, were brought together to discuss challenges relating to the sustainable production of food within agricultural supply chains and approaches to address these challenges. A key output of the meeting was the identiﬁcation of six goals for agricultural sustainability. These included food, water and nutrition security and the preservation of biodiversity. Attendance by Maplecroft was considered important as part of our active engagement in emerging developments within the responsible sourcing sector. For example, the meeting provided an opportunity to develop our understanding of different stakeholder perspectives and inform discussion in these areas. Such engagement is highly relevant to the ongoing development of Maplecroft’s product and services, particularly our tools which enable companies to develop and implement responsible sourcing strategies. http://asi.ucdavis.edu/research/ss 28 PRINCIPLE 10: ENCOUR AG E WOR K AG AINST COR RUP TION IN A LL OF ITS FOR MS Our commitment or policy Maplecroft is committed to working transparently and is against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.
