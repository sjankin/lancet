We shall touch them with our small style and make sure that they act in compliance with the Global Principles Covenant as well. We shall not withdraw in to our shell and sit in our island, which is surrounded by water on four sides, but shall call out to all the our suppliers and customers we can reach in the world, for the special meaning we assign to the word “global” in the Global Principles Covenant is the very thing that strengthens our commitment regarding the subject. • Explanations concerning the practices adopted for the application of the Global Principles Covenant: • In this aspect, the application-oriented steps that were taken in the previous year in order to try applying the principles set forth in the Global Principles Covenant and participating in partnerships should be explained (undertakings, systems, activities). However, as this is the first year of our COP, we are not able to give you examples from the past years. But, we hereby declare that we shall submit the COP for the year 2011 with all the commitments stated in the COP for 2009 implemented. • We can however, narrate one of our achievements, which we had decided among ourselves and realized within the 1-year process, but could not report because we were not acquainted with the COP yet, as it relates to the subject. We adopted a series of resolutions in order to take better performance from our employees, who have contributed to the company and affected our quality directly, thus leading our company to many achievements in its sector, and to reward them and ensure comfort and welfare in their lives, we have provided our original personnel, some of which are from outside the country, with dormitories without crowding, breakfast, lunch and dinner, resting and TV room in our facilities, in addition to the pay they receive. • And once again, as the Shipyard Famagusta Ltd, we do not carry any prejudice against any of our employees on the basis of their age, race, gender, tendencies, marital status, religious beliefs, nationality or handicap.

The working ours in our company is 8 hours a day as per the directives set forth by the government and issued by the Department of Labor. Our personnel works voluntarily beyond 8 hours and are paid overtime for each additional hour worked.

Social insurance and joint savings fund are always provided for the personnel that apply at us for employment without fail and are monitored by the 8 / 24 official departments legally. Serving since 19 years with the thought of institutionalizing, our company is well aware of the fact that employing child labor force would affect our quality extremely adversely and our prestige has never been shaken due to any offense such as employing people under 18 years of age and/or employing children. Because, we are aware of the fact that employing children is a crime according to the administration of our country as it is in the universal arena. Every year, a certain amount of the year’s budget is set aside by the decision of the administrative body of the company, to be donated to schools (especially primary schools) so that we can contribute to the education of the children under the age of 18.

Every employee is entitled to get the same pay for the same job, without discriminating. All the applicants seeking a job as a result of the announcements placed in the newspapers and employment office through the state are employed on the basis of an interview based on impartiality, justice and ensuring the principle of equal opportunity applicable to all out recruitment activities.

This has helped us introduce the shipyard to the students. ENVIRONMENT • Under the title “Principle 7” (The companies must support the Cautious Approach related to the environmental difficulties) The companies must support cautious approach regarding the environmental difficulties. Alarm bells are ringing for the global heating and environmental pollution ala over the world. As we are sharing this world too, we have responsibilities just like all other companies. In particular, because we are in the shipyard business, we are directly associated with the environment. In that respect, since we provide our services in our seas we are taking various measures with our competent personnel in order to collect many waste materials that threaten the environment. In relation with the foregoing, we intend to apply at both the ISO 9001:2000 quality certification and 12 / 24 immediately after that, to the environment-related 14000 certification institutions in order to implement measures of larger dimensions. At the moment, the environmentrelated actions implemented by our company are comprised of removing the wastes from the ships that are taken to the cradles and drydock especially, without harming the environment in any manner and transporting them to the disposal areas as per the laws. We also contribute directly to preventing the environmental pollution by maintaining the interior and exterior of the dirty vessels that enter out shipyard clean. Our environment friendly shipyard is aiming at many projects for the coming years and has made large investments and obtained various equipment and fixtures related to the environmental issues. Some of them are: • Purchasing the sea barriers: This is an investment made by our company and by means of those environment-friendly sea sausages, the waste and harmful oil leaking from the ships waiting at the wharves in the Famagusta port from time to time and accumulating on the are absorbed. We are also witnessing the wastes that fall overboard from the vessels carrying cargo while discharging in the Famagusta port from time to time and taking their photographs. We believe that the pollution in the Famagusta port shall be reduced with the investment we have made for preventing the environmental pollution and the support and aid to be provided by our state to us. • Some materials bought for environmental protection by the type as per the article GRI EN 30; – Sea Sausage: Absorbs the oil and chemicals accumulated on the water’s surface1080 $ – Sea Barrier Contains the polluting solid materials in a certain area and prevents them from spreading to a wide area on the sea.6000 $ – Pad: With the aid of those pads that are launched on the oil accumulated at certain areas on the sea, the oil and chemicals are absorbed. 1000 $ – The investments mentioned above are already made and the equipment is at the installation stage currently. We hereby undertake that the said equipment shall become active and we shall declare in the next year’s COP that they are put in operation, the practices are continuing and we have succeeded. We are also witnessing the wastes that fall overboard from the vessels carrying cargo while 13 / 24 discharging in the Famagusta ( Magosa ) port from time to time and taking their photographs. • Because, those investments made as a company are a proper step taken for the general cleanliness of the Famagusta port and our other ports, which belong to our country and society and not only for us. • Depending on the size of the vessels that come to our shipyard for maintenance; • Toilette • Bilge • Sludge after ballast-tank cleaning, and • Oil and oily wastes are removed by our shipyard. • As the issue is the environment, removal of the said wastes from the ships on time and correctly is very important. In that respect, the wastes are removed from the vessels coming to our shipyard without causing any pollution for the sea and environment in any manner and we hereby undertake that those practices shall continue without ceasing. If we look at from the “Total Water Discharge” of the GRI EN Article 21 point of view, and if we assume that the ships that are received for maintenance stay for one week for maintenance, we remove an average of 15 tons of toilette wastes in total during the one week process. A pipe connection is installed in order to remove the toilette wastes in the ships to transfer the wastes to the in to the toilette waste tank of the shipyard and then loaded on the waste material tankers provided from the market outside. Because both the private companies and the state organizations in the country are unfortunately inadequate in that respect, the removal tanker trucks are discharging to wastes in to the valleys (to the nature). But, we, as the Shipyard Famagusta Ltd. shall try to establish a treatment facility in the coming years to treat such wastes and to use the water obtain after treating the toilette wastes to irrigate the forest areas and to dispose of the other solid wastes by means of tankers. With this project, we shall be able to increase the amount of the recycled and re-usable water to 80% as per the GRI EN Article 10 and our nature and forests shall be fed with the recycles water obtained. If the wastes to be removed from the ships are in form of bilge sludge, oil and waste oil, 14 / 24 we have a separate tank to hold such waste during removal. The wastes are collected in the said tank and delivered to the tanker trucks employed from outside. However, a big problem here too is that, although those wastes are hazardous and chemical wastes, the tanker driver still dumps those to the valley bottoms and remote areas. Causing a different type of pollution. That means, while cleaning the sea on the once side, the nature is polluted on the other side. As a company, we are doing our share by not discharging the wastes removed from the ships, but, within the chain of our efforts, the state and the tanker operator should also act prudently and create healthy facilities to dispose of the wastes received and provide the infrastructure required. As a haevy industry company, we have to take extra measure related with environment. There is is some pictures from our company. • Waste-garbage collector company is taking our waste & garbage. For paint team personal, there is some rules for safty that have to wear mask, gloves and special uniforms. • For electric safety, there are special boxes to protect from high sun energy and rain. 15 / 24 • All chefs are wearing special uniforms. • There is full time security in our shipyard. We have got 5 watchman in our company. 16 / 24 • For all oxiygen tube and kitchen tube, there is security area. • We are a shipyard company, sometimes ships request to service, when sailing. For this emergency reasons we have a hawser. 17 / 24 On the other hand on January 2011 all our personnel organize “PLANT ACTIVITY”. Some photos from this activity. So we have green area. Shipyard’s family’s Forest. 18 / 24 In order to promote environmental responsibility along with global citizenship, an aggrement has been signed with the Turkish Red Crescent, where the volunteers under the roof of the shipyard has donated blood. This has gained attention in the local press where our company was shown as an example to others. 19 / 24 • Under the title “Principle 8”; (The companies must intervene as required in order to encourage higher environmental responsibility) The companies must intervene as required in order to encourage higher environmental responsibility. Believing in this principle, our company as made some activities again within the 1 year period prior to the presentation of this report. As a requisite of the our business as shipyard operators, the cleanness of our seas is as important as the quality of our work for us. The cleanness and maintenance of the ports we present to our costumers is equally our responsibility as the quality provided. Starting out from the principle that the quality and environment are a whole, we have a project that is related to our high environmental responsibility. Our first projects costs Euro 140.000 with the calculations over the current market prices. We have applied at the Donation Program initiated by the European Union Commission and started a project in order to obtain a share out of the said donation. If we can realize that project, as stated in the article 10 of the GRI EN concerning the “percentage and volume of the recycled water”, the waters in our seas will be clean and rendered re-usable and recycled. We are aware of the fact that our existing personnel and work-force are adequate to initiate the said project, but w need other resources as our budget is not enough to purchase the materials and equipment to build the ship in question. We are currently at the stage of preparing an application to be submitted to the European Commission Donation Program. If our application is approved and the donation requested is allocated to us, we shall start the construction immediately and build the first floating sea cleaning vehicle in the North Cyprus to contribute the cleaning of our ports regularly. If the said project is approved by the European Union Commission, we hereby undertake that we shall be able to make statements on the application thereof as the vessel in question will be completed in a period of 12 months. As a social responsibility, we take care about some ecomomize on electric, water, paper using. 20 / 24 For example : To reduce paper using, we expecially communicate from computer to computer with our customers and shareholders. To reduce paper using, generally all documents are send by mail between each departments (indoor). Our company can contribute to the protection of environment by not receiving hard copy offer upon their customers. Customers can receive their offers electronically. To reduce electric using, we are using only one lamp (not more) for each office. To reduce electric using, all machines swiches are off even if there is no any working or waiting mode. (warnings sign writing SWICH OFF IF NOT NECESSARY were stuck on switches. ) To reduce electric using, in all office personal pull plags at the end of the day. So, at least there will be 5 Watt electric saving for each computer. Related with save water, paper, and electricity and are hung up in various places within the offices. 21 / 24 • Under the title “Principle 9” (The companies must support the development and spread of the environment friendly technologies) At an era, when the whole world is mobilized for the environment, the environment and sea around our island surrounded by the seas are very important for us as the Shipyard Famagusta Ltd. Therefore, we assign priority to the customers that contact us to build environment friendly vessels aimed at cleaning the sea out of the local and foreign customers that contact us to build sea vehicles. Our company has “BATTARY COLLECT BOX” for enviromental responsibility. This Project is also can named environmental protection. Our company aims to meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental standart, given by the international supervisory board Bureauveritas in the year 2013. All environmental factors are being inspected and actions are being taken in this subject. 22 / 24 Financial help has been provided to the local Special Education Center to help it move on to more environmentally friendly technologies. As a result, the students at the special education center now has workshops in better conditions. FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION • Under the title “Principle 10”; (The companies must fight against all types of corruption, including bribery and profiteering.) The companies must fight against all types of corruption, including bribery and profiteering. Many of the illegal acts committed around the world are taking place using the marine ways. And we, as an establishment in the marine area, have a great responsibility regarding this issue. In that respect, we have adopted the principle of maintaining constant contact with the judicial authorities of the KKTC government. We are taking protective precautions in the Gazi Magosa (Famagusta) port area against illicit activities, bribery and profiteering with the support of the Police offices in the vicinity. Our company has never been involved in aggravated crimes such as profiteering, bribery or illicit activities and has asserted its principals clearly that would prevent such an eventuality at all times. “All facilities and repairing services for every type of vessel must complete legal ways.” This is our company’s most important policy. 23 / 24 Sultan DEMIR ISO 9001:2000 Management Representative & Assistant Manager Shipyard Famagusta Ltd.
