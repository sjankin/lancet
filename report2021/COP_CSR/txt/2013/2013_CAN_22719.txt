Our safety motto “If it is not safe, do not do it” has been accepted throughout Golden Star Resources (GSR) and I hope that this will assist our entire team to continue our efforts to improve safety. We continued our progress with our environmental performance and completed the entire year without a reportable environmental incident at any operational or exploration site. One of our major environmental improvements was the installation and commissioning of a process water treatment plant at our Bogoso operation. This allows us more flexibility in water management and will result in the re-use of more water within our overall operation.

This includes embracing, supporting and enacting – within our sphere of influence – a set of core values in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment, and anti-corruption. By integrating the UN Global Compact’s 10 universally accepted principles into our business operations and strategies, we aim to continually improve our corporate responsibility performance, while simultaneously advancing broader economic and social goals. In our 2011 Sustainability Report, we outlined several objectives and targets to work towards so as to advance the aims of the UN Global Compact. We also continued to work towards meeting our commitments and goals from prior years. The following tables presents a summary of these aims and our progress as well as our goals for 2013.

As part of the landmark social responsibility agreements with GSBPL catchment communities – which concluded nearly two years of negotiations – GSBPL has refined its comprehensive local employment agreement. We began implementing these agreements in 2012, building on our existing local hiring policy, with the aim of recruiting 80% of new Ghanaian unskilled and 40% of Ghanaian skilled people from our catchment communities. These recruits are required to meet specific criteria to be endorsed as a “community citizen” by traditional leaders, so as to ensure we employ as many local people as feasibly possible. The realization of this agreement will not only contribute to local economic development; it will also increase local pride and involvement in our GSBPL operations. Golden Star employs dedicated teams of specialist personnel to support corporate responsibility activities across our business.

The program adopts the small-holder concept of sustainable agribusiness, which addresses environmental, food access, and community concerns. Initially, development is sponsored by Golden Star as part of its local economic development program. The plantations are later able to become self-supporting and the smallholder farmers pay back the start-up loans to GSOPP to allow for further development. For every ounce of gold produced, Golden Star commits US$1 to the program, resulting in over $3.6 M in funding to date. To date, GSOPP has established 790 ha of plantation, 100 ha of out-grower plantations, and had, for 2012, produced 3,800 tonnes of oil palm fruit. .
