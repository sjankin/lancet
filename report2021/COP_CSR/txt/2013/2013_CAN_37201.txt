This resulted in a removal of 96.3 hectares of re-disturbance from the total of reclaimed areas prior to 2010. As such, the changes in the reclamation areas for each year and the total area permanently reclaimed to the end of 2010 have been updated to reflect these changes. Reclaimed lands have not been certified as such.

Suncor: Report on sustainability 2013 — 5 A message from our CEO “We are in this If there’s anything that has become The challenge ahead is even greater: apparent in the past few years, it’s that over the next 20 years, global energy energy has the power to divide. Despite demands are expected to grow by more together and that we all need it, the level of debate about energy sources, how it’s priced, than one-third to support the evolving aspirations of a global population expected the decisions how it’s delivered to consumers, and its environmental impacts have resulted to increase to nine billion. The reality is that as citizens on this planet, we make will in polarization. we’re going to need all sources of energy Through all of the debate, we seem to have to meet that challenge. And we’ll have determine forgotten the impact of energy in our lives. We are preoccupied deciding what we’re to find ways to responsibly link supply to demand. what our future against: oil sands, nuclear power, fracking, and have forgotten about what we’re for.

In the end, we are all part of something bigger – and we have many common goals and obligations. We decided to make these interconnections a key theme of this year’s Report on Sustainability and, emerging from that, we asked ourselves an obvious question: How can a company like Suncor best position itself to make a positive impact on the larger society? There’s no simple answer, but we believe the principle of ‘creating shared value’ is a good place to start. In other words, we need to strive to create economic value in a way that not only benefits our shareholders, but also creates value for society. On the meaning of shared value: Harvard University’s Michael E. Porter is one of the key proponents of the shared value principle, and we’ve had him come to talk to us about it. 8 — Suncor: Report on sustainability 2013 Professor Porter defines shared value Suncor has made to its community The second big picture point is this: as policies and operating practices that investment program, where we are growing economies require responsible enhance the competitiveness of a company targeting initiatives that build skills, and affordable sources of energy. This while simultaneously advancing the economic knowledge and capacity. For example, is particularly true when it comes to and social conditions in the communities Suncor supports a number of education transportation fuels, which provide in which it operates. What’s exciting to me and training programs aimed at Aboriginal mobility. So when you think planes, trains about this approach is that it encourages youth.

Water Water affects every aspect of Suncor’s business, and we focus on continuously raising the bar on our water performance, management and quality control practices. As we pursue our goal of reducing freshwater consumption by 12 per cent by 2015 (as compared to 2007), all our operations are realizing opportunities to use less water. We are paying particular attention to our oil sands mining operations, which represent Suncor’s biggest draw on freshwater resources.

Suncor: Report on sustainability 2013 — 13 Land and biodiversity As Suncor strives to be a trusted steward of natural resources, we are working to accelerate the rate at which we reclaim lands disturbed by our operations. We also continue to work collaboratively with industry peers as well as multi-stakeholder organizations to protect and restore sensitive lands and habitats across the boreal region – home to Canada’s oil sands. Since oil sands production began in 1967, Suncor has disturbed 21,303 hectares of land through our mining operations. As of the end of 2012, we had reclaimed* 1,542 hectares, or about seven per cent of the total. Our goal is to return all disturbed lands to as close to a natural state as possible.

Suncor continues to be an advocate of a national sustainable energy strategy for Canada. As a nation, we should be assessing our probable energy requirements 10, 20 and even 50 years down the road, and determining the mix of proven and potential energy resources that can best meet those requirements. Targets and goals for reducing GHG Canada’s oil sands industry remains under objective: to identify, assess, and quantify emissions would be an integral part of intense scrutiny over its contribution to energy efficiency and GHG reduction such a strategy – and it would need to look greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Forward-looking statements and other information is based on Suncor’s current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions that were made by the company in light of information available at the time the statement was made and consider Suncor’s experience and its perception of historical trends, including: expectations and assumptions concerning the accuracy of reserves and resources estimates; commodity prices and interest and foreign exchange rates; capital efficiencies and cost-savings; applicable royalty rates and tax laws; future production rates; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities; the availability and cost of labour and services; and the receipt, in a timely manner, of regulatory and third-party approvals. In addition, all other statements and other information that address expectations or projections about the future, and other statements and information about Suncor’s strategy for growth, expected and future expenditures or investment decisions, commodity prices, costs, schedules, production volumes, operating and financial results, future financing and capital activities, and the expected impact of future commitments are forward-looking statements. Some of the forward-looking statements and information may be identified by words like ‘‘expects’’, ‘‘anticipates’’, ‘‘will’’, ‘‘estimates’’, ‘‘plans’’, ‘‘scheduled’’, ‘‘intends’’, ‘‘believes’’, ‘‘projects’’, ‘‘indicates’’, ‘‘could’’, ‘‘focus’’, ‘‘vision’’, ‘‘goal’’, ‘‘outlook’’, ‘‘proposed’’, ‘‘target’’, ‘‘objective’’, ‘‘continue’’, ‘‘should’’, ‘‘may” and other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in the publication include references to: Suncor’s missions and visions, including to be Canada’s premier integrated energy company; developments around renewable energy (including planned investments); Suncor’s environmental goals to be achieved by 2015 (as compared to a baseline year of 2007), including improving energy efficiency by 10%, achieving absolute reductions in fresh water consumption by 12% and air emissions by 10% and increasing land reclaimed by 100%; Suncor’s goals and expectations around the roll-out of EMS, EIMS and OEMS; Suncor’s TROTM tailings management approach, which is expected to, among other things, dramatically accelerate the reclamation of tailings ponds (resulting in reclaimable surfaces within 10 years) and mined lands and reduce the need for future tailings ponds; Suncor’s environmental and social goals for 2013-2014; Suncor’s expectations (including results) around technologies being introduced or that may be introduced across Suncor, including those related to surfactants, lubricants, oxyfuel and carbon capture, waterless extraction and electromagnetic technology; the operation, by 2014, of a new $150 million wastewater treatment facility and the expectations around withdrawal of water as a result; plans to be undertaken by organizations Suncor is involved with, including COSIA and OSLI; the goal to return all disturbed lands to as close to a natural state as possible; Suncor’s belief that it will have two additional wind power projects commencing in 2015; anticipated future emissions and intensities of emissions, including GHG emissions; Suncor’s views around market access for its production; and Suncor’s anticipated transaction to sell the majority of its natural gas business in North America. The publication also includes Suncor’s planned capital expenditure spend and production guidance for 2012 which is based on our current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions (collectively, the “Factors”), including those outlined in our corporate guidance available on www.suncor.com/guidance, which Factors are incorporated herein by reference. Forward-looking statements and information are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some that are similar to other oil and gas companies and some that are unique to Suncor. Suncor’s actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by its forward-looking statements, so readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on them. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could influence financial and operating performance of all of Suncor’s operating segments and activities include, but are not limited to, changes in general economic, market and business conditions, such as commodity prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates; fluctuations in supply and demand for Suncor’s products; the successful and timely implementation of capital projects, including growth projects and regulatory projects; competitive actions of other companies, including increased competition from other oil and gas companies or from companies that provide alternative sources of energy; labour and material shortages; actions by government authorities, including the imposition of taxes or changes to fees and royalties, and changes in environmental and other regulations; the ability and willingness of parties with whom we have material relationships to perform their obligations to us; the occurrence of unexpected events such as fires, equipment failures and other similar events affecting Suncor or other parties whose operations or assets directly or indirectly affect Suncor; the potential for security breaches of Suncor’s information systems by computer hackers or cyberterrorists, and the unavailability or failure of such systems to perform as anticipated as a result of such breaches; our ability to find new oil and gas reserves that can be developed economically; the accuracy of Suncor’s reserves, resources and future production estimates; market instability affecting Suncor’s ability to borrow in the capital debt markets at acceptable rates; maintaining an optimal debt to cash flow ratio; the success of the company’s risk management activities using derivatives and other financial instruments; the cost of compliance with current and future environmental laws; risks and uncertainties associated with closing a transaction for the purchase or sale of an oil and gas property, including estimates of the final consideration to be paid or received, the ability of counterparties to comply with their obligations in a timely manner and the receipt of any required regulatory or other third-party approvals outside of Suncor’s control that are customary to transactions of this nature; and the accuracy of cost estimates, some of which are provided at the conceptual or other preliminary stage of projects and prior to commencement or conception of the detailed engineering that is needed to reduce the margin of error and increase the level of accuracy. The foregoing important factors are not exhaustive. Suncor’s management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) for the first quarter of 2013 dated April 30, 2013 and its Annual Information Form/Form 40-F dated March 1, 2013, Annual Report to Shareholders and other documents it files from time to time with securities regulatory authorities describe the risks, uncertainties, material assumptions and other factors that could influence actual results and such factors are incorporated herein by reference. Copies of these documents are available without charge from Suncor at 150 6th Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta T2P 3E3, by calling 1-800-558-9071, or by email request to info@suncor.com or by referring to the company’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or EDGAR at www.sec.gov. Except as required by applicable securities laws, Suncor disclaims any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Non-GAAP Measures – Certain financial measures in the publication – namely cash flow from operations, operating earnings, oil sands cash operating costs (excluding Syncrude) per barrel and ROCE – are not prescribed by Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). For 2012, these non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled in Suncor’s MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2012. These non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are included because management uses the information to analyze operating performance, leverage and liquidity, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reclamation – Reclamation at Suncor is a carefully monitored process with two distinct components: (i) transformation of the area, including tailing ponds, into a solid material that can support vegetation, wildlife and landscape restoration, which includes landform design and oil placement; and (ii) re-vegetation in a way that the reclaimed landscape can support vegetation and wildlife as a self-sustaining ecosystem. When Suncor claims that it has reclaimed land or plans to reclaim land, the reclaimed land will have met or is intended to meet the two distinct components identified in this paragraph. BOEs – Certain natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (boe) on the basis of one barrel to six thousand cubic feet. Any figure presented in boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A conversion ratio of one bbl of crude oil or natural gas liquids to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.
