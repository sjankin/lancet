As such, it marks a milestone for our combined company. First and foremost it demonstrates our ongoing commitment to the principles of sustainable development throughout our organisation and supply chain. Over the past year, we have taken the time to review our sustainability strategy in order to match our approach to the company we have grown into today. At the same time, we want to secure continued progress in integrating sustainability in all our activities. We believe that targeting an even stronger sustainability performance is a way to enhance and ensure the future of our business. We are inspired by the opportunities it offers by adding value to our stakeholders as well as to our business. A deep-rooted approach Our focus on sustainability builds on a long-standing tradition in our company and is a natural priority for us. As a business dependent on nature’s resources and stable climates, our environmental and climate consciousness is deeply rooted. Our ongoing commitment to reducing the footprint of our activities has helped us make ­significant progress over the years. By introducing increasingly sophisticated technology to our processes, for example, we have cut our energy consumption and CO2 emissions considerably. Today, energy optimisation and measures to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels remain a primary action area. Lower resource consumption not only improves our sustainability profile. It also makes financial sense, with an immediate positive impact on our bottom line. As a sugar and feed producer, we are aware of the demands that go with supplying an ingredient used in human and animal diets and with the role we play in the commercial success of our customers worldwide. Our response is a systematic, proactive approach to ensuring the integrity of our supply chain through setting high standards, working to identify and deal with potential risks, and nurturing the strong quality-conscious spirit of our team. Nordzucker employs around 3,300 people in several countries. Their competences and desire to excel shape our success, including in the sustainability area. To maintain that high level of commitment, the provision of safe and inspiring work conditions is a core priority. We are currently focused on ensuring that Nordzucker remains attractive to the diverse group of employees we are privileged to have in our company today – and to the new talents we will need in the future. Good business sense At Nordzucker, we have made continuous improvements to our sustainability performance over the years, constantly raising the bar for our work. In determining our priorities, we seek to take our stakeholders’ views and concerns into greatest possible account. We believe in sharing our experience and are glad that we have been able to support several of our supply chain partners in making progress with their sustainability efforts, too. 4 Sustainability Report 2012 / 2013 02 Our company We are aware that there remain challenges to be tackled – and that new ones will arise, particularly as we expand our business internationally. However, there is no doubt that an ambitious approach to sustainability boosts our competitive power and is the best strategy for our company and stakeholders. Backed by a strong culture for improvement and the know-how of our team, we are committed to leading the sustainable development within sugar and comparable industries. An increasing number of customers and other partners show an interest in our sustainability performance. We see this as a welcome opportunity to maintain a dialogue about our initiatives and priorities. This report is an important tool in that communication.

These improved methods, combined with plant breeding research and development, have over time helped raise the sugar concentration in the beet from 5 per cent up to 20 per cent, while yield per hectare has increased tenfold. Sugar beet is an environmentally friendly crop. It has a very deep root system that is good for soil structure and efficient water uptake. Growing into the autumn, when other crops are already harvested, the beet continues to absorb nitrogen from the soil, reducing the risk of nitrogen leakage. The sustainability of the beet crop remains a high priority, for the sake of both the environment and our business. For this reason, we have taken a number of initiatives to support farmers in making further production improvements. 100 per cent of the sugar beet is utilised Through the process of photosynthesis, sugar beet uses the Sunlight CarbonWater Oxygen dioxide energy in sunlight, along with carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil, for plant growth and in the process releases oxygen to the air.

I have many small fields, with country roads and houses among them. The area is very popular with tourists and locals. That is why I try to consider my surroundings by reducing pesticide spraying to an absolute minimum and keeping strips of grassland along fields and waterways for safety. Detection and warning systems also help me keep pesticide use to a minimum.

In addition, we employ renewable energy sources such as biogas from our wastewater treatment Investing for the future plant. Since 2010/2011, we have increased our investments in projects to reduce our energy consumption from EUR 3 million to EUR 10 Our major energy reduction initiatives over the last three years million in 2011/2012 and EUR 20 million in 2012/2013. have included the installation of more effective beet pulp presses and heat exchangers, with more effective cleaning of the heat The installation of new steam dryers at our factories in Uelzen, ­exchangers to optimise their performance.

Germany – a fuel change that has cut CO2 emissions by up to Carbon footprint of sugar The carbon footprint of sugar has become increasingly important to our stakeholders. Many of our customers want to work with suppliers who take steps to reduce their emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases and can provide robust supporting data. However, the lack of a common methodology for measuring ­carbon footprint within the beet sugar industry remains a ­challenge. European study In 2012, The Comité Européen des Fabricants de Sucre (CEFS) published a European carbon footprint study of EU beet sugar. One of the key findings is that the carbon footprint of EU beet sugar varies widely depending on the carbon accounting methodology used. Even with the same data set, different methodologies may give results ranging from 241 kg to 771 kg CO2 per tonne of sugar produced. Sustainability Report 2012 / 2013 23 The carbon footprint of sugar cultivation and production has become increasingly important to our stakeholders. Nonetheless the CEFS study assists our CO2 reduction efforts by Our carbon footprint showing how each step in the value chain contributes to the total In an effort to understand our carbon emissions profile and carbon footprint.

The unit of measurement for our carbon footprint study was one The results of the CEFS carbon footprint study tonne of sugar as it leaves the factory. For our calculation, we used data covering 12 months of production at all 13 sugar factories, including the 2009 beet campaign.

This is well within the 49.3 % 3.6 % range of the CEFS study. As with all lifecycle analyses, our result is unique and cannot be compared directly with other studies. The result ­indicates that sugar has a smaller carbon footprint than most other processed foods, for example meat or milk.

This will assist us in planning further initiatives The study’s results confirm the focus of our sustainability initiatives. to reduce our carbon footprint. As the majority of emissions (64 per cent) emanate from production processes, this underlines the importance of driving energy efficiency measures. That 32 per cent of emissions originate from cultivation supports our efforts to help beet growers reduce their emissions. 2 Substitution (system expansion) was used for co-products to avoid allocation. 24 Sustainability Report 2012 / 2013 05 Our production Reducing CO2 emissions in the supply chain Multi-cyclones, scrubbers, new types of filter and filter cloths are Our energy and climate strategy not only focuses on reducing further reducing dust levels in our factories. the CO2 emissions of our own operations. It also includes plans for working with our partners to reduce the carbon footprint of Projects to reduce also NOx emissions include the reconstruction the supply chain. of the boiler in Nykøbing, Denmark, the replacement and reconstruction of boiler in Porkkala, Finland investment in a low NOx In cooperation with beet growers, we will continue to improve gas turbine in Klein Wanzleben, Germany, and the installation of the efficiency of beet cultivation and transportation, for example, NOx reduction systems in a number of other factories. through our 20 · 20 · 20 initiative. Other projects include reducing soil tare by pre-cleaning beet in the fields. All these investments will ensure our compliance with the EU Industrial Emissions Directive that will come into effect on 1 January 2016. Other emissions to air Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and dust are mainly produced by combustion processes. The amounts SO2, NOx and dust produced emitted depend on the type and quality of fuel used in our boilers in kg per tonne of sugar and pulp driers. For example, while coal and oil contain 1 – 4 per cent sulphur, the sulphur content of natural gas is negligible. The fuel mix used by our factories depends on the type of equipment 1.02 at each site and the availability of fuel types. 0.91 0.83 Our progress 0.62 0.62 0.56 Over the last three years, our total SO2 emissions per tonne of sugar produced have fallen almost 20 per cent. Initiatives that have con­tributed to this improvement include the replacement 0.18 0.20 0.18 of oil with natural gas at some plants; the installation of flue gas scrubbers at German sites; and the use of fuel with a l­ower ­sulphur content. SO2 NOx Dust 2009 2010 2011 Sustainability Report 2012 / 2013 25 Conserving water Water plays a critical role in our production processes. So mana­g­ ing our water consumption responsibly is a natural priority for us. All the water employed in production is initially reused, then cleaned and returned to source. Sugar beet contains approximately 75 per cent water. This is evaporated during processing, condensed and used for processing steps such as beet fluming, washing, extraction and crystallisation. We recycle water approximately 20 times before using it to transport soil to the settling ponds. In this way, we meet 90 per cent of our water requirements through water evaporated out of the beet, keeping our municipal water usage to an absolute minimum. Our progress By continually optimising our water reuse and raising awareness of water consumption, we have successfully reduced our total water consumption by 28 per cent over the past three years. The low consumption in 2011 was achieved by optimising our internal water cycles, assisted by favourable weather conditions. The good weather with low soil content enabled the factories to run more evenly with good capacity utilisation and water management. Given our healthy performance in this area, further improvements will be mainly incremental. In line with our overall key performance indicators, consumption will continue to be assessed and local ­targets defined in all factories.

Nordzucker factories, optimising transportation is very much in focus. Initiatives over the last few years have cut the kilometres travelled, fuel used and carbon dioxide emitted. The high capacity trucks used by professional transport companies have also Kg waste* per tonne of sugar reduced the frequency of traffic significantly.

The result is reduced transport weight, saving 10.9 11.4 fuel and reducing emissions. Whenever possible, the vehicles that 7.1 deliver beet to the factories also transport products back to the farmers, such as sugar factory lime and feed products, like pulp and pellets. Transport distances are reduced by continuous 2009 2010 2011 ­efforts to move sugar beet production closer to factories.

That applies not only to Nordzucker employees but also to the external contractors we have on site. We also strive to ensure consistent compliance with our health and safety requirements. In spite of our best efforts, there will be accidents. My job is to keep accidents to a minimum and ensure that people think of health and safety at all times. How do you ensure that your colleagues are always aware of health and safety? At the end of the day, safety is in our own hands. Everyone needs to take responsibility – be proactive and get involved. We try to train people to be “responsible drivers”, that is to see accidents and dangers before they happen. To promote this philosophy, we conduct training, perform weekly controls and reward employees who show the best health and safety performance.

As a leading European sugar supplier, we consider it our responsibility ® to provide information about the nutritional aspects of sugar. In this way, we aim to promote a balanced, knowledge-based debate and enable consumers to make informed choices. In the media, sugar has often been highlighted as the cause of health problems, particularly obesity. However, we believe scientific Fairtrade improves the evidence proves that sugar can be an important part of a balanced daily diet.

The Bonsucro vision is to be a leader in driving the market demand for certified sugar cane produced against sustainable standards. Bonsucro aims to improve the social, environmental and economic sustainability of sugar cane by promoting the use of a global metric standard. By continuously improving sugar cane production and downstream processing, the objective is to contribute to a more sustainable future. Bonsucro was formed in 2005 and now has around 60 members. Currently 2.3 per cent of all grown sugar cane is Bonsucro certified. 50 Sustainability Report 2012 / 2013 09 Society Partner for health and nutrition Childhood is the best time to learn about food and nutrition. That is why Nordzucker supports selected projects that help ­children and young people to develop their dietary knowledge. Hardegsen international school farm Every year nearly 2,500 school children of all ages spend a few days at the Hardegsen international school farm and get a close-up view of where food really comes from. The children are actively involved. Mornings and evenings they take care of the chicken, sheep and pigs. The “curriculum” also includes processing sugar beet and making cheese. The children cook a lot of their own food and learn about a healthy and balanced diet. In order to give a realistic picture of modern agriculture, the school farm works with agribusinesses from the region. When children discover how their food is made, which plants and animals are used in food production, and how much work goes into producing them, their understanding of food and agriculture grows.

Short-term financial impact • Are there direct and significant costs or financial benefits linked to the indicator? • Is the indicator covered by regulation, and is non-compliance a significant risk factor? • Does the activity linked to the indicator cause significant spending? B. Covered by own policies • Is the indicator directly covered by existing policies, targets or commitments? • Is the indicator indirectly covered by policies or commitments and is the level of impact non-marginal? D. Impact on stakeholder behaviour and concerns • Is the indicator within the area of interest of an identified stakeholder? • Is the impact the indicator describes non-marginal? • Has the stakeholder raised concern or is he/she likely to do so?
