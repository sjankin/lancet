Notes to the Reconciliation of Equity as at 1 January 2011, 31 December 2011 and Total Comprehensive Income (“C I”) for the year ended 31 December 2011. A. Revenue 1. Revenue Recognition on Produce Stock Profit & loss of the perennial crop has been recognised in the financial period of harvesting in terms of SLAS 32. Thus the unsold stocks were treated as a part of revenue. The scope of revenue recognition was changed to LKAS 18. Accordingly, the revenue is recognised based on the date of auction where the recognition criterias are met and therefore the quantity which is sold at auction is treated as the sales. This classification does not effect on the net assets for the Statements of Financial Position as at 1 January 2011, 31 December 2011. The turnover in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended 31 December 2011 was decreased by Rs. 76.9 m.

Cost of Sales 1. Matching the Cost of Sales Against Revenue Recognition of the cost of sales has been changed simultaneous to the changes to the revenue recognition. Thus, cost of sales consists with the costs that are directly attributable to goods sold. Cost of opening stocks and the closing stocks were adjusted to the cost of production in arriving this. Further, the measurement of unsold tea and rubber stocks have been changed, in terms of LKAS 2 and LKAS 41. Please refer Note H for changes in valuation method of inventoty. 2. Changes of Useful Lives and Residual Values of Property, Plant & Equipment The depreciation for the year has been changed as a result of changes in the useful lives and residual values. Please refer Note D for further details. 3. Increase in Amortisation Due to Re-assessment of Right-to-Use Land (Note C) The amortisation for the year increased due to recording the contingent Liability of liability to Make Lease Payment. Please refer Note C. As a result, cost of sales for year ended 31 December 2011 has been decreased by Rs. 82.2 m.

Leasehold Property, Plant & Equipment Right-To-Use Land As per the provisions of SoRP for right-to-use land, the Group has reassessed the liability to make lease payment as of 1 January 2011. As a result, right-to-use land has increased by Rs. 67.9 m and amortisation for the year ended 31 December 2011 increased by Rs. 1.9 m the interest charge for the year increased by Rs. 4.3 m, in C I.

Freehold Property, Plant & Equipment 1. Changes to the Estimation of New Useful Lives and Residual Values The high value of fully-depreciated assets those are being used in commercial operations provided an objective evidence of estimation error in allocation of depreciation. Hence, the management reviewed the useful lives and residual values of all classes of the assets and identified that plant & machinery, vehicles and equipments are mainly contributing to the deficiency. Accordingly, the electronic machineries were segregated from plant & machinery, as a separate class of asset, and reduced its useful life into 10 years as those assets are having distinguishable useful life due to technical obsolescences. The useful lives of rest of the plant & machineries were increased into 20 years. The motor vehicles segregated to two classes i.e. utility and supervisory. The useful life of the utility vehicles increased to 10 years while the useful life of supervisory vehicles remained unchanged. The depreciation rate of equipments were increased from 12.5% to 25%. The changes were retrospectively adjusted to the Financial Statements in terms of transitional provision in SLFRS 1. As a result, the net assets of opening Statement of Financial Position increased by Rs. 40.2 m and 31 December 2011 increased by Rs. 53.3 m.

Improvement to Leasehold Property The improvements to leasehold property consists of mature and immature tea, rubber and other plantations which come under the definition of biological assets in terms of LKAS 41. These assets were classified as biological assets and presented in the Statements of Financial Position. The amount classified as biological assets is amounted to Rs. 50.1 m and Rs. 50.4 m as at 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011 respectively. Please refer Note F for further details. This classification does not effect on the net assets for the Statement of Financial Position as at 1 January 2011, 31 December 2011 and Comprehensive Income for year ended 31 December 2011. F. Biological Assets 1. Changes in Classification of Improvements to Leasehold Property The cost of the consumable biological assets which were classified as Improvements to Leasehold Property was reclassified as consumable biological assets. These assets include the cost of managed timber that is cultivated for commercial purpose. 2. Changes in Classification of Nursery Stocks The tea, rubber and other nurseries were classified as inventory under SLAS. Since the living plants scoped under the definition of biological assets in terms of LKAS 41, those nurseries were classified as biological assets. However, those are presented under inventory as previously. This classification does not effect on the net assets in the Statement of Financial Position as at 1 January 2011, 31 December 2011 and C I for year ended 31 December 2011. 3. Fair Value of Biological Assets The tea, rubber and other plantations were measured at cost less depreciation and amortisation or impairment if any, under SLAS. The requirement of recognition of the biological assets at its fair value under LKAS 41 has not been effected due to the ruling issued on 2 March 2012, by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Company has elected to measure the bearer biological assets i.e. tea & rubber using LKAS 16 Property, Plant & Equipment and continued the cost model of recording them. This measurement does not effect on the net assets in the Statement of Financial Position as at 1 January 2011, 31 December 2011 and CI for the year ended 31 December 2011. Therefore, LKAS 41 applied for consumable biological assets thus the fair value of managed trees was ascertained by professionally qualified valuers. As a result, the net assets of opening balance sheet has been decreased by Rs. 10.5 m and 31 December 2011 decreased by Rs. 1 m. The C I for the year ended 31 December 2011 has been increased by Rs. 9.4 m due to the gain on fair value of biological assets.

Inventories 1. Produce Stock The produce stock of biological assets i.e. tea and rubber were valued at their actual or estimated realisable values, net of direct selling expenses in terms of SLAS 32. With the conversion to new accounting standards, the agricultural products that are harvested from biological assets i.e. green leaf and latex are required to measure at its fair value less cost to sell at the point of harvest. Thereafter, it is scoped under LKAS 2 and said fair value is the cost at the date of applying this standard. The cost of semi-finished and finished products was estimated through attributing the direct manufacturing cost into the fair value of biological products. Finally the measurement of inventory is carried at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value in accordance with LKAS 2. As a result, the net assets of opening Statement of Financial Position decreased by Rs. 30.2 m and 31 December 2011 decreased by Rs. 35.8. m. The cost of sales in C I for year ended 31 December 2011 has been increased by Rs. 5.5 m. 2. Nursery Stocks The nursery stocks were classified as biological assets.

The assets (including plantation assets) taken over by way of estate leases are set out in Note 13 to the Financial Statements. Further investments in Immature Plantations taken over by way of leases are shown in this Note. When such plantations become mature, the additional investments since taken over to bring them to maturity are transferred from Immature to mature. The requirement of recognition of bearer biological assets at its fair value less cost to sell under LKAS 41 was superseded by the ruling issued on 02 March 2012, by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Company has elected to measure the bearer biological assets at cost using LKAS 16 Property Plant & Equipment. Specific borrowings have not been obtained to finance the planting expenditure. Hence, borrowing costs were not capitalised during the year under Immature Plantations (2011 NIL). The addition of Rs. 336 m (2011 Rs. 288 m) shown above includes the following costs among other costs incurred during the year in respect of uprooting and planting of tea and rubber.

The cost of immature trees is treated as approximate fair value particularly on the ground of little biological transformation has taken place and impact of the biological transformation on price is not material. When such plantations become mature, the additional investments since taken over to bring them to maturity are transferred from Immature to Mature. The fair value of managed trees was ascertained since the LKAS 41 is only applicable for managed agricultural activities in terms of the ruling issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. The valuation was carried by Messrs Sunil Fernando Associates, chartered valuers, using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methods. In ascertaining the fair value of timber, physical verification was carried covering all the estates. Key assumptions used in valuation 1. The harvesting is approved by the PMMD and Forest Department based on the forestry development plan 2. The prices adopted are net of expenditure 3. Discount rate is 17.5% 4. Though the replanting is a condition precedent for harvesting, yet the costs are not taken into consideration. The valuations, as presented in the external valuation models based on net present values, take into account the long-term exploitation of the timber plantation. Because of the inherent uncertainty associated with the valuation at fair value of the biological assets due to the volatility of the variables, their carrying value may differ from their realisable value. The Board of Directors retains their view that commodity markets are inherently volatile and that long-term price projections are highly unpredictable. Hence, the sensitivity analysis regarding selling price and discount rate variations as included in this note allows every investor to reasonably challenge the financial impact of the assumptions used in the LKAS 41 against his own assumptions. 134 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements The biological assets of KVPL are mainly cultivated in leased lands. When measuring the fair value of the biological assets it was assumed that these concessions can and will be renewed at normal circumstances. Timber content expects to be realised in future and is included in the calculation of the fair value that takes into account the age of the timber plants and not the expiration date of the lease. 15.2.1 Sensitivity Analysis Sensitivity Variation on Sales Price Values as appearing in the Statement of Financial Position are very sensitive to price changes with regard to the average sales prices applied. Simulations made for timber show that a rise or decrease by 10% of the estimated future selling price has the following effect on the net present value of biological assets: Company As at 31 December 2012 Rs. ‘000 Rs. ‘000 Rs. ‘000 -10% – +10% Managed Timber 56,090 58,540 61,339 Total 56,090 58,540 61,339 Sensitivity Variation on Discount Rate Values as appearing in the Statement of Financial Position are very sensitive to changes of the discount rate applied. Simulations made for timber show that a rise or decrease by 1.5% of the estimated future discount rate has the following effect on the net present value of biological assets: Company As at 31 December 2012 Rs. ‘000 Rs. ‘000 Rs. ‘000 -1.5% – +1.5% Managed Timber 63,024 58,540 56,718 Total 63,024 58,540 56,718 The carring amount of biological assets pledged as securities for liabilities are nil for year 2012 (2011 nil).

This requires an entity to determine how much benefit is attributable to the current and prior periods and to make estimates about demographic variables and financial variables that will influence the cost of the benefit. The following key assumptions were made in arriving at the above figure. According to the actuarial valuation report issued by the actuarial valuer as at 31 December 2012 the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits amounted to Rs. 1,007,582,466/-. If the company had provided for gratuity on the basis of 14 days wages and half months salary for each completed year of service, the liability would have been Rs. 876,846,560/-. Hence, there is a contingent asset of Rs. 130,735,906/-, which would crystallise only if the company ceases to be a going concern. The Present Value of Retirement Benefit Obligation is carried on annual basis. The key assumptions used by Messrs Actuarial & Management Consultants (Pvt) Ltd. include the following: (i) Rate of Interest 10% (ii) Rate of Salary Increase Workers 22% (every two years) Staff 10% (per annum) (iii) Retirement Age Workers 60 years Staff 60 years (iv) Daily Wage Rate Tea Rs. 380/Rubber Rs. 380/144 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements Sensitivity Analysis Values appearing in the Financial Statements are very sensitive to the changes of financial and non-financial assumptions used. The sensitivity was carried for the rate of wage increment, as it is the key contributor to the entire obligation. Simulations made for retirement obligation show that a rise or decrease by 1% of the rate of wage increment has the following effect on the retirement benefit obligation: Company As at 31 December 2012 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rate of wage increment in every two years (%) 21 22 23 Retirement benefit obligation of workers 841,163 883,370 928,373 As at 31 December 2012 841,163 883,370 928,373 27.
