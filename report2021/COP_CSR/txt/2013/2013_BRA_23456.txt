GRI INDEX S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT GRI 4.11 Multiple Opportunities and Challenges In the mid 1990s, as we were entering the highway administration market, Brazil was a very different country than it is today. At the economic level, the then recently launched Plano Real represented the hope for a definitive end to hyperinflation. At the institutional level, the country still lacked specific legislation to regulate highway concessions, a solution found by the federal government to improve the conditions of the roads without having to invest public resources. In this high risk environment, the first companies to operate in this sector—and CCR was among them— received as a reward an attractive rate of return on the capital invested. This model transformed Brazil’s main highways, providing more comfort and safety to drivers and saving lives in addition to contributing to a better flow of industrial and agricultural production, thus avoiding economic losses. Almost two decades later, Brazil is a different country. The economy has been growing at a steady rate, increasing the level of employment and the income of its citizens. The regulatory framework for the concession of highways has been established; everyone knows the rules of the game. These factors have significantly decreased the risk that a company from the private sector has to assume in order to operate in this segment; however, the reward is smaller. In other words, the return on the capital invested is considerably lower compared with that of 20 years ago, which is to be expected. Highway concessions is CCR's core business. Throughout Brazil, there are still many roads in poor condition requiring urgent investment. Competition is steadily growing, but our expertise in this segment gives us a competitive edge. We intend, therefore, to operate in this area for many years to come. Nevertheless, in order to keep growing we must look to all areas. There are excellent opportunities in other infrastructure segments such as urban mobility, airports, and railways. Among the projects already forthcoming and others yet to be developed, we estimate a volume of R$ 40 billion per year in Brazil alone throughout this decade. CCR will be a part of this movement, providing returns to shareholders and adding value to employees, users, communities, vendors, and other audiences in our relationship chain. Our diversification strategy was put into practice in 2006 with the execution of the public-private partnership (PPP) with the government of the state of São Paulo for the operation of Line 4-Yellow of the subway system for the capital city. In 2012, we took important steps toward achieving this strategy. Through a consortium formed with partner companies, we secured public bidding for the construction and operation of the Transolímpica, an express bus corridor that is part of the set of investments for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. In that same city, we acquired the operation of Barcas, which is the passenger ferryboat system between the city of Niterói and Rio de Janeiro. Finally, we concluded the acquisition of assets owned by our shareholders in the airports of Quito (Ecuador), San Jose (Costa Rica), and Curaçao (Netherlands Antilles). Still concerning 2012, we were surprised by the Brazilian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which was less than forecast, and this had a direct impact on the volume of traffic on the roads under our administration. This was offset by the success of CCR Group’s business units in their quest for greater efficiency, 6 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 controlling expenses, and generating additional revenue. With the support of excellent financial management which benefited from the reduction of interest rates for debt restructuring, we reached the end of the year posting very good results. The consolidated net operating income for the year reached R$ 5.77 billion, representing an increase of 12.34% compared with 2011 and the profit was R$ 1.2 billion, an increase of 30% compared with 2011. In general, all operating goals were met. We had some difficulty in making all the investments forecast in highways given the slow pace of the environmental licensing processes. We will give priority to this issue in 2013. We advanced in CCR’s sustainability management, considered by the Board of Directors to be a strategic guideline for the company. We are working, as planned in 2010, through the implementation of the Programa Corporativo de Sustentabilidade CCR (CCR’s Corporate Sustainability Program). In 2012, we continued to be a part of the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) of BM&FBOVESPA, bringing about many advances in dealing with our externalities, including priority topics for the mitigation of our social and environmental impacts. To this end, we implemented work fronts for actions related to for solid waste, greenhouse gas emissions, road safety, and consumption of energy and water. Among 2012 highlights, we can cite the formalizing of our Corporate Policy on Climate Change and a reduction in traffic fatalities and the internal consumption of water and energy. I would like to take this opportunity to share the progress we have made toward the Global Compact, an initiative by the United Nations to which we became signatories in 2011. At that time, we took on the challenge of putting into practice 10 principles of corporate responsibility, including advocating for human rights and fighting corruption, and of bringing sustainability to the company’s operations. Our actions have shown that CCR is, in fact, committed to the principles of the Compact. We are advancing these issues not only internally with our executives, but also with our external audiences. On CCR Day, an annual meeting with investors, we included sustainability and the Global Compact on the agenda. We have been entering people’s lives for a long time, and that’s why the Global Compact is important in validating our ethical commitment. 2012 also represented the kickoff of our CCR 2020 Project through which we will prepare CCR to become the company we desire by the end of this decade. We envision being a much larger and more diversified company than we are today. A major part of this will still come from highways, but we will have more projects with a focus on urban mobility, passenger transportation, railways, and airports in Brazil and abroad. In most cases, we will not have a controlling interest in the business since we will share governance and management of these new businesses. Our major challenge consists in preparing the company to operate within this new model in order to influence the consortiums in which we will take part and drive our policies, guidelines, and values. For 2013, CCR has important internal projects in the pipeline. After intense development in 2012, the Sustainability Governance Portal will enter operations, representing a system that will automate and centralize all information about the company’s externalities and social and environmental projects. It is expected that this system will allow for better monitoring of CCR’s evolution, as well as provide financial gains. As we consider the scenario, it is our understanding that Brazil will experience more growth than in 2012, favoring an increase in the volume of traffic on the highways. In this sector, we intend to conclude our negotiations with the Grantor to establish amendments to the concession agreements for the Ponte and NovaDutra highways, which will allow for investments and upgrading in these concessions. We also wish to secure new businesses, participating in public bidding in different regions of Brazil. We will continue to seek qualified businesses based on three principles: serve the interest of the Grantor; satisfy the end users of projects; and provide adequate return to our investors, enabling investment solutions and infrastructure services, contributing to the socioeconomic and environmental development of the regions in which it operates. Renato Vale President of the CCR Group 7 ABOUT THE REPORT S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 ABOUT THE REPORT GRI 3.1 | 3.2 | 3.3 | 3.5 | 3.6 | 3.7 | 3.8 | 3.9 | 3.13 | 4.14 | 4.15 | 4.16 | 4.17 With an awareness of the importance that accountability and transparency have on the reputation and prosperity of a business, CCR has—since its creation in 1998—been adopting best governance practices that allow for value creation to shareholders and to society as a whole. This report is instrumental to this transparency and to communication with stakeholders. This year, CCR’s seventh sustainability report follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and also the directives of the integrated report of the International Integrated Report Council (IIRC). CCR has endeavored to execute a report that is both concise and complete—concise enough to facilitate decision-making and complete so that greater detail through references and links to documents and other sources of external information can be obtained. The report follows a narrative style that tells a story with a beginning, middle, and end. Given the market context, the report describes decisions made by company leaders, the main strategies adopted, their operating and business outcomes, and the results obtained. It concludes with an outlook and vision for the future. All quantitative indicators correspond to the period between January 1st and December 31st, 2012 and refer to all business and service units of the CCR Group, with the exception of Controlar, STP, Renovias (companies with less than 50% controlling interest) and the new businesses initiated in 2012: Transolímpica, Barcas, and the airports of Quito, San Jose, and Curaçao. Data concerning these operations were not included given the uncertainty about the quality of the information available. Transolímpica is just starting and Barcas and the airports are in the middle of CCR management adjustment. None of these factors, however, significantly modified the reporting process, nor have any information processes been reported. This year, the report addresses a larger number of indicators as per GRI requirements for Level A+ reporting, and it is assured by a third party Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and submitted to GRI Check. In addition to an online version of the complete report in a tablet-friendly format, the report is also available for smartphones to accommodate investors and shareholders, an online version for employees and other stakeholders, and in versions in downloadable format. All versions are available in three languages: Portuguese, English, and Spanish. The content of this publication was defined based on the guidelines and instructions from “Guidance on Defining Report Content” from GRI, which establishes priority reporting topics as the most relevant aspects to society and the company. The priority sustainability topics for CCR were chosen based on a process initiated in 2010 through which CCR identified its stakeholders and its major economic, social, and environmental impacts resulting from its operations (see figure below). Since 2005 the CCR Group has published its Sustainability Report annually. In 2012, the report was published in June.

The materiality on handling externalities was assessed in 2012, through surveys and interviews with CCR's priority stakeholders: suppliers, shareholders, civil society (represented by sustainability experts), the media, and users. The purpose of this process was the establishment of an interface between the topics that were relevant to the company and the priorities of its stakeholders. The results of this work are represented in the Materiality Matrix (see the figure below) which shows the priority topics for sustainability management at CCR: road safety, traffic jams, waste, greenhouse gas emissions, and consumption of water and energy. This definition was observed in preparing this report, as well as in the selection of the indicators to be addressed.

S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 COMPANY PROFILE MULTIPLE PATHS GRI 2.1 | 2.2 | 2.3 | 2.4 | 2.5 | 2.6 | 2.7 | 2.8 | 2.9 | 4.8 | EC1 Headquartered and operating at São Paulo, and present in Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, Quito, Curaçao, and Costa Rica, the CCR Group employs approximately 8,000 people in Brazil and had net revenues of R$ 5.77 billion over 2012, approximately 12.34% more than in the previous year. The CCR Group is composed of companies working in different sectors, united in the mission of contributing to the social, economic, and environmental development of the region where it operates through investment solutions and infrastructure services. The company is undergoing a cycle of significant growth, having doubled its size in the past seven years, and has aggressive goals for the current decade. Business diversification, corporate governance, financial soundness, and sustainability are the pillars of the company’s evolution. 14 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 Talent for innovation has been an essential part of CCR’s profile since 1998, when the company was founded as an operator of highway concessions. 2002 It became the first company to enter the Novo Mercado, New Market in English, segment of BM&FBOVESPA (São Paulo Stock Exchange) – a demonstration of transparency and leadership in decision-making and relations with the capital markets. The following year, aiming to expand its field of operations in the infrastructure sector, the company began a strategic move toward diversification in business, which guides its work to date. The year 2012 marked CCR’s entry into the airport operation business. The company acquired assets of three international airports, located on the island of Curaçao, in Quito (Ecuador), and in San Jose (Costa Rica). In the city of Rio de Janeiro, the company took over the operation of passenger waterway transportation and signed a contract for the construction and operation of Transolímpica, an expressway that will connect the north zone to the west zone of the city. These investments – which have totaled R$ 15 billion since the creation of CCR – have improved the users’ quality of life in addition to providing economic growth and the creation of jobs in the areas served. Meanwhile, the company has structured itself for growth, with profitable businesses, good relationships, and responsibility. Plans for the future are bold and based on realistic assumptions. CCR intends to maintain investments to improve its current portfolio and seek new businesses, provided they qualify in terms of profitability and sustainability. In the short term, one of the possibilities to be analyzed is working in logistic services, an activity that complements the operation of highways. For more details on plans for the future, see the section Future Vision or see the Financial Statements Report . 15 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 CCR’S MILESTONES Creation of Companhia de Concessões Rodoviárias (Highway Concession 1998 Company CCR) based on the association of concessionaires.

S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY At the end of 2011, CCR had positive expectations regarding the business environment and the Brazilian economy for the shortand long-term. It was anticipated that the infrastructure sector in the country would require a great deal of investment. It was also understood, however, that this scenario would impose growing demands of a Social and environmental nature. Growth in the volume of traffic on highways indicates a trend toward increased accidents and traffic jams, while climate change, waste generation, and the consumption of water and energy are also aspects of growing importance in the general context. Looking at this scenario, CCR Group’s Board of Directors developed a General Business Plan for the 2012-2016 five-year period. This document defined two strategic objectives: to guarantee a significant increase in EBITDA and to “enable the perpetuity of the business, supported by the company's differentiated competence in communicating with its stakeholders .” 24 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 In 2012, CCR Group’s strategies were to maximize the profitability of its business portfolio and to develop opportunities in activities associated with its core business—the concession of highways. Optimizing administration of its businesses should result in synergy, with a positive impact on operating margins. Concerning sustainability governance, the significance of its main externalities— highway safety, traffic jams, greenhouse gas emissions, waste, and consumption of water and energy—was validated through consultations made with representatives of our stakeholders. CCR’s management maintained these externalities as a priority in its operations. Expectations for 2012, in general terms, were met. Despite the fact that the Brazilian economy grew less than was forecast, the company’s business units achieved operating and financial results in line with our goals. The year was marked by the beginning of CCR’s operations in the airport segment with the acquisition of assets in three international airports, located on the island of Curaçao, in Quito (Ecuador), and in San Jose (Costa Rica). In the city of Rio de Janeiro, the company took over operations in the waterway passenger transportation system and executed an agreement for the construction and operation of Transolímpica, a thruway corridor that will interconnect the north side of the city to the west side. In terms of operations, CCR maintained its continuous quest for more efficiency, effectiveness, and excellence in the management of its tangible and intangible assets. This work involved a series of efforts such as cost reduction, operating improvement, expansion of the client base, and the development of new businesses. 25 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 In 2012, the main advancement in sustainability governance was the creation of the Corporate Policy on Climate Change, which sets forth the company’s commitment to participate in the global effort to stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. Stemming from this new policy is the development of a new proposal for a mitigation plan and the adaptation of the CCR Group to a low-carbon economy, to be implemented in 2014. Among the many challenges of 2012, the most important was the difficulty in complying with the investment goals for highways, especially due to the sluggish environmental licensing procedures. Additionally, we were not able to obtain an amendment to the concession agreements for NovaDutra and Ponte Rio-Niterói, forecast for this year. As the year continues, CCR will keep the focus on the operational optimization of its business units and on the development of new opportunities, including participation in new bidding processes for highways, airports, and urban mobility projects in Brazil and abroad. Management of sustainability issues, in turn, should gain new impetus. A computerized system will enter into operation, and will be continuously fed with information and evidence of all the company's sustainability actions and social, cultural, and environmental projects. 26 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 Throughout its history, the company has never before experienced a period with so many projects, opportunities, and challenges. The results we achieved and the recognition we received confirm the efficacy of our strategy and CCR's competence in its successful quest for its mission, such as the surveys carried out by Instituto Datafolha regarding user satisfaction and the assessment by the Confederação Nacional dos Transportes of the best highways in Brazil. In a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group (commissioned by Exame magazine) of all Brazilian companies listed in the stock exchange between December 2003 and December 2011, CCR ranked second for best remuneration to its shareholders. In 2012, the company’s performance was similar. As shown in another study carried out by BMF&BOVESPA, CCR is the company with the best performance among those listed in BMF&BOVESPA’s Corporate Sustainability Index. In analyzing the period between February 2012 and January 2013, the ISE had an appreciation of + 14.55%, while the Ibovespa index devaluated by 5.25%, and of the 51 companies listed in the ISE, 31 obtained positive returns, the most significant being CCR S/A ON (+ 74.78%). +14.55% appreciation ISE FEBRUARY 2012 TO JANUARY 2013 ISE CCR S/A ON +74.78% appreciation CCR03 These gains were achieved in all areas of capital: Financial capital through cost reduction, generation of revenue, and value added; Social capital through local development, social inclusion, education, health, culture, and sports; Human capital through training, qualiﬁcations, quality of life, innovation, and personal achievements; Natural capital through the reduction of pollution and natural systems deterioration. For the long-term, the company initiated the implementation of Project 2020 aiming to prepare it for the opportunities and challenges to come in this period. CCR intends to become, by the end of the decade, a large corporation with diversified businesses and with the objective of decisively contributing to the sustainable development of the infrastructure sector. 27 BUSINESS SCENARIO Since 2012, a series of factors has indicated a scenario of great demand for infrastructure projects. S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 BUSINESS SCENARIO FAVORABLE WINDS At the end of 2011, CCR had positive expectations for the business environment and the Brazilian economy; at that time, its operations were restricted to the domestic market. Projections indicated recovery in the level of economic activity in the country, with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growing by 4% in 2012. This factor would promote traffic on the highways under its concession for both lightweight vehicles (due to increased incomes and low unemployment rates) and commercial vehicles transporting industrial and agricultural cargoes. Additionally, there was an expectation for greater demand for urban mobility and airline and railroad transportation. At the same time, the federal government was attempting to strengthen the second phase of the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC 2, in the Brazilian acronym), launched in 2010 forecasting R$ 1.59 trillion in investments in highways, urban mobility, railways, and airports. PAC 2 was an opportunity for the public and private sectors to join forces to face Brazil’s huge infrastructure deficit, still considered one of the major obstacles for sustainable growth in Brazil. The country’s continental dimensions, associated with the precarious conditions for the distribution of its agricultural and industrial production, are important factors in forming the so-called “cost Brazil,” which reduces the country’s economic competitiveness in the global market. 29 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 Another factor drove expectations for 2012: Brazil’s efforts to prepare to host the FIFA World Cup, which will be held in 12 cities in the country in 2014, and the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. These two major global sporting events come with a series of investments in urban mobility and hotel, tourism, airport, and highway infrastructure. On one hand, economic perspectives indicated several business opportunities; on the other hand, the scenario imposed growing demands and challenges of a social and environmental nature which, in turn, increased the need for improvement in highway infrastructure. One example of this is highway safety. According to statistics from the United Nations (UN), approximately 1.3 million people die each year as a result of traffic accidents worldwide. In Brazil, the situation is also critical, with approximately 42,000 deaths per year occurring on our roads and highways. To address the problem, the country became a signatory of the UN resolution that defined the period from 2011 to 2020 as the “Decade of Action for Road Safety. Brazil’s commitment is to reduce the number of accidents by 50% by the end of the decade. In the environmental arena, a topic that has increasingly gained attention in the social agenda is climate change, a phenomenon associated with global warming caused by human activities, according to a major portion of the global scientific community. Studies indicate that excess emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide released by automotive vehicles, is one of the major causes for the increase in the average global temperature. 30 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 This is also a relevant issue in Brazil. Among other consequences, the significant increase in the number of trucks, cars, and motorcycles traveling the country has increased the number of traffic jams in recent years. Slow traffic, in addition to further increasing atmospheric pollution, results in significant economic losses and discomfort to users of roads and highways. This situation has led to the strengthening of alternative modes of transportation, such as the subway in cities and STRENGTHENING OF railroads to connect cities and states, in addition to promoting collective ALTERNATIVE MODES transportation projects. Waste and biodiversity represent other material environmental aspects for CCR’s operations. In 2010, the new National Waste Management Policy was enacted, requiring that by 2014 companies implement the adequate disposal of their materials. Protection of biodiversity, on the other hand, makes environmental licensing of infrastructure projects increasingly stringent and lengthy processes, imposing on companies of the sector the need to better understand the impacts of their activities. ADEQUATE DISPOSAL OF SOLID WASTE 2012-2016 STRATEGIC PLAN In September 2011, when the company put together its strategic plan for the 2012-2016 five-year plan, CCR decided that the country’s economic scenario would lead to a greater demand for infrastructure projects in the 2011 coming years, in addition to imposing the challenge of addressing its social and environmental demands. Analyzing this scenario and the associated opportunities and threats (see table) the Board of Directors of the CCR Group defined the Company’s Strategic Objectives described in section “Corporate Governance.” 31 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS OF THE 2012-2016 SCENARIO Identiﬁed by the Board of Directors of the CCR Group in September 2011 OPPORTUNITIES THREATS • Infrastructure boom in Brazil, given • Supply of assets with little attractiveimportant and urgent “bottlenecks”. ness to investors, although considered adequate to the Grantor, hindering • Long-term strategic plan definitions attractive returns and development of and priorities for the next five to ten years new business niches. expanding the scope of new areas of operation. • Lack of consensus between the Grantor and the concessionaires on the • Capability of adapting the organization inclusion of new investments in the in light of the challenges. current portfolio. • Major sustainability challenges in Brazil • Agreements with defined terms. in the areas of road safety, mobility, regional economic development, identify• Commercial risks arising from the ing and valuating intangible assets. possible investment boom. • Inclusion of new investments to its • Increase in regulatory risk. current portfolio. 32 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GOVERNANCE CONSIDERS RISKS AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FROM A SUSTAINABILITY STANDPOINT.

In the 2011 strategic planning cycle, analyzing the business environment and the economic, social, and environmental situation, the Board of Directors indicated the direction to be followed by CCR, defined in its Master Business Plan for the 2012-2016 five-year period, as follows: MAIN STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES FOR THE CCR GROUP 1 SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF EBITDA:� increase of EBITDA with focus on diversification, though with 70% of the result in highway concessions. 2 ENABLE BUSINESS PERPETUITY SUPPORTED BY DIFFERENTIATING COMPETENCIES IN RELATIONSHIPS: integrating stakeholders promoting sustainable growth through diversification continuously enhancing governance developing skills for entrepreneurship 34 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 ...WHILE OBSERVING THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES: strengthening Planning and Strategic Management as instrumental tools for growth within the values and beliefs of the group train and develop people, aiming to proceed with the group's growth process through the development of its employees identify and submit to the Grantor new investments that may be added to concession agreements, aiming at the improvement of road conditions lead strategy toward maximizing profitability for new investments (current and new businesses) ensure agreed-upon results and enable corporate safety consolidate sustainability as an integral part of value creation and of the evaluation process of results ...without losing track of the foundations of the Central Ideology and ensuring the perpetuity of the CCR Group. PERFORMANCE OF THE BOARD “NO DECISION IS TAKEN BY VOTE, ONLY BY CONSENSUS, WITH CORDIALITY, CONVERGING THROUGH THE SAME PRINCIPLES. IT IS HARD TO FIND A COMMITTEE AND STAKEHOLDERS SO ALIGNED, THAT IS A VERY POSITIVE CONSEQUENCE OF THE WHOLE WORK.” (ANA PENIDO – CCR GROUP BOARD PRESIDENT) The current growth and business diversification cycle is a result of the strategic positioning defined by the Board of Directors a few years ago. 2012 marked CCR’s debut in the airport infrastructure sector and the increase in institutional relationships, participating in governmental interests in the analysis of infrastructure bottlenecks. Having understood that it is necessary to provide governance with an attentive eye on the impacts, risks, and opportunities resulting from sustainability, the Board decided to create a long-term Corporate Sustainability Program in 2010, divided into three phases: 1 2 3 Identification of the level Engagement of its employees; Improvement of communicaof maturity of CCR and development and consolidation and generation of value its operations in relation tion of initiatives to mitigate for the company with its staketo social and environimpacts; and guidelines, goals, holders, based on improvemental issues and objectives for short, ments and processes implemedium, and long terms assomented for sustainability ciated with its critical issues 35 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 In 2011, sustainability became a part of the General Objectives and Guidelines (OGD, in the Brazilian acronym) which define CCR’s strategies for the current year. Also in 2011, the company adhered to the United Nations’ Global Compact, identified its main externalities, which represent its most relevant responsibilities and priority opportunities of a social and environmental nature (see more details in section, Management means Sustainability), and adjusted its governance structure to address the issue of sustainability. See details of the adjustments to CCR’s governance model below. In 2012, the most important development in CCR’s sustainability governance was the adoption of its Corporate Policy on Climate Change, which consolidates the company’s commitment to participate in the global effort to stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. Among the results stemming from the adoption of the new policy is the development of a proposed mitigation plan and adaptation of the CCR Group to a low-carbon economy, to be implemented in 2014. GOVERNANCE MODEL Since its creation, CCR has stood out through its pioneering spirit in the adoption of best practices in corporate governance. In 2002, it became the first company to integrate BM&FBOVESPA (São Paulo Stock Exchange) Novo Mercado, the most demanding segment in Brazil’s capital market. The group was also the first in the country to create a Governance Committee which is responsible for, among other things, contributions in the formation and evaluation of the Board of Directors. These initiatives, associated with other distinctions, led the organization to be a part of the ISE, IBrX-50, IBrX-100, and MSCI Latin America indices and achieve, in 2012, an average daily trading volume in the São Paulo Stock Exchange of approximately R$ 67.1 million. Some of the best practices adopted by CCR are: 36 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 Shareholders with controlling interest have equal participation; there is no veto and/or single approval by any of them. As a publicly traded company integrating Novo Mercado, it regularly informs BM&FBOVESPA of all its agreements with other parties. The Investment Plan is previously approved for each of its businesses. Its Investments are financed by third parties who consistently investigate prices and execution through engineers and independent auditors. Company administration is professional and independent from controlling shareholders. The governance model is designed to promote balance and equal opportunities during decisionmaking processes. As shown in the diagram below, all decisions are made by a collegiate body, with the participation of the Board of Directors, the committees, and the Executive Board (more details on Reference Form, item 12.1 2012 Description of the Administrative Framework of the Reference Form, and in the Financial Statements). One example of this practice is the election and replacement of key positions in the company. Those who nominate a name do not confirm or approve the proposed nomination. This format allows the Executive Board and members of the Board of Directors to be supportive of decisions made. • Analyze DIR proposals that require a decision from CAD COMMITTEES • Facilitate analysis by CAD in matters of their expertise • Provide opinions on proposals by CAD EXECUTIVE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (CAD) PROPOSALS BOARD (DIR) In cases of possible conflicts of interest, the Company’s Shareholder Agreement provides that shareholders with controlling interest involved must refrain from voting in the meetings, as well as any members appointed by such shareholders to the Board of Directors. All agreements with related parties in amounts in excess of R$ 1 million, or any other agreements executed with third parties that exceed R$ 10 million, require approval from this body (more details in Shareholders Agreement Interests Conflicts, section 5.7 and 5.7.1). 37 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 An example of this procedure adopted by CCR occurred when the company was entering the airport infrastructure sector. The creation of an independent committee responsible for the analysis of the acquisition of these assets ensured a fair and transparent process. This committee was formed by one administrator chosen by all members of the Board of Directors, one independent advisor from the Board of Directors, and two non-administrating third parties chosen by the other two members. In the General Assembly Meeting, held on January 16, 2012, the company shareholders approved the addendum to CCR’s corporate purpose, allowing CCR to operate in this new sector. Operations in airports, as well as the operation of Transolímpica, Renovias, Controlar, ViaQuatro, RodoAnel, and RodoNorte, follow a model in which CCR shares governance and management with other partners, imposing an additional challenge pertaining to the convergence of interests. Committees are being created, composed of advisors from different partners, to manage each of the new companies. The first step in adjusting the sustainability governance structure was the creation of the Strategy and Sustainability Committee, composed of advisors, whose role is to support top management in developing and implementing sustainable principles and practices. At the corporate level, the Sustainability Executive Committee, formed by the president, vicepresident, and certain leaders, proposes guidelines based on strategies defined by top management. It is this group’s responsibility to further identify opportunities and threats to the company’s businesses. In the Business Units, there are sustainability committees formed by their presidents and the Finance, Environmental, and Personnel Management Departments, in addition to the heads of other areas such as the Legal, Agreement Management, and Communications Departments. These committees are responsible for developing and putting into the practice action plans that contain the company’s processes with a focus on sustainability. The results are analyzed at the end of the year by the Sustainability Executive Committee. All these groups meet on a monthly basis seeking to integrate the social and environmental issues into the strategies and decision-making processes of the Group.

Communication of relevant information follows the norms set forth by the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (Comissão de Valores Mobiliários CVM), see below. To better learn about CCR’s governance model, its policies, and governance documents, visit the website www.grupoccr.com.br/investidores. INVESTOR RELATIONS CCR seeks to maintain an open, transparent, and systematic relationship with the capital market, including potential investors and its shareholders. As a publicly traded company, CCR maintains a program of meetings for the communication of relevant facts and other information which may influence investment decisions. The decisions are registered in minutes and made available for consultation on CCR's website. To view the minutes of the investor relations meetings, visit Minutes of Meetings and Meetings at www.grupoccr.com.br/investidores. Shareholders have the opportunity to communicate demands and make recommendations to top management through this same channel. DIVIDENDS CCR's policy is to distribute annually at least 50% of the adjusted net profit as dividends, provided its economic-financial situation is guaranteed. The company seeks to make payments every six months. In 2012, dividends were distributed on two separate dates. On April 27, payment of complementary dividends was made pertaining to the 2011 fiscal period, totaling R$ 100.8 million, corresponding to approximately R$ 0.06 per share. On October 31, intermediary dividends were paid pertaining to the 2012 fiscal period, totaling R$ 953.4 million, corresponding to R$ 0.54 per share and approximately 80% of adjusted net income. For more information on Payment of Dividends see Financial Statements Explanatory Note number 26 item D. REMUNERATION The remuneration policy is one of CCR’s strategies that aims to attract, retain, and integrate the best professionals in the market. In the Board of Directors and in the Audit Committee, remuneration is fixed. Among the directors, the focus on corporate results is stimulated through the sharing of gains obtained through achieving or exceeding goals, complementing salaries. In 2011, for the first time, a sustainability criterion was part of the variable remuneration of the main directors— the company’s return to the Corporate Sustainability Index (Índice de Sustentabilidade Empresarial ISE), of BM&FBOVESPA. In 20012, in addition to ISE, other criteria associated with this matter were incorporated to the variable remuneration goals, such as water and energy consumption and improvement in road safety. The idea for the coming years is for all employees to have goals associated with this matter, with an impact on remuneration. For more information, see Financial Statements Explanatory Note number 14, item C. In the next section, we will present the strategies implemented by the Executive Board to comply with the General Objectives and Guidelines determined by the Board of Directors. 39 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE CCR's top management is composed of: • BOARD OF DIRECTORS • EXECUTIVE BOARD • AUDIT COMMITTEE • SIX COMMITTEES The Board of Directors, the committees, the CEO, and the secretary of the board are annually evaluated by the Governance Committee, through questionnaires that translate the practices foreseen in the statement of principles for the operation of the Board of Directors. The other directors are annually evaluated by the CEO, whose objective is to analyze the performance of their roles and the achievement of goals. BOARD OF DIRECTORS The Board of Directors is responsible for the definition of general strategic policies and, among other assignments, for establishing general policies and guidelines, for electing directors, and monitoring their management. Composed of ten effective members, two of whom are independent members, the board meets regularly on a weekly basis and also whenever necessary to the social interests of the company. These additional meetings may be convened by any of its members. Independent Members BOARD Effective members Each controlling group is entitled to assign three effective members and their respective deputies to the Board, as per the Shareholder Agreement in force.

Any shareholder or group of shareholders holding at least 5% of CCR’s social capital may request information from the Audit Committee. The group is not subordinated or bound to any other administrative body, and the election of its members occurs in the General Shareholders Meeting. AUDIT COMMITTEE For more information on CCR Group's Boards and the Executive Board, visit www.grupoccr.com.br/investidores page Executive Boards and Boards. In the next section, you will see the strategies adopted by the Executive Board to meet Strategic Objectives and Guidelines established by the Board of Directors. 42 STRATEGY QUALIFIED GROWTH The main goals for 2012 were to maximize results of the businesses under management and to operate in new activities. S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 STRATEGY GRI EC2 In the company’s strategic planning cycle, each year the Executive Board reviews its main strategies for the following year, taking into account the current scenario (see more details in the Business Scenario section) and the long-term guidelines defined by the Board of Directors, which are represented in the Strategic Objectives for the CCR Group (see more details in the Corporate Governance section). Group CCR’s strategies for 2012 consisted of maximizing profitability of its business portfolio and developing opportunities in activities associated with its core business, the concession of highways. Growth would be based on the disciplined capital investments, with potential yield having precedence over expansion as an objective. Optimal administration of its set of businesses should result in leveraging synergies with positive effects on operating margins (see the materialization of these expectations in the Results section). 44 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 In the highway administration area, CCR's successful experiences in the search for which accounts for the largest portion diversification, represented by companies like of the company's revenue, the first ViaQuatro (Line 4-Yellow of the São Paulo strategy was the negotiation for subway), Controlar (vehicle emissions inspecenhancement of public services tion in the city of São Paulo), STP (the Sem Parar, Via Fácil, and Onda Livre automated through new investments.

In terms of cost avoidance and reduction and to protect value, CCR manages social and environmental risks by handling and monitoring its main externalities and its relationships with its key stakeholders (read more on CCR's website, item Strategy for Sustainability). In 2012, the main externalities road safety, traffic jams, greenhouse gas emissions, waste, and water and energy consumption were validated in relation to their relevance to the company's business through interviews with representatives of the key stakeholders (read more in section About this Report). Regulatory risks—such as the enactment of new Brazilian laws concerning climate change and solid waste—were identified by the Board of Directors, which to the launch of action plans to prepare CCR Group's business units for this new environmental context (read more under Natural Capital Management). The acquisition of equity interest in Controlar, in which the company holds 45% of the social capital (50% of shares with voting rights), represented a business opportunity identified by the CCR Group, approved by the Board, and directly associated with air quality and the issue of emissions. The company is responsible for the inspection of vehicles in the city of São Paulo (read more under Management, Natural Capital). 46 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 STP, a company in which the CCR Group holds a 38.25% interest, operates the electronic system Sem Parar/Via Fácil, present in the parking lots of several shopping malls and airports and in the automated collection of tolls. This company exemplifies the materialization of a business opportunity identified by CCR to provide new technology to users aiming to reduce traffic jams and emissions. SAMM, in turn, is a fiber optic company created by the CCR Group in 2010 which represents another example of new business opportunities identified that take into account the trends stemming from climate change and the growing use of home offices, teleconferencing, and other alternatives to on-site work. The three companies have fulfilled expectations in terms of financial yield and contribute to CCR Group's good performance (read more under Results). The following section describes how CCR implemented its strategies and action plans focusing on financial, social, human, and natural gains. 47 MANAGEMENT A YEAR OF QUALIFIED GROWTH CCR secures new businesses and advances in the management of companies in its portfolio as it presses forward in the treatment of its externalities. S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 MANAGEMENT A YEAR OF QUALIFIED GROWTH For CCR, 2012 was marked by growth. Never before in its history has the company experienced a period with so many projects, opportunities, and challenges. Two main aspects were addressed in the administration of CCR Group’s activities. The first was the implementation of strategies defined for the year (read more under Strategy), which in turn came from the General Objectives and Guidelines defined by the Board of Directors (read more under Corporate Governance). The second, complementing this work, was a series of efforts to prepare the company for the coming years (read more about CCR's perspectives under Future Vision). From an operating standpoint, the company proceeded with its continuous search for improved efficiency. This work encompassed a series of efforts such as cost reduction, operating improvement, expansion of the user base and the development of new businesses. Good performance in these areas, combined with successful financial management (read more under Management, Financial Capital), led CCR to financial results aligned with the expectations for 2012 (read more in the Results section). MORE AGILITY AND STRATEGIC FOCUS In 2012, CCR implemented a new planning cycle that provided greater autonomy to its business units, more agility in facing new scenarios, and greater focus on strategic issues. 49 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 THE COMPANY BEGAN COMPARING TO A GREATER DEGREE WHAT HAD BEEN FORESEEN IN THE BUDGET TO WHAT EFFECTIVELY TOOK PLACE, ENABLING COURSE ADJUSTMENTSTHROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AND NOT ONLY IN THE ANNUAL STRATEGIC PLANNING.

Businesses already in operation have received investments and should reflect MANAGEMENT MEANS SUSTAINABILITY GRI PR1 | SO9 | SO10 At the end of 2011, while analyzing the current and future scenarios, CCR’s Board of Directors decided that “consolidating sustainability as an integral part of value generation and of the evaluation process of results” would become one of the strategic guidelines of the company. This stems from the understanding that managing sustainability will become increasingly important in the business environment, and can decisively contribute to the reduction of risks and to the development of opportunities. As early as 2010, CCR’s Corporate Sustainability Program had already been created with the mission of structuring of sustainability within the company. The first important step taken was the identification of the company’s externalities, which occurred in 2011. This concept encompasses the effects or impacts of the operations or activities of a business upon individuals, communities, or the environment. In CCR’s case, the priority externalities are: • ROAD SAFETY (HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE SERVICES), • TRAFFIC JAMS, • GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, • WASTE, • CONSUMPTION OF WATER AND ENERGY. 50 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 In 2012, the significance of these externalities was validated by representatives of the company’s strategic stakeholders (read more in the About the Report section). Management of sustainability through the work of the sustainability committees in the business units resulted in a series of actions aiming to minimize adverse impacts stemming from these externalities. This work generated results throughout the year, such as: reduced water and energy consumption improved waste management reduced accidents and trafﬁc jams in the businesses under CCR concession (read more in the Results section) Our relationship with communities in the vicinity of our operations is also included in this context. Through dialogue established with authorities and local leadership, CCR Group has, since its creation, been conducting social projects that contribute to the mitigation of impacts in areas such as health, environment, safety, and traffic education (read more under Social Capital). Concerning the employees, our greatest achievement for the year was the creation of Projeto Reconhecer (Recognition Project) through which the analysis staff had its individual goals associated with the General Objectives and Guidelines, including the criteria on sustainability. Training of the new business team on sustainability issues should also be highlighted. We expect that preparing professionals dedicated to new projects will add value to the business through the identification of risks and opportunities associated with social and environmental aspects. The company’s approach to these topics also reached its shareholders and potential investors through their inclusion in the agenda for CCR Day and other meetings with professionals from capital markets. 51 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 The year was also marked by the development of the Sustainability Governance Portal, which is a software program that centralizes sustainability management information for the CCR Group. The new tool enhances the implementation and monitoring of projects in addition to providing agility and more reliability to accountability processes, including the preparation of the Sustainability Report and the answers to the questionnaires on BM&FBOVEPA’s Corporate Sustainability Index, Guia Exame de Sustentabilidade, and the Carbon Disclosure Project. The sistem had its first module finished in the second half of 2012, and started operating in the beginning of 2013. FINANCIAL CAPITAL CCR’s management of financial capital follows strict guidelines that protect the company from risks intrinsic to the nature of this activity (read more under Financial Statements Report Explanatory Note number 7 Financial Risk Management) and allow for qualified growth aimed at generating value for all its strategic stakeholders. One of the factors that contributed to the financial results obtained in 2012 (read more under Financial Statements) was the focus that business units placed on cost control, including areas such as energy and water consumption, which was reduced throughout the year (read more under Results). Additionally, this work proved to be important given the investment the company made in organizing and integrating new businesses acquired during that year. Another highlight in the management of financial capital was the creation of a working group aimed at maintaining the CCR Group listed on BM&FBOVESPA’s Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE). Being listed in the ISE has had a positive impact on the company’s reputation by providing recognition for best corporate governance and sustainability practices and providing the company access to special financing and investment terms in the market. In November 2012, CCR was listed for the second consecutive year in the ISE and is one of 37 companies in the 2012/2013 portfolio. See CCR’s questionnaire on BM&FBOVESPA’s website (www.bmfbovespa. com.br/indices/ResumoIndice). HUMAN CAPITAL With the integration of new businesses acquired in 2012, CCR’s team totaled 8,000 employees at the close of the year. The Directors of the Corporate Center are responsible for developing strategies and for the application of key initiatives in personnel management, supported by managers working in the business units. 8,000 EMPLOYEES 52 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 “To train and develop people seeking to proceed with the Group’s expansion process through continuous development of its workforce” represents one of the company’s strategic guidelines. Human capital management involving all employees is considered to be critical in giving CCR a competitive edge, and for that reason it is at the heart of one of the fronts of the Project 2020, initiated in 2012 to set the foundations of the future we envision for the end of this decade. Project 2020 was structured on four fronts: people, management, new businesses, and optimization of operations. In the personnel area, we are already preparing our executives for this multifaceted operation. In 2012, 250 employees took part in a training course that focused on this general vision of the company. In terms of new businesses, we expanded our team and enhanced the institutional relationship to bring CCR closer to the decision centers. We will also have a team dedicated to the study and development of opportunities abroad. (Read more in the Future Vision section.) The Leadership Development Program (PDL), conducted in partnership with Fundação Dom Cabral (a standard-setting institution in this area), represents one of the main aspects of this work. PDL follows the model of corporate universities in which employees are trained within the company’s area of knowledge. The first step is providing leaders with a general view of CCR and an understanding of the routines in areas other than their own. Another activity carried out throughout the year was a diagnosis of the abilities of these professionals, and this diagnosis will be the basis for an individual development plan starting in 2013. Employee development has a lot to do with the challenge of attracting and retaining the best talents. While the 2012 market was not as active in this area as in previous years, the company maintained its investments in Internship Programs as one form of recruiting professionals to occupy leadership positions in the company. In 2012, fourteen trainees were prepared through our program. These initiatives led CCR to be chosen in 2012, for the first time, as one of the best companies to work for in Brazil and to be recognized at an event held by the Great Places to Work Institute, in partnership with Época magazine. 53 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 SOCIAL CAPITAL GRI 4.13 | PR5 | SO1 | EC8 | EN26 Relationship management with external audiences, especially users of services and members of the communities surrounding the operations, is considered critical to CCR’s sustained evolution. Among the company’s externalities (read more under the introduction to Management Means Sustainability), two of them are directly related to these stakeholders: ROADWAY SAFETY AND TRAFFIC JAMS CCR Group defined road safety as one of the priorities in its management because it has to do with saving lives. In addition to implementing the program Estrada para a Cidadania (Road to Citizenship) in all roads under its administration (read more under Social and Environmental Projects), the company put in place a series of initiatives aimed at avoiding accidents. In 2012, there were investments in the following initiatives: improved traffic signs; educational campaigns for users; construction of pedestrian flyovers; erection of animal protective nets; and employee training. Traffic jams adversely affect users, causing economic losses, bringing disruption to surrounding communities, and increasing the levels of greenhouse gas emissions. CCR’s most effective action in reducing traffic jams is to carry out work expanding and repairing roads (read more in the Results section). In 2012, the deployment of noise barriers on RodoAnel (São Paulo’s Outer Ring) that reduce the noise generated by traffic also aimed to reduce the negative impact of its operations on people’s lives. 54 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 Another area where CCR focused its efforts was on communication with users. New websites for the concession companies will go live in 2013 to improve our communication and services to users. The company decided, however, not to operate on social networks, since the framework of our concession agreements does not allow for this type of interaction. Nevertheless, in order to acknowledge the importance of this topic, an internal policy was developed to guide employees on how to conduct themselves on social networks. In order to measure the level of satisfaction of users and the reputation of the CCR brand, regular surveys are conducted by Instituto Datafolha (see satisfaction indices in the Results and Indicators section). In the 2012 CNT Highway Survey conducted by Confederação Nacional do Transporte, highways under concession of the CCR Group ranked among the best in Brazil. Bandeirantes Highway (SP-348), under the administration of CCR AutoBAn, was chosen as the best highway in Brazil (see ranking under Results). SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS CCR’s investments in social, cultural, and environmental projects are in line with the Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, published in 2006, and are directly associated with the company’s commitment to contribute to the sustainable development of society. Throughout 2012, about R$ 25 million were invested in social and environmental projects. Most of these resources came from tax incentives, such as the Rouanet Act, the Sports Act, and other specific funds. The year marked a significant increase in the volume of projects and resources invested. Furthermore, the diversification of our businesses and markets serves as a challenge to CCR, which needs to monitor this movement in its social and environmental projects. Project Estrada Sustentável (Sustainable Road) is among the highlights in 2012; it was launched during Rio+20 and aims to turn the Presidente Dutra Highway into a benchmark for other Brazilian highways, through the generation of a collaborative network composed of multiple stakeholders committed to sustainable development. The Project has seven work fronts, namely: Road Safety, Education, Waste, Mobility, Health and Food Safety, Green Infrastructure, and Local Entrepreneurship. It faces the challenge of integrating society, companies, the third sector, governments, and public agencies into a single platform, in which all can engage to develop sustainable practices for the development of the main connection between two most important economies in Brazil: Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.

In 2012, the company consolidated its management actions aiming to mitigate impacts in these areas. In relation to waste, a Waste Management Plan started to be prepared for each business unit of the Group. A Normative Instruction for the disposal of Information Technology waste was formalized along with campaigns to raise the awareness of employees about these issues. In the highways, a series of initiatives aiming to avoid waste generation was held, such as the use of environmentally friendly asphalt, which is a type of pavement with increased durability, and the use of recycled asphalt in new paving operations. In the Anhanguera Bandeirantes Complex AutoBAn alone, approximately 1,360,000 m2 of asphalt pavements were recovered, avoiding the disposal of at least 98,000 used tires. In RodoNorte and in NovaDutra, 10,010.34 m³ and 14,601.91 m³ were paved utilizing used tires, respectively. 56 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 Moreover, an agreement was executed with the city authorities, involving the receipt of demolition materials and their reuse in the work conducted in public roads. Approximately 1,550m³ were reused as foundation of road pavements. 2012 will also be marked by the company’s advances in the management of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), especially with the publication of its Corporate Policy on Climate Change. Through this document, CCR formalizes its commitment to participate in the global effort to stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and CCR's transition to a low-carbon economy. Among the main guidelines of this policy are the following: 1 to include this commitment as a strategic guideline in the decision-making process for investments; 2 to annually determine and disclose its inventory of greenhouse gas emissions; 3 to involve its entire value chain in the discussions about this topic. In order to identify the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions associated with its operations, in 2012, for the second consecutive year, CCR conducted its inventory. This time, there was an expansion in the scope of the survey, which also began to consider the following aspects: generators; logistics of materials; logistics of personnel; air travel; raw materials; maintenance and conservation services; subcontracted fleets; solid waste; and effluents. Among the actions already in place for the reduction of GHGs is the use of warm asphalt, a pavement process in which the temperature used in the asphalt mixing plant is significantly reduced. In terms of energy consumption, the concession companies implemented several initiatives to achieve reductions. ViaQuatro, for example, made adjustments in the scheduling of trains according to passenger demand. In 2012, on the highways, conventional light bulbs were replaced with the more economical LED lights and with light bulbs of lower consumption. Furthermore, campaigns promoting conscientious consumption and modernization of air conditioners were also carried out. 57 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 The management of impacts in the areas affected by the operation of highways or the implementation of road-related infrastructure (expansions and improvements) is done through various programs and environmental control instructions, in conjunction with a program to monitor the environmental performance of the activities, which especially aim to minimize the impacts with proactive and preventive actions.

S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 RESULTS AND INDICATORS As reported in the section on Performance Scenarios, the start of 2012 found CCR with a positive outlook on the macroeconomic scenario in Brazil, expecting a 4% increase in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The country, however, posted a significantly smaller increase, approximately 0.9%. The industrial sector also performed below expectations. On the other hand, certain indicators posted significant results: the unemployment rate decreased, and both the average income of workers and agricultural production increased. All these factors have a direct influence on the demand for the services provided by the Group. The strong performance of the economy, for example, directly affects the traffic of light and heavy vehicles on the roads and of passengers in airports and public transportation. At CCR, the diversified profile of the highways under concession contributed to reduced volatility in revenue. While certain highways had their volume of traffic affected by reduced industrial activity, tourist regions and those responsible for the flow of agricultural products benefited from increased activities. The regulatory environment also had a direct impact upon activities. In the area of highway concessions, there was difficulty in achieving the goal for investments due to the lengthy environmental licensing process. Additionally, the ongoing negotiations with the Grantor for possible new investments in highways NovaDutra and Ponte Rio-Niteroi have not yet been completed. It is expected that an agreement will be reached in 2013, allowing the company to invest in improvements on these highways. In new bidding processes, the policy of maintaining capital discipline was paramount in the formulation of CCR's proposals that were not awarded bids. 60 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 NEW BUSINESSES In 2012, CCR took important steps in its diversiﬁcation and qualiﬁed growth strategy. First, the implementation of SAMM was completed—a company in the group dedicated to high-speed data transmission through optical ﬁber installed alongside the highway (backbone). Additionally, the company closed ﬁve important deals. In April, CCR executed a concession agreement for the implementation, operation, maintenance, monitoring, conservation, and improvement of Transolímpica for a period of 35 years. The project consists of road structure and mass transportation (BRT) interconnecting the district of Recreio dos Bandeirantes to district of Deodoro, on Rio de Janeiro’s west side. (for more details see the website www.g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/cidade/rio-de-janeiro.html). In July, the company ﬁnalized the acquisition of 80% shareholding interest in Barcas S.A. – Transportes Marítimos, which operates the passenger ferryboat service between Niterói and Rio de Janeiro. The concession for its operation extends to 2023, with a possibility of extension for an additional 25 years. These two projects represent CCR Group’s sequence of investments in urban mobility, which is an area with huge growth potential in Brazil for the coming decades, further expanded by Brazil’s hosting of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games. ViaQuatro, which operates Line 4-Yellow of the São Paulo subway, and STP, which operates in the electronic payment of tolls and parking, were already included in CCR Group's portfolio. The Barcas operation and the future Transolímpica have great synergy with two highways under CCR’s administration—Ponte Rio-Niterói and NovaDutra—and with two other projects that interest the company. These projects, expected to be in the bidding process for 2013, are: Veículo Leve sobre Trilhos –VLT (Lightweight Vehicles on Rails), which will interconnect the port area to the city’s ﬁnancial center and to the Santos Dumont Airport; and the subway connection between Niterói and São Gonçalo, Line 3. In the two quarters in which the company headed the Barcas operation in 2012, CCR implemented several improvements including the acquisition of two vessels and the organizational restructuring of the company, in addition to its integration with the company’s back ofﬁce. The priority for 2013 is to improve overall general and administrative costs and services to users. The three other new businesses secured in 2012 are in the airport sector abroad. After approval in the General Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting, based on the performance in the independent business assessment committee and deﬁnition of appropriate values, CCR acquired from two of its shareholders, assets in the airports of Quito, in Ecuador, San Jose, in Costa Rica, and Curaçao, in the Netherlands Antilles.

FINANCIAL CAPITAL GRI EC1 | EC8 | PR9 In a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group commissioned by Exame magazine, between December 2003 and December 2011, CCR ranked second among companies with the highest return to shareholders among all Brazilian companies listed in the stock exchange (for details visit the website www.exame.abril.com.br/revista-exame/edicoes/1020/noticias/as-estrelas-da-bolsa). To illustrate CCR’s performance, those who acquired R$ 1 million in CCR's shares in 2003 had earned over R$ 12 million by the end of 2011. In a savings account, the same investment would be worth R$ 1.8 million. If the money had gone into a portfolio made up of similar companies in the BM&FBOVESPA Index, this investor would presently have R$ 2.2 million. In 2012, the company’s performance was similar. In another study carried out by BM&FBOVESPA, CCR's shares demonstrated the best performance among all companies in the BM&FBOVESPA’s Corporate Sustainability Index portfolio. While analyzing the February 2012 to January 2013 period, ISE had an appreciation of 14.55%, while the Ibovespa index had a devaluation of 5.25%. Of the 51 companies in the ISE portfolio, 31 had positive performance, and CCR S/A ON posted the most significant performance (+74.78%).

HUMAN CAPITAL GRI LA1 | LA2 | LA7 | LA13 | LA15 These strong financial results stem from personnel management and investment policies carried out by the human capital that CCR has been developing throughout the years. In 2012, CCR ranked among the 100 best companies to work for, according to its employees and an assessment by Great Places to Work, an annual survey conducted by Época magazine (see details on Época’s website www.greatplacetowork.com.br/melhores-empresas/ gptw-brasil). In 2012, this positive result is confirmed by the very small number of labor actions filed by employees. CCR suffered three labor actions, totaling R$ 2,213.00, corresponding to about 5% of the total provisioned.

The positive results obtained in 2012 are evident in the survey conducted every two years by Instituto Datafolha regarding user satisfaction and in the assessment by the Confederação Nacional dos Transportes of the best highways in Brazil (see charts below). Based on the Sustainability Program, the priority externalities have been managed so as to reduce the risk to the various groups impacted. Improving the Roadway Safety externality in 2012 was considered in the variable remuneration of executives, and several actions were implemented by the Business Units in order to reduce accidents and work-related deaths. Depending on the Business Unit, the goals for the reduction of accidents and deaths ranged between 3% and 5%. Corporately, the goal of reducing deaths was reached.

S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 FUTURE VISION Care for the future is a constant in all aspects of the company that goes from internal and external relationships, economic and financial issues, businesses, grantors, government, management, and especially governance. In addition to representing an evolution of the diversification strategy, the business secured in 2012 followed a different model from the one CCR had adopted previously. While in the past the Company used to operate in a completely independent manner, now it seeks PARTNERS TO FORM SHAREHOLDING STRUCTURES, which creates the need to carry out shared management. Diversification also addresses a more complex social and STRATEGIC environmental setting. The global environmental crisis, especially the aspects associated with climate change and the OBJECTIVES increasing loss of biodiversity, imposes the need for large corporations to incorporate the sustainability criteria into their CONSOLIDATE governance and management. Therefore, the Board of Directors of the company defined as one of its strategic objectives SUSTAINABILITY to “consolidate sustainability as an integral part of creating value and of the process of evaluating results.” This involves identifying the businesses that contribute to addressing these issues, which should generate a great deal of opportunities in the coming years. Collective transportation projects that reduce the number of cars on the roads and, consequently, the level of greenhouse gas emissions may be new business niches. 80 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION International expansion is also a part of the company's long-term strategy, in the areas of airport and highway administration. Considering these opportunities, specialized sectors have foreseen a volume of infrastructure projects totaling approximately R$ 40 billion per year for this decade in Brazil alone. By taking part in bidding processes or developing other types of businesses, such as acquisitions, CCR will maintain the disciplined investment of capital as mandatory. Another basic criterion for the selection is the balance of interests: the project must address the interest of the Grantor, provide real benefits to the population, and allow for an adequate return on investment. PLANNING FOR 2013 The foreseen growth of the Brazilian GPD should reflect in the increase of the traffic on the highways under CCR concession. Should be reflected in the increase in traffic on the highways under its concession. In this segment, which at the end of 2012 accounted for 87% of its revenue, the company intends to finalize negotiations with the Federal Grantor for new investments in NovaDutra and Ponte Rio-Niteroi. Furthermore, the company will take part in the bidding process of other concessions, maintaining a position of disciplined capital investment. 81 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 The operations initiated in 2012 (Barcas and the airports of Quito, Curaçao, and San Jose) should reflect the investments already made and the new management, yielding improved results and services. In the new business segment, there will be an increase in the role of the team responsible for the study and exploration of projects, including following up on the airport market, both in Brazil and abroad. Furthermore, management of sustainability aspects should gain new momentum in 2013. A digital system will enter operations and will be continuously fed with information and evidence from all sustainability initiatives and social, cultural, and environmental projects carried out by the company. It is expected that this new tool will enhance monitoring of projects and measuring of results, allowing for the definition of a set of specific indicators for the sustainability committees in each of the business units, for the Executive Committee, and for the Strategy and Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors, and also for a better definition in establishing goals. PROJECT 2020 In 2012, as a response to the emerging challenges and to continue successful growth, CCR prepared Project 2020, a comprehensive work in the preparation for the future of the business. The implementation of the project, divided into four fronts, will be carried out over the long-term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’S SERVICE COMPANIES OPERATE; TO REVIEW THE ORGANIZATION AND THE OPERATING COSTS OF THE CONCESSIONAIRES. 83 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 CCR’S STRATEGIC PLANNING THREE HORIZONS OF OPPORTUNITIES TWOTO THREE-YEAR HORIZON: GROWTH OF OUR CORE BUSINESS New investments in the current concessions, if accepted by the Grantor, and duly re-balanced Acquisitions in the secondary market Participation in bidding processes of new highways in the primary market TWOTO FIVE-YEAR HORIZON: EXPANSION OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESSES Materialize the optic fiber business installed alongside the highways Change STP's scope of operation Materialize opportunities abroad Focus on urban mobility, subways and other means of public transportation (BRT/VLT) FIVETO TEN-YEAR HORIZON: – ENTER MARKETS MORE DISTANT FROM THE CORE BUSINESS Transport market in Brazil Airports Parking lots in large cities Highway concessions in other states 84 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 2 CCR’S CHALLENGES FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS CORPORATE MANAGEMENT Strengthen corporate management given new projects in partnership with new groups Maintain/develop a competitive differential Develop autonomous services divisions (Actua, Engelog, and EngelogTec) Increase corporate security (management of operating risks) INSTITUTIONAL RELATIONS Further enhance CCR Group’s institutional relations level Provide the necessary representativeness given the challenges posed by growth NEW BUSINESSES Develop business niches Capture the EBITDA curve foreseen in the 2011-2020 strategic planning Adjust the New Businesses area to tackle new challenges CURRENT BUSINESSES Provide increased productivity and efficiency in management.
