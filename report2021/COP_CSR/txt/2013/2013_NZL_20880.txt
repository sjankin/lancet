Please refer to attachment 1.1 and 1.2 on the following pages for safety reports for Tridonic Global Operations and Tridonic NZ for the period Feb 2012 to Dec 2012. Following the table is giving better picture of Tridonic NZ’s effort towards Health & Safety. 05/2008 to 05/2009 to 05/2010 to 02/2011 to 01/2012 to 04/2009 04/2010 01/2011 12/2011 12/2012 (12 months) (12 months) (9 months) (11 months) (12 months) LTI (Lost Time Injury) 2 2 1 2 0 TRI (Total Recordable Injury) 3 2 3 2 0 Total working hours 62236 58369 91924 99007 70552 The monthly TRI rate (total recorded injuries per million hours worked) is recorded in all our plants. All incidents, regardless of their impact, are included in the calculations. The most frequent injuries are those caused by cuts. In the long term, the Zumtobel Group is aiming to reduce the TRI rate to 10. Currently, targeted TRI rate is 13. The LTI rate (Lost Time Injuries or number of working days missed due to injuries per million hours worked) is measured in order to differentiate between industrial accidents having various degrees of seriousness. Industrial accidents are taken into account if they involve more than eight hours off work. Measures such as employee training, improvements in protective clothing, upgrading of installed machinery, etc. are constantly being taken in order to improve occupational safety. The Tridonic NZ is continually making investments to improve working conditions. By preventative and corrective actions throughout the year, Tridonic NZ is targeting to reduce the number of injury rates for the upcoming year. Tridonic NZ provides a safe and healthy workplace. We are dedicated to maintaining a productive workplace by minimizing the risk of accidents, injury and exposure to health risks. In addition, Tridonic NZ arranges following to keep their safe & healthy workplace for everyone: ¾ Influenza Vaccination at the beginning of winter each year. ¾ Hearing Test for all employees from New Zealand certified organization & further hearing aids support – guidance for whom having hearing loss. ¾ Safe Material Handling Procedure training session by ACC (Accident Compensation Corporation, NZ) approved Trainer to avoid back injury at work place. ¾ Fire Extinguisher Refresher course for trained representatives. ¾ Monthly Hazards review & training. ¾ Refresher courses for Forklift Truck Operators. ¾ Safe operation training for Overhead Cranes & Load lifting Page 8 of 67  12th February 2013 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   Page 9 of 67  Safety Report: Status: Dec-12 Auckland Plant Status: Dec-12 120 10 100 8 80 6 60 4 40 2 20 0 0 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr FY 12/13 LTI TRI LTI rate (LTM) TRI rate (LTM) LTI rate (YTD) TRI rate (YTD) Target LTM TRI FY 12/13 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr LTI 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 TRI 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 hours 3,113 6,886 7,016 6,993 7,685 5,447 7,496 5,944 5,230 5,856 5,136 3,750 LTI rate (month) 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 TRI rate (month) 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 LTI rate (LTM) 19.58 20.58 11.18 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 TRI rate (LTM) 19.58 20.58 11.18 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 LTI rate (YTD) 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 TRI rate (YTD) 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Target LTM TRI 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 Page 10 of 67 12th February 2013 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   Page 11 of 67  Safety Report: Dec-12 TridonicAtco Ops.

Labour Principle 3 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4 The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5 The effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6 The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Tridonic NZ’s Employee Rights Policy is guided by international and New Zealand human rights standards, ministry of Labor, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the United Nations Global Compact. Tridonic NZ is committed to working with and encouraging our sub-contractors to uphold the principles in this Policy and to adopt similar policies within their businesses. The Policy includes the following components: • Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining The Company respects our employees’ right to join, form or not to join a labour union without fear of reprisal, intimidation or harassment. Where employees are represented by a legally recognized union, we are committed to establishing a constructive dialogue with their freely chosen representatives. Tridonic NZ is committed to bargaining in good faith with such representatives. • Forced Labor Tridonic NZ prohibits the use of all forms of forced labour, including prison labour, indentured labour, bonded labour, military labour or slave labour. • Discrimination at work place Tridonic NZ values all employees and the contributions they make and has a long-standing commitment to equal opportunity and intolerance of discrimination. We are dedicated to maintaining workplaces that are free from discrimination or physical or verbal harassment on the basis of race, sex, colour, national or social origin, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, political opinion or any other status protected by applicable law. The basis for recruitment, hiring, placement, training, compensation and advancement at the work place is qualifications, performance, skills and experience. • Work Hours and Wages Tridonic NZ compensates employees competitively relative to the industry and local labour market. We operate in full compliance with applicable wage, work hours, overtime and benefits laws. We offer employees opportunities to develop their skills and capabilities and provide advancement opportunities where possible. • Workplace Security Tridonic NZ is committed to maintaining a workplace that is free from violence, harassment, intimidation and other unsafe or disruptive conditions due to internal and external threats. Security safeguards for employees are provided as needed and will be maintained with respect for employee privacy and dignity.

Tridonic NZ prohibits the hiring of individuals that are under 18 years of age for positions in which hazardous work is required. Tridonic NZ’s prohibition of child labour is very strict with International Labour Organization standards. The Zumtobel Group, of which Tridonic NZ is a member of, has a code of conduct which everyone in the Zumtobel Group adheres to. The Zumtobel Group’s Code of Conduct states that no type of discrimination will be tolerated. The Zumtobel Group’s code of conduct is shown in Appendix – A. It can be seen that the social responsibility and environmental protection section in the code of conduct addresses basic labour principles and employee working conditions which the whole Zumtobel Group abides by. A breakdown of the age bands of the employees in Tridonic NZ has been provided in the table below: No of Employees No of Employees No of Employees No of Employees Age Group 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 18 -20 4 2 1 0 21-30 15 23 17 12 31-40 11 9 8 11 41-50 11 11 12 10 51-60 10 12 13 11 Above 60 0 2 3 4 TOTALÆ 51 59 54 48 This clearly establishes that Tridonic NZ does not discriminate against age & does not tolerate child labour. Tridonic NZ would like to ensure that Tridonic NZ only do business with companies that treat labour issues as seriously as we do.

Environment Principle 7 Businesses are asked to support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Support to environmental challenges: Tridonic NZ recognises the New Zealand government efforts to provide a clean healthy environment for both the present and future generations of New Zealanders. The National Environmental Standards enforced throughout the country helps to ensure that everyone in New Zealand has clear air to breathe, clean water to drink and clean land to live on. Tridonic NZ is committed to maintaining and protecting New Zealand’s clean green image because we believe this is an essential value adding process which we can benefit from. Initiatives to promote environmental responsibility: Global changes, dwindling resources and the effects of climate change – every individual has to assume responsibility. Tridonic takes its social responsibility to society and its employees just as seriously as it takes its responsibility for ensuring sustainable environmental protection and manufacturing energy-efficient products. Far-sighted ecological and social actions enable us to contribute towards protecting the environment and society at large. There is a concept for our contribution towards treating the environment, its resources and society responsibly: “ECOLUTION”. The development of environmentally friendly technologies: The Zumtobel Group’s vision of sustainability – “Through light, we care” – expresses its absolute commitment to corporate responsibility. In its core business the Group develops sustainable lighting solutions that set new standards in promoting human well-being – particularly in terms of energy efficiency and light quality. This means that through its products, the company’s economic interests are intrinsically linked with both social and ecological responsibility. Tridonic NZ is committed to the development of environmentally sound new products and reducing waste materials produced during manufacturing processes. The Zumtobel Group as a whole take environmental concerns very seriously. This can be seen from: x Attachment 2.1 – Our Environment Health and Safety Policy x Appendix B : Ecolution – an initiative of TRIDONIC Page 15 of 67  12th February 2013 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   Page 16 of 67  Page 17 of 67 12th February 2013 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   ECOLUTION is the integrated sustainability strategy which links all the divisions of our company. We assume responsibility for the environment, society and, above all, our customers. Our ecolution strategy sets new sustainability standards that go far beyond just environmental protection. TRIDONIC Group helps its customers identify the ideal solution for greater sustainability and efficiency. Energy savings of up to 80 percent can be achieved with lighting management systems and digital dimmable ballasts. Control of the luminaries is demand-led, governed by presence sensors and daylight levels. As part of TRIDONIC’s “ecolution” sustainability strategy, the “ecosim” simulation toll compares different lighting technologies based on life cycle costs, energy profiles and life cycle assessments. This way, the cumulative costs of various solutions can be mapped over several years, helping to define amortization periods and environmental impacts. Product quality is the top priority for us and is constantly monitored. As part of our Lean Six Sigma philosophy, we also operate a continuous improvement process and adopt a zerodefect approach. Our processes are constantly improved and systematically monitored, and the effectiveness of implemented process and quality improvement measures are followed-up through continuous reviews. In the event of any deviation, we instigate corrective measures and monitor their effectiveness. This ensures that resources are used in a sparing, costconscious manner throughout the entire life cycle of products, environmental pollution is prevented to the greatest possible extent and risks are minimized. This allows us to guarantee customers the very highest product quality at all times. The Tridonic Group is determined to make its contribution to climate protection not only by developing innovative products – as a manufacturing company it is also constantly mindful of the need to achieve the biggest possible reductions in emissions. The Tridonic Group’s environmentally relevant emissions include carbon dioxide (CO2), dust and noise. Measures in the Tridonic Group to cut CO2 emissions are based primarily on optimising material and energy requirements in the manufacturing process and optimising transport logistics.

Anti-Corruption Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Our businesses are against all forms of Corruption: New Zealand does not have any one single agency tasked with fighting corruption. Unlike many other countries it has not seen the need to create an Independent Commission against Corruption. Rather it has a number of agencies that focus on the different elements in the fight against corruption. Some of these agencies have their focus on the more positive task of reinforcing values to ensure that New Zealand maintains a corruption free environment; others focus on the enforcement of the laws and the rules. Transparency International (www.transparency.org) is the global civil society organisation, leading the fight against corruption. Transparency International’s mission is to create change towards a world free of corruption. Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) was first launched in 1995; it has been widely credited with putting the issue of corruption on the international policy agenda. The CPI ranks almost 176 countries by their perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys. New Zealand is maintaining its No.1 position with least corruption nation and very clean image in public sector for consecutive 7th years in row. (Year 2006 to 2012) http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi Background: Tridonic NZ defines corruption as ‘the abuse of a position of trust in order to achieve improper financial or other advantage’. We are aware that corporate corruption can take many forms such as: x bribery, price-fixing agreements, facilitation payments x money laundering x inappropriate favours, hospitality or gifts The Zumtobel Group’s Corporate Values, Code of Conduct and Corporate Policies are binding for all the Group’s employees. These lay the foundation for taking the right decisions and acting in a fair, trustworthy and unprejudiced fashion towards both colleagues and business partners. Tridonic NZ is part of a the Zumtobel Group’s Code of Conduct which contains detailed regulations on corruption (refer to Attachment D) which all employees must observe as well as other sensitive issues such as: x Sponsorship x political and charitable donations x and relations with the authorities Page 23 of 67  12th February 2013 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   Objective: We believe that “Corruption is the abuse of entrusted power for private gain”. It hurts everyone whose life, livelihood or happiness depends on the integrity of people in a position of authority. Tridonic NZ will not condone any form of corruption. Briefly, the giving or accepting of undue advantage and other forms of corruption, along with the damage caused by such misconduct worldwide, are a serious issue in today’s legal, economic and political environment. For this reason, in September 2004 the Zumtobel Group of which Tridonic NZ is a member, made a clear commitment to introducing anti-corruption regulations for all business dealings, transactions and processes in all Zumtobel Group companies worldwide of which Tridonic NZ is a member. As an active participant in the World Economic Forum’s “Partnering against Corruption Initiative” (PACI) the goal of the Zumtobel Group of which Tridonic NZ is a member, is to actively combat the various forms of corruption in international and national business dealings. Target: Do note, as an international company, we currently have an independent 3rd party audit carried out on a yearly basis. Fraud and corruption is an important component of this audit. Nevertheless, we will try and further improve by identifying key areas which might be susceptible to fraud and corruption in our business and rectify it. In the Zumtobel Group we will not tolerate any form of corruption; regardless of the value or nature of the advantage this involves (cash, benefits in kind, etc.). Inappropriate favours, gifts or complimentary benefits for customers and business partners also violate our Code of Conduct. In this respect we wish to point out that this also applies within the company to inappropriate gifts given by our employees to one another. Such gifts are not permitted and violate our Code of Conduct.

Through more than 90 chapters worldwide and an CORRUPTION international secretariat in Berlin, we raise awareness of the damaging effects of corruption and work with partners in government, business and civil society PERCEPTIONS to develop and implement effective measures to tackle it. INDEX 2012 Corruption can happen anywhere. When politicians put their own interests above those of the public. When ofﬁcials demand money and favours from citizens for services that should be free. Corruption is not just an envelope ﬁlled with money though – these people make decisions that affect our lives. We know corruption is a problem around the world. But how bad is it and what can be done? The Corruption Perceptions Index measures the perceived levels of public sector corruption in countries worldwide. Based on expert opinion, countries are scored from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). Some countries score well, but no country scores a perfect 100. Two-thirds of the 176 countries ranked in the 2012 index score below 50, showing that public institutions need to be more transparent, and powerful ofﬁcials more accountable. “We must ensure that there are real consequences to corruption. ‘No to impunity’ cannot just be a slogan – it must be carried out with all our combined strength and inspire citizens to speak up and to no longer tolerate corruption.” Huguette Labelle, Chair, Transparency International The Corruption Perceptions Index forces governments around the world to take notice of corruption – their country’s score reﬂects on them. But recognising the problem is only the ﬁrst step towards a solution. That is why we help citizens to demand accountability from their leaders. And we show www.transparency.org governments what they can do to tackle corruption. Together, we can make ISBN: 978-3-943497-29-8 corruption a thing of the past. © 2012 Transparency International.
