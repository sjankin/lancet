The Group has surpassed the initial long term targets set for the 2006 to 2016 period. In 2012, the Group decided that it was the right time to reconsider its sustainability vision and commissioned Jones Lang LaSalle to perform a materiality review of its sustainability strategy. The materiality study allowed the Group to: > Understand and prioritise its sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities > Develop a sustainability vision for 2020 (this timeframe is aligned with the European Union’s new legislation) > Create a hierarchy for material issues – deﬁning long-term objectives and short-term targets > Develop a sustainability strategy which focuses on the most important topics for the real estate sector and for Unibail-Rodamco’s business model, activities and portfolio spread > Enable Unibail-Rodamco staff to clearly articulate its sustainability vision and priorities to external stakeholders The conclusion of this study led to a new prioritisation of the Group’s issues detailed in the matrix to the right. The new targets announced in the 2012 Financial Report (page 96) reﬂect the results of the materiality analysis. 60 • 61 IMPACT ON THE GROUP’S VALUE LOW MIDDLE HIGH L B & and an rib po d d er co y T llu eg rr & ran tio ra H up Tr sp & ea an or n da tio sp t C tio Sa lth n n fe or on t n ty ec tiv ity L En in abo er su ur gy pp c & ly on Ca ch dit ISSUES TO MAINTAIN UNDER CONTROL ai ion H rb on Em n s rig um pl ht an oy s ee s C (1) The top 8 issues which, given the current business strategy and activities, & rim Sa e C fe ty 60 • 61 ch lim an at ge e W L as De oca te ve l E lo co pm n en om Pr od t ic TOP 8 MATERIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED uc tL eb el lin g B co iod W ns ive at er rs er Te va ity n an tio n t s represent the biggest opportunities for creating value.

SOME OF 2012’S ACHIEVEMENTS: For the second year in a row, Unibail-Rodamco was recognised as the n°1 company in France for “leadership opportunities” offered to recently-hired young graduates. 28 NEW TRAINING PROGRAMS were introduced through the UR Academy in line with the Group’s new strategies – such as the 4 Star Label, new leasing programs, Iconic Shopping and the Dining Experience. In 2012, the number of training hours per employee increased from 18/H TO 20+/H. In 2012, a Human Resources Database Project was piloted in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, an important ﬁrst step in deploying the initiative across the whole Group. New performance goals were set out for every Shopping Centre Manager and in the area of digital marketing, both revealing outstanding results in 2012. A new scorecard was established for the Group’s leasing teams, which identifies goals and achievements in concordance with pre-determined KPIs. 64 • 65 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT women@UR Initiatives to further help the integration of “Peer networking is an increasingly popular way to support the career young graduates in the European Graduate Program (EGP) have been implemented in 2012 – all graduates are now assigned a advancement of female employees mentor and it is now the third year in a row that all EGPs go through an induction program, within companies”, states Delphine Merle, president of the network. which includes team building activities such as a football tournament and numerous case studies.

Since 2007, the Group has published an annual corporate sustainability report which aims to provide a clear, objective picture of its goals and results. Since the 2010 reporting period, the corporate sustainability report has been integrated into the annual report to reﬂect the fact that sustainable practices are fully integrated into the Group’s everyday operations. In 2012, the Group considered it was the right time to reﬁne its long term sustainability vision and priorities by performing a materiality review. This study identiﬁed the issues that are most material to Unibail-Rodamco in order to sustain value for both its stakeholders and the company. This vision allows the Group to reallocate its efforts and resources, to reﬁne its long term targets and to transparently report against its most material topics. In 2012, achieving -58%, the Group surpassed its long term target to cut CO2 emissions per visit by 50% in 2016 compared to its 2006 baseline. In this favourable context, all targets have been reviewed and structured from a new 2012 baseline, in order to address the challenges the Group has to face by 2020. For more details on 2012 progress, KPIs and the new long term targets please see pages 93-96. The environmental informations and indicators disclosed in the following pages cover 79.3% of the total gross market value at the Group’s assets portfolio aggregated as of december 31, 2012; and 100% of the Group’s salaries entities for social informations (excluding Comexposium). 1.

Visitor footfall was almost stable (+1%) and did not have a 2012 evolution noticeable impact on this result. This encouraging CO2 performance is achieved by the ambitious energy-saving programmes that operate across 2012 all of the Group’s assets.

As a consequence, Unibail-Rodamco has decided to set a new long term target, even if this CO2 reduction performance has to be considered in the long term, taking into account the possible cyclical and external factors, such as tough climate conditions or uncontrolled changes in the suppliers’ energy mix. In this context of culmination of its long-term targets, the Group’s new target for carbon mitigation is to achieve -30% for its cumulated carbon intensity by 2020 compared to 2012 baseline. The reduction of CO2 emissions between 2011 and 2012 in a like-for-like basis represents 7,279 tonnes, equivalent to 5 times the 2012 emissions generated by the Group’s business travels.

The CO2 ﬁgures are calculated with local emission factors for each source of energy consumption. These factors depend on the source of energy (electricity, gas, etc.), the country and the energy supplier. The KPI highlights the split between direct CO2 emissions (scope 1: gas and fuel oil) and indirect CO2 emissions (scope 2: electricity, district heating network and district cooling network).

Deferred tax liabilities on properties refer to those countries where there is no tax efﬁcient status comparable to that of France (SIIC), providing a tax exemption on recurring income and capital gains on property sales. The increase of deferred tax liabilities on investment properties is mainly due to the increase of the valuation of the assets outside France. The decrease of deferred tax liabilities on investment properties is mainly due to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities on the French assets from the Simon Ivanhoe portfolio which entered the SIIC regime in 2012.

The temporary differences and tax losses are mainly related to real estate operations in Germany (€62.5 million), in Poland (€60.8 million) and in Spain (€32.6 million) and to negative ﬁnancial result on French SIIC entities (€117.8 million). Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available to be offset against these assets. It is expected that the Dutch tax authorities will deny the FBI status for Unibail-Rodamco’s Dutch activities for 2010 onwards (see section 2.1 “Accounting principles and consolidation methods” § 2.1.9 “Taxes”). The Group does not agree with this position. As at December 2012, a deferred tax liability of €44.1 million was booked on the Dutch investment properties. A deferred tax asset for the same amount based on tax losses was recognised. Both amounts were netted. In this context of uncertainty, no other deferred tax asset has been recognised for signiﬁcant Dutch tax-loss carry forwards.
