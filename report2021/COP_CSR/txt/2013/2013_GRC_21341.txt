Emporiki Bank has been a part of this process and actively considered all the options. On October 16, 2012 the parent Group Crédit Agricole signed an agreement with Alpha Bank in order to transfer all the shares of Emporiki Bank. The agreement is expected to be concluded very soon, after the competent authorities grant the necessary approvals. According to the agreement, Crédit Agricole will continue Emporiki's recapitalization, which started in July 2012 and currently amounts at €2.3 bil. up to the total amount of €2.85 bil. Additionally, Crédit Agricole will obtain Alpha Bank's equity related bonds totally amounting at €150 mil., which highlights its active confidence in the development perspectives of the new Group. Since mid October 2012, an effort has started to proceed with the legal and technical agreement by the competent teams of both banking institutions. Crédit Agricole Group's Upper Management works in order to reach an agreement which will take advantage of the unique elements and characteristics of Emporiki Bank, which will provide more to its customers and will be to its people's advantage. For every decision taken, it was and still is based on the interest of the Bank, of its customers and employees. The Corporate Social Responsibility Report for 2011 presents the Bank's contribution to the economy, the social cohesion and its environmental responsibility. Under adverse financial conditions, Emporiki Bank proceeded with social responsibility. Through this report, we would like to thank our customers, our personnel and suppliers, the public authorities, the local society and its organizations.

The actions in the countryside as well as the dance, theater, music, visual arts and creation of short films are the first priority. At the same time, day trips are organized within and outside Attica to beaches, national parks and archaeological sites.

Extract from the Communication by Vice-Chairman and CEO CEO – 12– 003 Athens, 17/2/2012 “..…I am pleased to inform you that the Management and the Union of Employees have reached an agreement after a sincere and constructive dialogue that ended yesterday and we have already signed today a new Collective Labor Agreement for the years 2012 and 2013. I would like to stress that the deal for the new two-year, Collective Labor Agreement, was achieved in a spirit of consensus and with a sense of responsibility from both sides. Through this agreement we achieve the absolutely necessary rationalization of the very high up to date salary costs of Emporiki Bank, while proceeding with the lowest possible modifications in the overall remuneration. This is achieved mainly through adjustments in the amount of the operational allowance and other smaller scale modifications that will be gradual. It is particularly important to note that the reductions agreed in the operational allowance will be implemented incrementally, so in a spirit of justice, lower salary ranges will be less affected, whereas in the cases of employees with a gross monthly salary lower than 1,800 euros there will be no relevant reduction. ……………………………….) Yours sincerely, Alain Strub 6 The collective Agreement was signed on 17/02/2012 7 The Union of Employees was founded in 1945, with the Decision of the Court of First Instance of Athens no 1862/45. The Union is located at 8, Efpolidos Str., PC 105551, Athens. According to its Charter, the Union is governed by a 15-Member Board, which is elected through a universal secret ballot following an Ordinary General Meeting. Similarly, the employees’ representatives are elected for the BoD. The Union is Member of the Federation of Greek Banks Employees (OTOE) and General Confederation of Greek Employees. 8 Established in 1976 28 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2011 Code of conduct – Disciplinary Measures Code of Conduct All employees are required to uphold the banking regulation 1.

The Exhibition of the Bank had numerous visitors. Its publishing work aroused great interest and received flattering words. The publishing activity of the Bank became widely known not only in the book buying public of Northern Greece but also to representatives of foreign publishers and foreign visitors of Thessaloniki.

Giannis Kefallinos, professor of printmaking at the School of Fine Arts, founded in 1956 the laboratory on graphic arts-typography and art of book. As he himself used to say, books beyond their content must also have an aesthetic value, must delight the eye aesthetically and educate the public. The contentaining is just as important as the content. The book is an essential element of culture. Not only carrier of information and ideas but also a piece of art on its own. Towards this direction are focused the publications of the Bank. Our books, written by prestigious scientists and with the care of experienced editors, have contributed to improving the quality of domestic book production. We have released books about ancient times, the Byzantine and medieval art, the art of Modern Greece. Many are also dedicated to the history and architecture of cities and places as well as to the work of acclaimed artists of the 20th century. It is not easy for one to summarize in a few lines the importance and necessity of knowledge and art. Clearly, however, the book is an expression of both necessities and is a result of collaboration of writers, editors, artists and printers who each, in their part, grapple with love and taste on the production of this good we call book. A good that promotes individual and collective culture, memory and knowledge. The value of a book is much more stable than the value of any other consumer goods, much more resistant against the menacing spectrum of globalization. This is a value we should fight with all our strength. If we tried to paraphrase a verse of Hölderlin 'books are necessary-indeed during difficult petty times”.

Re-use and Recycling of electric and electronic equipment The re-use of electric and electronic equipment is our priority. In 2011 we donated many items of electric and electronic equipment to organizations which had requested for them in order for it to be reused. The non-functional equipment were delivered for recycling. In 2011 we recycled 39,531 Kgr of electric and electronic equipment versus 70.484 Kgr in 2010 E9. Project Financing: Renewable Sources of Energy An important part of the Project Financing portfolio is the financing of renewable energies. In 2011, the projects which were financed in the past were our priority. The projects are included in the following fields: wind parks, Combined Heat and Power (CHP), hydroelectric stations, photovoltaics, and desalination units. As of 31.12.2011, the renewable sources projects financing amounted at €184 mil. The marginal decrease (1.6%) versus last year is due to the scheduled payments and the lower number of new projects because of the liquidity crisis in The Athinas str. Branch the market. Apart from the Project Financing, the Bank finances photovoltaic stations through its Business Centers and Retail Banking.
