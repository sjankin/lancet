Social Responsibility Report About this Report The SAS 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report is based on the calendar year Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2011. All data and information pertains to SAS Institute Inc., the US-based parent company for SAS, except for environmental data or unless otherwise stated. There have been no significant changes during the reporting period. The report was developed using Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 sustainability reporting guidelines and is self-declared at application level C. SAS’ CSR efforts focus on four core areas: governance, employees, environment, and education and philanthropy. Content relating to the company’s values, structure and employee benefits sits in the CSR overview site, while content specifically relating to 2011 is contained here. As in previous reports, SAS® for Sustainability Management was used to provide the facts and figures regarding SAS’ environmental footprint. Executive leaders and other relevant internal stakeholders have reviewed all content. SAS received numerous awards and recognition, which can be found on its website. SAS welcomes your comments and questions regarding this report and its corporate responsibility efforts. For questions about this report or its contents, please email globalreporting@sas.com. Letter from CEO Now in our 36th year of operations, SAS remains focused not only on providing innovative, high-quality products but on a deep commitment to corporate social responsibility. At SAS, we want to be the company others call first to solve complex business problems. SAS produces software that is second to none because people are our No. 1 priority. Employee and customer satisfaction are at the heart of SAS’ success and sustainability. SAS’ structure allows us to use the risk and volatility of a challenging economy as opportunities, not constraints. This applies to sustainability practices as well. By embedding sustainable principles into our business decisions – particularly those that involve employees and capital investments – organizations can emerge from uncertain times on a foundation of stability and prosperity. A key factor for SAS has always been and will remain our employees. SAS retained its No. 1 position on the Fortune Best Companies to Work For list in the US and secured the No. 2 spot on the first-ever Top 25 World’s Best Multinational Workplaces list from Great Place to Work. In line with these achievements, in 2011 we grew our workforce by more than 9 percent while maintaining a low turnover rate of 3 percent. 3 SAS White Paper This year we continued our efforts as a leader in sustainability by further investing in innovative technologies that help minimize the environmental impacts of our business. 2011 saw the completion of a new LEED®-certified building. The building is expected to use 50 percent less water and 40 percent less energy compared to industry standards and incorporates solar-generated hot water and electricity, a building cooling system and a one-acre green roof that filters and slows the rate of stormwater run-off. We will continue to implement LEED guidelines and best practices in the pursuit of formal certification for new and existing buildings, as well as leased and owned office renovations. At SAS, we believe in improving lives through learning and, by focusing on one particular area of concern – education – we believe we can be more effective in making a difference in our community. Our education initiatives inspire more students to study science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) – knowledge required to solve global concerns about limited natural resources. We continue to provide 21st century technology, expertise, professional development and instructional materials to prepare students for college and their careers; collaborate with Change the Equation national initiative to define metrics for evaluating and sustaining viable STEM initiatives; and engage the global corporate community in prioritizing efforts that strengthen education and increase the numbers entering careers in STEM. This year we donated nearly $20 million in grants, software, equipment and training for students and educators. Furthering our commitment to international efforts on corporate responsibility, SAS joined the UN Global Compact, an initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with 10 universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. This CSR report, our fifth, reflects our commitments and performance as well as future goals to ensure that our business incorporates operating both responsibly and sustainably while contributing to the communities where we work.

In 2011 the Executive Sustainability Council continued its role ensuring that sustainability goals and priorities permeate every aspect of the company’s operations. The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Task Force is an interdepartmental group that meets regularly to integrate these efforts across the business. These teams continue to work closely with all aspects of the business, engaging with various departments and ensuring policies and initiatives regarding CSR are considered in all aspects of the business. As part of its CSR commitment, SAS senior management is represented on the boards of leading conservation organizations, such as The Nature Conservancy, and provides influence on the global stage through organizations such as the World Economic Forum, World Resources Institute and the Environmental Defense Fund. SAS continues to engage with stakeholders both internally and externally, including: Stakeholder Engagement 2011 Communities Employee volunteers, grants, SAS employees volunteered 22,700 hours through the Employee donations and training.

Governance Structure SAS Institute Inc. is a North Carolina corporation that has been privately held since its inception in 1976. SAS is headquartered in Cary, NC. The company operates through functional divisions that include Worldwide Marketing, Research & Development, Finance, Legal, and Corporate Services. SAS delivers software and related services to customers throughout the world. These sales operations are conducted primarily through SAS and its controlled sales subsidiaries, which operate in 57 countries. These entities are grouped into three regional sales divisions – the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific. 8 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility Report The SAS Americas division includes 12 companies (SAS Institute Inc. and 11 operating subsidiaries), which provide software and services to customers in specific territories. The Europe, Middle East and Africa division and the Asia Pacific division together include approximately 48 operating subsidiaries. SAS also has a number of representative and branch offices in the above regions, with a total sales presence in more than 55 countries. SAS also has subsidiaries in the Asia Pacific region that are dedicated to conducting research and development activities for SAS and its affiliates. DataFlux, IDeaS, Memex, VSTI, Assetlink, JMP and Teragram are separately branded but affiliated lines of business that are operated either through dedicated wholly owned subsidiaries of SAS or as integrated divisions of SAS. Jim Goodnight, Chief Executive Officer, and John Sall, co-founder and Executive Vice President, are the company’s principal shareholders and constitute the board of directors serving as executive officers, overseeing corporate performance and investment decisions across environmental, social and economic interests. Corporate social responsibility initiatives and priorities are set by the board, working with Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Jim Davis. The SAS Executive Sustainability Council, formed in 2008, continues to ensure that SAS’ global operations conduct business in a sustainable manner. This group includes representation from senior-level executives. Read more on SAS’ sustainability initiatives. Employee rights are managed through Human Resources; ethics and compliance are managed from Compliance in Legal (covering compliance with anti-corruption, privacy and antiaggression laws); sustainability and environmental conservation are managed through Facilities. 9 SAS White Paper Ethics and Compliance SAS has a corporate culture based on trust between its employees and the company. SAS employs the highest ethical standards in its dealings with customers, suppliers and competitors. To help SAS maintain its high standards for respect, honesty, fairness and accountability, the company created the SAS Code of Business Ethics and related training courses. The Code of Business Ethics provides guidance to SAS employees and its subsidiaries on how to comply with all laws, rules and regulations of the countries in which SAS does business to ensure legal and ethical behavior. SAS offers courses and training to help employees better abide by the SAS Code of Business Ethics, applicable external rules and regulations. SAS provides this training to help all employees make the right choices when ethical and regulatory challenges arise. SAS also provides certain ethics and regulatory compliance training to employees and certain contract workers to protect SAS’ business partners’ interests, as well as government and societal responsibilities. Training is provided worldwide online to all employees, and targeted training is also provided in person to particular groups on specific issues, such as gift laws relating to government officials or export laws on encryption software exports. Training courses are provided on the SAS Code of Business Ethics, including: • Information security. • Export control awareness. • Ethics in selling, buying and competing. • Respect in the workplace. • US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. • Defense export controls (International Traffic in Arms Regulations). • Executive compliance training. SAS has strict regulations on gifts, bribery and how to conduct business fairly and to avoid undue influence when dealing with third parties. In 2011, SAS expanded its domestic lobbying, gift and campaign law compliance measures by engaging a specialized firm to help manage these matters in the US. SAS also operates an ethics hotline where employees are encouraged to report any violations of the Code of Business Ethics. SAS will not retaliate against anyone who makes a good faith report of ethical, regulatory or legal compliance issues. In 2011 there were no violations in the areas of corruption, ethics, bribery, anticompetitive behavior, antitrust or monopoly practices; SAS was not fined for noncompliance with any laws or regulations. SAS Conflicts of Interest Policy “Employees, subcontractors, or agents will not knowingly make, receive, provide, or offer gifts for the purpose of influencing any act or decision with respect to any government contract, any other contract, or otherwise act in any manner inconsistent with Company policies. No employee shall offer any gift to any local, state, federal, or foreign government employee, official, or any foreign political party except as authorized by the employee’s manager and the Company’s Legal Department.” 10 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility Report Because the term gift is defined so broadly and in varied forms under the laws of the several jurisdictions where SAS does business, and because gifts from vendors to customers, especially in transactions with governments, have in many jurisdictions been deemed illegal or unethical, SAS has implemented a broad provision against providing gifts to persons who might have influence over awarding a contract. The anti-bribery, lobbying, gift, and campaign financing laws that give rise to gift restrictions are further explained in SAS’ compliance group’s Web guidance materials and in targeted training for affected employees. Privacy Privacy is part of the mainstream business culture at SAS as companies respond to emerging state, federal and international privacy and data protection legislation; rapid changes in technology and security; and growing consumer and employee concern about the collection, storage, use and sharing of personal information. The Legal Department, along with other divisions, periodically reviews SAS’ and its various business units’ information collection practices to ensure that SAS’ Privacy Statement accurately reflects the practices and informs individuals who provide SAS with personal information. It also guides what SAS does with that information: how it is collected, used and shared; what choices exist with respect to personal information; and how to contact SAS with any questions or concerns they may have. Our current Privacy Statement is global and applies not only to SAS Americas, but to its foreign subsidiaries and other business units who maintain a separate online website. Translated versions of the Privacy Statement with country-specific requirements are also made available. In 2011 there were no material complaints regarding breaches of privacy or losses of customer data. 11 SAS White Paper Education Philanthropy Education continues to be the prime focus for SAS’ community and philanthropic work. SAS believes that by focusing on one particular area of concern, it can be more effective in making a difference in its community.

Customer Marketing Food Drive The Corporate Executive and Customer Marketing Department held a food drive for a month involving 40 people and garnering more than 9,000 items, which translated into 3,896 pounds of food for the homeless and hungry of North Carolina. 16 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility Report Empowering Others SAS® Software Helps Fight Cancer In 2011, SAS is teamed up with the University of North Carolina’s (UNC) Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center to develop a new product designed to improve treatment for cancer patients. UNC Lineberger and SAS are building on the capabilities of SAS Health Outcomes Analysis, currently in development, which will eventually provide information from a larger cohort of patients with similar treatment, health and demographic profiles. The software helps researchers and medical practitioners easily and dynamically apply advanced analytical techniques to observational patient data. This partnership will allow researchers and physicians to better understand how a cancer’s genetic cause interacts with a patient’s therapeutic combinations or sequences of therapies. Analysis will result in better patient outcomes and a road map to help patients graduate from active therapy and join the more than 12 million cancer survivors in the United States. The ultimate goal is to improve cancer outcomes in North Carolina and elsewhere. JMP® Pro Helps the Charlotte Rescue Mission ‘Boost’ Contributions The Charlotte Rescue Mission aims to help individuals caught in the cycles of poverty, hopelessness and chemical addiction by meeting their spiritual, physical, emotional, social and vocational needs. It provides shelter and other forms of assistance to 152 clients at two facilities. The organization is devoted to spending as little as possible on overhead and as much as it can on helping people turn their lives around. JMP Pro, created by SAS, helps the organization achieve its goals. With approximately 110,000 people in its database who have donated at least once, the rescue mission is using the software to optimize direct mailing lists, enable more targeted communications and reduce costs of postage and printing. Direct mail is also used to communicate to the public how the shelter works and how donations will be used. JMP Pro offers a new software option for organizations that need automated techniques for data mining and predictive modeling. It includes techniques that allow the user to mine and model data with greater accuracy and flexibility. The rescue mission uses the software to determine which factors contribute most to a donor’s response to a solicitation and to classify donors by expected profitability. The software also provides data on how much the rescue mission should spend on a contributor over the course of that person’s lifetime. Go to jmp.com/software/success/ for more information on how JMP software is used in education, conservation and health care. 17 SAS White Paper Employees Overview For the 14th year in a row, SAS has been ranked on Fortune’s list of 100 Best Companies to Work For in the US, enjoying the No. 1 spot in 2011.

From its US headquarters to its offices around the world, SAS is committed to making a difference. This year saw the installation of new solar arrays, completion of a new office building that was awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certification and continued efforts to manage water consumption, waste and improved energy efficiency. Highlights from 2011 at the Cary, NC, world headquarters included: • Generated 3,833 megawatt hours of renewably sourced solar power from rooftop and ground-mounted solar installations. • Installed additional building rooftop solar thermal hot water system. • Installed two additional building rooftop solar photovoltaic systems. • Awarded LEED Platinum certification for a newly constructed office building. • Awarded LEED Gold certification for a newly constructed Data Center. • Initiated a preferred parking program for qualifying eco-commuters. Employees with energy-efficient and earth-friendly vehicles, participants in the vanpool program, and active carpoolers have access to premium parking and electric vehicle charging stations. • Installed numerous environmentally friendly and energy-efficient technologies in new and existing buildings. In addition to employing various sustainability measures at its headquarters, SAS takes pride in supporting environmental education and awareness efforts. In 2011, SAS supported numerous environmental speaking engagements, visits to the SAS solar farms, companywide Earth Day celebrations, featured articles posted on the internal green website, and published white papers and webcasts. By engaging with customers, employees, industry leaders and world leaders, SAS seeks to extend the reach of its sustainability initiatives. SAS did not receive any sanctions or fines in 2011 for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations in the United States. Green Buildings SAS continues to deliver on a commitment to customers, employees, and the environment with Building C at SAS world headquarters in Cary, NC. With minimal impact to the surrounding natural environment, this showcase of sustainability and style includes an office tower, a socially conscious café and the SAS Executive Briefing Center, which is used by customers, partners and the community. 25 SAS White Paper SAS strives to be a sustainability leader by investing in innovative technologies that help minimize the environmental impacts of its business. This commitment led the design and construction decisions for Building C, resulting in LEED certification at the Platinum level by the US Green Building Council (USGBC). Built with minimal environmental impact, this “green building” was designed to consume 40 percent less energy and 50 percent less water by integrating numerous, highly efficient technologies and sustainable features, including: • Rainwater is captured from roof drains and stored in two 20,000 gallon underground cisterns for non-potable water use in bathrooms. • High-efficiency plumbing and electronically activated fixtures reduce employee water consumption and the amount leaving the building for wastewater treatment – resulting in 63 percent savings compared to EPA standards. • A 655,000 gallon retention pond collects stormwater runoff to minimize erosion impact and pollution of local water sources; it also provides landscape irrigation. Building C’s design will reduce landscaping irrigation demand by at least 75 percent. • 405 solar photovoltaic panels feed power to the building for lighting and building systems. • A solar thermal system uses the sun’s energy to preheat the hot water supply for the cafeteria. • To decrease the load on heating and cooling systems, fresh air is pre-conditioned with heat and humidity from the building’s exhaust air. • With highly efficient motors to reduce energy usage, regenerative drive elevators generate electricity during their descent to help power lighting, computers and other electrical equipment. • With high-performance spandrel glazing backed with semi-rigid insulation, exterior glass reflects a substantial amount of heat. • A one-acre living sedum green roof minimizes stormwater runoff; it also increases the building’s insulation, absorbs CO2 and provides a natural habitat for wildlife. White reflective membranes on rooftops reflect the sun’s energy and keep the roof cool. The reflective nature of the membrane helps increase the efficiency for the solar photovoltaic systems. Green roofs significantly minimize the heat island effect – the thermal increase between developed and undeveloped areas that can cause smog and increase ambient temperatures. • Thermal slab floor cooling uses water cooled in off-peak hours by building chillers to help maximize air conditioning efficiencies. 26 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility Report • Radiant floor heating is used in the atrium to maintain floor-level heat for greater occupant comfort and minimize heat loss through the roof. • Highly efficient HVAC systems integrate economizers, enthalpy wheels, variable-speed drives, and various heat recovery systems to increase energy savings. • Energy is saved by using T5 fluorescent and LED lighting fixtures along with individual lighting controls, motion sensors and automatic timers. • Night light pollution is reduced by using full cut-off exterior lights and an automated system to turn off all interior lights at night. • Designated preferred parking spaces and electric car charging stations are available for eco-commuters. Bike racks and showers encourage employees to bike to work. • The cafeteria provides a low-carbon menu and serves locally grown vegetables from the one-acre organic culinary farm at SAS headquarters. • The dining area’s food waste is composted and used by SAS landscapers to enrich soil throughout the SAS campus – waste vegetable oil is recycled and converted into biodiesel fuel. • 82 percent of construction waste was diverted from the landfill. • The Building C site preserved almost 1 million square feet of open space to help maintain local ecosystems. • The landscape planting for the project has been developed with native plants that are predominantly mediumto highly drought tolerant. • All trees removed from site were reused for accent walls and furniture inside the building, donated to Warmth for Wake (a seasonal energy assistance outreach program) or chipped for landscape in plant beds. • Artisans crafted the site’s timber into the building’s indoor furniture and wall panels. • All office furniture purchases were Green Guard Certified, but most of the building’s furniture came from employees’ previous offices, a reuse practice that minimizes waste to landfills. In addition, the majority of the new furniture was manufactured locally in North Carolina. 69 percent of wood products used in doors, casework and blocking are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), ensuring that sustainable harvesting practices were met. • 27 percent of materials purchased for this project came from within 500 miles of the project. • 23 percent of materials purchased had recycled content. • All carpet installed was Carpet and Rug Institute’s Green Label Plus certified and all composite woods were free of urea-formaldehyde, which ensured the indoor air was as free from unnecessary odors and chemicals as possible. • CO2 sensors and demand-controlled ventilation supplies outside air into the building as needed, which helps save energy while also providing optimal air quality for employees and guests. • During construction, the contractor implemented an Indoor Air Quality Plan that addressed HVAC protection, source control, pathway interruption, housekeeping and scheduling issues. In addition to Building C’s achievements, the newest SAS Data Center received LEED Gold Certification. SAS is also embracing LEED guidelines for remodeling and retrofitting existing buildings. In 2011, SAS registered five existing buildings for future LEED certification consideration. 27 SAS White Paper 2011 Highlights 2011 Goals Performance Highlights 2012 Goals Achieve LEED New Construction Awarded LEED Gold certification for Data Center.

Water SAS’ 900-acre campus in Cary used 171,378 cubic meters of municipal water and approximately 45,800 cubic meters of ground water from 15 wells in 2011. For 13 other owned facilities worldwide, SAS used 55,844 cubic meters of municipal water in 2011. In addition, SAS: • Reduced landscape irrigation volume by 9 percent despite additional requirements from two new buildings. • Completed installation of a rainwater-capture system for office buildings at SAS world headquarters, which collected 1,932 cubic meters in 2011. • Replaced two antiquated building-cooling towers with higher-efficiency models designed to use less water and accept reclaimed water as an alternative. • Renovated 12 restrooms with high efficiency and electronically activated plumbing fixtures, which are estimated to reduce employee water consumption by 37 percent and reduce the amount of water leaving the building for wastewater treatment by 26 percent. • Expanded use of native drought-tolerant plants and planted large expanses of prairie grasses instead of the more traditional turf grasses. 28 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2011 Highlights 2011 Goals Performance Highlights 2012 Goals Renovate 12 restrooms in Facilities renovated 12 restrooms with lowReplace two antiquated building-cooling towers with major office buildings at Cary flow technologies – all restrooms at Cary higher-efficiency models designed to use less water and headquarters with low-flow headquarters are now retrofitted with highaccept reclaimed water as an alternative. technologies. efficiency plumbing fixtures.

This year, SAS installed numerous environmentally friendly and energy-efficient technologies in new and existing buildings. The new Data Center has allowed SAS to consolidate IT equipment from other locations and retire antiquated equipment. In 2011, SAS generated 3,833 megawatt hours of renewably sourced solar power from rooftop and ground-mounted solar installations. Three new rooftop systems were activated in 2011: • A 169 kW photovoltaic system was installed on the office roof of Building R and will provide approximately 208,000 kWh annually for use within the building. • A 74 kW photovoltaic system was installed on the office tower roof at Building C and will provide approximately 100,000 kWh annually for use within the building. • Another building rooftop solar thermal hot water system was installed. Solar water heat is used on sunny days to help supply the estimated 3,000 gallons of hot water used primarily in the kitchen. SAS continues to implement LEED guidelines and best practices in the pursuit of formal certifications for new and existing buildings, as well as leased and owned office renovations. • SAS has expanded use of energy-efficient lighting technologies such as LED, fluorescent and metal halides. • SAS installed two elevators with regenerative drive technologies. 30 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility Report • The elevators generate electricity on descent for use within the building. • The thermal slab floor cooling system installed last year uses water cooled in off-peak hours by building chillers to help maximize air conditioning efficiencies. • Radiant floor heating is used in a building atrium to maintain floor-level heat for greater occupant comfort and minimize heat loss through the roof. • Highly efficient HVAC systems in several buildings integrate economizers, enthalpy wheels, variable speed drives and various heat-recovery systems to increase energy savings. 2011 Highlights 2011 Goals Performance Highlights 2012 Goals Install an additional 1.0 Solar farm expansion didn’t happen megawatt of solar photovoltaic due to building expansion plans to (PV) capacity to the existing accommodate employee growth. solar farm.

Over the past decade, the challenge of delivering timely information to support enterprise analytics has increased exponentially. The deployment of additional computing and storage solutions, combined with IT globalization at corporate headquarters, has increased demand for energy and data center space. Existing facilities were reaching capacity and could not be efficiently expanded to maintain the high level of support expected by SAS’ customers. The solution was to design and construct a dedicated computing facility, emphasizing efficiency, flexibility and sustainability. This past year, the new Data Center achieved an average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.35. The data center industry uses the PUE calculation as a measure of efficiency. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power consumed, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power in support of the IT equipment. A data center is more efficient when it uses less energy to run the facility than to power the IT equipment. So, the closer it gets to a PUE of 1.0, the more efficient it is. Managing Greenhouse Gas Emissions SAS completed the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain questionnaire related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory and related climate change management in response to customer requests. SAS’ overall score was 71 out of 100, up from 65 last year and well above the average of 51. 33 SAS White Paper Global Emissions Summary, CO2e T *Does not include Data Center Region 2011 2010 Variance Percent Difference Asia Pacific 6,117 6,163 -46 -1% Canada 377 443 -66 -15% EMEA 8,614 8,735 -121 -1% Latin America 177 177 0% US Data Center 15,837 13,797 2,040 15% United States* 30,637 30,637 -244 -1% Totals 61,759 60,196 1,563 3% *Does not include Data Center Note: 2010 energy consumption reported in last year’s report has been reduced slightly because of restated values reported by global offices. Waste SAS continues to invest in waste management program initiatives to reduce waste and encourage recycling at all its facilities. • SAS successfully diverted all electronics waste from landfills by repurposing equipment for internal use, recycling with responsible vendors and donating to educational institutions. • SAS eliminated the purchase of polystyrene-based disposables in favor of earthfriendly compostable options. 34 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility Report • On-site composting of cafeteria waste increased by almost 100 percent in 2011. It increased from 43,750 pounds to 84,500 pounds. • The battery recycling program doubled annual volumes for the third consecutive year. The 900 pounds from the initial effort in 2008 has grown to more than 6,500 pounds in 2011. • SAS initiated a pen recycling program this year to collect used pens for a provider that will donate 1 cent for every pen collected to a local SAS nominated charity. • Of the 1,980 tons of total construction waste for SAS Building C, 82 percent was recycled – resulting in 1,616 tons diverted from the landfill. • Campus renovation projects achieved 89 percent diversion from landfill in 2011. Of the 1,402,960 pounds of construction waste, 1,248,006 were recycled. • Food waste from the cafeterias is composted and used by SAS landscapers to enrich soil throughout the SAS campus – waste vegetable oil is recycled and converted into biodiesel fuel. SAS takes pride in its education and awareness efforts on environmental issues. The company engaged in a yearlong campaign of education and communication through speaking engagements, visits to the SAS solar farms, a companywide event for Earth Day, featured articles posted on the internal green website, published white papers and webcasts. 2011 Highlights 2011 Goals Performance Highlights 2012 Goals Expand program to measure globally Developed survey tool to collect volumes from Collect, analyze and report global waste owned offices. owned offices. volumes in 2012 CSR report.

Overall volumes for recycling stayed high in 2011 due to an increased focus on the treatment of operational and construction waste, a campuswide cleanup to prepare for the 2011 opening of Building C, increased participation from the Eco Advocate employee volunteer program, and employee awareness campaigns. 36 2011 Corporate Social Responsibility Report Other Initiatives In 2011, SAS established a culinary farm at SAS world headquarters where the produce grown is used in various SAS food service locations. Sustainable agriculture practices – including applying site-specific organic applications, cover cropping, crop rotation and companion planting – will continue to be used on the farm. 37 About SAS SAS is the leader in business analytics software and services, and the largest independent vendor in the business intelligence market.
