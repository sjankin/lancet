Harrie Noy (1951) joined the company in 1975 and spent his entire career with ARCADIS, mostly in management positions. In 1994, he became a member of the Executive Board and in 2000, CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board. Under his leadership the company’s gross revenues grew from €750 million to €2.0 billion, the number of employees rose from 7,500 to almost 18,500, and the market capitalization went from €150 million to €1.1 billion by the end of 2011. The basis for this success was a new strategy, resulting in a focus on a selected number of growth markets, the sale of non-core activities, better margins through activities higher in the value chain, and higher organic growth through enhanced synergies and improved internal cooperation, and targeted acquisitions. Harrie Noy formally stepped down at the end of the General Meeting of Shareholders in Amsterdam on May 16, 2012. On June 6, during his farewell party he was made Commander in the Order of Orange-Nassau, an honor bestowed by Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands, and presented by Clemens Cornielje, Commissioner for the Queen in the Province of Gelderland. Harrie Noy was also made an Honorary Member of the Dutch association of consulting engineers, the first person to receive this honor in 20 years. The award was presented by Ed Nijpels, chairman of the Dutch association of consulting engineers. In October 2012, Harrie Noy won the Strategy Award of the Dutch organization for strategy and management, while in November he received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the European CEO Conference of the British Association of Consulting Engineers ACE. The Lifetime Achievement Award is for a CEO who has made an exceptional, prolonged contribution to the industry during his career. We wish Harrie and his wife Tini all the best.

The passing of a new transportation law has not changed this situation as funding levels are unchanged from previous years. We are continuing to exploit our regional positions in areas where we see good opportunities for our expertise in intelligent traffic solutions. The slow turnaround in the housing market and limited funding for government investment are not supporting an improvement in the buildings market. Commercial properties are seeing signs of growth, while healthcare continues to see low growth levels, also in architecture. Margins remain strong Despite the more challenging market conditions, margins were kept at a strong level. The margin improvement in the water activities supported this strong performance. Restructuring charges amounted to €2.1 million (2011: €4.7 million) and were related to the integration with Malcolm Pirnie and the adjustment of the organization to reduced demand, especially in the water market. Excluding these charges, the operational margin improved to 12.2%.

Middle East invests in social infrastructure Governments in the Middle East invest in the development of social infrastructure (healthcare, education, tourism, ports, sports facilities, parks).

A review of the Polish business resulted in a Operational non-cash charge of €5.3 million. The non-cash charge was created for overstated work in progress, project cost overruns and re-scoping of road projects by the client, the Polish Road Authority. Market conditions in Poland continue to be difficult. In the Czech Republic, market conditions led to staff reductions and some margin pressure. Our Czech project management business was combined with the activities of EC Harris. Margins somewhat improved, but further steps needed Although the operational margin in Europe improved to 5.9% (2011: 2.5%), it is still far from the overall margin target of 10%. The margin throughout Europe was impacted by revenue and price pressure as well as from the merger with EC Harris. Total restructuring and integration charges amounted to €11.4 million. It has been announced that ARCADIS will move to a Pan-European operating model to improve client service, better leverage our capabilities across geographies, provide enhanced career opportunities for our people, while creating a more effective and efficient support organization.

Excluding these charges, the operational margin was 8.6% (2011: 9.4%).

The standard is applicable to both financial and non-financial items measured at fair value. The standard is effective as from January 1, 2013 and requires prospective application. IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ (amendment 2011) The amendment requires separation of items presented in other comprehensive income into two groups, based on the possibility to recycle these items into the statement of income in the future. The amendments only impact presentation and disclosures. They will be adopted as from January 1, 2013 and will be applied retrospectively. IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ In 2011 ARCADIS already changed its accounting policy and eliminated the deferral of actuarial gains and losses and plan changes (‘the corridor approach’), and as such already applied the most important change in the new IAS 19. Besides this change, the recognition and measurement of defined benefit pension expenses and their presentation in the statement of income were amended. Changes in defined benefit obligations and plan assets will be split into three components: service costs, net interest on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) and remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability/(asset). The expected return on plan assets is no longer included in the statement of income. Instead, the (estimated) finance income is calculated on the plan assets and included in the net interest amount on the net defined benefit liability/(asset). Differences between actual returns on plan assets and the (estimated) finance income are recognized as part of the remeasurements in other comprehensive income. Additional disclosure requirements have been added for risks and plan objectives and the distinction between short-term and long-term benefits has been revised. IAS 19 also introduced minor changes to the definition and accounting for termination benefits, while the amended accounting and presentation for pensions as mentioned above, also applies for costs relating to other long-term employee benefits. The amendments will be adopted as from January 1, 2013 and will be applied retrospectively.

Amortization other intangible assets 14,910 5,384 Depreciation and amortization 6,064 5,201 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The expected future cash flows used in the impairment analysis Impairment testing for cash-generating units are based on management’s estimates. Events in our end containing goodwill markets as well as the financial markets and the overall economy may have an adverse impact on the estimated future For annual impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cashcash flows of ARCADIS business. The impairment test generating units. The cash-generating unit is the lowest level indicated sufficient headroom for all cash-generating units, and within ARCADIS at which goodwill is monitored for internal as such a reasonably possible change in any of the assumptions management purposes. Where applicable, cash generating would not cause the carrying value to exceed the recoverable units are grouped together following the segment reporting as amount. However, the headroom for ARCADIS Poland is more used within ARCADIS. The impairment test compares the sensitive to the changes in the assumptions, as the carrying carrying value of the cash-generating units (including goodwill) amount approximates the recoverable amount. The total with the recoverable amounts. Goodwill is impaired if the goodwill recognized for ARCADIS Poland is e4 million. recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it is allocated is lower than the carrying value. The recoverable value is determined based on a value in use calculation. These calculations use cash flow projections based on historical performance and the plan for 2013 as approved by the Executive Board. Projections were extrapolated with stable or declining growth rates for a period of 8 years, after which a terminal value was calculated. Growth rates were capped at a long-term average growth rate, and typically do not exceed 3% (2011: 3%). The pre-tax discount rate used in discounting cash flows to their present value in order to determine the value in use is 10.3% (2011: 11.4%), and where applicable, a surcharge is added for specific country risks. The pre-tax discount rate has been determined by iterative computation so that value in use determined using pre-tax cash flows and a pre-tax discount rate equals value in use determined using post-tax cash flows and a post-tax discount rate. The post-tax WACC used is 7.5% (2011: 8%), and where applicable, a surcharge is added for specific country risks. The key assumptions used in the predictions are: • Revenue growth: based on experience and market analysis; • Margin development: based on historical performance, plan 2013 and management’s long-term projections. The margins fall in a range between 7.1% and 13.5%; and • WACC: based on the market participants view on rates of return demanded for investments equivalent to those in the Company, and based on the current leverage of the Company.

All financial instruments carried at fair value within the Company are categorized in level 2. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the term and maturity of the contract, using market interest rates. The fair value of interest rate swaps is consistent with bank valuations. These valuations are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at measurement date. For loans and receivables fair value is determined for disclosure purposes based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the Company specific market rate of interest at reporting date. For financial leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at reporting date. Due to the short-term character of the receivables, the fair value equals the carrying value. 32 Subsequent events On January 31, 2013 ARCADIS announced that it acquired 100% of the shares of Geohidrologia Consultores in Santiago, Chile. The company is active in hydro consulting, and employs 55 employees. The acquisition will not materially impact the financial position of ARCADIS. As such, there were no material events after December 31, 2012 that would have changed the judgement and analysis by management of the financial condition of the Company at December 31, 2012 or the profit for the period of the year 2012.
