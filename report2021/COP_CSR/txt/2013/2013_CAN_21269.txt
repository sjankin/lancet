GhG emissions were lower than the data that was reported last year, as the hydro-Québec factor that had been used was 0.013635 kg Co2/kWh, compared to the 2011 actual factor of 0.006501 kg Co2/kWh. Consequently, GhG emissions for electricity consumption from January to may 2011 have been adjusted. 1.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2012 This Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A’) is intended to help the readers to assess, through the eyes of management, the Fonds de solidarité FTQ’s (the “Fonds”) results and financial condition and the material changes therein during the financial year ended May 31, 2012. The annual MD&A complements and supplements the financial statements and contains financial highlights, but does not contain the complete annual financial statements of the Fonds. To facilitate understanding of events and uncertainties, this MD&A should be read together with the financial statements and the notes thereto. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements about the Fonds’ activities, results, and strategies that should be interpreted with caution. Because, by their nature, forward-looking statements involve assumptions, uncertainties and risks, it is possible that a number of factors may cause forecasts not to materialize. For example, legislative or regulatory changes, economic and business conditions and the level of competition are a non-comprehensive list of major factors that could influence, sometimes significantly, the accuracy of the forward-looking statements in this MD&A. This MD&A is dated June 28, 2012. The Fonds is subject to the Regulation Respecting Development Capital Investment Fund Continuous Disclosure (the “Regulation”) and, as such, applies the requirements of this Regulation, notably to its financial statements and its MD&A.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS World and United States For the last 12 months, the global economic and financial environment has been riddled with volatility and unpredictability. These factors were even more pronounced in developed countries, while in emerging countries, despite some slowdown, economic conditions were generally more favourable. The high volatility in stock markets even drove fears that a new period of economic contraction – which is not to say a recession – might occur in several industrialized countries. During this period, numerous investors flocked to the safety of fixed-income securities, which drove bond prices up. All this commotion also led to volatility in commodity prices, particularly copper, gold and oil. In the Eurozone, despite austerity plans that have been adopted by several countries, the sovereign debt crisis situation has remained particularly troublesome during the last 12 months, to such an extent that the stability of the entire European banking system was threatened. To contain this crisis, leaders of Eurozone countries and the European Central Bank (ECB) deployed massive efforts. In October 2011, for example, Eurozone member country leaders agreed on all the conditions of a bailout plan to lift Greece out of the crisis and avoid its spread to Italy or the other most fragile Eurozone countries. In addition, in December 2011 and February 2012, the ECB took decisive action by injecting liquidity into the markets to recapitalize the banks holding bonds of the most fragile Eurozone countries; this measure successfully averted a global credit crisis. However, the public finance crisis in Eurozone's most shaky countries is far from being resolved. Despite the agreement concluded in March 2012 between Greece and its private creditors to forgive over 100 billion Euros of its debt, Greece's situation is still troublesome, as is the situation with Spain, Italy and Portugal. In addition, several economists believe some countries in the Eurozone are currently in a recession. The U.S. economy, while far from sustained growth, successfully avoided a recession and even grew a little over the last 12 months. This seems to be a good sign, especially if you consider the political controversies highlighting this period – which fed fears of a possible recession – starting with the one surrounding raising the debt ceiling, which prompted Standard & Poor’s to downgrade its U.S. debt rating by one notch (from AAA to AA+), followed by the controversy surrounding the $US447 billion job market stimulus plan (The American Jobs Act). In general, over the last 12 months, economic growth was positive in the United States. After a slow start in the first quarter of 2011, the still shaky and troubled U.S. economy picked up steam during the following three quarters, only to lose momentum again in the first quarter of 2012. The savings rate dropped, settling at its lowest level since 2009 (3.4% in April 2012). The U.S. unemployment rate decreased over the last 12 months to 8.2% in May 2012, compared to 9.0% in May 2011. In terms of inflation, the annual fluctuation in the U.S. CPI was 2.8% on average since May 2011. Lastly, the key interest rate has remained unchanged at 0.25% since December 2008. 2 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) Canada and Québec There is no doubt the global economic troubles impacted Canada over the last 12 months. After a strong first quarter, the Canadian economy experienced a decrease in GDP in the second quarter of 2011, largely due to significant decline in its external trade. While remaining vulnerable to the decline in the global economic outlook, and given that the country is a key producer of natural resources, the Canadian economy regained momentum in the third quarter, notably due to relatively strong domestic demand, then slowed down in fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012. In terms of inflation, the annual fluctuation of the Canadian CPI has been 2.5% on average since May 2011. The unemployment rate decreased from 7.4% in May 2011 to 7.3% in May 2012. The Canadian dollar fluctuated against the U.S. dollar over the year and traded at $US0.97 on May 31, 2012, losing some value compared to $US1.02 as at May 31, 2011. The discount rate has remained unchanged at 1% since September 2010. Québec also saw a decline in GDP during the second quarter of 2011, after a rather strong first quarter. Despite tough economic conditions, the Québec economy nonetheless experienced a slight upturn in the following two quarters. The unemployment rate was 7.8% in May 2012, which is higher than the 7.3% recorded in May 2011, and higher than the rate for Canada (7.3%) and the same as the rate for Ontario (7.8%). As at May 31, 2012, short-term (2-year) and long-term (10-year) interest rates on Canadian government bonds were down compared to the rates prevailing a year ago. The credit spreads of provinces and investment-grade corporations worsened slightly over the last financial year. The increasing economic uncertainty of the last few months and the resulting instability in the stock and financial markets around the world had repercussions on the performance of many financial institutions, including the Fonds. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERALL RESULTS For the financial year ended May 31, 2012, the Fonds recorded net earnings of $215 million, compared to net earnings of $650 million for the prior year. With this result for the year, the Fonds generated a return of 2.6%, down from the return of 8.8% experienced for the previous year, in much more favourable economic conditions. The value of the Fonds’ shares therefore increased by $0.67 compared to the price reported in July 2011 and by $0.61 compared to January 2012 to stand at $26.59 as at July 5, 2012. The Fonds also reached new historic highs as at May 31, 2012 as it increased its number of shareholders to 594,287 and its net assets to $8.5 billion. As a result of its mission, a significant portion of the Fonds de solidarité FTQ’s portfolio is comprised of private securities and specialized funds, which enabled it to avoid the full effect of the decline on the stock markets that occurred in the first six-month period ended November 30, 2011. The Fonds’ asset allocation tends to limit its loss potential in a bear market, while the opposite occurs in a bull market. The Fonds was therefore able to achieve, for the financial year ended May 31, 2012, a return that was higher than the average return of Canadian balanced funds 1; this was largely attributable to its performance for the first six-month period of the year, when stock markets were experiencing a decline. 1 Canadian Neutral balanced funds, as compiled by globefund.com 3 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) FONDS RETURN Years ended May 31 2012 2011 Assets under Assets under management at management at end of year* Weight Return end of year* Weight Return $M % % $M % % Development capital investments 4,497 52.6 9.2 3,931 47.9 8.9 Other investments** 4,053 47.4 (0.1) 4,274 52.1 12.3 8,550 100.0 4.4 8,205 100.0 10.6 Total operating expenses (1.5) (1.5) Income tax and capital tax (0.3) (0.3) Fonds return (annual) 2.6 8.8 Fonds return (1st six-month period) 0.2 5.0 nd Fonds return (2 six-month period) 2.3 3.6 * Assets under management at end of year refer to the fair value, at the end of the year, of the assets managed by the Investments and Other Investments sectors and used to generate revenues presented in the Statement of Operations. This amount differs from the amount of assets presented in the financial statements, which includes, unlike assets under management, notes from the liquidity surpluses of regional and local funds and certain specialized funds. ** Other investments represent the remaining assets not invested in partner companies. Managed by the Other Investments sector, they consist of the following portfolios: bonds, cash and money market, sector-based shares, absolute return strategies, international infrastructure funds and high-income. SECTOR RESULTS Investments sector The assets managed by the Investments sector are essentially mission-driven development capital investments in public and private partner companies in the form of shares, units or loans. To stabilize its return, the Fonds favours a fair balance between investments in the form of loans – that are usually unsecured and provide a current return through interest payments –, investments in shares – that potentially generate a higher return but involve an increased level of volatility –, and investments in specialized fund units – that contribute to a better diversification of the Fonds’ portfolio while bringing private and foreign capital inflows to Québec. Development capital investments are governed by the Investment Policy, which is an important component of the Integrated Financial Assets Management Policy. The Investments sector earned a gross return of 9.2% for the year, up from the gross return of 8.9% generated for the prior year. Taking into account this return and given the level of mission-driven investments made by the Fonds during the year, the assets in this sector represented $4.5 billion or 52.6% of assets under management as at May 31, 2012 (47.9% as at May 31, 2011). The performance of the Investments sector is influenced by various factors, particularly the behaviour of the financial markets as well as the economic and business conditions in which our partner companies operate, and by the dynamic management of our investments. The gross return of 9.2% of the Investments sector for the year is largely explained by the following: • the return of 12.5% generated by our private securities and specialized funds portfolio during the year (compared to 6.2% for the previous year). This performance is essentially attributable to the general strength of the portfolio, which was emphasized this year in uncertain economic conditions, and to the gains realized on the disposal of some of our investments, including the investment we held in Enobia Pharma; • the negative return of 7.0% generated by our portfolio of listed securities during the year. This return is mainly explained by the poor performance of the stock markets for the first six-month period. Despite the positive returns posted for the second six-month period by some of our listed partner companies, the results for the first six-month period had a significant impact on the overall results of the portfolio. For the previous year, this portfolio had recorded a positive return of 23.0%, when the stock market conditions were much more favourable. 4 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) Other Investments sector The Other Investments sector manages the assets not invested in partner companies. Other investments consist of the following portfolios: bonds, cash and money market, sector-based shares, absolute return strategies, international infrastructure funds and highincome. As with development capital investments, other investments are managed in accordance with the Integrated Financial Assets Management Policy, which targets sound diversification of the Fonds’ financial assets. Under this policy, a sufficient portion of financial assets must be invested in a way that allows the Fonds to meet its liquidity needs, to produce current revenue sufficient to cover its expenses and to contribute to the generation of a reasonable return to its shareholders. For the year, the Other Investments sector earned a negative gross return of 0.1%, down from the positive gross return of 12.3% recorded for the prior year. The assets of this sector represented $4.1 billion or 47.4% of the Fonds’ assets under management as at May 31, 2012 (52.1% as at May 31, 2011). The evolution of interest rates and the performance of the stock markets are the determining factors in analyzing the performance of the Other Investments sector. Accordingly, the results achieved by this sector are influenced by the behaviour of the financial markets and the conditions affecting the Fonds’ economic environment. The negative gross return of 0.1% of the Other Investments sector for the year is largely explained by the following: • the decline in stock markets, resulting in part from the drop in commodity prices, which contributed to the negative return of 9.6% for the sector-based shares 2 and other securities 3 portfolios. This performance followed a positive return of 21.1% for the prior year, when the economic conditions both in Canada and internationally were much more favourable. • the return of 7.1% on our fixed-income securities portfolio for the year, compared to 6.4% for the previous year. The increase in value of bonds, mainly attributable to the decrease in interest rates for Government of Canada securities, combined with interest income generated by the portfolio, enabled us to earn this return.

Although it is essential that the Fonds has available resources to achieve its mission, it is also fundamental that it controls its expenses. Year after year, the Fonds was able to maintain its total operating expenses at a level it considers to be low. For the years ended May 31, 2012 and May 31, 2011, the ratio of total operating expenses to net average assets for the year, calculated using the method prescribed in the Regulation, was 1.5%. Expressed in dollars, total operating expenses amounted to $122.1 million for the year ended May 31, 2012, compared to $116.7 million for the previous year. This increase is attributable, amongst other factors, to expenses related to the disposal of investments during the year, management costs related to the increase in share subscriptions and redemptions as well as normal salary increases. 2 These sectors are materials, energy, consumer staples, utilities and telecommunications. 3 Other securities are comprised of the following portfolios: absolute return strategies, international infrastructure funds and high-income. 5 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS, BALANCE SHEET AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS Cash flows Cash flows from operating activities of the Fonds totalled $171 million for the year, up from $75 million for the previous year. Changes in these cash flows mainly result from our current operations. Cash flows from financing activities of the Fonds totalled $209 million for the year, compared to $161 million for the prior year. These cash flows for the year result mainly from issues of shares amounting to $767 million less redemptions of shares totalling $620 million 4 (compared to issues of shares of $698 million less redemptions of shares of $466 million4 for the previous year). Cash flows from investing activities of the Fonds represented a net cash outflow of $372 million for the year, compared to $238 million for the previous year. Cash needed to support net investments (acquisitions less proceeds from sales) in partner companies was chiefly provided by the cash flows from both operating activities and financing activities of the Fonds discussed above. The Fonds also has lines of credit available for its working capital requirements. As at May 31, 2012, these lines of credit were unused. Balance sheet and off-balance sheet items Balance sheet development capital investments increased from $4.3 billion as at May 31, 2011 to $4.9 billion as at May 31, 2012. This $649 million increase mainly resulted from our net disbursed investments of $378 million (disbursed investments of $903 million less disinvestments of $525 million) and the appreciation of our development capital investments during the year. During the year, on a commitment basis, the Fonds made development capital investments of $908 million, compared to $733 million for the prior year. On the other hand, amounts committed but not disbursed decreased from $919 million as at May 31, 2011 to $822 million as at May 31, 2012. Balance sheet other investments decreased by $67 million during the year to settle at $4.1 billion as at May 31, 2012 ($4.2 billion as at May 31, 2011). This decrease is mainly attributable to the volume of net development capital investments made during the year. The Fonds uses derivative financial instruments in particular to safeguard the value of its assets, to facilitate the management of its portfolios, to modify its asset allocation without increasing or decreasing the amounts managed by internal and external specialists and to improve its returns within allocated risk limits (see the “Risk Management” section on page 20 for more details). MISSION OF THE FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ FTQ, OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES MISSION AND OBJECTIVES The Fonds de solidarité FTQ is a union-based development capital investment fund that was born out of the Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec. Created in 1983 under the Act to Establish the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec (F.T.Q.), the Fonds endeavours to collect the savings of Quebeckers who want to participate in creating and maintaining jobs, in order to improve the situation of workers and to stimulate the Québec economy. The Fonds’ mission also includes raising awareness and encouraging workers to save for retirement as well as providing economic training to workers. The Fonds’ mission is strongly supported by both levels of government since shares of the Fonds qualify for RRSPs and give rise to a 15% tax credit at both the Québec and federal tax levels, for a total of 30% 5. The maximum tax credit is $1,500 per year, which corresponds to a purchase of $5,000 of shares. 4 This amount is presented on a cash basis and therefore includes the change in amounts payable between May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2012. 5 Please see the prospectus for more information. 6 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) STRATEGIES To implement its mission and to reach its objectives, the Fonds deployed various strategies, both from a global management perspective and by sector. The Fonds therefore implemented an Integrated Financial Assets Management Policy under which it manages its financial assets in an integrated and comprehensive way to produce a reasonable return for its shareholders while mitigating the volatility of the return from a six-month period to the next. Accordingly, the assets in the other investments portfolio are distributed in a way that is complementary to the portfolio of mission-driven investments made in partner companies. This strategy allows the Fonds to obtain, overall, the desired return/risk ratio. The Integrated Financial Assets Management Policy takes into account actual and expected changes in the Fonds’ business, particularly the decrease in net subscriptions (shares issued less shares redeemed) and the increase in the size of the portfolio of mission-driven development capital investments. In fact, the weight of investments disbursed by the Fonds, which as at May 31, 2012 was at a level of 53%, should gradually increase. This policy allows the Fonds to maintain the desired balance among the various components of the Fonds’ balance sheet and to review the target weight of each asset class with a view to maintaining the desired return/risk profile and continue to meet shareholders’ expectations. The Fonds may modify its targets depending on the circumstances and events that occur in the next few years. The significant volatility of financial and stock markets during recent financial years resulted in significantly modifying the actual weight of these various asset classes, which led the Fonds to rebalance its portfolio a few times. These rebalancings were made to comply with the limits and guidelines of the Integrated Financial Assets Management Policy regarding the target asset allocation. They were also a way to actively manage the portfolio within the limits set out by the policy to improve the return/risk profile, taking into consideration the general movement and erratic behaviour of financial and stock markets. The Shareholder Services sector The Shareholder Services sector is built on three strategic axes: developing systematic savings, mobilizing the LR (local representatives) network and building shareholder loyalty. For the financial year ended May 31, 2012, the Fonds collected subscriptions allowing it to make share issues totalling $767 million, compared to $698 million in the previous year. The number of new shareholders totalled 35,338; which helped the Fonds reach a new historic high of 594,287 shareholders as at May 31, 2012. Its financial performance and strength, publicity campaign, targeted marketing mailings, increased presence (particularly through its LR network throughout Québec and the opening of 59 field offices) during the RRSP period have all allowed the Fonds to increase the amount of lump-sum subscriptions by 23%, reaching $354 million for the financial year (compared to $288 million for the previous financial year). However, as expected, the volume of redemptions increased this year, amounting to $620 million as at May 31, 2012, compared to $465 million as at May 31, 2011. With shareholders getting closer and closer to retirement, the Fonds anticipates a heavier volume of annual share redemptions in the next few years. These major redemptions bring in their wake the need for the Fonds to renew its shareholder base. This is why for several years now our communication strategies have mainly targeted young people (40 years and under) and cultural communities. The 2011-2012 RRSP campaign alone allowed the Fonds to increase new subscriptions among young people by 51%, (compared to an increase of 12% during the 2010-2011 RRSP campaign). But beyond this axis of communication and the various means the Fonds uses to get the word out, it can also count, to meet its objectives, on a network of 2,083 LRs from FTQ-affiliated unions as well as non-FTQ-affiiliated unions the Fonds has agreements with. These LRs promote the Fonds in their workplace across Québec. They explain the Fonds' objectives and encourage their coworkers to subscribe to Fonds shares and thereby contribute to Québec's economic development while saving for retirement. Our LRs receive continuing education, which is provided in collaboration with the Fondation de la formation économique, to mobilize them around the Fond's mission and the development of systematic savings. The LRs are also supported by a team of coordinators and an LR service group. Thanks in large part to our LR network, subscriptions through payroll deduction continue to represent the largest proportion of the Fonds’ subscriptions. Our efforts over the last financial year to recruit new shareholders who contribute to their RRSP through payroll deduction combined with the increase in workplace campaigns (14% more than last year) paid off: 11,645 additional shareholders chose payroll deduction in this financial year, compared to 11,147 in the previous financial year. The financial year also saw something new: the Fonds began accepting enrolments and subscriptions online through its new portal, CyberFondsFTQ. The Fonds welcomed 11,927 new shareholders who executed transactions of $32 million through this platform. 7 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) The Investments sector The Investments sector’s strategies, which support the Fonds' achievement of its mission regarding development capital investments in Québec's economy, are integrated in the global perspective defined by the Integrated Financial Assets Management Policy, which includes the Investment Policy, and vary depending on fluctuations of the 60% rule which the Fonds must follow pursuant to its Incorporation Act (for more on this, see the 60% Rule section). To enable risk diversification, the Fonds allocates its investment portfolio among various economic sectors and avoids too much concentration in a single company or sector. Generally, the Fonds holds a minority interest in the companies it invests in, however it may exceptionally, in very specific situations, hold a majority or all the shares of a company. Over the years, this approach to investing has allowed the Fonds to develop extensive knowledge of the various sectors in which it invests, and its partner companies highly value the expertise this has allowed it to develop. Every year the Fonds undertakes an analysis to determine the sectors that will be prioritized given the behaviour of the financial markets and the economic and business conditions of the various sectors, as well as based on the dynamic management of its investments. The priorities are determined within the risk management framework implemented by the Investments sector more than five years ago, which helped improving the quality of the portfolio and stabilizing the return. Multidisciplinary teams support our investment specialists with their expertise: legal, tax, business valuation, market study, due diligence, labour relations and public market departments. A due diligence committee reviews all files submitted to governing bodies to identify the associated risks taking into consideration the Fonds’ mission. In addition, to deal with more difficult situations, the Senior Vice-President, Turnaround Management and Special Projects, together with the Vice-President, Legal Affairs, very closely monitors investments that entail greater credit risk. The Fonds makes significant investments in each category of development capital as defined by Canada’s Venture Capital & Private Equity Association (CVCA). The CVCA proposes classifying private equity investments into three categories: buyout capital, venture capital and mezzanine capital. 6 Applying this definition, the following graph presents the breakdown of our $3.8 billion development capital investments portfolio (at cost). 7 BREAKDOWN OF DEVELOPMENT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO BY CATEGORY (AT COST) As at May 31, 2012 6 Based on the classification proposed by the CVCA, a buyout capital investment consists of the purchase of shares of an established private or public company looking to grow organically or through acquisition. A venture capital investment consists of the purchase of shares of a company that is generally unlisted and in the start-up or early development stage. Mezzanine capital consists of subordinated debt or preferred shares with or without a variable portion in equity warrants. 7 On a fund disbursement basis, excluding investments in real estate funds and in listed securities acquired on the secondary market. 8 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) The Other Investments sector In managing the balance of assets not invested in partner companies (presented under “Other Investments” in the financial statements), the Other Investments sector is governed by the Integrated Financial Assets Management Policy which targets sound diversification of the Fonds’ financial assets. A sufficient portion of financial assets must be invested in a way that allows the Fonds to meet its liquidity needs, to produce current revenue sufficient to cover expenses and to contribute to the generation of a reasonable return to the shareholders. The portfolios in the Other Investments sector, except for the money market portfolio, part of the bond portfolio and the high-income portfolio are managed by external specialized managers. The three portfolios that are managed internally at the Fonds by a team of professionals represented $1.9 billion as at May 31, 2012, or 45% of the total amount of other investments (42% as at May 31, 2011). To improve the overall performance of these portfolios, the Fonds’ specialists have some latitude in buying and selling securities; these transactions must comply with the limits and guidelines of the Integrated Financial Assets Management Policy and are overseen by the Financial Assets Management Committee. For portfolios managed externally, the Fonds retains the services of specialized managers which allows optimizing the management of those portfolios. One of the benefits of this kind of management is the implementation of specialized management strategies, such as active management of the duration of the bond portfolio, which targets generating added value for the portfolios in question through the expertise the selected specialists have in the area. Using derivative financial instruments provides active management of market risks the Fonds is exposed to. When appropriate, the Other Investments sector develops a risk management strategy, which must be authorized by the appropriate governing bodies, to minimize the Fonds’ exposure to volatility in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or stock market prices. Over the last few years, based on the change of the weight of its development capital investments, the Fonds was led to aim for a gradual reduction of its bond portfolio as well as liquidate a large part of the securities in its high-income portfolio. The transactions required subsequent to these modifications to the target asset allocation were executed in an orderly fashion so the Fonds would not hurt its return. The activities of the Other Investments sector fall under the responsibility of two separate Vice-Presidents: the Vice-President, Marketable Securities Portfolio Management and the Vice-President, Financial Management and Strategy. This structure helps the Fonds continue prioritizing the optimization of its return/risk ratio despite the increasing complexity of financial markets. 60% RULE The 60% rule set out in the Fonds’ Incorporation Act stipulates that the Fonds’ average unsecured investments in qualified business enterprises must represent at least 60% of its average net assets of the previous financial year. The remaining assets may be invested in other financial vehicles for asset diversification and sound management purposes. The calculation method for this rule is based on the value of the Fonds’ assets, which depends in part on interest rate fluctuations and on the performance of stock markets and the economy in general. Even though market volatility is not something new, the fluctuations that result may, given the size of the Fonds, make it more difficult to manage the 60% rule. Accordingly, the last budget of the Government of Québec proposed to amend the Fonds’ Incorporation Act to allow flexibility in the calculation of average qualified investments. It would therefore be possible, under certain conditions, to include in the calculation excess qualified investments with respect to the 60% rule made in the two financial years preceding the current financial year. As at May 31, 2012, the value of average qualified investments 8 amounted to $5.1 billion or 67.0% of the average net assets of the previous financial year (compared to 71.0% as at May 31, 2011). Since the minimum percentage prescribed was reached as at May 31, 2012, the amount of share issues for the 2012-2013 financial year will not be limited by the 60% rule. As at May 31, 2012, the Fonds was also in compliance with all other limits and rules set out in its Incorporation Act. The Fonds expects to comply with all the limits and rules set out in its Incorporation Act over the next several years. 8 These investments include amounts committed but not disbursed as well as guarantees and suretyships. 9 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Fonds does not anticipate adopting new accounting policies that would significantly affect its net earnings for the next financial year or the value of its net assets as at May 31, 2013. INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS) In 2008, the Accounting Standards Board of Canada (AcSB) confirmed that Canadian GAAP would be replaced by IFRS for the years beginning on or after January 1, 2011, for publicly accountable enterprises. In December 2011, the AcSB confirmed that investment companies, as defined in the Accounting Guideline on investment companies of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) Handbook, will have to apply IFRS for the first time to interim and annual financial statements for the years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, at the latest. The Fonds therefore intends to meet the first-time adoption date and will prepare its first interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS as at November 30, 2014. IFRS conversion plan The Fonds adopted an IFRS conversion plan comprised of three phases: a diagnostic phase; a standards assessment, detailed analysis, issue resolution and model financial statements preparation phase; and a change integration phase. The first phase was completed before the end of the financial year ended May 31, 2009. This phase included identifying the IFRS having a significant impact on the Fonds as well as the main issues and priorities to assess in the context of the Fonds. The part of the second phase dealing with standards assessment, detailed analysis and issue resolution, was completed in May 2010. It included a more detailed analysis of the IFRS and the differences with current Canadian standards and their interpretations in order to identify the impact the conversion will have on processes, systems and the financial statements. In the coming months, the Fonds will prepare draft financial statements in accordance with the new standards. During the change integration phase, we will keep accounting records both under Canadian GAAP and IFRS to be able to present comparative information upon transition. In addition, the Fonds deployed its training plans, which are intended to upgrade the knowledge of its accounting staff and other stakeholders of the organization that are affected by the IFRS conversion. The Fonds continuously monitors the development of IFRS to assess its impact. 10 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) Main expected changes The following table presents only the significant differences between Canadian GAAP currently applied by the Fonds and IFRS. While noteworthy, these differences do not necessarily have a significant impact on the Fonds’ financial statements. This table was prepared based on current standards that would be effective as at the date of transition; however, certain standards could be amended and the Fonds could reassess its position as needed. The impact assessment reflects the results of the analysis based on the current situation.

As such, the calculation of future income taxes cannot reflect the favourable effect of refundable taxes. The Fonds believes that the IFRS conversion will not require major changes to its information systems, its data processing procedures and its various activities. The Fonds also believes that its current internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures will be sufficient and adequate for the adoption of the new IFRS and their disclosure requirements. REGULATION 31-103 The Fonds has been registered as an investment fund manager in accordance with Regulation 31-103 Respecting Registration Requirements and Exemptions since April 26, 2012. This registration should not have a material impact on the Fonds’ operations. 13 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) PAST PERFORMANCE This section presents the past performance of the Fonds. The past performance of the Fonds does not necessarily indicate how it will perform in the future. YEAR-BY-YEAR RETURNS OF THE FONDS The following chart shows the Fonds’ annual performance and illustrates how the Fonds’ performance has changed from year to year for the last ten financial years. The annual performance of the Fonds is calculated by dividing net earnings (net loss) per share for the financial year by the price per share at the beginning of the financial year. Such performance sometimes differs from the annual compound return to the shareholder because the annual performance of the Fonds is calculated taking into account share issuances and redemptions made during the year, which have a dilutive or accretive effect on net earnings (net loss) per share, as the case may be. ANNUAL COMPOUND RETURNS TO THE SHAREHOLDER At the current value of $26.59 per share, a shareholder who has invested at the beginning of each of the periods indicated below earns the following annual compound returns: The annual compound return to the shareholder is calculated by taking into account the annualized change in the price per share over the periods indicated. This return sometimes differs from the annual performance of the Fonds since, as mentioned above, it does not take into account the dilutive or accretive effect of share issuances and redemptions made during the year. Since the inception of the Fonds, the annual compound return to the shareholder has been 3.6%. ANNUAL COMPOUND RETURNS TO THE SHAREHOLDER (INCLUDING TAX CREDITS) Let’s take, for example, a shareholder who has invested an equal amount each year through payroll deduction. Including the Québec and federal labour-sponsored funds tax credits (each amounting to 15%) that this shareholder has received, at the current value of $26.59 per share, this shareholder earned an annual compound return of 13.1% and 9.8% for a 7-year and 10-year period, respectively. This return does not take into account the RRSP tax deductions. 14 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.)

CONTRIBUTION TO QUÉBEC’S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT In keeping with its mission, the Fonds made investments over the financial year that contributed to creating, maintaining or saving quality jobs in different sectors of the Québec economy. In the current, still uncertain economic conditions, the Fonds continues to play an important role in the development and growth of Québec companies. As such, during the financial year, the Fonds invested $908 million on a commitment basis to support Québec entrepreneurs in their development projects. We intensified our efforts to support traditional sectors throughout the financial year. Maibec inc., a manufacturer of lumber, valueadded wood, spruce siding and cedar products, received an investment of $12.5 million from the Fonds for its equipment modernization project. In addition, the Fonds invested $18.4 million in Groupe MBI, a manufacturer and distributor of drilling products and measuring instruments as well as other products used in the mining industry, which will facilitate the company’s succession and help it pursue its growth plan. In the recreational tourism sector, the Fonds has committed to supporting the overall development of the Montréal Impact soccer club and its successful entry into MLS through an investment of $7.5 million. Groupe Tolgeco, a construction materials distributor, also received an investment of $2.5 million to help implement its growth and activity diversification program. In the mining industry, Richmont Mines, a public company, received a $13.1 million investment from the Fonds to proceed with development work for the Wasamac mining project near Rouyn-Noranda. In the finance sector, the Fonds made an additional $21.9 million investment in Maple Group Acquisition Corporation to enable it to complete its financing to acquire TMX Group. In addition, the Fonds reinvested $300 million in SSQ Financial Group to enable it to acquire AXA Life Insurance. This strategic acquisition will allow SSQ to grow faster, diversify its activities and strengthen its position as a major player in the Canadian insurance and financial products market. In the new economy, $2 million was invested in Acquisio, a company that develops software to manage web-based advertising campaigns, allowing it to make its way on the international online advertising management market, thereby creating around 60 new jobs over the next 18 months. Another promising company, Maetta Sciences, which is specialized in manufacturing medical implants and instruments as well as parts for the aerospace industry, received a $3.3 million support from the Fonds. Lastly, as set out in the Government of Québec’s last budget, the Fonds and the Government of Québec are expected to invest $75 million and $95 million, respectively, during the next financial year in Fonds Valorisation Bois. This investment fund for high valueadded wood transformation will be set up to help businesses in the forestry industry move to new niches such as green construction, green energy, green chemicals, which are all supported by the forestry industry. POLICY FOR INVESTMENT OUTSIDE QUÉBEC 13 Over the years, the Fonds made investments pursuant to the Policy for Investment Outside Québec that have had significant economic spinoffs for Québec. During the financial year, the Fonds invested $47.2 million ($20 million in the previous year), in three companies in accordance with this policy. In the category of companies undertaking large-scale projects in Québec, the Fonds invested a total of $39.7 million in two companies: a $14.7 million investment in Stornoway Diamond Corporation as part of its diamond mining project in Northern Québec and a $25 million reinvestment in Fortress Paper to help it with its conversion and cogeneration project at its Lebel-sur-Quévillon plant and thereby hire 300 employees. During the financial year, $7.5 million was also invested in a company meeting the company impacting the Québec economy criteria ($14.4 million in the prior year). Meca Dev S.A.S. received this amount notably to start a boiler-making production facility in the Montréal Mécachrome plant and thereby create 30 jobs. In addition, it should be noted that no investment was made in private funds outside Québec during this financial year and the previous financial year. 13 Since 1998, the Fonds has been authorized by the Minister of Finance of Québec to invest outside Québec provided certain clearly defined conditions are met, notably with regards to economic spin-offs in Québec. The main groups of eligible investments are private funds outside Québec, companies impacting the Québec economy and large-scale investment projects (financing for expansion, modernization, productivity improvement). 16 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) THE FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ FTQ INVESTMENT NETWORK Since its inception in 1983, the Fonds has built a solid investment network that provides entrepreneurs who follow their ambitions with patient capital based on their needs. A veritable business hub brimming with ideas, talent and knowledge, this network offers the Fonds' partner companies the opportunity to share their concerns with other SMEs, learn from past experiences and forge new business ties. The Fonds’ investment network revolves around five levels of investment: • The Fonds de solidarité FTQ generally offers $2 million and up for large companies. • The fonds régionaux de solidarité FTQ, which cover all of Québec, generally offer capital ranging from $100,000 to $2 million to meet the needs of businesses in their region. • The local solidarity funds, created by the Fonds and the Québec Federation of Municipalities, generally offer $5,000 to $100,000 to small businesses. • The fonds immobiliers de solidarité FTQ are specialized in real estate investment and development. Their main objective is to create and save jobs through building or renovating major office buildings and commercial, industrial, institutional and residential properties. • The other specialized funds form an investment network in Québec and abroad that invests in assorted industries. The Fonds’ commitment o this network continued in 2011-2012, with the continued goal to facilitate Québec SMEs’ access to capital in all their stages of development. Since January 2011, Québec entrepreneurs have had access to the entire Fonds investment network through its Website: www.fondsftq.com. In addition to searching for our financing projects and for members of our teams of experts, this one-stop shop for investment provides details on the Fonds, the regional funds, the local funds and the real estate funds. The following graph shows the breakdown of the Fonds’ investments based on its various network components: DISTRIBUTION OF INVESTMENTS BY NETWORK COMPONENTS (AT COST) As at May 31, 2012 17 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) OUTLOOK AND TRENDS ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK World and United States The sovereign debt crisis situation in the Eurozone (see the Economic Conditions section) remains worrisome. Long-term refinancing transactions of 1,000 billion Euros were launched in December 2011 and February 2012 by the European Central Bank to recapitalize the banks holding bonds from the most fragile Eurozone countries. We will have to wait and see if this will buy enough time for European country leaders to bring about the structural reforms necessary to resolve the crisis. The recession that many economists say certain countries in the Eurozone are firmly in could extend throughout 2012, which would undoubtedly have repercussions on the growth of these countries’ commercial partners. However, and despite continuing uncertainty, the U.S. economy is showing some signs of growth and emerging countries appear to have the tools necessary to grow despite challenging economic conditions. These economies should therefore be able to pick up the slack to support the global economy over the next several months. In the United States, the risk of the European financial crisis spreading, which seemed to have faded, could increase again over the next few months depending on the reactions of political and monetary authorities. Skyrocketing gas prices over the last 12 months have raised fears over the effect this could have on consumer spending. Many economists nonetheless believe that consumption should hold steady, provided that employment figures continue to climb. Despite a small rise in home prices in some areas, the situation of the U.S. real estate sector is still troubling given the major structural issues it must overcome. Regardless, an improved credit availability due to the lower interest rate combined with the uptick in demand should likely increase consumer spending and thereby U.S. GDP. In this context, the U.S. Federal Reserve agreed to continue its accommodating monetary policy by maintaining its key interest rates at the current level (0.25%) until mid-2014. Canada and Québec Many economists believe that Canadian economic growth should continue at a moderate pace for the next few months. Consumers should be part of the equation, but much more prudently. The value of the loonie, close to parity with the U.S. dollar, should encourage Canadian companies to invest (in machinery and equipment). The real estate market, which never truly suffered from the financial crisis, should show some signs of cooling off, but more so in some regions of the country than in others. Two other major factors should limit Canadian economic performance: external trade and government spending. In external trade, the growth in exports resulting from the expected recovery of the U.S. economy will very likely be offset by a jump in imports, mainly due to growth in business investments. Accordingly, at the end of the day, external trade's contribution to Canadian GDP should be quite small, almost negligible. For government spending, budget balancing efforts at both the federal and provincial level and the end of the stimulus plans will likely have a downward impact on the growth of government spending, and consequently on GDP growth. In light of the challenges the European economy faces and the uncertainty that still plagues the American economy, the Bank of Canada, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, seems to want to send to the market the message that the discount rate (currently at 1%) will not be raised in the near future, while at the same time reminding that the level of Canadian consumer debt remains very high. Given current economic conditions, we forecast that over the next few months the Canadian dollar will fluctuate between $US0.93 and $US1.08, while interest rates on Canadian 10-year and 30-year bonds should vary in a range of up to 100 basis points. In Québec, after a year 2011 that was chaotic on the economic front, to say the least, GDP should grow at a relatively weak pace in 2012. The main concerns for Québec's economic outlook are job growth and consumer confidence. Despite a small improvement in the opening months of 2012, employment is slow to recover the losses of the fourth quarter of 2011. Consumer confidence does not seem to be on the rebound, and leading indicators are not pointing to a recovery in the next few months, which makes room for doubt about the hoped-for recovery in consumer spending. 18 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) TRENDS IN THE VENTURE CAPITAL INDUSTRY 14 After a drop of 9% in 2010, the Québec venture capital market posted noticeable growth in 2011, both in terms of the number of companies financed and amounts invested. More specifically, dollars invested in venture capital in Québec increased 48% compared to 2010 levels, and the number of Québec companies in the technology and non-technology sectors that received venture capital in 2011 grew by 45% compared to the previous year. The Québec venture capital market grew more quickly than the Canadian market, so that Québec's market share represented over 36% of amounts invested in Canada in 2011, compared to 33% in 2010. Québec also remained at the front of the pack in terms of the number of companies financed through venture capital in 2011, with 58% of the Canadian total, compared to 50% in 2010. However, this situation seems to have changed in the first quarter of 2012 if we rely on the results presented by Réseau Capital, the Québec Venture Capital and Private Equity Association, which show that venture capital investments in Québec fell 63% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. It remains to be seen if this is a momentary drop or the start of a new trend. Canadian venture capital funds greatly intensified their activities in 2011 by investing 49% more in dollar terms than in the previous year. Once again, it was labour-sponsored funds and other tax-advantaged funds that dominated investment activities in Québec: in 2011, amounts invested by these funds increased 21% over 2010. While activities of tax-advantaged funds represent 30% of the Québec market, they only represent 16% of the market on a Canada-wide scale. However, venture capital raised in Canada did not increase significantly in 2011. In fact, this new capital reached $1.0 billion in 2011, or a modest increase of 2% over 2010. However, thanks notably to the importance of the role of tax-advantaged funds, Québec once again increased its share of funds raised in Canada in 2011 and accounted for a 53% share of the total raised, compared to 42% in 2010 and 36% in 2009. THE SAVINGS MARKET AND RRSP With the current economic conditions characterized by volatile and unpredictable financial and stock markets, the level of Canadian household debt calculated as a percentage of personal disposable income continues to reach unprecedented heights. This rate was 153% in the third quarter of 2011 (compared to 150.6% in the previous quarter). On the other hand, the savings rate continues to plummet: it settled at 2.9% in 2011, compared to 3.7% in 2010. We therefore note that households increased their debt level to the detriment of savings, as is also shown by the results of SOM’s annual survey on the RRSP market (of 1,000 RRSP holders in Québec). This survey revealed that the RRSP contribution rate dropped 3% to settle at 62% in 2011, compared to 65% in 2010. The good performance of the Fonds in these economic conditions that are hostile to savings shows once again the importance of one of the components of its mission: to raise awareness of Quebeckers of the importance of saving. Another significant element that strengthened the Fonds' position is its return, which favourably compared to unsecured products such as balanced mutual funds, not to mention the tax credits to which its shares give rise. The Fonds therefore attracted a large number of savers even in the midst of conditions that strongly incited them to invest in secured products such as term deposits or government bonds. Clearly, this success is due to other factors we should highlight: the involvement of a network of over 2,000 local representatives (LRs), the opening of 59 field offices during the RRSP campaign, a successful relationship marketing approach and advertising campaigns aimed at the general public and at unionized groups. It should be noted that the Government of Québec announced in the last budget its intention to launch voluntary retirement savings plans (VRSPs). Companies with at least five eligible employees will be required to offer this type of plan unless they already provide all their employees the opportunity to contribute to a retirement savings plan through payroll deduction, which is possible with the Fonds' RRSP. This could therefore represent a fantastic opportunity for the Fonds to increase its shareholder base. 14 As previously mentioned, Canada’s Venture Capital & Private Equity Association (CVCA) proposes classifying private equity investments into three categories: buyout capital, venture capital and mezzanine capital. As such, the information presented in this section only concerns the venture capital category and is therefore not representative of the Fonds’ overall development capital investments, which are allocated among all three categories. In addition, most of the information presented in this section covers the 2011 calendar year, which is different than the Fonds’ financial year. 19 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) FONDS OUTLOOK 15 Based on current financial and economic outlooks, and given our mission and investment strategy, we are anticipating an average annual return of 2.5% to 3%. This return does not take into account the tax credits granted to shareholders upon purchasing shares of the Fonds and is subject to significant volatility on a six-month or annual basis. While the Fonds is confident it will reach its return objective over a long period, the annual return depends on current economic conditions and the ups and downs of the stock and financial markets. Therefore, the Fonds’ return over the 2012-2013 year will be greatly influenced by stock market returns. The return for private securities is also linked to the general performance of the economy and may be lower than their historic average returns, particularly because of an increase in the cost of credit, adverse impact of economic conditions, the volatility of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar and the effects of foreign competition. The Fonds is targeting a ratio of total operating expenses to average net assets similar to the ratio achieved during the financial year ended May 31, 2012. With projected share issues higher than anticipated redemptions, the Fonds’ net assets should increase over the 2012-2013 year. However, net subscriptions (shares issued less shares redeemed) could be lower than in the previous years, particularly because of the anticipated increase in share redemptions, as previously mentioned in this report. Consequently, considering the current 60% rule level, the volume of investments made by the Fonds will likely not exceed the levels recorded in the last financial years. RISK MANAGEMENT Sound risk management practices are vital to the success of the Fonds de solidarité FTQ. We manage our risk within a framework taking into account the nature of our activities and the risks we can reasonably assume considering the desired return/risk ratio and shareholder expectations. To that end, we capitalize on a structured process to determine, measure and control the significant risks with which we must contend. Notice to readers: The following four paragraphs and the sections on market risk, credit and counterparty risk and liquidity risk form an integral part of the financial statements on which an unmodified opinion was expressed in an independent auditors’ report issued on June 28, 2012. The Fonds manages all its financial instruments in an integrated, comprehensive manner in accordance with the standards set out in the Integrated Financial Assets Management Policy adopted by the Board of Directors. This policy covers both development capital investments and other investments. It sets goals, guidelines and several limits so that the Fonds’ management can ensure that the target return/risk profile is reached. The Fonds uses derivative financial instruments in particular to safeguard the value of its assets, to facilitate the management of its portfolios, to modify its asset allocation without increasing or decreasing the amounts managed by internal and external specialist and to improve its returns within allocated risk limits. During the year ended May 31, 2012, the risk management approach continued to evolve, after the Fonds undertook, two years ago, a process to implement an integrated risk management framework. The objective of this process was essentially to provide the Fonds’ management with an overall vision of all risks to ensure that they are managed in accordance with their degree of importance. The production of an integrated risk profile allowed prioritizing the key financial and non-financial risks to which the Fonds is exposed, before and after considering the effectiveness of the controls implemented to mitigate the Fonds’ exposure to these risks. A mitigation strategy was developed for some of these risks, and action plans were set up. Other action plans are also intended to validate the existing controls aimed at managing certain of these risks. Several action plans have now been completed, and others will continue to be implemented in the next year. The integrated risk management approach was also designed to improve risk governance, monitoring and reporting. To this end, the Board of Directors of the Fonds adopted, in May 2012, the Integrated Risk Management Policy, a policy that sets out the Fonds’ requirements in that regard while specifying the responsibilities of the main stakeholders involved. This new policy is effective as of June 1, 2012 and will be implemented during the 2012-2013 financial year. In addition, at the beginning of the financial year, the Fonds deployed its risk scorecard, which is integrated with its corporate scorecard and allows the Fonds’ management to monitor the evolution of its risks with respect to its business objectives and its strategies. In the normal course of business, the Fonds is exposed to various risks; the principal ones are presented below. 15 The outlook presented in this MD&A reflects the Fonds’ expectations with respect to future events, based on information available to the Fonds as at June 28, 2012, and presupposes certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Many factors, several of which are beyond our control, may cause the Fonds’ actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from explicit or implicit expected future results, performance, or achievements. 20 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) MARKET RISK Market risk, which is inherent to the Fonds’ participation in financial markets, represents the risk of losses in value arising from fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates and prices of listed financial instruments. More specifically, this risk varies with the financial markets’ conditions and certain parameters of these markets, such as volatility, that may lower the value of the Fonds’ financial assets and thus have a negative impact on its Balance Sheet and Statement of Operations. Difficult economic or financial conditions may thus have a negative impact on the value of the Fonds’ shares. The Fonds manages market risk by allocating its financial assets across several classes. In addition, it invests in various industries (government and government agencies, financial institutions, technology, manufacturing and primary, services and tourism, regional or local funds and real estate) and geographic areas, within the limits allowed by its Incorporation Act. The Fonds’ financial assets are especially sensitive to listed share prices and fluctuations in bond interest rates (Canada bond rates and credit spreads). The Fonds’ financial assets are also sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations, but since most of its transactions are in Canadian dollars, the Fonds’ direct exposure to currency risk is relatively low. Furthermore, common hedging mechanisms such as foreign currency forward contracts are generally used for other investments in a foreign currency. During the 2009-2010 financial year, in response to the significant appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the Fonds decided to gradually reduce, over the following six-month periods, from 100% to 50% the hedge of its sector-based shares portfolio against currency risk. The Fonds continues to work towards this objective despite a temporary stop in the reduction of the hedge level during the year, as the sector-based shares hedging ratio was 52.5% as at May 31, 2012, which is the same level as at May 31, 2011. For the portion of the bond portfolio that is internally managed, the sharp interest rate fluctuations led us to enter into hedging transactions several times during the year. During this period, the hedge level for this portion of the portfolio ranged from 10.8% to 27.8%, and it was 16.5% as at May 31, 2012 (10.8% as at May 31, 2011). However, it was agreed in April 2012 to eliminate all hedges against an increase in interest rates. This strategy will be gradually deployed when the rate markets provide us with a window for action. Sensitivity analyses and simulations are used to inform senior management of material levels of market risk exposure. The Fonds uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its market risk exposure and safeguard the value of its assets. A sensitivity analysis is presented hereafter for each of the three market risk categories to which the Fonds’ financial assets are exposed, namely changes in interest rates, listed share prices and exchange rates. These analyses reflect the changes made to existing hedging levels aimed at reducing the Fonds’ exposure to interest rate risk and currency risk. SENSITIVITY OF THE FONDS’ RESULTS TO MARKET RISK (in millions of dollars) May 31, 2012 May 31, 2011 Change in bond interest rates* 1% increase in bond interest rates (134) (131) 1% decrease in bond interest rates 134 131 Change in listed share prices** 10% increase in listed share prices 215 214 10% decrease in listed share prices (215) (214) Change in exchange rates*** 10% appreciation of the Canadian dollar (77) (69) 10% depreciation of the Canadian dollar 77 69 * This analysis is performed on bonds held by the Fonds presented under Other investments in the financial statements.

In this analysis, the impact on results takes into account the use of stock index futures. *** This analysis is performed on securities denominated in foreign currencies held by the Fonds presented under Development capital investments and Other investments in the financial statements. In this analysis, the impact on results takes into account the use of foreign currency forward contracts. 21 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) The value of unlisted financial instruments in the development capital investments portfolio is established using approved and accepted valuation techniques. These techniques are based on a set of assumptions that take into account market conditions such as exchange rates, economic growth, credit spreads, etc. as at the valuation date. Since the assumptions used are highly interrelated, a sensitivity analysis that isolates the impact of only one of these variables on the unlisted securities portfolio is not considered to fairly represent the sensitivity of the results. In addition, the fair value of certain financial instruments, in particular other investments and listed securities in the development capital investments portfolio, is determined based on external information and, consequently, no other reasonably possible assumption can be applied to the valuation techniques. Despite this, management assessed the situation for loans, bonds and advances as well as for unlisted securities valued using the capitalization of cash flows method, and determined that using possible alternative assumptions would not result in significantly different fair values. CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY RISK The Fonds’ exposure to credit risk stems mainly from its mission-driven development capital investments, which are generally unsecured. Its other investment activities generally entail less of this risk since the counterparties concerned are typically more financially solid (governments, banks, etc.). Credit risk is the potential for loss due to the failure of a partner company (financial instruments presented under Development capital investments), issuer or counterparty in a transaction (financial instruments presented under Other investments) to honour its contractual obligations or due to a degradation of its financial position. The Fonds manages this risk through several means, including a due diligence process to ensure that the credit risk level is acceptable. The Fonds maintains a sound diversification of its assets through the Integrated Financial Assets Management Policy. Compliance with this policy therefore enables the management of concentration risk associated with the exposure to an issuer or group of issuers with common characteristics (industries, credit ratings, etc.). EXPOSURE TO CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY RISK (fair value as a percentage of net assets) May 31, 2012 May 31, 2011 Weight of the five largest investments (Development capital investments) 19.7* 14.0* Weight of the five largest issuers or counterparties (Other investments) 13.8** 15.7** * The portion attributable to investments that do not constitute a significant concentration risk given their large number of investees represented 9.7% as at May 31, 2012 (8.5% as at May 31, 2011). ** The portion attributable to securities issued or guaranteed by the governments of Québec, Ontario or Canada represented 12.7% as at May 31, 2012 (15.7% as at May 31, 2011). The summary of investment portfolio presented previously also discloses relevant information on the credit and counterparty risk concentration level. Targets by industries, in keeping with the Fonds’ internal structure, are approved each year for the development capital investments portfolio. These targets are set using risk budget management. Based on an optimal risk level defined by the Fonds for this portfolio as a whole by taking into account its mission, risk budget management facilitates a more effective monitoring and control of the portfolio profile and sector allocation by risk level. The return/risk balance of this portfolio is achieved through a sector-based risk budget allocation that takes into account the higher risk of our investments in certain sectors. We regularly re-examine the status of development capital investments to justify their classification in one of the following three categories: compliant with internal criteria, under watch or in turnaround. To deal with the more difficult situations, an internal committee closely monitors investments that entail greater credit risk. CLASSIFICATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO (fair value in millions of dollars) May 31, 2012 May 31, 2011 Compliant with internal criteria 4,562 4,076 Under watch 334 177 In turnaround 23 17 4,919 4,270 22 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) In the case of the other investments portfolio, issuer and counterparty ratings and compliance with exposure limits by borrower or counterparty contribute to managing credit and counterparty risk of the portfolio and to diversifying our assets. These criteria are set based on the risks specific to each asset class and reduce the risk that our results will be materially affected in the event of a payment default. As at May 31, 2012, the weighted average credit rating of bonds was AA-, compared to AA as at May 31, 2011 and to A as at May 31, 2010.

LIQUIDITY RISK The Fonds must make disbursements on a daily basis. Cash outflows occur when the Fonds redeems shares held by shareholders, disburses amounts it committed to invest in partner companies, reimburses notes payable and pays expenses. It is worth noting that the Fonds is required to redeem shares only in the circumstances set out in its Incorporation Act, or to purchase them by agreement in exceptional situations provided under a policy adopted for such purpose by the Board of Directors and approved by the Minister of Finance of Québec. The Fonds must be able to obtain the liquidity required to meet its commitments. Liquidity risk is therefore related to the potential for loss due to its inability to meet such commitments. In certain cases, securities acquired on the market can be subject to resale restrictions, thus potentially reducing their liquidity. The Fonds’ Incorporation Act provides that part of the financial assets of the Fonds may be invested in marketable securities on organized markets, such as stock and bond markets, so we can easily obtain cash. The Fonds also has access to bank credit facilities for additional sources of liquidity. As at May 31, 2012, the ratio of liquid financial assets 16 as a percentage of assets under management was 51.5% (54.3% as at May 31, 2011), demonstrating, in management’s opinion, that the Fonds has the required liquidity to fulfill all its obligations and commitments, even under potential scenarios that would be unfavourable to it. OPERATIONAL RISK Inherent to all the Fonds’ activities, operational risk is the risk of sustaining losses as a result of the inadequacy or failure of certain processes or systems in place or due to human factors or external events. This risk also includes legal risk. Effective policies, standards and procedures are implemented to manage this risk. Control principles and mechanisms are monitored and periodically revised with a view to continuous improvement. The Fonds’ operational risk management and the effectiveness of its management framework are underpinned by the following guiding principles: • Competent, well-trained staff; • A succession management program; • A culture of integrity; • Segregation of incompatible duties; • Adoption of a concept of independence inspired by the securities regulations applicable to public companies; • Delegation of decision-making authority to Special Boards whose majority of members are external to the Fonds and the FTQ; • Monitoring of the development capital investment valuation process; • Implementation of a framework program of financial compliance; • Monitoring of technology development and information security; • A planning process for resumption of activities in the event of business interruption; • Continuous monitoring of changes in applicable legislation, regulations and standards, including the Fonds’ compliance therewith; • Risk identification and assessment when new products or activities are implemented. 16 Liquid financial assets are comprised of fixed-income securities (cash, bonds and money market securities), listed shares of the other investments portfolio and certain listed shares of the development capital investments portfolio. 23 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) The Codes of Ethics and Conduct define, among other things, the rules of conduct to be followed by employees, officers and directors to avoid, for instance, conflict of interest situations. All employees or officers must, in the execution of their duties, put the interests of the Fonds ahead of their own or those of third parties. They must also avoid placing themselves in a conflict of interest situation, either real, potential or apparent. The Codes of Ethics and Conduct prohibit, among others, certain personal trading deemed conflictual, including receiving certain gifts and using any advantage, information or interest related to the Fonds that would be incompatible with the professional duties and responsibilities of an employee. In addition, the Codes forbid the disclosure by directors and employees, for purposes other than the execution of their duties, of confidential information obtained through such execution. Each year, all employees must complete a statement of interests held and a statement on the compliance of their conduct with the Code. The Codes of Ethics and Conduct for management and unionized personnel were updated in 2009, and training was provided to all employees. The Codes provide for a whistleblowing procedure for cases of non-compliance with the Code involving financial or accounting information or illegal acts. During the year, the Fonds also undertook an analysis of the risk of fraud and misconduct to which it is exposed. Although this risk was not assessed as high following this analysis, recommendations to improve its control environment will be implemented by the Fonds in the next months. To diversify its financial assets management, the Fonds also calls upon the services of specialized external managers and acquires interests in specialized funds. Where appropriate, the Fonds purchases insurance that transfers to insurers certain components of operational risk related to these activities. OTHER RISKS The Fonds is also exposed to other risks such as strategic and reputation risks, which could result in negative financial consequences. Strategic risk, which includes competitive risk and risk associated with regulatory changes, refers to the possibility of incurring losses as a result of ineffective strategies, lack of integrated business strategies or the inability to adapt the strategies to changes in the business environment. This risk is managed through monitoring and strategic and operational planning processes that seek input from all levels of the organization; the resulting plans are submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. The Management Committee periodically monitors the business plans and strategic objectives of the Fonds and each sector. Any strategic decision or change to the Fonds’ already adopted orientations that could have a material impact is authorized beforehand by the appropriate governing bodies, based on the powers delegated to them. Reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity, whether founded or unfounded, will cause losses, a decrease in liquidity or a decline in the customer base. The Fonds controls and manages reputation risk through the following, among others: proper training, legal and financial due diligence for all its capital development investments, sound governance practices, the application of policies and procedures, and ownership of the Codes of Ethics and Conduct by all officers and employees. The Fonds is a responsible corporate citizen that takes ethical, social and environmental aspects into consideration when making investment decisions. We have also adopted a voting rights policy with regards to public partner companies and a code of conduct for international business dealings. The Fonds also ensures that any financial information released outside the organization is accurate and validated beforehand. In 2008, the Fonds implemented a Disclosure Policy concerning all financial and non-financial information issued and/or disclosed externally and the information that is communicated internally to a large number of employees. The main objectives of this policy are to provide a disclosure framework and standards, to ensure that information disclosed is rigorously prepared and validated, to make the Fonds’ employees aware of disclosure principles, and to specify the roles and responsibilities of the main participants in the disclosure process. The application of this policy is monitored by a Disclosure Committee composed of members of the Fonds’ management. The main responsibilities of this Committee are to set disclosure guidelines, to implement and keep up to date the Disclosure Policy and ensure it is complied with, and to ensure that relevant and effective disclosure controls and procedures are in place. The Disclosure Committee reports its activities to the Management Committee. Given the growing use of social media by the Fonds and its employees, the Fonds implemented during the year a new policy, the Social Media Policy. This policy governs the use of these tools to prevent any harm or damage to the image or the reputation of the Fonds resulting from such use. All employees were trained following the implementation of this policy. 24 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) GOVERNANCE RISK GOVERNANCE The Management Committee, comprised of the President and CEO and executives, is responsible for the global management of the Fonds de solidarité FTQ’s operations. Because risk governance is an essential part of integrated financial assets management, the Fonds has put in place a management framework to ensure that risk management and control strategies and resulting operational decisions take the established level of acceptable risk into account. This management framework is as follows: Our risk governance structure is built upon a series of policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Fonds regularly reassesses policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures to incorporate the best possible practices. It should be noted that the functions of Chairman of the Board and President and CEO are separate. The implementation process of an integrated risk management framework, that was launched two years ago and led to the adoption by the Board of Directors of the Integrated Risk Management Policy in May 2012 (see the “Risk Management” section), also had some effects on the risk governance structure. The roles and responsibilities of the Fonds’ governing bodies, internal committees and main stakeholders involved were specified in this policy. The Board of Directors of the Fonds thus reconfirmed its responsibility for integrated risk management while delegating to the Executive Committee the monitoring of some work and their results in that respect. In addition to the governance structure, the Integrated Risk Management Policy sets out the organization’s requirements with respect to the integrated management of all types of risks, ensures that risk management is closely related to the “total” risk appetite and determines an approach whereby all significant risks and their interrelations are considered in the development of the organization and the maintenance of the return/risk balance. The Vice-President responsible for the integrated risk management framework reports directly to the President and CEO in carrying out his duties, and he is supported by an Integrated Risk Management Advisory Committee. The Integrated Financial Assets Management Policy, which is under the Integrated Risk Management Policy, is a key piece of this management framework. The policy sets out the target financial asset allocation allowing the Fonds to fulfill its mission while meeting the desired return/risk ratio through sound diversification that helps mitigate the volatility of such return from a six-month period to the next. This policy also provides objectives, guidelines, and limits within which our managers and professionals perform their duties and carry out their mandates. In fact, the Integrated Financial Assets Management Policy is composed of several policies covering general principles, orientations, and the limits and guidelines applicable to various asset classes, including a separate policy applicable to the Investments sector. The detailed guidelines and procedures covering the management of financial assets on an operational basis are presented separately to facilitate their application. 25 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) KEY GOVERNING BODIES BOARD OF DIRECTORS, DELEGATE BOARDS AND COMMITTEES The Board of Directors carries out the following duties: • Ensuring the Fonds’ mission, Incorporation Act and any other law it is subject to are followed while adhering to its values of solidarity and responsibility; • Approving the main directions, policies and business strategies of the Fonds, notably in regards to integrated financial asset management and integrated risk management; • Ensuring there are controls over the Fonds’ management, including over risk management, and ensuring a culture of integrity; • Approving investment recommendations for which it is responsible and monitoring them; • Evaluating the Fonds’ performance on a regular basis. Members of the Board of Directors are nominated or elected according to the rules set out in the Fonds’ Incorporation Act. In carrying out its mandate, the Board delegates part of its responsibilities. Delegate Boards and Committees are responsible for decisions related to development capital investments and, in accordance with Section 8 of its Incorporation Act, to the purchase by agreement of shares of the Fonds. These Delegate Boards and Committees include the Executive Committee, the four Special Boards created for the Traditional, New Economy, Mining Portfolio and Turnaround and Majority Interests sectors as well as the Purchase-by-Agreement Decision-Making Committee, which is responsible for approving the purchase by agreement requests made by our shareholders. Each development capital investment of $5 million or more must be authorized by the Board of Directors, or the Executive Committee if the Board of Directors is unable to meet in a timely fashion; in addition, each of these investments must be recommended by the Special Board overseeing the corresponding activities. All investments of less than $5 million are under the authority of the corresponding Special Board, except for the Mining Portfolio, whose limit is $1 million. The four Special Boards are composed of a majority of members who are external to the Fonds and the FTQ, while the Purchase-by-Agreement Decision-Making Committee is comprised of Fonds employees. The Executive Committee examines, at least once every six-month period, management’s reports on integrated risk management. Using these reports, the Committee reports to the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee and the Financial Assets Management Committee, as required. It also recommends policies for integrated risk management that are proposed by management, as needed. AUDIT COMMITTEE The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of members who are external to the Fonds in accordance with Regulation 52-110 respecting Audit Committees, and its mandate includes: recommending the audited financial statements and MD&A for approval by the Board of Directors; approving the principles for valuing development capital investments and receiving the Valuation Committee’s report; enquiring about the effectiveness of internal controls implemented by management and the fact that they are not overridden; enquiring about the compliance and risk management process for preparing the Fonds’ financial statements and provide feedback; and receiving the Ethics Committee report and overseeing the application of the Code of Ethics for Board members. The Committee also ensures the Fonds complies with the statutes, regulations and agreements that govern its operations and that may have a material financial impact. The Audit Committee reports its activities to the Board of Directors and makes recommendations to it when necessary. In addition, an Ethics Committee composed of members of management support the Audit Committee in monitoring the application of the Fonds’ Codes of Ethics and Conduct. FINANCIAL ASSETS MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE This committee is responsible for monitoring the implementation, compliance with and updating of the Integrated Financial Assets Management Policy, including the Investment Policy and the policies applicable to the various asset classes of the Other Investments sector. Its primary mandate is to ensure that asset management is coordinated and linked. In this capacity, it recommends the overall vision and orientation for financial assets management to the Board of Directors. This committee also monitors performance, changes in the return/risk ratio and ensures that the Fonds’ activities are in compliance with all its financial assets management policies, and ensures that the Fonds has adequate and sufficient guidelines and procedures. The Financial Assets Management Committee reports to the Board of Directors twice yearly on its activities and makes recommendations to it when necessary. VALUATION COMMITTEE Composed of a majority of qualified valuators independent from the Fonds, the Valuation Committee is mandated to provide a reasonable assurance that the procedure used for valuing the development capital investments portfolio complies with the procedure set out in the Regulation Respecting Development Capital Investment Fund Continuous Disclosure. The Valuation Committee reports on its review to the Audit Committee twice yearly. 26 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) VALUATION FRAMEWORK Development capital investments and other investments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 17. However, the majority of the Fonds’ development capital investments are made in private companies or specialized funds for which a fair value must be established because the securities issued by these companies or funds are not traded on organized, public markets. Specialized valuators employed by the Fonds determine the fair value of these investments. These valuators report to the Executive Vice-President, Finance and follow a structured process comprising several verification and validation steps to ensure the quality, uniformity and integrity of the work performed and of the resulting fair value. The management framework that governs the procedure for valuing development capital investments is set out in the Regulation Respecting Development Investment Fund Continuous Disclosure. In particular, the Regulation specifies the minimum qualifications required for specialized valuators employed by the Fonds as well as the governing body responsible for approving the valuation principles used. The Regulation also requires that all relevant information about the valuations (excluding publicly traded issuers valued using market prices) should be provided to an independent valuation committee. In addition, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer must sign a certification stating that the valuation procedures set out in the Regulation were complied with and confirming the aggregate fair value of the development capital investments portfolio. This certification has been submitted to the Audit Committee on a half-year basis since May 31, 2009. FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE While not required to apply MI 52-109 issued by the Canadian Securities Administrators, the Fonds has decided to base its work upon the principles stated in this rule, thereby demonstrating its willingness to respect best practices in financial governance. Our financial compliance framework program commonly known as Confor applies to controls providing reasonable assurance that the financial information prepared and reported is reliable and that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. Management is responsible for designing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. It must also periodically evaluate their design and effectiveness. During the year, the Fonds undertook the necessary work to evaluate the design and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. A certification was signed by the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer for the financial year ended May 31, 2012, confirming their responsibility for this procedure. These certifications are available on SEDAR. A mechanism for sub-certification by several Fonds executives and managers also supports these certifications. Management’s conclusions on the design and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are presented below. 17 Using fair value is a best practice recognized by venture capital firms and private equity funds. In short, fair value is defined as the price for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an orderly, arm’s length transaction. 27 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS Management is responsible for designing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. It must also periodically evaluate their design and effectiveness. Management evaluated the control design based on the COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) framework, and, for information technology controls, the COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) framework, two recognized financial governance frameworks. CONCLUSIONS ON THE DESIGN AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING As at May 31, 2012, management evaluated the design and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Based on the work done, management can conclude that internal control over financial reporting is adequately designed and operates effectively to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. During the year ended May 31, 2012, there was no change in the Fonds’ internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, the Fonds’ internal control over financial reporting. CONCLUSIONS ON THE DESIGN AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES As at May 31, 2012, management evaluated the design and effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the work done, management can conclude that disclosure controls and procedures are adequately designed and operate effectively to provide reasonable assurance that information disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and presented within the time periods specified in the regulations and that it is communicated to management on a timely basis for decision-making purposes. 28 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS AT MAY 31, 2012 AND 2011 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT To the Shareholders of the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec (F.T.Q.) We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec (F.T.Q.), which comprise the balance sheets as at May 31, 2012 and 2011, and the statements of operations, changes in net assets and cash flows for the years then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditors consider internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec (F.T.Q.) as at May 31, 2012 and 2011 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. 2 2 ---------------------------------------------1 CPA auditor, CA, public accountancy permit No. A105976 2 CPA auditor, CA, public accountancy permit No. A125741 Montréal, June 28, 2012 FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) 1 BALANCE SHEETS AS AT MAY 31 (In thousands $, except net assets per share) 2012 2011 Assets Development capital investments (Note 4) 4,918,765 4,269,537 Other investments (Note 5) 4,123,020 4,190,196 Accounts receivable and other assets (Note 8) 656,836 264,248 Cash 13,789 6,372 Capital assets (Note 9) 61,076 62,323 Income taxes 93 9,773,579 8,792,676 Liabilities Notes (Note 10) 428,544 349,503 Accounts payable and other liabilities (Note 12) 816,434 260,894 Income taxes 1,170 Future income taxes (Note 17) 3,913 3,298 1,248,891 614,865 Net assets (Note 13) 8,524,688 8,177,811 Number of Class A shares outstanding (Note 13) 320,629 315,504 Net assets per Class A share 26.59 25.92 Contingencies (Note 14) The accompanying notes form an integral part of these financial statements.

INCORPORATION ACT STATUTES AND OBJECTIVES OF THE FONDS The Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec (F.T.Q.) (the “Fonds”), incorporated by an Act of the Québec National Assembly, is a joint-stock company with the following objectives: a) to invest in Québec business enterprises and provide them with services in order to create, maintain or protect jobs; b) to promote the training of workers in economic matters to enable them to increase their influence on Québec’s economic development; c) to stimulate the Québec economy by making strategic investments that will be of benefit to Québec workers and business enterprises; d) to promote the development of qualified business enterprises by inviting workers to participate in that development by purchasing the Fonds’ shares. To this end, the Fonds endeavours to concentrate most of its development capital investments in unsecured investments, mainly in small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”), located in Québec. As a general rule, the Fonds will take a minority interest in the projects in which it invests. 60% RULE The Fonds may make development capital investments in any business enterprise with or without security. However, in any given financial year, the proportion of unsecured development capital investments made in qualified business enterprises must represent an average of at least 60% of the Fonds’ average net assets of the previous financial year. If the Fonds fails to reach this percentage, the share issues giving rise to tax credits for the following financial year are limited to a prescribed percentage of the total value of shares issued in the preceding financial year, except for shares acquired through payroll deductions and employer contributions stipulated in agreements concluded at the end of the preceding financial year. The percentage of average qualified development capital investments to the average net assets of the preceding year was 67.0% as at May 31, 2012 (2011: 71.0%). Since the minimum percentage prescribed by the 60% rule has been reached as at May 31, 2012, the amount of share issues will not be limited for the 2012-2013 financial year. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Fonds is an investment company as defined in the Accounting Guideline on investment companies contained in the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) Handbook and, as such, applies the accounting principles stated therein. A Statement of Comprehensive Income is not provided as there are no items to include therein. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions, in particular when determining allowances and the fair value of development capital investments and other investments, that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. RECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial instruments are recognized at fair value on the transaction date. Financial assets classified as loans and receivables comprise Accounts receivable and other assets, excluding securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and financial instruments related to securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements. Financial liabilities classified as other liabilities comprise Notes and Accounts payable and other liabilities, excluding securities sold under repurchase agreements. All these instruments are recognized at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value. FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) 6 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As at May 31, 2012 and 2011 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS All development capital investments and other investments are measured at fair value, established as follows: a) Unlisted financial instruments Unlisted financial instruments consist of shares, units and loans and advances. These instruments are measured at fair value using appropriate valuation techniques and models that may not be principally based on observable market information. Observable market information is used in valuation models if it is available. The fair value is established based on reasonable assumptions that would be considered by parties to an arm’s length transaction. Certain assumptions may have a material impact on fair value, including those used to determine characteristic cash flows and the level of risk and future growth rate associated with such cash flows considering economic conditions, the outlook for the relevant industry segment and conditions specific to the business entreprise. Hedge fund units are measured at the fair value set by their respective manager at the date closest to the Fonds’ balance sheet date. b) Listed financial instruments Listed financial instruments consist of shares, bonds and money market instruments. These instruments are measured at bid price at the close of trading at balance sheet date. In exceptional instances, when the market for a financial instrument is not active, such instrument is then measured using appropriate valuation techniques, including the techniques used for unlisted financial instruments. c) Derivative financial instruments Listed derivative financial instruments are measured at bid price at the close of trading at balance sheet date. Unlisted derivative financial instruments are measured using appropriate valuation techniques, including discounting future cash flows at the current rate of return. SECURITIES LENDING, SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS To generate additional revenues, the Fonds participates in the securities lending program put in place by its trustee for securities of which it is the custodian. Under this program, the Fonds can enter into securities lending transactions and transactions involving the purchase of securities with a simultaneous commitment to resell them in the short-term at a specified price and date. In addition, the program allows the Fonds to enter into transactions involving the sale of securities with a simultaneous commitment to repurchase them in the short-term at a specified price and date. The resulting revenues are recorded under Interest in the Statement of Operations. CAPITAL ASSETS Capital assets are stated at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful life using the following methods and annual rates: Methods Rates (%) Property and equipment Buildings straight-line 2.5 Office furniture and equipment diminishing balance 20.0 Computer hardware straight-line 25.0 Information systems development straight-line 33.3 Capital assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded when their carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows that would result from their use and eventual disposition. The recognized impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) 7 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As at May 31, 2012 and 2011 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) REVENUE RECOGNITION a) Interest Interest is recorded on an accrual basis. b) Dividends Dividends are recorded as income when they are declared, except for cumulative dividends which are recorded on an accrual basis. c) Gains and losses on development capital investments and other investments Realized gains and losses on disposals of development capital investments and other investments, including derivative financial instruments, are recorded at the time of sale and presented under Gains (losses) on development capital investments and other investments in the Statement of Operations. The amount is the difference between the proceeds of disposal and the average cost. INCOME TAXES The Fonds uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, future income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of balance sheet items and their tax bases, multiplied by the enacted or substantively enacted income tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Future income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Monetary assets and liabilities and assets and liabilities measured at fair value are translated into Canadian dollars at exchange rate prevailing at balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in the Statement of Operations. EMPLOYEE FUTURE BENEFITS The cost of pensions and other retirement benefits earned by managers and employees is actuarially determined using the projected benefit method prorated on service and management’s best estimate of expected return on plan assets, salary escalation and retirement ages of employees. For the purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets, those assets are valued at fair value. Net actuarial gains or losses which are greater than 10% of the accrued benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets, whichever is higher, are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees. The average remaining service period of covered active employees is between 8.5 and 12.1 years (2011: between 8.8 and 12.2 years). 3. FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (“IFRS”) In 2008, the Accounting Standards Board of Canada (“AcSB”) confirmed that Canadian GAAP will be replaced by IFRS for the years beginning on or after January 1, 2011, for publicly accountable enterprises. In December 2011, the AcSB confirmed that investment companies, as defined in the Accounting Guideline on investment companies of the CICA Handbook, will have to apply IFRS for the first time to interim and annual financial statements for the years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. The Fonds therefore deferred its first-time adoption date and will prepare its first interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS as at November 30, 2014. The Fonds complies with its IFRS conversion plan. FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) 8 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As at May 31, 2012 and 2011 4.

Funds committed but not disbursed represent development capital investments that have already been agreed to and for which amounts have been committed by the Fonds but have not been disbursed at balance sheet date. Disbursements are subject to compliance with the agreement’s terms and conditions. Of funds committed but not disbursed, an amount of $248.1 million (2011: $251 million) represents credit facilities and project financing for operating companies, having a weighted average maturity of 15 months (2011: 6 months); and an amount of $573.7 million (2011: $667.8 million) represents commitments that will be disbursed to specialized funds in tranches, having a weighted average maturity of 9.3 years (2011: 8.5 years). Commitments amounting to $89.9 million (2011: $153.8 million) are denominated in foreign currencies, mainly the U.S. dollar. 2. Under Section 17 of its Incorporation Act, when the Fonds makes a development capital investment in the form of a guarantee or a suretyship, it must establish and maintain a reserve equal to at least 50% of the guarantee or suretyship amount for the term thereof. This reserve is established from Other investments. GUARANTEES AND SURETYSHIPS The Fonds granted guarantees and suretyships that do not generally include a specific maturity and that are irrevocable commitments by the Fonds to make the payments of partner companies that cannot meet their obligations to third parties for an undiscounted total maximum amount and for the following purposes: (In thousands $) 2012 2011 Operating activities and operating lines of credit without recourse 7,831 8,574 Operating activities and operating lines of credit with recourse 8,398 9,940 16,229 18,514 As at May 31, 2012, the unrealized depreciation related to guarantees and suretyships amounts to $4.5 million (2011: $3.7 million) and is presented under Accounts payable and other liabilities. As well, in the normal course of business, the Fonds enters into various indemnification agreements, usually related to sales of development capital investments, for the representations and warrantees made as well as to the liability of the Fonds’ directors, officers or representatives toward partner companies. The latter liability is covered, subject to certain conditions, by liability insurance. Due to the nature of these agreements, it is impossible to reasonably estimate the maximum amount that the Fonds may have to pay to counterparties. In management’s opinion, it is highly unlikely that these commitments will result in material additional expenses, taking into consideration the provisions recorded.

Even though management believes that its fair value measurements are appropriate, using reasonably possible alternative assumptions could result in different fair values. Whenever possible, a sensitivity analysis of changes in significant assumptions is performed. Management assessed the situation and determined that using reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not result in significantly different fair values. Since the Fonds does not have access to information on the underlying investments, the fair value of certain units and of hedge fund units classified as Level 3 is based on the value provided by the general partner or the external manager. Therefore no other reasonably possible assumption could be used. 7. SECURITIES LENDING As part of the securities lending program, the trustee receives, in exchange for the securities loaned, guarantees or assets equivalent to the minimum percentage prescribed by law or to a percentage that may vary according to best practices. Depending on the securities loaned, this percentage ranges from 102% to 106% as at May 31, 2012 (2011: from 102% to 104%), and the fair value of the securities loaned is $133 million (2011: $98 million). 8.

NET ASSETS (CONTINUED) SHARE CAPITAL (CONTINUED) Authorized (CONTINUED) CLASS B SHARES Unlimited number of Class B shares, without par value, non-voting, entitled to a preferential dividend at the rate determined by the Board of Directors. In the event of liquidation, the Class B shares rank prior to Class A shares. Subscribed Subscribed capital is money cashed but for which no Class A share can be issued in consideration thereof pursuant to the Fonds’ purchase-by-agreement policy. These Class A shares will be issued at the time set out in such policy at the share price in effect at that date. Redemption terms The Fonds is required to redeem shares in the circumstances set out in its Incorporation Act or to redeem them by mutual agreement in exceptional situations provided under a policy for such purpose adopted by the Fonds’ Board of Directors and approved by the Minister of Finance of Québec. The redemption price is determined semi-annually based on the value of the Fonds. Contributed surplus Contributed surplus arises from the reduction in issued and paid-up capital resulting from transfers and the excess of the average value of share capital over the redemption price. This excess is reduced when shares are redeemed at a price exceeding the average value of issued share capital, prorata to the redeemed shares. Transfers During the year, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the issued and paid-up capital on Class A shares, Series 1 of $97 million through a transfer from retained earnings (2011: $103 million). As at May 31, 2012, the Fonds had transferred a cumulative amount of $1,717 million from retained earnings to share capital.

CONTINGENCIES In the normal course of business, the Fonds is party to claims and litigations that could result in losses. A contingent loss is recognized when it is likely and can be estimated. Management believes that the aggregate amount of contingent losses, net of losses recognized, would not have a material adverse effect of the Fonds’ financial position. 15.

INCOME TAXES For purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada), the Fonds is subject to the rules applicable to mutual fund corporations. As such, the Fonds can receive a refund of the income taxes paid on its capital gains by redeeming its shares or by increasing its issued and paid-up share capital through a transfer from retained earnings. Since these income taxes are refundable and that, in management’s opinion, the issued and paid-up share capital will be increased sufficiently to recover them, these income taxes are not presented in the Statement of Operations, but are included in Accounts receivable and other assets. The balance of these income taxes is $10.3 million (2011: $9.0 million). The Fonds, as a private company, can receive a refund of a portion of the income taxes paid on its investment income through the refundable dividend tax on hand (RDTOH). The RDTOH is recoverable by increasing the issued and paid-up share capital through transfers from retained earnings. This tax of $31.9 million (2011: $33.9 million) was entirely applied against income taxes payable following transfers approved by the Board of Directors during the year. Under the Taxation Act (Québec), the Fonds is an open-ended investment company. As such, the Fonds can, in calculating its Québec taxes, deduct taxable capital gains from its taxable income. Consequently, capital gains realized by the Fonds are not subject to taxes in Québec. Income taxes on net investment income before income taxes are detailed as follows: (In thousands $) 2012 2011 Current 26,874 22,925 Future 615 3,155 27,489 26,080 The above income taxes are different from the amounts that would be obtained by applying the combined basic tax rate (federal and provincial) to net investment income before income taxes.

EMPLOYEE FUTURE BENEFITS On January 1, 2001, the Fonds implemented funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans, which guarantee pension benefits to most of its employees. Pension benefits under these plans are based on years of service and average annual salary, which represents the average annual salary over the period of 36 months of consecutive service which results in the highest average. Also, since July 1, 2003, the Fonds has had an optional personal insurance plan for retired employees. The accrued benefit obligation of these plans as determined by independent actuaries and the fair value of plan assets are as at March 31, 2012. The most recent actuarial valuation of the pension plans for funding and solvency purposes was as at December 31, 2011 and the next valuation will take place as at December 31, 2012.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS In the normal course of business, the Fonds conducts transactions with related companies that are either controlled by the Fonds or subject to significant influence by the Fonds. Many of the development capital investments are of such an amount and nature that the investee is considered a related company. These transactions consist predominantly of interest and dividend revenues on investments and certain expenses, in particular premiums paid under insurance plans. The Fonds, of which a majority of directors are elected by the FTQ, agreed to pay $1.9 million to the FTQ for the year ended May 31, 2012 (2011: $1.6 million) under an agreement that calls for compensation to be paid for services rendered in respect of economic training, social audits, shareholder development, and support and guidance of certain activities. These transactions are measured at the exchange amount, which is the amount of consideration established and agreed to by the related parties. The Fonds incorporated the Fondation de la formation économique du Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec (F.T.Q.) (the “Fondation”) under Part III of the Québec Companies Act and appoints the members of the Fondation’s Board of Directors. The Fonds granted a loan of $5 million to the Fondation at a variable, contingent interest rate, with a fair value of $3.6 million (2011: $3.3 million). The Fonds granted non-interest bearing loans of $20 million with a fair value of $13.9 million (2011: $13.1 million) to the Fonds étudiants solidarité travail du Québec (FESTQ), which are considered related to the Fonds because the Fonds appoints some of their directors together with the Government of Québec. These loans are presented in the Balance Sheet under Accounts receivable and other assets. 20. RISK MANAGEMENT Risks arising from financial instruments are an integral part the audited Financial Statements and are discussed in the “Risk management” section of the Management Discussion and Analysis for the year ended May 31, 2012, which is available at the Fonds’ head office, on its Website at www.fondsftq.com or at www.sedar.com. 21.

FONDS DE SOLIDARITÉ DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUÉBEC (F.T.Q.) 24 STATEMENT OF DEVELOPMENT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AT COST AS AT MAY 31, 2012 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT To the Directors of the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec (F.T.Q.) We have audited the statement of development capital investments at cost of the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec (F.T.Q.) as at May 31, 2012 ( the statement ). The statement has been prepared by management based on the dispositions of article 18 of the Regulation respecting development capital investment fund continuous disclosure. Management's Responsibility for the Statement Management is responsible for the preparation of the statement in accordance with the dispositions of article 18 of the Regulation respecting development capital investment fund continuous disclosure, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the statement based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statement is free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the statement. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the statement, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation of the statement in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the statement. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the financial information in the statement of development capital investments at cost of the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec (F.T.Q.) as at May 31, 2012 is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the dispositions of article 18 of the Regulation respecting development capital investment fund continuous disclosure. ____________________ 1 CPA auditor, CA, public accountancy permit No. A105976 Montréal, June 28, 2012 1 Statement of Development Capital Investments at Cost AS AT MAY 31, 2012 (In thousands $) Unsecured Secured Total Unlisted Loans, Guarantees Year of Industry Listed Shares Bonds Loans and Initial Investment Segment Shares and Units and Advances and Advances Suretyships 1988 Fonds de développement emploi-Montréal inc.
