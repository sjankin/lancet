Profitability For A/S Storebælt, the repayment period is unchanged on the year and amounts to 31 years according to the latest updated profitability calculations. On the basis of the updated traffic forecast, including an expected ­dividend payment to the owner companies in 2020, Øresundsbro Konsortiet expects the repayment period for the bridge to be reduced by one year and is now 33 years. For A/S Øresund, a combination of A/S Storebælt’s positive performance and joint taxation between the Group’s companies means that the repayment period will be shortened by two years, 47 years. 4 A NNUA L R E P ORT 2 0 1 2 ManagemenT report Traffic Traffic on Storebælt’s road link rose by 0.7 per cent on 2013 is expected to be characterised by continuing the year.

Lorries over 20 m, i.e. long heavy vehicles and ­abnormal loads, rose by 19.4 per cent. As a result, they accounted for 5 per cent of lorry traffic in 2012 against 4 per cent in 2011.

Deferred tax will be offset as the underlying assets and liabilities are realised, including as the companies in the joint taxation of Sund & Bælt Holding A/S achieve positive taxable income. The group has managed the construction of the fixed link across Storebælt and Øresund and during the construction phase, the companies realised tax losses since the revenue base can only be realised when the links are ready to use. The use of the companies’ losses carried forward extend over a longer period than five years, but as the main components of the companies’ tangible assets have an estimated service life of 100 years, it is deemed prudent to recognise the tax value of the losses carried forward without impairment.

When interest rates change, this affects the market value (fair value) of the net debt and, in this respect, the impact and risk are greater on fixed rate debt with long maturities. This is owing to the discounting effect and corresponds to alternative cost or gain relating to fixed rate debt obligations in comparison to financing at current market interest rates. The duration denotes the average remaining maturity on the net debt. A long duration implies a low interest rate refixing risk since a relatively small proportion of the net debt needs to be reset to the current interest rate.
