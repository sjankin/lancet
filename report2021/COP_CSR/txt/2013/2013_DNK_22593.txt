We’ve been working with global and local brands for 25 years, and today we are more than 55 professionals crafting from offices in Copenhagen (Denmark) and Tokyo (Japan). We cover every brand discipline from brand strategy, conceptand design development, communication, implementation and brand guardianship. To us a brand is a promise. A promise about consistency where all of a brand's fundamental elements come together and point in a clear direction independent the platform. Our passion is to help clients identify and express their promise and keep it. Kontrapunkt has among others developed the visual identity for the UN Global Compact, which has contributed to promote the ten principles on the international agenda. In late 2010 we added some extra to the brand by developing the UN Global Compact 10th anniversary logo. See the case story and learn more about us at our website, www.kontrapunkt.com. How do you intend to make this COP available to your stakeholders? Besides the availability through the Global Compact organisation website, we also promote our adherence to the Global Compact principles through our corporate website and intranet. OUR PRINCIPLES In the sections below you will find our commitments and policies regarding the global compact programme, including descriptions of relevant processes and systems that helps us to live out the principles. Furthermore you will find thoughts about planned activities as well as past initiatives and outcomes. Human rights principles Principle 1: OUR BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT AND RESPECT THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY PROCLAIMED HUMAN RIGHTS Principle 2: OUR BUSINESS SHOULD ENSURE THAT W E ARE NOT COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES We strive for, and believe that our corporate values and business operations fully support and respect the international human rights, which are also incorporated in the Danish national legislation. Our employees and vendors are primarily based in Denmark. Hence, we have a high level of control and are thereby confident that our operations comply with the human rights and relevant Danish national and EU legislation. We have never been involved neither directly or indirectly in any issues regarding human right abuses in our business affairs. The recent years we have made an annual financial contribution to the SOS-Kinderdorf International as well as the Medecins sans Frontieres , which are both organisations aimed to improve the lives of those suffering the most. Also for the years to come we will make annual financial contributions to these organisations. Labour standard principles Principle 3: OUR BUSINESS SHOULD UPHOLD THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND THE EFFECTIVE RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING Principle 4: OUR BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF FORCED AND COMPULSORY LABOUR Principle 5: OUR BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOUR Principle 6: OUR BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT OF EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION We comply with Danish national legislation, which fully incorporates the principles for labour standards. In agreement with the Danish labour market regulation, we carry out Safety at work inspections every three years, which has so far not revealed any safety issues at our work place. In 2011 we decided to make an annual job satisfaction survey among our employees. Our objective for this survey is an overall satisfactory score above average . Our employees are represented with two seats in our Board of Directors, and we continue to support our employee’s Well being board , which has the purposes of acting as an employee voice (to the management) and to ensure a continuous improvement of working conditions and job satisfaction. Our company is covered by one of the major national collective labour agreements (“Industriens Funktionær Overenskomst”), which has been renewed through collective bargaining in early 2012. Our employees participate in an age pension scheme, which also includes insurance coverage for death, disability and psychical and physical health. We encourage equality between sexes and different ethnic groups, by providing the same status, rights, and responsibilities for equally skilled employees. E.g. females are represented in our Senior Executive management group as well as in our Board of Directors. As mentioned in the section above, we provide financial support to the SOS-Kinderdorf International organisation, which among others work against child labour. Environmental principles Principle 7: OUR BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES Principle 8: OUR BUSINESS SHOULD UNDERTAKE INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY Principle 9: OUR BUSINESS SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DIFFUSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES Environmental aspects continue to gain importance to our organization. We fully comply with Danish national legislation, which as for other EU countries has high requirements in terms of environmental standards. In addition to this, we have improved our routines with particular emphasis on energy-saving initiatives, which has resulted in an 18% reduction of our power consumption during the past 2 years. Our original aim was 5% per year, so this result is very satisfactory. In 2011 we have moved our head office to a new domicile, which will provide state of the art power saving light installations and IT server-cooling facilities. We will continue to aim for an annual power reduction of 5% which will be tracked every quarter. Also, we have examined the possibility of purchasing green energy (wind energy) instead of energy from traditional energy sources. This however has not been possible so far, as we are currently restricted to use the same provider as our landlord. In 2009 we implemented an initiative regarding classification of waste and responsible waste disposal, and introduced “reduce paper” policy, which among others meant that we no longer print invoice copies and other financial documents for our own archive (we keep them electronically only). In late 2010 we also converted to invoice our customers electronically (instead of paper invoices by ordinary mail). In 2010 we set up videoconference equipment, which have reduced our travel activity (CO2 emission), e.g. between Denmark and Japan, as most meetings are now held per videoconference. In 2012 we changed our server park, and went from 15 to only 2 computers. By this improvement we reduces the power consumption to run and keep cool the machines. Finally, we are certified by the Det Norske Veritas (www.dnv.com) within the areas of Quality Management Systems (ISO certificate # 16362-2006-AQ-ABG-DANAK) and Environment Management Systems (ISO certificate # 26377-2006-AE-ABG-DANAK). As part of these certifications we have the objective that at least 85% of the volume in our print jobs must be carried out by environmental certified vendors. This will be evaluated on an annual basis. Anti corruption principles Principle 10: BUSINESS SHOULD W ORK AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ALL ITS FORMS, INCLUDING EXTORTION AND BRIBERY We fully comply with the Danish national legislation, which fully incorporates the principles for anticorruption. We have never been involved neither directly or indirectly in any matters of this regard. Statement of support As a participant in the Global Compact program, we strive for, and believe that our corporate values and business operations fully comply with the ten principles of Global Compact, as well of the Danish National legislation, which incorporates the international conventions regarding Human Rights and EU regulation of environmental affairs. Through our support of the Global Compact, we also aim to continuously improve our efforts and results towards the Global Compact principles, with the environmental principles as our current focus area.
