From our Group’s perspective, we regard our performance in this period to have been largely positive. We have have made clear progress in the implementation of our strategy. Not only have we maintained our turnover level, recurrence in results and excess solvency, but we have also undertaken two corporate transactions that consolidate Grupo Catalana Occidente as one of the main independent insurance entities. On one hand, our acquisition of Atradius NV, completed in 2012, has given us a global presence and established us as credit insurance leaders. On the 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES other hand, the acquisition of Plus Ultra (formerly Groupama Seguros) in 2012, which I will discuss in more detail below, contributes to improving our Group’s business diversification and will help us consolidate our leadership position in the Spanish market. In short, seeing where we have arrived, we are convinced of the soundness of our business model and hope to continue growing in profitably and solvency. In 2012, not oblivious to the complex market situation, our Group has maintained revenues at EUR 3,200 million and has seen EUR 200 million in net profit. Permanent resources at market value stand at EUR 2,300 million and the solvency level stands at 497%, with a surplus of EUR 1,700 million. Our traditional business has achieved premiums of EUR 1,612.5 million, 2.7% less than in the previous year, although they perform better than the market, which is dropping by 5.3%. Results have been positive. The combined ratio continues to improve and is currently just below 90%, 88.8% to be precise, thanks to cost control and, above all, favourable claims development, as a result of appropriate technical management. With all this, the traditional business brings EUR 118.0 million to our recurring profit. The credit insurance business also ended the year strongly. Insurance revenues increased by 3.6% to reach EUR 1,565.0 million. Credit flow difficulties have caused an increase in defaults and, consequently, the number of claims, although the Group has managed to protect the combined ratio, closing the year at 88.4%. This business contributes EUR 104.5 million to the recurring profit. 5 Grupo Catalana Occidente maintains the dividend one more year. The Board of Directors has proposed that the supplementary dividend is the same amount paid out in the previous year, thereby obtaining a total dividend amounting to EUR 68.32 million, assuming a payout of 34.2% and a dividend yield of 4.1%. Thanks to the recurrence of results and our cautious investment policy, permanent resources have increased. This has meant that in 2012 the Group has acquired, with its own funds, 6.48% of Atradius shares, bringing its stake to 83.2%, and 49% of Plus Ultra’s share capital. 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES The Group has been attentive to market opportunities, as our history over the last decade shows. Currently, with the difficulty of growing organically in a crisis environment, the acquisition of Plus Ultra is a great opportunity. The company has a turnover of around EUR 850 million, with a balanced portfolio, primarily selling through brokers. This transaction will allow us to take a quantum leap in our business volume, from a turnover of EUR 3,200 million to more than EUR 4,000 million. We are convinced that we will be able to improve its profitability by leveraging business knowledge and sharing best management practices. In the area of corporate responsibility we have continued to strengthen our commitment, especially on the social side — people. Grupo Catalana Occidente has maintained the size of its workforce and, through the Jesús Serra Foundation, we have carried out intense sponsorship activity and social progress promotion. The economic difficulties we faced in 2012 are expected to continue in 2013. However, we remain confident that we can consolidate our position in the market, allowing sustainable increase in profitability and increased customer and shareholder value. In closing, I would like to thank you again for your trust and support, and that of our agents and policyholders. All of us here at Grupo Catalana Occidente remain committed to improving our ability to deliver results and create value in the medium and long term.

The focus has been on monitoring the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone, in particular the implementation of programs by peripheral country governments. It has also been agreed to appoint a single banking supervisor, the ECB itself. In the U.S., growth has been moderate and attention has been focused in the last quarter of the year on the presidential election — culminating in Barack Obama’s re-election — and avoiding the fiscal cliff , which could have otherwise Letter to resulted in a significant budgetary adjustment. Lastly, emerging economies continue to show dynamic growth, Shareholders albeit lower than in previous years. Economic activity in Spain has shrunk by around 1.5%. Lower economic growth has pushed the deficit rate to 7% of GDP. The Government is undertaking a programme of extensive spending cuts and tax increases along with structural reforms in order to ensure long-term economic growth. The labour market has continued to deteriorate. The unemployment rate is above 25%, which hampers the recovery of domestic demand. The Grupo Catalana positive factor is the increasing contribution of exports, although it has slowed down somewhat due to the 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES economic downturn in the major euro zone countries. The government also requested financial assistance to Occidente restructure the banking system, after it undertook several reforms. The new SAREB tool has also been created to manage restructuring-derived real estate assets. Financial markets The performance of the financial markets is still marked by the course of events in the eurozone and the effect of central banks in investor expectations. Management Expansionary monetary policies worldwide have resulted in financial markets’ recovery. During the year, the Report stock exchanges showed signs of improvement, signalling increases, especially during the second half of the year. The Euro Stoxx 50 has risen by 13.8% and the S&P 500 by 13.4%. The IBEX 35 ended the year in the red at -4.7%. Condolidated However, debt markets have continued to be characterized by high risk aversion, resulting in some countries maintaining high public debt interest rates, especially in Spain and Italy, forcing investors to seek refuge in Financial Statements German and U.S. bonds, in turn triggering record lows for these assets’ yields (1.32% and 1.76% respectively). During the second half, and thanks to agreements reached by European bodies, risk premiums started to level off, especially in Spain and Italy. Insurance sector Notes to the The insurance sector in Spain closed 2012 with a drop of 5.3% in premium volume, reaching EUR 57,381 Consolidated Financial million. The Life business line saw the biggest drop, which reached -9.0%. Non-Life (54% of premiums) slipped 1.9%. Broken down by business lines, the worst performances came from segments linked to industrial activity such as Decenal, Building and Auto, which continue under intense pressure, following a 5.9% drop in turnover. Funeral and Health Insurance are the silver lining. Statements From a technical results standpoint, at the end of September, the sector shows a combined ratio of 92.3%, in line with 2011 results (92.2%). The claims ratio stood at 69.9% of earned premiums (0.6 points below the 2011 Auditors Report on rate) and the expense rate stood at 22.4% (0.7 points higher). Consolidated Financial 2013 Forecasts The consensus is that global growth in 2013 is expected to reach 2.8%, with significant disparities between Statments regions and countries, led by Asia and, to a lesser extent, Latin America. However, there is a continued review of downward growth expectations in mature markets and credit conditions are increasingly tougher. The Corporate adjustment and debt refinancing measures taken by governments in 2013 are expected to re-condition the performance of European economies, especially Spain. Governance Report Regarding the outlook for the insurance industry, 2013 is expected to be a challenging year. Higher unemployment and the decline in consumption and investment continue to drag down insurance contracts, especially in Non-Life. Even though less use of insurance can result in lower claims, the pressure on margins will be higher. 14 COMMERCIAL PERFORMANCE Key Figures Revenues The year 2012 has been further developed in a discrete environment of economic growth where the insurance market has been particularly competitive.

Basis of presentation Key Figures 2.a) Regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the Group These consolidated financial statements have been produced by the Board Members of the parent company in accordance with the financial reporting regulatory framework applicable to the Group, which is established by: a) The Spanish Código de Comercio and other commercial legislation. b) The International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union through EU Letter to Regulations, pursuant to Regulation (EU) no. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of Shareholders July 19, 2002 and subsequent amendments thereto. c) For the purposes of the valuation of technical provisions the Regulations on Administration of Private Insurance approved by RD 2486/1998 and regulatory provisions established by the DGSFP have been taken into account, as well as the criteria and regulations established by local regulators in the different Grupo Catalana countries of the Group's foreign subsidiaries. 2.b) True and Fair View Occidente 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES The Group's consolidated financial statements have been obtained from the accounting records of the parent Company and its subsidiaries and are presented in accordance with the financial reporting regulatory framework applicable and in particular the accounting principles and criteria it contains. Therefore they present a true reflection of the equity, financial position, results of the Group and cash flows for the year concerned. These Management consolidated financial statements were prepared by the Board of Directors of Grupo Catalana Occidente, S.A. at its meeting on February 28, 2013, and shall be subject, as well as those from investee companies, to the approval by the respective Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. It is expected they will be approved without Report amendments. The consolidated financial statements for the year 2011, were approved by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Grupo Catalana Occidente, S.A. on April 26, 2012. The Group's consolidated financial statements have been prepared from accounting records maintained by the Condolidated parent and the other companies of the Group and include certain adjustments and reclassifications to standardise the principles and criteria used by the various companies integrated into Grupo Catalana Occidente. As recommended by IAS 1, assets and liabilities are generally classified in the balance sheet according to their Financial Statements liquidity, but not by classifying assets and liabilities as current or non-current, which is more relevant for the purposes of insurance groups. As with other insurance groups, expenses in the profit and loss account are classified and presented according to their nature. Notes to the 2.c) Responsibility for the information Consolidated Financial The information in these financial statements is the responsibility of the Board Members of the parent Company, who have taken due care to ensure the effective operation of the various controls put in place to guarantee the quality of financial and accounting information, both for the parent and the companies of the Group. Statements On occasions, in preparing the consolidated financial statements judgments and estimates made by the Auditors Report on management of the parent, and consolidated companies, and subsequently ratified by the Board Members, have been used. These estimates relate, inter alia, to the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, impairment losses, the useful life of tangible and intangible assets, the measurement of consolidation goodwill, the actuarial hypothesis Consolidated Financial used in the calculation of pension commitments, the hypotheses used in the calculation of the liability adequacy test, the hypotheses used in transferring a portion of the unrealised gains on the portfolio of financial assets Statments designated as “available for sale” or “at fair value through profit or loss” to the life insurance provision, and the assets, liabilities and results of companies integrated by using the equity method. Corporate These estimates affect both the amounts recorded in the balance sheet and profit and loss account and those appearing in the statement of recognised income and expenses. Although they were prepared using the best information available, future events may make it necessary to revise these estimates (upwards or downwards) in coming years. Any such revisions would be applied prospectively, recognising the effects of the changed estimates Governance Report in the consolidated financial statements. 74 2.d) New accounting principles and policies used in the Group’s consolidated financial statements Key Figures New standards, revised standards and amendments adopted in 2012 Standards and interpretations in effect in the current period New accounting standards have come into force in 2012 which have naturally been taken into account in preparing the attached consolidated financial statements. Letter to Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Breakdown: transfers of financial assets Shareholders This amendment has significantly expanded the disclosures to be made in relation to financial asset transfers, when some type of continuing involvement is held with the transferred asset. However, the application of this amendment has not had significant impact on the figures reported or on the presentation and disclosures in these consolidated financial statements. Grupo Catalana Standards and Interpretations released but not yet in force Occidente At the date these accounts were authorised for release, the most significant standards and interpretations that had been published by the IASB but had not yet come into force, either because their effective date was after the date of the consolidated financial statements, or because they have not yet been adopted by the European Union. 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and measurement: Management The partially published IFRS 9 (not complete at the time of publication) replaces IAS 39 in the classification and measurement of financial assets (partly published in November 2009) and financial liabilities (published in Report October 2010). The standard published in October 2010 also includes the requirements for account recognition and derecognition, which in substance are the same as those in the IAS 39. IFRS 9 will eventually replace the current IAS 39 classification and measurement section. There are very significant differences with the current standard, in relation to financial assets. These include the approval of a Condolidated new classification model based on only two categories (amortised cost and fair value), the deletion of the current Investments held to maturity” and “Financial assets available for sale” classifications, impairment analysis only for assets measured at amortised cost and the non-separation of derivatives embedded in financial assets. Financial Statements The mandatory application of this standard will occur in financial years beginning after 1 January, 2015. At the reporting date, the impact of adopting this standard has not yet been analysed. IFRS 10 changes the currently existing definition of control. The new control definition consists of three elements Notes to the that must be met: power over the investee, exposure or rights to variable investment results and the ability to use that power to influence the amount of those returns. Consolidated Financial IFRS 12 is a disclosure standard that includes all account disclosure requirements relating to investments in other entities (subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures or other interests in other entities) including new disclosure Statements requirements. The amendments to IAS 27 and IAS 28 are parallel to the issuance of the new aforementioned IFRS standards. Auditors Report on The mandatory application of this standard will occur in financial years beginning after 1 January, 2013. The adoption of these standards is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group. Consolidated Financial Amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits Statments The fundamental change in this amendment to IAS 19 will affect the accounting treatment of defined benefit plans since the “fluctuation band” (which currently allows deferring some portion of gains and losses) is eliminated. When the amendment enters into force, all share gains and losses will be recorded immediately in the Corporate other comprehensive income to reflect the plan’s total deficit or surplus in the consolidated balance sheet. On the other hand, the interest cost and the expected return on plan assets are replaced in the new version by a net interest amount, which is calculated by applying the discount rate to the liability (or asset) obligation. It will also trigger changes in the presentation of cost components in the comprehensive income statement, which will be Governance Report pooled and presented differently. 75 The mandatory application of this standard will occur in financial years beginning after 1 January, 2013. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group. Key Figures All mandatory accounting policies and measurement bases with a material effect on the consolidated financial statements have been considered in preparing the accounts. 2.e) Basis of comparison and error corrections For comparison purposes, the consolidated financial statements for 2012 are presented alongside the consolidated financial statements for 2011, as required under IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements. Letter to 2.f) Consolidation principles The Group’s scope of consolidation was defined according to the provisions of IAS 27 – Consolidated and Shareholders Separate Financial Statements and IAS 28 – Investments in Associates (see Annex I and II). These consolidated financial statements for 2012 include all the companies of the Group, using the consolidation Grupo Catalana methods applicable in each case, in accordance with Article 42 of the Código de Comercio (Spanish Commercial Code). The parent is not required to prepare consolidated financial statements with a scope greater than that of these consolidated financial statements, as it is itself part of a group headed by CO Sociedad de Gestión y Occidente Participación, S.A. which prepares its consolidated annual financial statements separately. 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2.f.1) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are defined as entities over which, regardless of their legal form, the Group exercises control, i.e. the Management power to govern the financial and operating policies of these entities in order to obtain results from their activities. Annex I to these Consolidated Notes contains significant information on these companies and Notes 5 and 7 provide information about the most significant changes during 2012 and between the balance sheet date and the Report date these financial statements were authorised for release. Exceptionally, the subsidiary Valles y Montañas, S.A. –in which the Group directly or indirectly holds more than Condolidated 50% of the voting rights– has not been included in the scope of consolidation, as its effect is immaterial. Valles y Montañas, S.A. was incorporated in 1962 and its registered office is located in Puerto de Navacerrada, Cercedilla, Madrid. At December 31, 2012, its share capital amounted to EUR 5 thousand and the fair value of this investment at that date, classified under “Available-for-sale financial assets – Equity investments”, amounted to Financial Statements EUR 5 thousand. The Group has also excluded from consolidation its ownership interests in excess of 50% in certain mutual funds, as at December 31, 2012, most of these related to the Unit Linked business managed by the subsidiary Bilbao Compañía Anónima de Seguros y Reaseguros and the Group does not therefore control these interests (see Note 6.a.4). Notes to the Consolidated Financial Finally, the company Hercasol, S.A. SICAV, in which the Group has a 50% stake on a transitional basis on December 31, 2012, has not been considered as a subsidiary of the Group, as the Group does not have majority Statements representation on the board of directors of that company, nor manages or may manage its financial and operating policies as an alternative. This company is considered to be an associate entity as there is a significant influence as accounted for by the equity method. The annual financial statements of subsidiaries are fully consolidated with the Group financial statements by Auditors Report on aggregating assets, liabilities, net equity and income and expenses of a similar nature, which are recognised in the Consolidated Financial individual financial statements after harmonisation and restatement to comply with IFRS. The book value of direct and indirect interests in the equity of subsidiaries is offset against the portion of the net assets of the subsidiaries that each represents. All other material balances and transactions between consolidated companies are eliminated on consolidation. In addition, third-party ownership interests in the Group’s equity and in profit Statments for the year are presented under the headings “Minority interests” in the consolidated balance sheet and “Profit attributable to minority interests” in the consolidated profit statement, respectively. The individual financial statements of the parent and subsidiaries used in preparing the consolidated financial Corporate statements are prepared with the same reporting date. Governance Report The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition to year-end. The results of subsidiaries that leave the Group’s control in the course of the year are included up until the date on which they cease to be a subsidiary. 76 In cases where the Group increases its share of a subsidiaries’ voting rights, any difference between the cost of the new acquisition and the additional portion of net assets acquired is calculated on the value at which they were Key Figures accounted for in the consolidated accounting records. 2.f.2) Associates Associates are entities, other than subsidiaries, over which the Group has significant influence, i.e. the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not to exercise full or joint control over it. Letter to In general, it is presumed that the Group exercises significant influence if it holds, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the voting power of the investee, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that such influence does not exist. Shareholders Annex II provides information on associates. Associates are integrated in the consolidated annual financial statements using the equity method, whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted to reflect any changes in the Group’s share of Grupo Catalana net assets of the investee. The Group’s results for the year include its share of the profit or loss of investees, less any treasury shares held by each investee, after deduction of dividends and other appropriations. Occidente The Group’s share in discontinued operations is recognised separately in the consolidated income statement, while its share in the changes that associates have recognised directly in equity are also recognised directly in the Group’s net equity, with the details being recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense. 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES In applying the equity method, the most recent available financial statements of each associate are used. Management If an associate uses accounting policies other than those used by the Group, the appropriate adjustments are made to make the associate’s accounting policies consistent with those of the Group. Report If there is any indication of an impairment loss in the investment in the associate, the impairment loss is deducted in the first place from any remaining goodwill in the investment. Notes 5 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements give details of any significant new investments in associates, Condolidated any increases in the Group’s interests in the capital of companies already classified as associates at the start of the year, and any sales of ownership interests that took place in 2012 and the date these annual financial statements were authorised for issue Financial Statements 2.g) Offsetting Asset and liability balances are offset and therefore recorded in the consolidated financial statements on a net Notes to the basis if, and only if, they arise from transactions in which offsetting is contractually or legally permitted and which the Company intends to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Consolidated Financial 2.h) Financial information by Segment Statements IFRS 8 – Segment Reporting lays down the principles governing the preparation of financial information by business lines and geographical area. Auditors Report on Segment information is presented according to the control, monitoring and internal management of the Group’s insurance activities and results and is prepared for all the insurance lines and sub-lines in which the Group is active, taking the Group’s structure and organisation into account. Consolidated Financial The Group has identified its primary business lines as being Life insurance, Non-life insurance and Other Statments Activities. The Life insurance segment encompasses all insurance contracts guaranteeing coverage of a risk that may affect the insured’s existence, physical integrity or health. The Non-life insurance line, by contrast, groups together all insurance contracts other than life insurance contracts. It can be broken down into the Auto, Multirisk, Credit Insurance, and Other non-life sub-lines. With respect to this presentation it should be noted that Corporate the Credit Insurance is mainly integrated into the insurance business of the subsidiary Atradius N.V. The two primary segments, Life and Non-life, are subject to risks and returns of the insurance business. The Governance Report Other Activities segment is used to group together all operations other than, or unrelated to, the insurance business. 77 The secondary lines, meanwhile, have been defined taking the location of insured customers and existing management centres into account. Key Figures Each of the insurance companies directly or indirectly controlled by the Group may be classified as a single-line or multi-line company, operating in one or both of the two main segments, based on the definition of insurance lines provided by the DGSFP. Note 1 gives details of the specific lines in which the Group is authorised to operate. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as those used for preparing and presenting the Group’s consolidated financial statements, including all the accounting policies relating specifically to segment reporting. Letter to Shareholders Segment assets and liabilities and income and expenses were determined prior to the elimination of intra-group operations and transactions on consolidation, except to the extent that such balances or transactions had taken place between companies in the same segment. This is the prevailing scenario in the Group, with all intra-group transactions being carried out at current market prices. Grupo Catalana The rules for allocating assets and liabilities and income and expenses to the Group’s primary and secondary segments are as follows: Occidente Allocation of assets and liabilities to the primary segments and subsegments 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES Segment assets are assets relating to the Group’s insurance and complementary operations that are used by a segment to provide its services, including assets that are directly attributable to the segment or that can reasonably be allocated to it. Segment assets include investments accounted for by the equity method, based on the allocation of these Management investments in the “Investment Book” of each subsidiary that has significant influence over said investment. The Report profit or loss from such investments is included in the ordinary profit of the segment in question. Segment liabilities include the Group’s share of the liabilities arising from the segment’s activities that are directly attributable to the segment or can reasonably be allocated to it. If the segment result includes interest expense, the related interest-bearing liabilities are included in segment liabilities. Allocation of income and expenses to the primary segments and sub-segments Condolidated Financial Statements Technical income and technical expenses deriving from insurance transactions are allocated directly to either the Life or the Non-life segment, and in the case of the latter segment, to one of its various sub-segments, depending on the nature of the transaction. Financial income and expenses are allocated to the Life and Non-life segments according to the prior allocation of the assets that generated the income or expense in question, as shown in the each insurance company’s Notes to the “Investment Book”. The same financial instrument may be allocated to more than one segment. Where a Consolidated Financial portfolio associated with the Life, Non-life or Other Activities segment includes an interest in a non-insurance subsidiary, the individual income statement of the subsidiary in question has been consolidated in the segment in question on a line-by-line basis, respecting the allocation recorded in the “Investment Book”. The Group’s share of the results of associates, which is shown separately in the income statement, has been allocated to the different Statements segments on the basis of the percentage of the investment that each segment represents within each investment portfolio. Income and expense deriving from equity securities and other financial instruments not directly related Auditors Report on to the insurance business are assigned to the ‘Other Activities’ segment. Consolidated Financial The aforesaid financial income and expense is allocated between the various Non-life sub-segments mainly on the basis of the technical provisions established for each of the lines in question. The ‘Other Activities’ segment includes income and expenses which, should not be included in the Statments aforementioned technical segments. Corporate All other non-technical and non-financial income and expense directly or indirectly related to the different segments has been assigned to the corresponding segments directly, according to the segment that generated it or on some other reasonable basis. In the latter case, a cost allocation method based on functional activities has been used. This involves identifying the activities and tasks performed in each business process and allocating to each Governance Report activity the resources it uses or generates. Thus, in the attached income statement, part of the general and administrative expenses is presented under the headings “Claims incurred in the year, net of reinsurance”, “Other technical costs” and “Expenses arising from tangible fixed assets and investments”, while the rest is presented as “Net operating expenses”. 78 The appendices to the Group’s consolidated financial statements and Note 17 provide consolidated segment financial information, including breakdowns of ordinary income and expense and segment assets and liabilities, as Key Figures well as any assets and liabilities which have been excluded or have not been allocated. This information is provided independently of the obligation under Spanish GAAP, applicable to the Spanish insurance companies included in the consolidated group, to disclose accounting and statistical information to the DGSFP. 2.i) Cash flow statement In the cash flow statement the following expressions are used: Letter to  Cash flows: inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are highly liquid shortterm investments, with a maturity of less than three months which are readily convertible into specific cash amounts and are subject to negligible risk of changes in value. Shareholders  Operating activities: activities typical of insurance companies and other activities that cannot be classified as investment or finance activities. Grupo Catalana  Investment activities: the acquisition, sale or other disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash and cash equivalents. Occidente  Financing activities: activities that result in changes in the size and composition of equity and of the liabilities that are not part of operating activities. Transactions with own shares are considered financing activities. Dividends paid by the parent to its shareholders are also included in this category. 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management 3. Significant accounting principles and policies and measurement bases used Report The main principles, accounting policies and measurement bases used in preparing the Group’s consolidated financial statements are as follows: 3.a) Cash and cash equivalents Condolidated This balance sheet item consists of liquid assets, including cash, sight deposits, and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments, with a maturity of less than three months that are Financial Statements readily convertible into specific cash amounts and are subject to negligible risk of changes in value. 3.b) Financial assets Notes to the 3.b.1) Recognition Consolidated Financial Financial assets are generally recognised on the date of settlement. In Accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the Group classifies its financial instruments at initial recognition in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, available for sale and loans and receivables. Statements 3.b.2) Classification of financial assets Auditors Report on Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements shows the book value of financial assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011, together with the specific nature of these assets, classified as follows: Consolidated Financial ─ Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Statments Within this category, two types of financial asset are distinguished  Financial assets held for trading (HFT portfolio): Corporate These financial assets are classified as held for trading because they are acquired principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing them in the short term, are part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit0 Governance Report taking or are derivatives not designated as hedging instruments.  Other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL portfolio): 79 These assets are classified into financial schemes or portfolios allocated to insurance transactions (insurance contracts for which the flows arising from the financial assets sufficiently match, in timing and quantity, the Key Figures obligations stemming from a group of homogeneous policies). The Group allocates to this portfolio all financial instruments with an associated or embedded derivative and part of its investments in bonds, whether or not the bonds are traded on an active market, part of its long-term deposits and all non-mortgage loans corresponding to financed premiums for outsourced pension plans. The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted on an active market or for which no firm market Letter to value is available from the counterparty (or through a contributor) is determined by discounting the cash flows the assets in question are expected to generate, using the market yield curve (see following section). Shareholders ─ Loans and receivables (LR portfolio): Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The majority of the Group’s mortgage loans, non-mortgage loans, advances against policies, other Grupo Catalana financial assets without published price quotations and receivables relating to the deposits required in the inward reinsurance business are included in this category. Occidente 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES Other receivables such as receivables arising out of direct insurance, reinsurance and coinsurance operations and other receivables other than tax assets are also presented in this category, according to their nature. Some of these items are excluded from the scope of IAS 39 and are specifically dealt with by other IFRS standards. Management ─ Available-for-sale financial assets (AFS portfolio): Report This category includes all financial assets that are not classified in the other portfolios. As a general rule, the Group includes in this category all equity instruments, the part of its portfolio of quoted and unquoted bonds that is not specifically set aside to cover commitments to insured customers, all its shares and units in mutual funds, part of its long-term deposits, and other financial assets with Condolidated published price quotations. Financial Statements Investments in associates are accounted for under the specific sub-heading of “Investments in entities accounted for using the equity method”. In 2012, and in the previous one, no financial instruments were classified as “Held-to-maturity investments”, 3.b.3) Recognition and measurement of financial assets Notes to the Consolidated Financial The Group measures financial assets at initial recognition at fair value, adjusted (in the case of financial assets not recognised at fair value through profit or loss) for any transaction costs directly attributable to the purchase or issue thereof. Statements After initial recognition, the Group measures financial assets, including derivatives that are assets, at fair value, without any deduction for transaction costs incurred on sale, except for certain loans and receivables which are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Auditors Report on Consolidated Financial The fair value of a financial instrument on a given date is taken to be the amount for which the asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties who are properly informed and in a mutual independence condition. The most objective and common reference for the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be determined on the basis of the quoted prices published in the active market. When such reference Statments exists, it is used to measure the financial asset. However, in certain cases the price quotations provided by the various counterparties who would be willing to exchange a certain financial asset or the prices indicated by the Corporate contributors are also considered. In the absence of an active market for a financial instrument, the Group determines fair value using generally accepted measurement techniques. In this case, mathematical valuation models are used that have been Governance Report sufficiently tested by the international financial community (discounting estimated future cash flows based on forward interest rates corrected for the credit spreads applicable to the issuer), taking into account the specific characteristics of the instrument to be measured and the various types of risk associated with it. These mathematical models may be used directly by the Group or by the counterparty who acted as seller. 80 The Group has also contracted a structured investments valuation service from Serfiex, a specialist in the sector. This service enables the valuations provided by the contributors to be compared with internal valuation Key Figures methods. For those structured investments where liquidity is not guaranteed through the contributor being quoted on an active market, the Group recognises the market value calculated by Serfiex. Financial instruments are therefore classified into to three levels, according to the inputs used to determine their fair value:  Level 1: prices quoted in active markets. Letter to  Level 2: prices quoted in active markets for similar instruments or other valuation techniques where all the significant inputs are based on directly or indirectly observable market data. Shareholders  Level 3: valuation techniques where a significant input is not based on observable market data. An input is considered significant when it has a major impact on the determination of total fair value. Grupo Catalana Instruments measured at amortised cost are measured taking into account the effective interest rate method. Amortised cost is taken to be the amount at which the financial instrument was initially measured, minus principal repayments, plus or minus, as appropriate, the cumulative gradual amortisation or allocation, using the Occidente effective interest rate method, of any difference between that initial amount and the redemption value upon maturity, minus any reduction for impairment or non-collectability. 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES All financial assets except for those recognised at fair value through profit or loss are subject to impairment testing. Management 3.b.4) Impairment of financial assets. Report At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired, taking into account events that either individually or in conjunction with others provide such evidence. As a general rule, a prolonged and significant decline in the market value of equity and debt securities, taken Condolidated individually, below their cost or amortised cost is considered evidence of impairment. Cases where the unrealised loss on a given security is irreversible are also considered evidence of impairment. Where there is evidence of impairment, based on the aforesaid criteria, the Group analyses the situation to Financial Statements determine the extent of the loss to be recognised. The following methods are used to determine the amount of the impairment: Notes to the  Financial assets carried at amortised cost: The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s book value and the present value of Consolidated Financial estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The book value of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account, while the amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. Statements If in subsequent periods the amount of the impairment loss decreases, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed in the income statement. This type of asset includes the amounts receivable by the Group from certain insured customers and/or Auditors Report on policyholders for uncollected or unbilled premiums. In this case, impairment is determined on the basis of the last three (3) years’ cancellation experience, and taking into account the number of months elapsed between the theoretical collection date and each reporting date, as well as the line of insurance in question. Consolidated Financial Statments Receivables on the recovery of claims are capitalised when realisation is sufficiently guaranteed. Corporate  Available-for-sale financial assets: When the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset declines significantly, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the profit or loss account, even though the Governance Report financial asset has not been derecognised. 81 Impairment losses recognised in profit or loss for investments in equity instruments classified as available for sale (equity securities) are not reversed through profit or loss. However, reversals associated with debt instruments are Key Figures recognised in the profit or loss account. The Group's impairment criteria and policies for establishing if there is evidence of impairment losses on available-for-sale financial assets: Listed or unlisted debt instruments are considered to have suffered an impairment if there is objective evidence of such as a result of one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset and this event or events have an impact on the future estimated cash flows associated with the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. The downgrading of an entity's credit rating is not in itself evidence of a loss of value, although it may indicate an impairment when taken together with other Letter to available information. A decline in the fair value of an asset to below its cost is also not prima facie evidence of an impairment loss. These events are evaluated together with other situations that may indicate a loss (e.g. if the issuer is in serious financial difficulties, if contractual clauses have been breached, if a bidding Shareholders event or financial reorganisation is likely, or if the active market for the instrument disappears. The Group determines if there is evidence of impairment losses on listed equity instruments primarily on Grupo Catalana the basis of establishing time or percentage criteria for comparing the average cost of the instrument with its quoted price. Specifically, criteria established by Group policy, in line with the local requirements to which the majority of its subsidiaries are subject, are: Occidente  Percentage range: a drop of 40% or greater in the listed price compared with the average 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES acquisition cost.  Time range: a sustained decline in the listed price over 18 months. The Group also considers situations where the issuer is declared, or is likely to be declared, insolvent, or has significant financial difficulties to be objective evidence of impairment losses. Management Once an impairment loss has been established, on the basis of the aforementioned parameters or circumstances, a specific analysis is carried out of the equity instrument to confirm or discount the need to make provisions, including studies of key figures and the influence of market factors (changes in the Report valuation methods used by analysts, changes in the multipliers underlying market prices, etc.). For unlisted equity instruments, the criteria applied to determine impairment losses are based on comparing the average acquisition cost of the instrument with its fair value calculated using best estimates according to Condolidated the information available. Financial Statements 3.b.5) Recognition of changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities A gain or loss arising from a change in the fair value of a financial asset that is not part of a hedging transaction is recognised as follows:  Any profit or loss on a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in the profit and Notes to the loss account for the year under the heading “Losses on investments” or “Gains on the sale of Consolidated Financial investments” in the Life insurance line income statement.  Statements Any profit or loss on an available-for-sale asset is recognised directly in equity, in the “Valuation adjustments” line, until the financial asset is derecognised, except for impairment losses and exchange gains or losses. Upon reversal of the asset, the profit or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the profit and loss account for the year. Auditors Report on Consolidated Financial However, interest calculated using the effective interest rate method is recognised in the income statement for the year (see point l of this Note). Dividends on an equity instrument classified as available for sale are recognised in the profit and loss account for the year when the Group’s right to receive payment has been established. Statments When a financial asset recognised at amortised cost is derecognised or impaired, or the effective interest rate Corporate method is applied to it, the resulting income and expenses are recognised through the profit and loss account. Governance Report 82 3.b.6) Investments held for the benefit of policyholders who bear the investment risk. Key Figures Investments held for the benefit of insurance policyholders who bear the investment risk are measured at cost upon subscription or purchase thereof. This cost price is subsequently adjusted on the basis of the assets’ realisable value. Any revaluation or impairment of these assets is credited or charged to the Life segment income statement under the headings “Income from investments assigned to insurance policies where policyholders bear the investment risk” and “Expenses of investments assigned to insurance policies where policyholders bear the investment risk”. All equity, fixed-income and other instruments quoted on official markets and linked to insurance in which the Letter to policyholder assumes the investment risk are designated and classified as “Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss”. Only financial assets without published price quotations (treasury bills, short-term bank deposits, etc.) and other assets allocated to the business are assigned to the Loans and receivables portfolio. Shareholders For presentation purposes, all investments and balances assigned to the business are classified by portfolio under the balance sheet headings “Other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss” and “Loans and receivables’”, while the liabilities assigned to these contracts are classified as “Technical provisions – for life Grupo Catalana insurance policies”. 3.c) Property, Plant and Equipment Occidente The Group records under this balance sheet item all owner-occupied property, properties occupied by companies of the Group and properties under construction or development for future use as investment property, all of 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES which property is held in fee simple. Properties under construction or development are reclassified as investment property on completion. Management “Property, plant and equipment” also includes transport equipment, furniture and fixtures, and computer hardware. Report Property, plant and equipment assets are stated at acquisition or construction cost, less accumulated depreciation and, where applicable, accumulated impairment losses, but never at less than their residual value. The cost of additions and improvements that expand the capacity or floor area, increase the returns or extend the useful life of property held by the Group subsequent to initial recognition are capitalised and recorded under “Other Condolidated tangible fixed assets”. Conversely, upkeep and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Group does not capitalise any financial expenses associated with these assets. When payments on acquisition of a property are deferred, their cost is the cash price equivalent. The difference Financial Statements between the cash price equivalent and the total payment is recognised as interest expense over the deferred period. In general, the Group applies the straight-line systematic depreciation method to the acquisition cost, excluding Notes to the the residual value, over the following estimated useful lives: Consolidated Financial Tangible Fixed Asset Items Estimated useful life Property (excluding land) Between 33 and 77 years Statements Improvements to owned property 10 years Transport equipment Between 5 and 7 years Data processing hardware Between 3 and 5 years Auditors Report on Other property, plant and equipment Between 3 and 10 years Consolidated Financial Property under construction is depreciated from the moment it is in a usable condition. Statments The residual values and remaining useful lives of these assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted as appropriate. The recognised book value of an asset is immediately reduced in line with its recoverable amount Corporate if the book value is greater than the estimated recoverable value. Profits and losses on disposal are calculated by comparing the net sale proceeds with the recognised book values. Governance Report 83 The market value of owner-occupied property indicated in Note 8.a) to the consolidated financial statements has been obtained from appraisals carried out by independent experts (Inmoseguros), which are no more than 3 years Key Figures old at December 31, 2012. For property located in Spain, the previous market value has been determined in accordance with Order ECO/805/2003 of March 27, partly amended by Order EHA 3011/2007 of October 4, on rules for valuing real estate and certain rights for specified financial purposes. 3.d) Investment property Property that is held for capital appreciation or to generate rental income over the long term and that is not occupied by Group companies is classified as investment property. Letter to Also included under this heading is land held for a currently undetermined future use and buildings that are Shareholders currently vacant. Some properties are partly held to earn rentals and partly owner-occupied. If the two parts can be sold separately, the Group accounts for the parts separately. Otherwise, dual-use property is classified as investment property only if the owner-occupied part is insignificant. “Investment property” includes land and buildings held by the Group in full ownership. It is recognised at Grupo Catalana acquisition or construction cost, less accumulated depreciation and, where applicable, accumulated impairment Occidente losses, but never at less than its residual value. Acquisition cost consists of the purchase price and any expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition (associated transaction costs). The acquisition cost of self-constructed 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES investment property is the property’s cost at the date when construction or development is complete. The accounting treatment of the costs of any addition, modernisation or improvement and the impairment tests, depreciation methods and useful lives established for investment property are similar to those used for owneroccupied property (see Note 3.c). Management Report The market value of the investment property indicated in Note 8.b) to the consolidated financial statements has been obtained in accordance with the rules described in the previous section on owner-occupied property. 3.e) Intangible assets Condolidated “Intangible assets” comprise all identifiable non-monetary assets without physical substance that arise as a result of an acquisition from a third party or are generated internally by a company of the Group. Intangible assets that are identifiable, have future economic benefits and are under the Group’s control are recognised if, and only if, Financial Statements their cost can be reliably estimated and the future economic benefits associated with them are likely to flow to the Group. The Group measures intangible assets initially at acquisition or production cost and subsequently at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. To determine whether intangible assets are impaired, the Group applies IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets and subsequent interpretations. Notes to the Consolidated Financial The Group assesses whether the useful life of intangible assets is finite or indefinite and, if finite, assesses its duration. 3.e.1) Goodwill on Consolidation Statements Auditors Report on “Goodwill on Consolidation” reflects any positive consolidation differences arising from the acquisition of equity interests in subsidiaries. It is equal to the excess of the cost of the business combination over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, provided such excess cannot be assigned to Consolidated Financial specific tangible or intangible assets. Statments Goodwill acquired since January 1, 2004 is recognised at acquisition cost, while goodwill acquired before this date is recognised at the net book value at December 31, 2003, determined in accordance with the former Spanish accounting rules. In both cases, goodwill acquired through a business combination is not amortised, but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances so advise. In accordance with IAS 36 –Impairment of Assets, for the purpose of identifying possible impairment losses, Corporate Group management analyses and assesses the estimates and forecasts provided by the various subsidiaries in order Governance Report to determine whether the projected income and cash flows of these companies attributable to the Group support the net value of the goodwill recognised. These estimates and projections are based on the following methodology, parameters and assumptions: 84 Goodwill is allocated to the subsidiary that generated it, each such subsidiary representing a cashgenerating unit that is independent of any other unit or segment. Key Figures The recoverable amount of units allocated in Spain is determined by reference to its value in use, taking into account forecasts of profit from ordinary activities after tax for the next 10 years, and also a residual value of the investments determined by reference to price-earnings ratios (PER) that are generally accepted in the insurance industry. The projections of profit from ordinary activities are a reflection of past experience and are consistent with external sources of information. Letter to To evaluate the projections made for the operations of Atradius NV, the Group contracted the services of an independent expert ‘Analistas Financieros Internacionales, AFI’ which, in accordance with the generally accepted systems used by investment banks, determined the recoverable amount based on the discounted value of the Shareholders future dividends it expects to receive (dividend discount model). In order to determine it, investee’s projected business plans and basic assumptions about the parameters that will affect the business’s future results are used. The discounted rate applied to the projections is calculated on the basis of a risk-free interest rate (average of the last 10 years of the German government bonds) plus a risk premium that includes general market risk and the specific risk of the investment. Grupo Catalana In the event of an impairment loss on goodwill, the loss is recognised in the income statement for the year in which the loss occurs and cannot be reversed either at the end of that year or in subsequent years. Occidente Goodwill attached to associates is included, purely for presentation purposes, in the book value of the investment. To identify possible impairments, the Group either: 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES Calculates the present value of the portion of the future cash flows the subsidiary is expected to Management generate that is attributable to the Group, taking into account all future cash flows projected to derive from the subsidiary’s ordinary operations, plus any amounts expected ultimately to be realised on the sale, or disposal by other means, of the investment or asset in question; or Report Updates the projected future cash flows it expects to receive by way of dividends and on the ultimate sale or other disposal of the investment. Condolidated 3.e.2) Policy portfolio acquisition expenses The amount of this balance sheet item corresponds basically to the difference between the price paid for an insurance business transfer and the related book value. This item also includes amounts paid upon acquisition of a Financial Statements group of policies from various agents, which amounts are totally residual. These portfolio acquisition expenses are measured in the same way as consolidation goodwill, as the intangible assets in question are expected to provide future economic benefits to the Group indefinitely. Notes to the Where the Group has taken control of insurance companies, a distinction is made between the intangible assets Consolidated Financial associated with rights and obligations existing at the time of the acquisition, which are measured and recorded if the amount is material to the Group (for example, implied profit margins or discounting of technical provisions in respect of claims incurred and pending settlement at the transaction date), and intangible assets associated with Statements rights and obligations which did not exist at that date. In the latter case, the Group estimates the value of the assets if they are material and can be reliably measured. If they cannot be reliably measured, they are added to the goodwill on the transaction. Auditors Report on 3.e.3) Other intangible assets Consolidated Financial The specific accounting policies applied to the main assets included in Other intangible assets are described below: Statments IT Applications Corporate This balance sheet line consists primarily of deferred charges associated with the development of IT systems and electronic communication channels. Acquired software licences are valued on the basis of acquisition costs and right of use of the specific software, Governance Report provided they are expected to be used for several years, and are recorded as computer software acquired entirely from third parties. Also included in this line are the costs of third parties involved in developing software for the Group. 85 Where software is developed internally, the Group capitalises the expenses directly associated with the production of exclusive, identifiable computer software controlled by the Group, that is, the labour costs of the software Key Figures development teams and the corresponding portion of associated indirect costs. The rest of the costs associated with the development or maintenance of internal projects are expensed as incurred. Subsequent costs are capitalised only if they increase the future benefits of the related intangible assets. Recurring costs incurred as a result of modifications or updates of computer software or systems and system overhaul and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Computer software is amortised systematically over its useful life, which is estimated to be a maximum of three to five years for software acquired from third parties and a maximum of five years for software developed internally. Letter to Shareholders 3.f) Non-current assets held for sale and associated liabilities Assets held for sale are generally recognised at the lower of their book value and fair value, less estimated costs to sell, the latter being understood to mean all marginal costs directly attributable to their disposal, excluding any finance costs and corporation tax. Non-current assets classified as held for sale are not amortised. Grupo Catalana Occidente Impairment losses of their book value are recognised in the profit and loss account. Should the loss be reversed, 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES the reversal is recognised in the profit and loss account for an amount equal to the impairment loss previously recognised. 3.g) Transactions in foreign currency 3.g.1) Functional currency Management The functional currency of the parent company and of the subsidiaries that have their registered office in the Report European Monetary Union is the Euro. Certain subsidiaries of Atradius N.V. present their financial statements in the currency of the main economic environment in which they operate, so their functional currency is other than the euro. Condolidated The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, the Group’s presentation currency. Therefore, all balances and transactions denominated in currencies other than the euro are deemed to be denominated in Financial Statements “foreign currency”. 3.g.2) Rules for translation of foreign currency balances Foreign currency balances are translated into euros in two steps: Notes to the  The foreign currency is translated into the functional currency (the currency of the main economic Consolidated Financial environment in which the subsidiary operates or into the euro in the case of companies domiciled in the Monetary Union), and  The balances held in the functional currencies of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro are translated into euros. Statements Translation of foreign currency into the functional currency: Auditors Report on Foreign currency transactions carried out by consolidated entities (or entities accounted for by the equity Consolidated Financial method) that are not domiciled in EMU countries are recognised initially at their equivalent value in the entities’ functional currency, using the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction dates. Monetary items in foreign currency are subsequently translated to the companies’ functional currencies using the closing Statments rate. Similarly:  Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated into the functional currency at the Corporate exchange rate at the date of acquisition,  Non-monetary items measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate on the date when the fair value was determined,  Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period for all the Governance Report transactions performed during the year, 86  The balances arising from non-hedging forward foreign currency/foreign currency and foreign currency/euro purchase and sale transactions are translated at the closing rates prevailing in the Key Figures forward foreign currency market for the related maturity. The Group follows the same rules when converting the foreign currency items and transactions of subsidiaries domiciled in the Monetary Union into euros. Translation of functional currencies into euros: The balances reported by consolidated entities (or entities accounted for by the equity method) whose Letter to functional currency is not the euro are translated into euros as follows: Shareholders  Assets and liabilities, at the closing rate.  Income and expenses, using the average monthly exchange rates (unless the average is not a reasonable approximation to the cumulative effect of the rates in force at the transaction dates, in which case the rates prevailing on the transaction dates are used), and Grupo Catalana  Equity, at the historical exchange rates. Occidente 3.g.3) Recording of exchange differences 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign currency balances into the functional currency are generally recognised in the income statement at their net amount. Nevertheless: Management Exchange differences arising on non-monetary items whose fair value is adjusted against equity are recognised in equity under “Valuation adjustments Available-for-sale portfolios”. Report Exchange differences arising on non-monetary items whose gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss for the year are also recognised in profit or loss, without differentiating them from other changes in fair value. Condolidated Exchange differences arising on translation of the financial information of subsidiaries denominated in functional currencies other than the euro are recorded in consolidated equity under the heading “Exchange differences” until the subsidiary or associate concerned is removed from the balance sheet, at which time they are recognised Financial Statements in profit or loss. 3.g.4) Exchange rates used Notes to the The functional currencies of the most important subsidiaries and associates of Atradius N.V. and the currencies Consolidated Financial of the Group’s other foreign currency balances are listed, showing their year-end and average exchange rate for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Statements Year-end rate Average annual rate Currency 12/31/2011 12/31/2012 12/31/2011 12/31/2012 Auditors Report on U.S. Dollar 0.773 0.758 0.745 0.775 Pound Sterling 1.197 1.225 1.168 1.230 Consolidated Financial Japanese Yen 0.010 0.009 0.010 0.010 Swiss Franc 0.823 0.828 0.815 0.830 Statments Swedish Krona 0.112 0.117 0.109 0.115 Norwegian Krone 0.129 0.136 0.129 0.133 Danish crown 0.135 0.134 0.134 0.134 Corporate Mexican peso 0.055 0.059 0.055 0.059 Australian Dollar 0.786 0.787 0.760 0.804 Governance Report 87 3.h) Company income tax Key Figures The corporation tax charge for the year is computed on the basis of accounting profit before taxes, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Spain and the other countries in which the subsidiaries of Atradius N.V. operate, adjusted for any permanent differences, these being differences between taxable profit and accounting profit before tax that do not reverse in subsequent periods and differences arising from application of the new IFRS in respect of which, likewise, no reversal will take place. When the differences in value are recognised in equity, the related income tax is likewise charged to equity. Letter to Both temporary differences arising from differences between the book value and the tax base of an asset or liability and, where assets are capitalised, tax assets arising from tax credits and rebates and tax losses give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities. Such deferred tax assets or liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are Shareholders expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. The Group recognises deferred tax liabilities for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered highly probable that the consolidated companies will have sufficient taxable profits in the future against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised. The deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012 Grupo Catalana have been estimated using the prevailing tax rates. Occidente 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES In the case of temporary tax differences arising from investments in companies of the Group (which are not consolidated for tax purposes) and associates, a deferred tax asset is recognised, except when the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary differences and the differences are unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax Management authorities, using the statutory tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Accordingly, Report the Group has calculated the corporate income tax liability at December 31, 2012, applying the tax regulations in force on measures to stimulate economic activity in companies resident in Spain for tax purposes and taking the various tax regimes for foreign companies into account (subsidiaries of Atradius N.V.). 3.i) Financial liabilities Condolidated A financial liability is a contractual obligation requiring the Group to deliver cash or another financial asset to Financial Statements another entity or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity on terms that are potentially unfavourable. Financial liabilities do not include the Group’s obligations at the different balance sheet dates arising from or associated with insurance policies in force. No securities have been issued that are convertible into shares of the Notes to the parent or that grant privileges or rights which may, under certain circumstances, make the securities convertible into shares. The Group’s most significant financial liabilities relate to the subordinated debt issued by Atradius N.V. (see Note 11). Consolidated Financial After initial recognition at fair value, in general the Group measures all its financial liabilities at amortised cost Statements using the effective interest rate method. When a financial liability recognised at amortised cost is derecognised or impaired, or the effective interest rate Auditors Report on method is applied to it, the resulting income and expenses are recognised in the income statement. At December 31, 2012, neither the parent nor any other Group company has guaranteed any other debt securities issued by associates or third parties unrelated to the Group. Consolidated Financial Statments 3. j) Insurance and reinsurance assets and liabilities The Group applies the requirements established in IFRS 4 – Insurance Contracts to all the insurance assets and Corporate liabilities recognised in its consolidated financial statements that derive from insurance contracts, as defined in this standard Governance Report 88 3.j.1) Classification of the portfolio of contracts Key Figures The Group assesses and classifies its portfolio of direct Life and Non-life business (including inward reinsurance) and of outward reinsurance taking into account the Implementation Guidance accompanying IFRS 4 and the guidelines issued, other than for statutory purposes, by the DGSFP on December 22, 2004, through the Framework Document on the Accounting System for Insurance Companies in relation to IFRS 4. All contracts are classified as “insurance contracts”, including the financial guarantee contracts issued by the Group in the form of insurance contracts, in accordance with the exception provided for in the amendment published on January 27, 2006. Letter to The Group does not unbundle any deposit components associated with insurance contracts, since such unbundling is voluntary in nature. Also, it is considered that the surrender options issued to the insurance policyholders either have a fair value of zero or, alternatively, that their value forms part of the insurance liability. Shareholders 3.j.2) Valuation of insurance and reinsurance assets and liabilities IFRS 4 imposes restrictions on permitted changes to accounting policies for insurance contracts. Pursuant to this Grupo Catalana standard, the Group has maintained the valuation rules for insurance contract assets and liabilities applicable under the accounting principles and valuation rules established in Spain and the other countries in which the Group operates, which are mandatory for all insurance providers, except for the following adjustment: Occidente  Apply the liability adequacy test provided for in IFRS 4, with a view to ensuring the adequacy of contractual liabilities. To this end, the Group compares the book value of technical provisions, less any 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES deferred acquisition costs or any intangible assets related to the insurance contracts under assessment, against the amount determined as a result of considering current estimates, using market interest rates, of all cash flows under the insurance contracts and related cash flows, such as those resulting from Management embedded options and guarantees. Report In the above calculation the Group offsets deficits against surpluses, considering the various types of insurance included in the life insurance line as a single level of aggregation. For a small group of the foreign subsidiaries of Atradius N.V. these calculations are made locally and are subject to external actuarial review or centralised assessment of the methods used. The Group Condolidated considers that the adequacy of these liabilities has been effectively proven. As the liabilities were adequate according to the calculations made at December 31, 2012 and 2011, it Financial Statements was not necessary to increase the amount of insurance liabilities recognised as of those dates. For the purpose of partially avoiding the mismatches caused by the use of different valuation bases for financial assets, which are classified mainly under the available-for-sale portfolio, and insurance liabilities, the Group reassigns the portion of the unrealised gains arising from the above assets which are expected to be allocated to Notes to the the insured in the future as they materialise or by applying an assumed interest rate higher than the maximum rate permitted by DGSFP. The reassignment is done by decreasing the valuation adjustments to equity through Consolidated Financial the “Corrections of accounting mismatches” sub-heading and recording an increase in liabilities through the “Other liabilities” sub-heading. Statements The main accounting policies applied by the Group in connection with the technical provisions are summarised below. Auditors Report on Unearned premiums and unexpired risks reserves Consolidated Financial The unearned premiums provision is the proportion of premiums earned in the year to be allocated to the period from each year-end to the expiry of the policy period. The insurance companies of the Group, including Crédito y Caución, calculate this provision by reference to the premium rates for each line of insurance on a policy-byStatments policy basis, net, where appropriate, of the loading for contingencies (i.e., commissions and other acquisition costs are not deducted). Corporate The unexpired risks provision is intended to complement the unearned premiums provision to the extent that the amount of this provision is not sufficient to reflect the measurement of all risks and expenses to be covered in relation to the coverage period not closed at year-end. It is calculated and established, as needed, for the Spanish companies in the Group, in accordance with the calculation stipulated in Article 31 of the Private Insurance Governance Report Regulations (ROSSP), amended by Royal Decree 239/2007 of February 16, considering the technical result by year of occurrence for the closing year jointly with the previous year or the four previous years, depending on the business line in question. 89 The above calculation is made for each line or product sold, understood as the specific guarantee or group of related guarantees with respect to the risks arising from the same type of insured object. Key Figures In the credit insurance business, Atradius N.V., unlike the rest of the Group and as permitted by IFRS 4, adjusts the amount of premium income based on unexpired risks by recording a provision for claims not yet reported instead of the provision for unearned premiums. Life insurance reserves This reserve comprises the unearned premiums reserve for insurance policies with a coverage period equal to or shorter than a year and, mainly for other lines of insurance, the mathematical provision. Mathematical provisions, Letter to which represent the excess of the current actuarial value of the future obligations of insurance subsidiaries over Shareholders the value of the premiums payable by policyholders, are calculated on a policy-by-policy basis using an individual capitalisation method, by reference to the valuation premium earned in the year, in accordance with the Technical Bases of each line of insurance, adjusted, as appropriate, for the mortality tables accepted under current Spanish legislation. Grupo Catalana The Group also values the options for the insured when they can choose the maturity of the policy, primarily in endowment insurance and retirement for which there is currently no new business, including a capital or an annuity whose interest rate is fixed from the moment of contracting the policy. Provisions for life insurance policies where risk is borne by policyholders Occidente 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES For presentation purposes the technical provisions relating to insurance policies in which policyholders bear the investment risk are included in liabilities under “Technical provisions – Life insurance provision”. The related technical provisions are determined based on the indices or assets established as a reference for determining the economic value of the policyholders’ rights (see Note 13). Management Report Claims provision This provision includes the total amount of obligations outstanding as a result of claims incurred at year-end. The Group calculates this provision as the difference between the total estimated or certain cost of claims incurred but not reported, settled or paid and the aggregate amounts of such claims already paid on account. Claims not yet settled or paid and claims not yet reported. Condolidated Financial Statements Statistical methods The subsidiary Seguros Catalana Occidente, Sociedad Anónima de Seguros y Reaseguros uses global statistical methods to calculate the provision for outstanding and unpaid claims and claims incurred but not yet reported in the following lines, with the following dates of reporting, authorisation and effect for accounting purposes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Lines in which global statistical methods are applied, gross and net of Date of reporting Date of authorisation Effective date for reinsurance to DGSFP by DGSFP accounting purposes Statements General third-party liability January 29, 2007 January 8, 2008 December 31, 2007 Auditors Report on Auto third party liability Other auto insurance December 17, January 8, 2008 December 31, 2007 Consolidated Financial Multirisk: 2007 Family Home Multirisks: Statments Retail Blocks of Flats Corporate Industrial (SME) May 30, 2008 July 10, 2008 December 31, 2008 Other (Offices) Accident Governance Report Transport 90 The subsidiary Bilbao Compañía Anómina de Seguros y Reaseguros also uses global statistical methods to calculate the provision for outstanding and unpaid claims and claims incurred but not yet reported in the Key Figures following lines, with the following dates of reporting, authorisation and effect for accounting purposes: Lines in which global statistical methods are applied, gross and net of Date of reporting Date of authorisation Effective date for accounting reinsurance to DGSFP by DGSFP purposes Letter to Autos third party liability Autos-Other Liabilities General third-party liability Shareholders Multirisk: Family Home June 22, 2010 September 24, 2010 December 31, 2010 -Retail -Blocks of Flats -Industrial (SME) Grupo Catalana Accident Transports-goods Occidente For these lines, the provision for outstanding or unpaid claims and unreported losses is calculated globally, without separating the two components. For the abovementioned lines, the provision has been calculated in 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES accordance with the best estimate provided by internal actuarial calculations, using generally accepted deterministic and stochastic models. Details of the methods and the main assumptions used in calculating these provisions at December 31, 2012, are given below: Management  The Group has chosen the (deterministic) Chain Ladder method for calculating claims paid and Report incurred, complemented by the (stochastic) Bootstrap technique.  The confidence level has been set at 50%, without taking into account any inflation effects or financial discount for the passage of time. Outlier claims, defined as claims whose estimated cost exceeds a certain amount, depending on the line, are excluded from these methods, despite of being assessed at an Condolidated 0 individual level.  Estimated payments are net of recoveries. Financial Statements These subsidiaries undertook an annual suitability check of the calculations made in accordance with the requirements of the Regulations. Notes to the For the purpose of the fiscal deductibility of the statistically calculated claims provision, the minimum amount of the provision has been calculated in accordance with the requirements of the Third Additional Provision of Royal Decree 239/2007 of February 16, amending the ROSSP. Differences between the provisions made and those Consolidated Financial considered a tax-deductible expense have been recorded as temporary differences. Statements In addition, on December 31, 2005, Seguros Catalana Occidente entered into an obligatory 100% quota share reinsurance agreement to guarantee the legal liability insurance, which is the most important insurance business ceded. Seguros Bilbao has the same type of agreement. In this case, neither company assesses claims on an individual basis. Depsa, Sociedad Anónima de Seguros y Reaseguros (‘Depsa’) manages and assesses claims and is 0 Auditors Report on responsible for determining both claims incurred and the claims provision using its own statistical methods, which it uses with the prior authorisation of the DGSFP. Consolidated Financial With the exception of its subsidiary Crédito y Caución, S.A., the subsidiary Atradius, N.V. uses statistical methods to calculate the claims provision for the direct credit insurance business, excluding the larger claims, which are Statments assessed individually. Expected losses are estimated using historical claims data, which are compared with claims estimates and other known trends and developments. Claims estimates are based on trends in reported claims, the time elapsed between each claim event and the reporting of the claim, the average costs of claims, the proportion Corporate of expenses, and recoveries. Individual assessments Governance Report For all other outstanding and unpaid claims of the remaining companies and/or lines, the amount of the provision is calculated on a case-by-case basis, using the best information available at year-end. 91 Key Figures Unreported losses Except for the lines in which statistical methods are used, the provision for unreported losses is calculated based on the insurance companies’ experience, taking into account the average costs and unreported losses of the last five (5) years. Internal claims settlement expenses The claims provision includes an estimated amount for internal management and claims handling expenses. This Letter to is to meet any expenses the company may incur in finally settling claims that have to be included in the claims Shareholders provision for direct insurance and inward reinsurance. This estimate is calculated in accordance with Article 42 of the ROSSP, taking into account the ratio between claims-related internal expenses and claims paid, adjusted for the change in the claims provision in each line. This percentage is applied to the claims provision for each line, taking into account the expense allocation system and the systems for calculating the claims provision explained previously. Independently of the valuation method used and pursuant to current law, the Group does not discount the claims Grupo Catalana provision. Provisions for policyholder dividends and returns Occidente 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES These provisions include the earnings accrued to insured customers or beneficiaries that are not yet allocated at year-end. They do not reflect the effect of allocating part of the unrealised capital gains on the investment portfolio to policyholders, which is included in the “Other liabilities” sub-heading. Management Other technical provisions – Provision for funeral insurance Report This provision is recognised on the basis of the actuarial approach to the transaction, pursuant to the Technical Basis of the insurance contracts. Condolidated Lastly, details of the rest of the main accounting policies, other than the technical provisions, used by the Group in relation to other assets and liabilities related to insurance contracts are given below: Commissions and deferred acquisition expenses It should be noted that the “Other assets” heading on the asset side of the balance sheet consists essentially of Financial Statements 0 commissions and other acquisition costs relating to premiums written that are to be allocated in the period between each year-end and the end of the contract term, the costs recognised in income being those actually incurred in the period, subject to the limit established in the Technical Basis. Notes to the Likewise, the “Other liabilities” heading on the liabilities side of the balance sheet includes commissions and other acquisition costs relating to outward reinsurance that are to be allocated in subsequent periods in line with the Consolidated Financial cover period of the ceded policies. Commissions and acquisition costs directly related to new premiums written are never capitalised, but are Statements recognised in income in the year in which they are incurred. Amount for estimated recoveries Auditors Report on In general, the recoveries of claim credits are counted only when their performance is sufficiently secured and Consolidated Financial come from the subsidiary Atradius NV. In the case of Crédito y Caución, integrated in the previous company, under the established in the ROSSP and Statments the Ministerial Order implementing certain specific aspects, it activates the recoveries, using statistical methods, with implementation of certain requirements and periodically submitting calculations to the evaluation of Corporate independent experts. The statistical method of this company calculate the amount of recoveries estimated taking into account the historical evolution of the settlement of all outstanding claims, including claims completed, and to determine their future behavioural tendencies, in order to apply them realistically, reasonably estimating Governance Report recoveries receivable by the appropriate projections. 92 In the case of the other companies belonging to Atradius N.V., recoveries are estimated as a parameter when using statistical methods to calculate the claims provision. A projection of the estimated amounts is made, taking Key Figures claims experience into account. Estimated recoveries, net of reinsurance, are recorded in the “Receivables – Other receivables” sub-heading in the consolidated balance sheet. Agreements between insurers The subsidiaries Seguros Catalana Occidente and Seguros Bilbao are members of the CICOS system for the Letter to settlement of certain auto claims (in application of the CIDE-ASCIDE agreements). Claims against insurers arising under such claims settlement agreements are recorded under the heading “Receivable under auto agreements” on the asset side of the Group balance sheet, together with the other items included under the Shareholders “Other receivables” sub-heading in “Loans and receivables”. Amounts payable to insurers under claim settlement agreements are included under the heading “Payable under agreements with insurers”, which is included along with the rest of the provisions under “Non-technical Grupo Catalana provisions” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. In any case, where the insurance companies have insured the liable party, any amounts payable to other insurers under these agreements are included in the claims provision. Occidente Reinsurance: 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES The reinsurance contracts entered into by the Group’s insurance subsidiaries with other insurance entities transfer, in all cases, a significant proportion of the insurance risk to the reinsurers. Management In some cases the contracts provide for profit commissions (profit sharing) based on the claims ratio determined for each underwriting year. These commissions are recognised having regard to detailed assessments of the expected claim ratios. Report Any profits or losses arising, at the time of entering into reinsurance contracts, from the use of different measurement bases for pricing the contract and measuring the insurance liabilities covered are recognised directly in the profit and loss account. Condolidated Reinsurance contract with Consorcio de Compensación de Seguros Financial Statements On June 18 2009, UNESPA and the Consorcio de Compensación de Seguros ( Consorcio ) signed a reinsurance agreement with credit insurance companies. The subsidiary Crédito y Caución, S.A. was a signatory to this agreement. The contract came into force retrospectively from January 1, 2009, and established an initial period of cover of three (3) years, with a review clause and an annual cancellation that was exercised, not existing and extended clause in 2010. The Consorcio provided two types of cover. The first of these was an extension to the Notes to the proportional reinsurance contracts (Quota-Share) in force. Crédito y Caución, S.A. took out this cover with 5% of its premiums. The second was an Aggregate Excess of Loss ('Stop-Loss'), contract under which the Consorcio Consolidated Financial assumed liability for 85% of net claims of between 85% and 130%. Cover was provided over a calendar year. The contract established the creation of an experience account that recognised, basically, the difference between the reinsurance premiums accrued and the claims assumed by the Consorcio each year. After the close of the Statements years of coverage, the Consorcio would accrue over the following five (5) years a 20% share of the positive result of the technical account in order to offset the eventual negative balance on the experience account. At the end of December, it has been updated the estimate of the obligation arising from that contract due to the worst expectations of results, EUR 15,000 thousand have generated positive run-off. In 2012 the technical result has Auditors Report on been negative, according to Crédito y Caución, S.A. local regulations, so no payments have been made under this item. As a result, the Group has the concept provided with EUR 9,200 thousand. This amount is recorded under Consolidated Financial the heading “Rest of LiabilitiesAccrues” of the Consolidated Balance Sheet attached Statments 3.k) Non-technical provisions The Group’s consolidated financial statements include all the material provisions with respect to which it is considered more likely than not that the related obligation will have to be settled. Contingent liabilities are not Corporate recognised in the consolidated financial statements. Provisions, which are quantified on the basis of the best information available regarding the consequences of the Governance Report event giving rise to them and are reviewed and adjusted at the end of each year, are used to cater for the specific risks for which they were originally recognised. Provisions are fully or partially reversed when such risks cease to exist or are reduced. 93 3.k.1) Provisions for pensions and similar obligations Key Figures i. Post-retirement benefits The main companies of the Group with pension commitments and other similar obligations are Seguros Catalana Occidente, Seguros Bilbao and Atradius, N.V. These companies have post-employment pension obligations classified as either defined-contribution plans or defined-benefit plans, which are covered by insurance policies and employment pension plans or trusteeadministered funds. Other long-term benefits, such as long-service awards, are covered by internal provisions. Letter to Shareholders For defined-contribution plans the Group makes predetermined contributions to a separate or Group entity and has no legal or effective obligation to make further contributions if the separate entity is unable to pay benefits due to employees in relation to services rendered in the current or previous years. In defined-benefit plans the amount of the benefits will depend on one or several factors, such as age, length of Grupo Catalana service and salary. The Group makes the necessary contributions to a separate entity. Unlike in the case of defined-contribution plans, however, it does have a legal or effective obligation to make further contributions if the separate entity is unable to pay benefits due to employees in relation to services rendered in the current or Occidente previous years. 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES In accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the liability recognised in the Group’s balance sheet for definedbenefit plans is the present value of the defined-benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets (if any) out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Where the plan assets are insurance policies issued by companies of the Group, pension obligations are not offset Management against plan assets. Unlike the other subsidiaries of the Group, the plan assets covering the defined benefit Report obligations of Atradius N.V. are represented by instruments, vehicles or insurance companies that are not part of the Group. The Group has opted to recognise actuarial gains and losses on all defined-benefit plans in full outside the income statement, under the heading “Actuarial gains/(losses) on long-term employee benefits” in the statement of Condolidated recognised income and expense. “Actuarial gains and losses” are gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the assets earmarked to cover the Group’s obligations and material changes in the actuarial assumptions used to measure those obligations. Defined benefit obligations are calculated annually by the Group’s actuaries using the projected unit credit Financial Statements method and based on unbiased, mutually compatible assumptions. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the obligations is the interest rate of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity that approximate the terms of the related pension liabilities. The estimated retirement age is the earliest age at which each employee is entitled to Notes to the retire under current Social Security regulations. The reversal of assets can occur when the plan assets are higher than the projected benefit obligation and the Consolidated Financial Group cannot recover any surplus through refunds from the pension’s vehicle due to solvency or control requirements. These reversals are presented in the statement of recognised income and expense. Statements Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account, unless the changes to the pension plan Auditors Report on are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time. In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Premiums on insurance contracts and contributions made to pension plans are accounted as expenses on the Consolidated Financial profit and loss account of the year of occurrence in each company of the Group. Statments Corporate ii. Employee profit-sharing plans The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing of Atradius N.V. employees, using Governance Report a formula that takes into account individual targets and the profit attributable to Atradius N.V.’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created an implicit obligation. 94 At December 31, 2012 it has not been necessary to record any provision for this purpose. Key Figures 3.k.2) Other non-technical provisions Other non-technical provisions basically cover debts arising from payments the Group must make under agreements entered into with insurance companies and estimated amounts payable to meet potential or actual liabilities such as litigation in progress, compensation, redundancy pay or other obligations. Letter to Shareholders 3.l) Treasury shares The negative balance of the “Equity – Treasury shares and participation units” account in the consolidated balance sheet relates to shares of the Group held exclusively by the subsidiary Salerno 94. These shares are held at acquisition cost. The related adjustments and the profits and losses arising from disposal of treasury shares are Grupo Catalana credited or charged, as appropriate, to the equity heading ”Other reserves for changes in accounting policies – Gains/(losses) on transactions in own shares”. Occidente A summary of the transactions carries out with the Group’s own shares during the year is provided in Note 15.c) to the consolidated financial statements. 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management 3.m) Income and expenses The Group recognises income and expenses on an accrual basis, i.e. when the actual flow of the related goods and Report services occurs, regardless of when the resulting monetary or financial flow arises. The main principles used by the Group to recognise income and expenses are summarised below: Condolidated 3.m.1) Income from Written Premiums Premiums written during the year, less cancellations and return premiums, are recorded as period income. The total is adjusted for changes in premiums written but not issued, arising from contracts completed or renewed Financial Statements during the year, where the insurer’s right to the premium income arises during the period. Non-Life premiums and direct renewable annual Life contracts are recognised in income throughout the life of the contracts, on a pro rata basis. These premiums are accrued via the establishment of provisions for unearned Notes to the premiums. Life premiums are long-term contracts, whether single or regular premium policies, and are recognised when the insurer’s collection right comes into effect. Consolidated Financial The Group’s income through fees for instalment payments of premiums is recognised as an increase in finance income and is accrued over the collection period of the bills generating these surcharges. Statements Premiums for outward reinsurance are recognised on the basis of reinsurance contracts written and in accordance with the same criteria used for direct insurance. Auditors Report on 3.m.2) Income from services and other technical income Consolidated Financial This income comes mainly from Atradius N.V. and includes fees for information services, collections and shortterm credit management services and income from activities carried out as an agent of the Dutch state. Service Statments income fees comprise up-front fees and regular fees. Up-front fees are recognised over the life of the contract. Those that cannot be recognised as income are deferred Corporate and presented as part of trade and other accounts payable and deferred income. Regular fees charged to the customer periodically (monthly, quarterly or annually) and billed in advance are recognised on a straight-line basis over the billing period, which is deemed to be equivalent to the period over Governance Report which the services are rendered. Fees charged at the end of the period are accrued as a receivable that is offset against the financial liability when charged to the customer. 95 3.m.3) Interest income and expense and similar items Key Figures In general, these items are recognised using the effective interest method, irrespective of the monetary or financial flow deriving from the financial assets. Dividends are recognised as income as the consolidated companies’ right to receive them arises. 3.m.4) Claims incurred and changes in provisions Letter to Claims incurred comprise benefits paid during the year, related changes in technical provisions and the portion of Shareholders general expenses allocated to the claims function. 3.m.5) Commissions Commission income and expense is recognised in income over the period in which the associated service is Grupo Catalana provided, except for commissions associated with a specific, individual act, which are recognised at the time they arise. Occidente 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES 4. Risk and capital management Management 4.a) Capital management The Group has an internal capitalisation and dividend policy aimed at achieving a rational distribution of capital Report among the companies. The Group also considers capital management an important aspect its strategic planning. Earnings retention in Condolidated previous years has enabled the Group to expand, more recently at the international level. The Group manages its capital in accordance with the following principles:  Ensure the Group is sufficiently capitalised to maintain financial strength, even after low frequency, Financial Statements high severity events.  Ensure the Group is sufficiently capitalised to comply with the solvency capital requirements for each individual entity and the level of rating required by its credit insurance subsidiaries. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Various methods are used to quantify solvency capital Statements First, the Group’s solvency is quantified in accordance with current Private Insurance Administration and Supervision Regulations, although without losing sight of the fact that these regulations are changing significantly. All Group companies took part in an internal impact study under the current wording of Solvency II with data up to 31 December 2011. As a result, progress is being made in quantifying the Group’s risk-adjusted capital in line with the future regulatory framework, which is still under development, however. Auditors Report on Consolidated Financial Second, S&P assigns a rating to the main operating companies that are part of the Group. Thus, the main operating companies (Seguros Bilbao, Seguros Catalana Occidente, Crédito y Caución, S.A., Atradius Credit Insurance N.V. and Atradius Re) have been assigned with an BBB rating with a negative outlook in 2012 due to the influence of the rating of the Spanish State. As the S & P methodology very strict when assigning sovereign Statments ratings above, it should be noted that the Group's rating is higher than the Spanish State (BBB-).

Local insurance regulators establish the available capital, the minimum solvency margin and the corresponding surplus. Consolidated Financial The minimum required capital in the following Group subsidiaries is the greater of the sum resulting from a Statements calculation based on premiums and the sum resulting from a calculation based on claims.

Governance Report Netherlands 97 The subsidiary Atradius Credit Insurance N.V. operates through a global network and is regulated by the De Nederlandsche Bank ('DNB'). The minimum solvency margin is calculated using premiums, as the resulting amount is Key Figures greater than that calculated using the claims rate. Certain branches belonging to Atradius Credit Insurance N.V. that operate in countries other than the Netherlands (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland and Turkey) are subject to their own local capital requirements. However, this does not impose any extra charge on the minimum required capital of Atradius Credit Insurance N.V. Ireland The subsidiary Atradius Reinsurance Ltd. is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI). The minimum solvency margin is calculated based on premiums. In the year 2012, the calculation of the minimum is less than the previous Letter to year, so the minimum amount that corresponds to the current period is the same as the previous year. Mexico Shareholders The subsidiary Atradius Seguros de Créditos, S.A. calculates the minimum solvency margin based on premiums, with additional required capital based on the quality and level of concentration of the panel of reinsurers. Lastly, in the United States the minimum solvency margin is based on a different system of calculation from the one Grupo Catalana described above: United States Occidente 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES The subsidiary Atradius Trade Credit Insurance Inc. determines the minimum required capital as the “company action level risk based capital”, in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Risk Based Capital (RBC) model. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account the company’s size and risk profile. The Management calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items, with the factors Report determined as higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. 4.b) Risk management As an international insurance company, the Group recognises the importance of risk control and internal control Condolidated systems and is making efforts to strengthen these in every respect. The growing importance, at regulatory and Group Financial Statements structure level, of the relationship between capital and risk, implies a greater systematisation and coordination of measures to quantify the existing risks. The Group’s operating companies are highly independent. However, there is a corporate-level risk control department designed to coordinate the implementation of a capital model for managing Group-level risk, as well as driving the implementation of a Risk Management System under the Solvency II framework. The Group is therefore Notes to the in the process of quantifying overall risk-adjusted capital and putting in place risk-adjusted control measures for Consolidated Financial different business lines or units. 4.b.1) Objectives, policies and risk management Statements As risk management systems in the financial and insurance areas evolve, and especially with the Solvency II contributions, the Group has continued to deepen in the measures of quantification, both standard and internal ones, as well as in the definition of objectives, policies, procedures, internal control and risk management as rated Auditors Report on by the same.. A. Non-life and Life insurance risk. Consolidated Financial Among non-life insurance risks, underwriting risk breaks down into premium deficiency risk and reserve Statments deficiency risk and also includes the technical part of reinsurance risk. These risks are managed differently in the different business lines. Life insurance risk is divided into three groups: underwriting risk, which includes mortality, longevity, disability, Corporate lapse and expenses, the risk to the company from future obligations arising from life/savings insurance products with risk borne by the company; catastrophic risks. Governance Report 98 These risks arise from the underwriting of policies, claims management (due to miscalculations of the cost and frequency of claims), changes in the provision for future obligations arising from the cover provided, or changes in Key Figures management expenses. Measures taken to monitor and control these risks include: o On-going development of Technical Standards, establishing automatic and preventive mechanisms to ensure that policy underwriting meets the standards. o Product analysis, aimed at determining the adequacy of premiums and technical provisions. Letter to o Business diversification in both general and life insurance. Shareholders o Quantification of European Embedded Value in the Life business line. o Implementation of Appraisal Value methodology. Grupo Catalana o Use of reinsurance to cover deviations from the expected claims rate, allowing the Group to retain as much business as possible, in so far as its scale of operations and solvency allow. For outward reinsurance, the Group uses only market-leading reinsurers, with ratings that guarantee Occidente the necessary solvency, financial and management capacity, and business and service continuity. o On-going analysis of policy returns and results, taking whatever measures are needed to prevent 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES high claims rates. Traceability mechanisms in Internal Control. Management o B. Credit insurance and Bonding risk. Report Credit insurance is subdivided into three categories: traditional credit risk, instalment credit protection and special products. Each category has particular risk characteristics and the Group manages the risk of each product in the way it deems most appropriate. Condolidated  Traditional credit risk The Group insures its customers against the risk of non-payment by their trade debtors (“buyers”). The causes of Financial Statements loss covered differ by policy. They usually include all forms of legal insolvency. Without intending to give an exhaustive list, policies can also cover so-called political causes of loss, which among others include the risk of non-payment due to cancellation of import-export licences, transfer problems and contract cancellation. Notes to the Each policy has defined credit limits that the policyholder can offer to its buyers without prior approval from the Group. Policies are issued for a fixed period, usually not longer than three years. In addition, customers are obliged to retain part of the risk (self-retention), using different formulas. Consolidated Financial Customers are covered for the credit risk on a given buyer only if the Group has established a credit limit (rating) Statements for that buyer. Credit limits are an important risk control and mitigation instrument because they allow the Group to limit its exposure to any given customer at any time by reducing the ratings of the customer’s buyers. Ratings may also be withdrawn. The Group uses this right to reduce exposure when it is no longer comfortable with its aggregate exposure to a particular customer. Auditors Report on It should be noted that for traditional credit insurance there are two underwriting processes: policy underwriting Consolidated Financial and buyer underwriting. Policy underwriting is the process by which the Group decides which customers to accept as policyholders and which terms and conditions for cover are to be applied to the account. Buyer underwriting is the process by which the Group manages the risk on the portfolio of existing policies related to a Statments single buyer. One of the most effective instruments for controlling exposure to risk is the Group's capacity to impose, or Corporate remove, conditions for certain forms of cover at country level.  Instalment credit protection Governance Report The instalment credit protection unit insures policyholders against the risk of non-payment by customers under instalment credit agreements. Here the Group typically insures portfolio loans. This product does not cover losses as a result of fraud by the customer. 99 Exposure is usually divided into corporate (companies covered by leasing or by bank loans), and retail (consumer credits of financial entities) Key Figures In 2012 the exposure was of 55% in retail and of 45% in corporate.  Special Products Risk The Group also offers tailor-made policies, which include those policies that cover single transactions. In this type of products, during 2012, the Total Potential Exposure (TPE, maximum exposure to the real risk exposure) associated has amounted to EUR 8,804 million. Letter to  Bonding Risk Bonding insurance is offered in Italy, Spain, France and the Scandinavian countries. The bond types issued vary Shareholders by location, owing to differing legal environments, but typically include bid bonds, performance bonds and maintenance bonds. The Group manages risk by underwriting the obligations to be covered by the bond, the financial strength of customers and their ability to perform, and also by working with customers and beneficiaries Grupo Catalana of bonds to resolve any conflicts.  Reinsurance assumed Occidente 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES Atradius Reinsurance LTD. is the reinsurer of the Group for Credit Insurance products. It has a diversified portfolio in about 70 countries. Most programs are entered into quota share. C. Financial market risks. The Group’s investment policy is approved by its Board of Directors. The Board assesses the ratio of assets to Management liabilities, risk tolerance and liquidity of positions in different scenarios. It also expressly considers the prerequisites for the use of derivative instruments and structured financial products. Report At present, the Group differentiates between four types of portfolios: Life portfolios, Non-life portfolios, Credit portfolios and portfolios in which the risk is borne by the customer. Condolidated The aim in the case of Life portfolios is to optimise asset and liability matching using asset liability management (ALM) frameworks, while verifying compliance with legal and internal requirements. The aim in the case of NonFinancial Statements life portfolios is to maximise long-term return through appropriate diversification of assets. In the Credit portfolios the aim is to maintain the solvency and liquidity required by the business. Lastly, the portfolios in which the risk is borne by the customer (whether in insurance contracts or in any other type of financial product) are managed in accordance with the policies established in each case in the statement of terms and conditions or prospectus. Notes to the  Credit risk. The Group’s policy on credit risk is based on two basic principles: – Prudence: the minimum rating for fixed-income investments is A-. Any investment below this threshold requires express senior management approval and must be Consolidated Financial reported to the Board of Directors. Statements – Diversification: high diversification across industries and issuers, with maximum risk limits per issuer. In this year the Group has carried out a closer monitoring of the Auditors Report on exposures of the Group.  Liquidity risk. The Group’s policy with respect to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient cash balances to meet any contingencies arising from obligations to customers. ALM analysis carried Consolidated Financial out in portfolios also helps to mitigate this risk. Statments On the other hand, almost all the investments are in securities traded in organised markets, so the Group will be able to take measures if there is any liquidity pressure. Corporate  Market risk. The Group regularly analyses the sensitivity of its portfolios to market risk, due mainly to changes in interest rates and stock prices. The modified durations of fixed income portfolios are monitored at monthly intervals and VAR analyses of fixed-income and equity Governance Report securities are conducted at various intervals, depending on the type of portfolio, and a range of stress scenarios are also analysed. 100  Currency risk. The Group has currency risk exposure in asset and liability items in its business coming from Atradius, as a result of its multinational activity. Key Figures D. Operational risks Grupo Catalana Occidente has always been characterised by its self-control culture, although due to the future implementation of Solvency II, it has worked on the classification of the greater operational risks of the Group according to the future regulatory framework. Solvency II defines operational risk as the risk of loss of inadequate or poorly functioning internal processes, staff or systems, or as a result of external events. It includes legal risks, but does not include those arising as a result of strategic decisions or reputational risks. Letter to To mitigate operational risk, in 2009 the Group implemented an IT tool that allows these risks to be monitored and quantified, focusing primarily on the area of regulatory compliance. During 2010, the use of this tool was Shareholders expanded to cover the most relevant types of risk in other areas and more companies in order to consider the main types of risks. Risks and controls associated with processes and controls have been categorized with the aim of standardizing this Grupo Catalana classification across all companies of the Group. Additionally, one has been working at the association of a quantification of possible loss has been included that may be incurred by the non-performance of the controls when performance was in fact possible. For those cases in which it was not possible, a qualitative assessment has been assigned. We have continued working on the incorporation of the evidence of controls performed into a Occidente software tool will allow the Company to meet current and future regulatory requirements arising from the needs of Internal Control. 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES This system aims to involve all the members of the organisation, without exception, and it is aimed at effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability and integrity of the financial information, the adequate risk management Management according to the objectives of the Group and compliance with policies, laws and regulations. Operational risk can be classified into the following categories: Report  People and Culture Risk. Intrinsic risk for individuals. This category includes risks from fraud, employees’ lack of skills to perform the process, labour organization, unsafe working conditions and discrimination. Condolidated  Process Risk. This category includes risks stemming from operational failures in the process, whether resulting from the definition of the process, its effectiveness or errors of those who perform it. Financial Statements  Physical Asset Risk. This category includes the entity’s loss of Physical Assets by external or natural causes.  External Event Risk. Risks arising from events outside the entity, which hinder its normal operations. Notes to the  Financial Risk. Risks arising from inaccuracies or delays in generating financial information causing Consolidated Financial incorrect business decisions.  Contingency Plan Risk. Risk arising from the lack of or inadequate contingency plans to ensure business Statements continuity in spite of damages caused by external events or to physical assets.  Systems Risk. Risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal systems. Auditors Report on Consolidated Financial 4.b.2) Risk management and internal control Statments The Group is continuously strengthening its Internal Control system, which is fully auditable. The Internal Control model it is developing is based on the COSO system that defines three pillars of control. The first is based on the selfregulation applied by each of the Group's business units. The second is based on the monitoring of the above process Corporate by an external unit. Thirdly, Internal Audit is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of risk control processes. The Group has a tool which is appropriate for its risk profile, in line with the corporate objective of developing and implementing an integrated Internal Control and Risk Control system. Governance Report With this tool, currently in development, the Group is able to identify and continuously monitor the new risks it incurs, monitor the controls required for proper assessment and mitigation of existing risks, and also define new 101 controls. This tool will also be used to monitor compliance with internal rules and the laws and regulations that apply to insurance activities. Key Figures This system allows the involvement of all members of the organisation without exception and is designed to promote effectiveness and efficiency in operations, reliability and integrity of financial information, proper risk management in accordance with the Group’s objectives and compliance with policies, laws and standards. The Internal Control System comprises: Letter to  A range of standards and procedures that affect the entire organisation.  Internal control procedures with appropriate authorisation levels and segregation of functions established Shareholders 0 for each business area.  Traceability of controls, especially for those with regulatory implications. Grupo Catalana  The performance of external audits.  Support from external consultancy services where required. Occidente 0  A structured information system. 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES  An internal audit unit that carries out regular audits according to risk levels. Management This system ensures that appropriate risk audits can reasonably be performed and is intended to ensure compliance with the proposals of Solvency II. Report A. Specific controls in the credit insurance business. Condolidated Fully defined risk authorisation systems and processes are in place. Sales staff has limited authority. As the credit limit increases, decisions need authorisation from one or more co-signatories of increasing seniority. Even senior levels have authority only up to certain thresholds. Credit committees have been established at local and Group level. Local credit committees may sign off on amounts Financial Statements up to certain thresholds, beyond which only the Group Credit Committee can decide. The Group Credit Committee also authorises exposures to large customers and customers with the largest overall exposure. Notes to the The Group monitors exposures by counterparty, sector and country through a single database (Symphony) that contains details of the majority of credit insurance policies and credit limits and all customers with whom the Group Consolidated Financial has exposure to default risk. This database is used as a source of management information. Because of the inclusion process of the Spanish business through Crédito y Caución in Atradius, the database, despite being independent, is accessible to the global database. Statements Most policies, both new business and renewals, are priced according to a structured system based on the risks, costs and outlook assigned by the Group according to country, sector and buyer credit ratings. Auditors Report on In particular, in the case of Crédito y Caución, the renewal of policies has been analysed on a case-by-case basis with the purpose of reviewing new conditions for the case of renewal or for adopting the decision of not renewing if so required by the policy. Consolidated Financial Statments Exposure from the instalment credit protection business is monitored separately, as the risk is assumed by consumers not companies. Premiums for these policies are calculated on the basis of the probability of default, expected losses, volume and maturity of loans. All customers with whom the Group has significant exposure are reviewed annually, although on a continuous basis Corporate information concerning defaults, both from companies and from individuals, is received Governance Report Concentration risk is controlled and monitored through what is known as Total Potential Exposure (TPE).

Governance Report (**) Provision for unearned premiums. 156 For all types of individual life insurance and certain group life insurance policies, policyholder dividends are allocated through increases in the life insurance provision in accordance with the term of the various policies. In Key Figures the group life risk business, policyholder dividends are allocated to policyholders through premium reductions on policy renewal. Dividends accrued to the insured or beneficiaries but not yet allocated are recognised in the subheading “Technical provisions – Reserves for policyholder dividends and return premiums”. In accordance with the provisions of the current ROSSP, the assumed interest rate used to calculate the life insurance provision is as follows: a) For obligations assumed since January 1, 1999, in respect of insurance policies with assigned (matched) Letter to investments, the subsidiaries have used the interest rate set forth in the technical bases (based on the internal rate of return of said investments). For policies without matched investments, the interest rate used is the rate set by the DGSFP for 2012 and 2011 (3.37% and 2.89% respectively) or for the year the policy came into Shareholders effect, provided the duration of the collections specifically assigned to the policies, estimated at the market interest rate, is equal to or greater than the duration of the payments arising from the policies, based on their likelihood flows and estimated at the market interest rate. b) For obligations assumed prior to January 1, 1999, the mathematical provisions continue to be calculated at Grupo Catalana 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES the same assumed interest rate as is used to calculate the premium, up to the limit of the actual or expected return on the assets allocated to cover these provisions. Since the rate of return on the investments assigned for this purpose in 2012 and 2011 exceeded the established assumed interest rate, no additional provision was Occidente required, except for certain types of policies issued by the subsidiary Bilbao Compañía Anónima de Seguros y Reaseguros, S.A., where the actual rate of return was insufficient to meet future administrative expenses arising from the policies.

AND SUBSIDIARIES should they materialize, and determines the information and internal control systems used to mitigate these risks, including contingent liabilities and off balance sheet risks. This system of risk management of the group also aims to Management develop processes and systems of capital allocation in light of the risks assumed by each area. The Group continues to work on the adequacy of current policies to future Solvency II requirements. Specifically, the Report Group is in the process of quantifying the adjusted capital level to the risk profile at a Global level and of implementing risk-adjusted control measures for the different lines or business units.

Specific controls in the Credit Insurance business Letter to Risks associated with credit insurance relate to an increase in the number of defaults in the credit insurance policy portfolio and customers not fulfilling their obligations regarding bonding products. Given the idiosyncratic nature of the credit insurance business, special risk approval systems and processes are in place limiting the authority of sales staff. The greater the amount to be insured, the higher the decision authority required. Even high levels of decision authority have Shareholders limits within the risk authorisation systems and processes in place. Credit committees have been established at local and Group level. Local credit committees may sign off on amounts up Grupo Catalana to certain thresholds, beyond which only the Group Credit Committee can decide. The Group Credit Committee also authorises exposures to large customers and customers with the largest overall exposure. Occidente Specific credit insurance controls include managing fluctuations in macroeconomic parameters. Due to the shrinking of the economy, in 2008, specific committees were created to mitigate the impact of recession and which have been especially active in managing customers, in terms of establishing prices, renegotiating the terms of poorly performing 2012 ANNUAL REPORT GRUPO CATALANA OCCIDENTE, S.A.

Concentration risk is controlled and monitored through buyer, sector and country. Report Management of Technical Risks or of risks specific to the Life Insurance business Condolidated In the case of Life products, the Solvency II requirements establish that the risks to which this line of business is exposed are split into biometric risks (including mortality, longevity and morbidity/disability risks), lapse risks, expense risks, revision risks and catastrophe risks. Variance in each of these risks from the statistical mean value is the source of a Financial Statements potential loss. Measures taken to monitor and control these risks include: Notes to the Monitoring the technical standards adequate for policy underwriting.
