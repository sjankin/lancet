In response to this, financial authorities have strengthened policies regarding standards of financial soundness and risk management for financial companies. Despite these uncertainties through Kyobo Life's new business policy of 'Customer Assurance Innovation, Strengthening Profit Creation', we have maximized our efforts to reach our 'Vision 2015' of 'being the best company in customer assurance'. 3 Through our two previous sustainability management reports and our philosophy of co-development with all of our stakeholders, we have promised you four things. Kyobo Life has striven to fulfill these pledge in our last business year, and we shall keep doing so in the future. In order to address our first pledge of always giving utmost priority to customer service, we have accelerated our 'Life Long Care Project' which was first launched in June 2011. As a part of this effort, the 'Life Long Care Project Services' designed for advanced customer assurance has been revised to better fit customer expectations. To minimize customer dissatisfaction we have steadily made efforts to establish a full-underwriting process culture, and we have opened a 'VOC Management' department to more effectively listen to customers and reflect it to our activities to improve our products and services. To address our second pledge of growing together with its financial planners and employees, we have opened seminars that share the company's annual business operations as well as future outlooks with our employees. Through the seminars we also had chances to communicate with the mentioned personnel through direct participation from the Board of Directors. We have also strengthened our insurance marketing education, and activated our intra-company job circulation program to expand employee opportunities to grow. Our third pledge of continuing to be an attractive investment to investors is being realized through our continuous investment and thorough risk management in growing markets(B2B2C, emerging areas, the upper class). Given the recent low interest rate and low development phenomena we have increased our investment in long-term bonds to secure steady profits, as well as increased investment in high-interest rate assets within manageable risk areas to enhance profitability. The fourth pledge of progressing together with the government and community is being realized through persistent social contribution activities. 2012 was a special case where 'Kyobo Dasomi', our volunteering organization comprising our financial planners, executive, and staff members celebrated its 10th year of establishment, which gave further meaning to Kyobo Life's cause of social contribution. We will further concentrate our efforts toward local communities that need us and areas of public interest that are relevant to our industry's characteristics. In 2012, Kyobo Life has been granted much social acknowledgment and support through its diligent sustainability management. In the sustainability management competition sponsored by the KSA which is under the Ministry of Knowledge Economy, we have been named first place for three consecutive years among all life insurance companies in the country. Other recent performances are receiving the grand prize in the area of life insurance in 'Financial Customer Protection', being nominated to be the best company in 'Labor and Management Culture' sponsored by the Ministry of Employment and Labor', receiving the grand prize as the 'Best Asian Insurance Manager'. However, Kyobo Life will not let it go to our heads and will further put in our best efforts to better realize our pledge for our stakeholders. As a member of the UN Global Compact which provides its 10 principles involving human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption, Kyobo Life would like to express our enduring support. We are trying in diverse ways to apply the mentioned Principles in our decision-making processes. The recent economic difficulties in both domestic and foreign settings is said to be likely to continue for the next few years. It is predicted that this will cause the insurance industry to shrink and increase the amount of risk involved, having a negative effect in the insurance business as a whole. But Kyobo Life's determination and efforts to realize sustainability management and fulfill our social responsibility at all costs will act as a solid foundation to overcome such crises. We thank the stakeholders for your support.

Such customer assurance starts from full-membership, meaning that we help the customers appropriately understand the value of life insurance and Customers and the Future guide them to underwrite policies that fit their needs.

Therefore it is essential that we use advertisements and guiding data that is not inaccurate or exaggerated. Kyobo Life operates an interim inspection system that allows only advertisements and data that have gone through prior review to be provided to customers.

Customers tend to feel uncomfortable asking for insurance payments when this happens. Kyobo Life is doing its best to pay the customers' insurance in a more convenient and accurate way. Operating Receiving Counters Other than the Customer PLAZA Claiming insurance and its payment is done in 66 customer PLAZAs all over the nation. But when there are no Kyobo Life customer PLAZAs near the area or in cases where it is difficult for customers to visit us, it becomes difficult for them to claim or obtain their insurance payment.

Risk Management Actions 'Risk limit management' refers to activities where the risk management committee designates the amount of risk that can be endured give our risk capital, and to maintain appropriate levels of risk with the respective risk management departments and divisions. We analyze the amount of risk through monitoring market risk levels for each type of risk, and when its levels meet our limit or certain Investors and the Future tipping points we carry out phase by phase measure of risk decrease, retaining, and avoidance. 'Prior risk review' is a process where the risk management department reviews the risk before making important decisions, and we have reflected this in the process of publishing documents in our Intranet to realize these efforts. The 'non-financial risk management personnel' in each department deals with tasks such as recognizing and evaluating operation risks together with the organization head, make and execute solutions, and educate personnel regarding the contents. The 'risk management support team' supports the activities of the non-financial risk management personnel's activities through periodic education sessions.

Appendix 56 Third Party Assurance Report 58 GRI Statement 59 Index (GRI, ISO 26000) 63 UN Global Compact 64 Awards and Association Memberships Related to Sustainability Management 65 Summary of Financial Highlights 66 Kyobo Life's Code of Professional Ethics 56 Third Party Assurance Report KYOBO Life Sustainability Report 2012 Messrs. Kyobo Life's Board of Directors and Stakeholders Foreword The Korean Standards Association (hereafter 'Assurance Provider') was asked for an independent assurance request regarding its 'Kyobo Life 2012 Sustainability Management Report (hereafter 'the Report')'. The purpose of this assurance report is as follows: to investigate the existence of serious mistakes or prejudice in the Report, to investigate whether or not the information collection system works, and to review the selection process and results of the sustainability management materiality test in order to provide opinions that can increase the quality of the Report. The Assurance Provider's responsibility is to provide to the Board the results that came from the assurance procedures. The Assurance Provider provides an independent assurance opinion based on the data included in the Report and the validity of the evidence related to performance and relevant systems. The accountability for all assertions in the Report as well as the collection, analysis, and organization of data for publishing the Report lies with Kyobo Life. Independence The Assurance Provider does not have any common, profit-related interests with Kyobo Life regarding its business activity except the tasks regarding the provision of the Third Party's Assurance. As an independent assurance institution, we hold no other interest that may decrease our independence. Assurance Standards and Levels With the AA1000AS 2008 Assurance Standards at the core, the Assurance Provider has also applied GRI G3.1 guidelines as well as ISO 26000. We have identified the scope of inclusivity, materiality, and responsiveness according to the assurance standards of AA1000AS 2008 as well as the credibility of the data that was included in the 2012 Report. The credibility of the data included in Kyobo Life's Sustainability Management Report was found to be of a 'Moderate Level' of assurance. Assurance Types and Scope The Assurance Provider carried out Type 2 assurance according to the AA1000 Assurance Standards. Type 2 assurance means that the exactness and quality of the sustainability management performance information and Kyobo Life's assertion were evaluated under the accountability principles of AA1000 2008 Assurance Standards. The scope of assurance was during FY2012(April 1st, 2012 to March 31st, 2013). The Assurance Provider has carried out assurance activities regarding Kyobo Life's sustainability management policies, objectives, business activities, standards, and performances, mostly within their systems and activities. We have also assured its environmental, social and financial data relating to its broad sense of performance, and the involvement of the Assurance Provider regarding stakeholder participation was limited to the review of the materiality tests. Assurance Methods The Assurance Provider has used the following methods to collect necessary information, data, and evidence related to the assurance scope, and has performed the assurance procedures.

Also, we have been unable to identify any grace mistakes or inappropriately written portions in the Report through our assurance activities. The Assurance Provider has confirmed that the Report has an A+ application level of the international reports standards of the GRI G3.1 guidelines, and would like to give the following opinion regarding Kyobo Life's Sustainability Management Report. Inclusivity Has Kyobo Life included the stakeholders during its process of strategically dealing with sustainability management? The Assurance Provider has confirmed that Kyobo Life has recognized the importance of core stakeholder participation within its pursuit of sustainability management and is putting efforts into the creation of a participation process. It has selected core stakeholder groups and has operated customized channels for each stakeholder trait such as holding meetings and carrying out surveys, and we would like to specifically give credit to how the committee regarding sustainability management is operated so that collecting the Board's opinions and supporting its decision-making process is carried out on a periodical basis. Materiality Has Kyobo Life incorporated material information so that stakeholders can make sound decisions? The Assurance Provider has decided that Kyobo Life has not omitted nor excluded any important information from the stakeholders. In the Report Kyobo Life has determined its issues for the pursuit of sustainability management through research in the media, and internal as well as external environment analyses. Also, it is worth noting that based on the data, Kyobo Life has carried out a materiality test to select core issues. As a recommendation, Kyobo Life should precisely complement the materiality test process so that it not only includes stakeholder-related issues but also issues that are related to sustainability trends that may create business opportunities for Kyobo Life. Responsiveness Has Kyobo Life appropriately responded to stakeholders' demands and interests in the Report? The Assurance Provider has confirmed that Kyobo Life has carried out diverse activities to appropriately respond to issues related to sustainability management. It is worth noting that sustainability management tasks were reported by connecting them to pledges, principles, and KPIs for individual stakeholders, and DMA(Disclosure on Management Approach) performances were reported in a time series development, which is worth highly positive remarks in that Kyobo Life continuously responds to stakeholder opinions and interests. As a recommendation, we believe that Kyobo Life should check the connectivity of its core issues and its KPIs and reinforce KPIs where necessary so that internal monitoring and improvement processes for its sustainability management strategies will become stronger. Opinions by Area and Recommendations for Improvement In order for Kyobo Life to further pursue its company-level sustainability management strategically and to create a basis for continuous responses toward core issues, we would like to give recommendations to review the following. Sustainability Management Processes We could see that Kyobo Life has a strong determination to actively listen to stakeholder demands and reflect them in business activities. We recommend that stakeholder participation systems be complemented after considering their influence, responsibility, and representativeness so that stakeholder opinions can be suggested in a balanced way, and that sustainability trends can be appropriately reflected during materiality tests so that Kyobo Life's strategies regarding these trends and activities can also be reported. Sustainability Management Results Eco-friendly social contribution activities that reflect the traits of the financial industry are worth noting because they show how Kyobo Life is deeply and sincerely concerned in this area. However, given that climate change is an important environmental issue that affects all industries worldwide,, we would like to recommend that you create future environmental management policies and strategies at the company level,, such as controlling greenhouse gas and decreasing energy usage in the event of an increase in energy prices. Kyobo Life is pushing for social contribution activities that utilize the traits of the insurance industry to help solve social issues such as a low birth rate and an aging populace. The Dasomi nursing volunteers, support for premature babies, and training forest experts are all contributing to the creation of social jobs, fostering a culture that supports the dignity of life, and providing for life after retirement. We expect Kyobo Life to continue to strengthen and advance its social contribution activities. It is worth noting that Kyobo Life has extended and established its investment standards according to Socially Responsible Investment(SRI) which considers ESG(environmental, social and governance) factors as investment factors. We hope to see Kyobo Life further increase social values and contribute to sustainable economic development through the development of insurance products in accordance with sustainability issues.
