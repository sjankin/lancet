We identify and prioritise these areas of focus based on the results of our engagement with stakeholders, the 2007 1998 review of ratings and rankings surveys, investor questionnaires and studies, and through internal consultations with senior executives and colleagues throughout the year.

During this period, we have experienced far-reaching changes, both in the financial sector and within our company. Despite the challenging circumstances, such as altered public expectations, a tightening regulatory landscape and continued economic instability, ING managed to become a financially stronger company. We were only able to achieve this progress thanks to loyal customers, prudent balance sheet management and the drive of our staff to do the utmost for our customers. There is still a lot of work ahead of us, but the foundations for further changes are in place. ‘Taking charge of change’ is the theme of our ING Group Annual Report 2012 and this ING in Society Report 2012, as it was the common thread across our operations: managing change to create truly customer-oriented businesses and prepare for a new destiny as a European-based, full-service bank, while ensuring an independent future for our insurance businesses. In 2012, we again made important strides in becoming a stronger company that serves the needs of its stakeholders well. Our restructuring efforts are on track and our company’s financial and commercial performance have been robust, especially given the tough market climate. Through divestments, we continued to sharpen our focus and again became smaller. In November, we repaid another tranche of the capital support provided by the Dutch State in 2008. The total EUR 10.2 billion repaid so far consists of a principal amount of EUR 7.8 billion and EUR 2.4 billion in premiums and interest. Secondly, ING and the Dutch State reached an agreement with the European Commission about amending the restructuring plan that we had to submit to obtain approval for the state aid we received. The agreement gives us more time and greater flexibility to meet the requirements of the European Commission. However, 2012 was also a year in which we have had to account for past breaches of US regulations. The violations that took place until 2007 were serious and unacceptable. The facts compiled in the Department of Justice statement describe a very different ING from the company today. All enhancements that have been implemented in the past years are designed to meet or exceed current rules and regulations of law enforcement agencies, and are aimed at preventing practices of this type from occurring in the future. ING Group Sustainability Report 2012 6 Chairman’s message continued After all the developments in the past years, an important At ING IM, the volume of sustainable assets grew thanks to priority for us is to restore trust. This starts by being a strong several new sustainable mandates.

The UN Principles for Sustainable Insurance knowledge and using our influence. (PSI) were launched at the conference and ING was one of the founding signatories. The Principles for Sustainable Insurance are a voluntary and aspirational framework. They provide a global roadmap to develop and expand the innovative risk management and insurance solutions that are needed to promote renewable energy, clean water, food security, sustainable cities and disasterresilient communities. ING has embraced the United Nations Global Compact and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) since 2009, and we consider the UN PSI a further evolution in our efforts to support building a more sustainable economy. 4.2 ING’s position on issues highlighted in 2012 In addition to the above-mentioned changes that shape the The selected topics in this 2012 overview are coherent with the current and future financial landscape, we are confronted with themes identified in our Materiality assessment, but are of a more various developments, issues or challenges throughout the year. detailed nature.

This products gender-neutral pricing, commonly called the unisex rule, states that as of 21 December 2012 life insurers must offer products that are identical for men and women. To comply with this new regulation, all product portfolios across the insurance business units were reviewed. More than 90 products were re-priced in ING Insurance Central and Rest of Europe. In the Benelux, all products available for sale were reviewed in the past two years to ensure they were compliant with the EU unisex rule. From 21 December 2012, all ING Insurance’s products available for sale throughout the European Union have been compliant with the rule. Unit-linked In 2008 ING’s Dutch insurance subsidiaries (ING Verzekeringen Retail, Nationalepolicies – insurance Nederlanden and RVS) reached an agreement to offer compensation to customers who products cost purchased certain unit-linked policies in the past. In 2012, Nationale-Nederlanden stepped structures up its total compensation for customers with individual unit-linked policies, aligned with the ‘Best-of class’ criteria formulated by the Dutch Ministry of Finance. By early 2013, all customers were informed about their compensation. Employees Job certainty Although it is impossible to ensure job security at all times, ING considers it vital to its success to foster an open, safe, inclusive and stimulating working environment for its employees. For more information on this, see chapter 8 ‘Better workplace’ in this report. Diversity We believe it is right for the composition of our workforce to reflect that of society and for our people to bring a diversity of talents, beliefs and perceptions to their work. To increase the level of diversity, a centralised team helps ING businesses create their own diversity plans. See chapter 8 ‘Better workplace’ in this report. Opportunities We consider it our responsibility to make a positive contribution to the many communities for employees in which we do business. We facilitate and encourage our employees to join this mission, to participate in, as they are the cornerstone of the programmes we develop and support.

In addition, the Liikanen Committee made a number of other recommendations regarding bail-in instruments, capital requirements and governance and control. The impact of the Liikanen recommendations on ING’s business model is unclear, not in the least because it is uncertain if and to what extent the European Commission will follow the Liikanen Committee separation recommendation in its legislative proposal, which is expected around the summer of 2013. In the Netherlands the Wijffels Committee, named after the Dutch representative in the Liikanen Committee, was established in October 2012. The task of the Wijffels Committee is to advise the Dutch government on a number of topics, including applying the recommendations of the Liikanen Committee to Dutch banks, or whether additional measures are needed. The Wijffels Committee has been asked to submit its report by 15 June 2013. For more information, please refer to the ING Group Annual Report 2012.

Although stability of we actively support many of the new regulatory proposals and are implementing them the financial to a large extent already, we have strong concerns that the ultimate and aggregated system through consequences of all the reforms are still not fully clear. We fear that there are too many stricter solvency uncoordinated additions to regulation; that there is too much focus on short-term and liquidity measures; and too little focus on how the financial sector can contribute to achieving requirements sustainable economic growth. More information can be found in the ING Group Annual Report 2012. Progress in In November 2012, ING paid EUR 1.125 billion to the Dutch State, including a EUR 750 repayment of the million repayment of core Tier 1 securities and EUR 375 million in premiums and interest. Dutch State This transaction bought the total paid to the Dutch State to EUR 10.2 billion, including EUR 7.8 billion in principal and EUR 2.4 billion in interest and premiums. See the ING Group Annual Report 2012 for more in-depth information on the current state of affairs with regard to the state support ING received in 2008 and 2009. Civil Society Syria In July, two Dutch NGOs approached ING about its investments in companies allegedly Organisations involved in the delivery of (internet-) communication surveillance technology to Syria in 2011. ING was not involved in the financing of these goods and refutes the allegation. ING policy prohibits the financing of weapons, including technology or dual purpose goods, to countries in which there is a clear risk that these products can be used for internal repression, or serious violations of international humanitarian law or for any other use which can reasonably not be considered to have a normal and legitimate national security and defence purpose. The scrutinised companies issued public statements on the allegations made and confirmed to uphold the 2012 EU and US sanctions to ban exports of surveillance technology to Syria.

Oil exploration An international environmental NGO raised concerns about ING investing in companies activities in Virunga engaged in oil exploration activities in Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic National Park, DRC of Congo (DRC). The park is Africa’s oldest national park, a UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site and a Ramsar wetland of international importance. ING policy prohibits the financing of oil exploration in UNESCO World Heritage Sites and areas registered by the Ramsar Convention. The three operating companies planning the exploration are, however, stock-listed in France and the UK and therefore included in ING managed investment funds and/or index trackers. We share the concern expressed by the NGO; hence our policy to abstain from financing oil exploration in UNESCO or Ramsar sites. ING Investment Management will engage with the companies involved to express our concerns about, and oppose to, any possible exploration in the area. Ship breaking In November 2012, a Dutch NGO coalition asked us to broaden our policy to require minimum social and environmental standards from ING clients owning vessels, to be applied to end-of-life ships. ING policy does not allow the financing of ship-breaking activities in Asia. We neither finance ship-breaking yards in Asia, nor the trade or transportation of ships to those yards. In practice we do not finance ship-breaking yards anywhere in the world. We share the concerns expressed with regard to the poor environmental and work conditions that exist within some breaking yards in Asia. We appreciated the fact that the NGO approached us about this, and subsequently contacted all of our main shipping clients to request additional information on their policy framework and the standards they apply to end-of-life ships. Based on the initial feedback we received, we expect our clients to follow a responsible policy of vessel scrapping in most cases. Where this may not be the case, we are keen to enter into an active dialogue with them to encourage a more socially and environmentally responsible approach.

Customer centricity Customer centricity is a key strategic priority for our Banking, Insurance and Investment Management businesses. We have defined an overall guiding approach to customer centricity, which our employees across the different business lines can use in order to translate our commitment into their day-to-day work. A significant part of the customer-centricity strategy, is our customer suitability approach. For ING, customer suitability means designing and providing products and services that are suitable for our customers’ needs and risk profile, and selling them at the highest standards of integrity. The ‘five ING Customer Golden Rules’ form a key component in our approach towards customer suitability for our banking and insurance operations. They are based on the ING Business Principles and express our commitment to provide our customers with products that meet their needs, to clearly explain the potential risks and returns of our products and services, and to provide them at a fair price. ING’s Executive Board approved the Customer Golden Rules in 2009 and made them an integral part of our Product Approval and Review Process (PARP). Our product approval and review process ensures that Risk and other functions are involved in considering the risks and making an assessment of other relevant factors. Through this process, ING attempts to make sure that all newly developed and existing products and services meet the set requirements for doing business. ING Group Sustainability Report 2012 28 Better customer experience 5 5.1 Customer centricity continued ING’s 5 Customer Golden Rules are: Customer Interest First has nine areas of focus: 1. We strive to meet customers’ needs throughout their life cycle. • Products and services: Constantly reviewing and improving our Through the right products and proper advice, we will keep existing products and reviewing all new products, services and customers happy. standards 2.

An example of a KPI is that our clients should rate 60% of our client conversations as ‘very good’ to ‘excellent’. Depending on the type of job, CIF KPIs are Implementing customer centricity part of the employee’s coaching and performance assessment. In 2012 several of our businesses implemented special clientor We are also developing an overall CIF dashboard so we can see customer-centric initiatives. how we are performing at any moment on a set of CIF KPIs • Human Resources: Making sure we hire people with a mind set Retail Banking of putting the customer’s interest first and providing continuous Since 2010, ING has been implementing a change programme throughout the international Retail operations called ‘Customer training to managers and employees Interest First’ (CIF). The objective of CIF is to make every aspect • Customer engagement: Making sure we listen to advice from our of our organisation customer-centric; from the type of people customers and use it to constantly improve our business.

On the contrary, CIF sometimes requires us to say no • Internal communications: Regularly emphasising CIF in our to a customer because we do not believe the product or service internal communications may be suitable for the client given his or her risk and financial profile. Private Banking ING Private Banking works on the basis of the relationship model. Surveys show that a strong fit between the client and the bank is essential in order to form long-term partnerships. For example in the Netherlands, to facilitate a better match between the personal profiles and needs of the clients and their private banker, ING gives prospective clients the opportunity to choose their own private banker. Based on their postal codes, prospective clients are presented with a number of profiles that show the background, expertise and personal interests of the private bankers. ING Group Sustainability Report 2012 29 Better customer experience 5 5.1 Customer centricity continued Commercial Banking ING Insurance In 2012, ING Commercial Banking introduced a new solutionsIn our insurance and investment management business, we aim driven methodology for client engagement called the Integrated to differentiate our customer experience from that of our peers Customer Approach (ICA). The ICA requires an in-depth analysis by providing clarity about our products and services, terms and understanding of the client’s strategy, operations and balance and conditions, and pricing. We also aim to comprehend our sheet. Relationship managers and product specialists have been customers’ circumstances and needs and consequently provide specially trained to dissect balance sheets for financial risks and better guidance on the customers’ financial situation.

In countries where local legislation goes further than the principles set out by the UDHR, ILO Core Conventions and/or UN Global Compact, ING will also apply to the additional local legislation. In countries where local legislation prevents ING from upholding aspects of the UDHR, the ILO Core Conventions, provisions of the UN Global Compact or ING’s own human resources policies, ING strives to act in the spirit and nature of these principles while respecting and adhering to applicable local legislation. Under our Human Rights Statement, we uphold the freedom of association for all our employees and recognise the right to collective bargaining. The way employees are consulted depends on local legislation and culture. In some countries employee consultation is a legal requirement. In many European countries, employee consultation is arranged via works councils. In 1996, ING instituted a European Works Council. In 2002, the European Works Council and the Executive Board signed a Social Framework with common principles for social policy and labour management. 8.11 Reduction in employment In 2012 ING sharpened its overall strategy for the Bank. We also announced the first divestments of our Asian Insurance/IM units, as well as the delayering of the support functions and the acceleration of the transformation programme at Insurance in the Netherlands. Both ING Insurance/IM Europe and ING US made progress in their preparations for an IPO. These developments have had an immediate impact on ING’s employees, resulting in a reduction in employment at the Bank and at Insurance/Investment Management.

We find ourselves confronted with difficult decisions on the financial aspect of our community investment programmes. There are several internal and external stakeholder expectations to consider before we make decisions or commitments. Having weighed all relevant issues, we chose to primarily invest in the education of children, financial literacy and entrepreneurship as the building blocks of our community investment strategy.
