Acindar was born as a result of the spirit of a group of construction entrepreneurs who had the vision of developing the largest steel industry. The dream 04 grew and was maintained over time due to the commitment and strength of its people. On our 70th anniversary, we continue betting on the future. 70 years It was the year 1942, when World War II broke out. At that time, Arturo Acevedo owned a construction company together with other shareholders. With the European industry devoted almost exclusively to production for the war and the obstacles met by maritime transport, First Steps there was a scarcity of steel bars, an indispensable element for the construction industry. Unable to import material, this group of businessmen decided to go a step further and began producing it locally. With an initial capital of one million Argentine pesos, a plant was built in the city of Rosario (province of Santa Fe). In 1952, Acindar settled in Villa Constitución (Province of Santa Fe) with a modern Morgan rolling mill. With an exceptional geographic location along the Paraná River and also convenient road and rail access, the factory facilitated progress in a city Arrival to Villa that until that time had mainly been devoted to agriculture. Constitución The intention of Eng. Acevedo had always been to build a comprehensive plant that would contemplate the entire production process from iron ore to finished products. The dream came After several attempts, in 1975, they started the construction of a direct reduction plant, a steel mill with three electric true furnaces and continuous casting, as well as ancillary facilities including a mineral port. This was a milestone for the company and represented a major challenge for the day. In 1981, an agreement was signed whereby Acindar joined Gurmendi SA, Establecimientos Metalúrgicos Santa Rosa SA and Genaro Grasso SA. In terms of the implementation of its investment policy in 1987, the projects involving affiliates based in Villa Mercedes (San Luis Province) were completed, contributing to the development of a region of the country where there Expansion had been only few industries. In 1995, there was an integration with Navarro plant in Rosario (province of Santa Fe), expanding the company’s growth potential. During the 90’s the company opened offices in Montevideo (Uruguay) and Sao Paulo (Brazil). In 2004, the purchase of Aceros Bonelli in San Nicolás (Buenos Aires) complemented the range of steel sections sizes Acindar had. An agreement was signed with Belgo Mineira, a leading Brazilian steel company. The Acevedo family sold 50% of their shares and Acindar was from the year 2000 under joint management. Belgo Mineira, that was at that time already under the control of Arcelor, International acquired the remaining shares. With further capital investments, Belgo Mineira now owned around 72% of the Company’s shares. integration By the end of 2006, Arcelor and Mittal Steel merged forming the ArcelorMittal Group, world leader in the production of steel. After this, Acindar became part of the new dynamics of the steel industry in the 21st century, becoming ArcelorMittal its largest shareholder. Today more than ever, rooted in the values of sustainability, quality and leadership, and accompanied by the professionalism of its people, Acindar Grupo ArcelorMittal is prepared for further growth, facing new challenges, maximizing its competitiveness Present and and optimizing daily production processes. Because the road to continuous improvement is not over. future 18 2012 Sustainability Report | Acindar Grupo ArcelorMittal 19 05 Human Rights Policy The ArcelorMittal Human Rights Declarations.

It is important to point out that, thanks to these recoveries, a positive impact was achieved in the volume of special waste generated (reducing neutralization muds generation and achieving a 32% reduction compared to 2011). It was also possible to reduce the consumption of resources in productive processes that now use this special waste as a supply. 62 63 Our relationship with 10 Enriching our communities the community Third edition of the Plant visit Acindar Marathon programme 10 On Sunday, September 9, a crowd composed of athletes and families from Villa Constitución gathered to participate in a new edition During 2012, different secondary schools and universities came to our plant in Villa Constitución to tour the facility and learn about our production processes.
