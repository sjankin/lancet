Through small steps every day and by working together with our employees, suppliers, customers, governments and communities, we plan to create a better tomorrow and help “shape the future” of millions of people towards achieving shared objectives. In line with this thought, we present a transparent and fair communication of our efforts on fostering sustainable development and how these will help in shaping the future of our stakeholders. This stakeholder-centric report reflects our strategies and actions towards analysing impacts and working towards creating a “positive stakeholder value”. 5 6 A word from our Chairman & Managing Director Dear Stakeholders, It is my pleasure to present GAIL’s Sustainability Report for 2011-12 titled “Shaping the Future”. It has been GAIL’s continuous endeavour to shape a sustainable future for all stakeholders by ensuring supply of clean and efficient energy across the length and breadth of India. This report describes our intent and initiatives to co-create such a future by working with employees, suppliers, customers, government and communities. We believe that acting in accordance with this philosophy and our core values is essential for superlative performance in the long term. Ensuring availability, accessibility and affordability of energy for people and industry is crucial to underpin India’s long term economic and social progress. Energy demand in India is rising and it is expected to be the 3rd largest energy consumer by 2025. GAIL is actively engaged in sourcing and delivering reliable and affordable natural gas and other clean energy sources to support this growth. GAIL is investing around $8 billion over the next few years to create new transmission and regasification infrastructure, tie-up new sources of gas, seed new We work with markets, and support new or existing downstream consumers based on gas. These steps will enable us to support green industrialization local communities and a cleaner climate. to support their GAIL is taking several steps to ingrain sustainability in its business operations and Corporate Strategy 2020. Besides several initiatives in development and core business areas, we are broadening our horizons to venture into gasbased power, renewables, and unconventional energy sources like Shale alleviate societal Gas, CBM and Coal Gas. We laid emphasis on conservation of energy and promotion of renewable technologies and commissioned around concerns while 115 MW of wind energy projects. Some of our environmental initiatives included development of green belt of over one million trees around minimizing any various site offices, implementation of flaring systems at important potential negative sites to prevent discharge of hydrocarbons into the atmosphere, and rain water harvesting to effectively recharge groundwater amongst impacts of our others. operations. GAIL recently developed its Sustainable Development (SD) Policy which will guide our sustainability initiatives in the years to come. We have also put the necessary structures and processes in place to effectively present our sustainability commitments, exercise better control on the performance indicators and transparently report progress on these commitments and indicators. This includes having designated Coordinators at site offices along with Aspect Owners and SD Core team at corporate/site level who have received specialized training on SD aspects. 7 GAIL became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) to further align its operations and strategies with the ten universally accepted principles of UNGC.

Tripathi Chairman & Managing Director GAIL (India) Limited 8 Ingraining Sustainability in GAIL As we work on our aggressive growth strategy to become an INR 1,000 billion company by 2016-17 and further to an INR 1,300 billion company by 2020, with an estimated profit of INR 100 billion; there is a tremendous responsibility on GAIL to contribute to India’s energy security and in turn lead her into a sustainable future. To realize this growth, we have identified critical growth areas and appropriately planned initiatives in the upstream, midstream and downstream segments of the hydrocarbon value chain. The contribution of our key stakeholders will play a pivotal role in GAIL realising its ambitions, and we have planned several partnership programs to ensure a symbiotic relation with them. Employees continue to be the driving force behind each and every success of GAIL. The shareholder’s and investor’s confidence on our capabilities to achieve our dreams ensures a seamless continuity of our operations and projects. The ever-increasing expectations of our customers drive us to innovate and create effective and efficient business models. The unwavering support extended by our suppliers ensures that we meet deadlines and achieve arduous milestones. And finally the endorsement provided by the local communities and the society helps us to create sustainable livelihoods for one and all. Our Directors under the able leadership of the Chairman & Managing Director are responsible for shaping our future in a sustainable manner and to the benefit of all. Left to Right Shri (s) S. Venkatraman, R.D. Goyal, B.C. Tripathi, S.L. Raina, Prabhat Singh, P.K. Jain 9 R.D. Goyal (Director – Projects) We are India’s premier integrated gas company. GAIL has been distinguished as the only company in Asia to receive the “World’s No. 1 company in downstream operations” award by Platts in 2011. We now have similar aspirations across the hydrocarbon value chain. It is our invariable effort to develop gas infrastructure throughout the country for efficient delivery of gas to end consumers. Several new pipelines are in different stages of execution across the country which will lead to doubling of existing pipeline length in the next five years. Commissioning of LNG re-gasification terminal in Dabhol is going to further increase the utilization of the company’s infrastructure. Expansion is underway in our Petrochemical plant at Pata. Our objective is always to go beyond compliance with laws and regulations minimizing environmental impacts using environment & risk management strategies. We have given topmost priority to environmental consideration throughout the various phases of project execution and operation. Our operations maintain Environmental Management Systems certified to ISO 14001 standards. All operations undergo annual independent audits of ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems to ensure standards are met. Considering the limited availability of conventional sources of energy, we strongly feel that there is a consistent need to improve energy efficiency of our processes thereby managing and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our facilities for which various initiatives are taken across our operations. Moving ahead with our commitment to implement GAIL’s vision and strategies on sustainability, execution of 5 MW Solar-PV project in Rajasthan is planned with targeted completion by 2012. Wind power project of 117.75 MW installed capacity has been commissioned and is being utilized for captive consumption in Gujarat and commercial production in Tamil Nadu & Karnataka. 10 S.L. Raina (Director – HR) At GAIL we believe that our people are a determining factor in the success of our company. We have achieved our goals which have only been made possible by the dedication, loyalty and contribution of our Human Capital. It is the capability, passion, enthusiasm, drive and strive-forexcellence attitude in our people that differentiates us from others and gives us that extra edge. Each of our employees adds value to our growing organisation. We invest in our employees in order to sustain their motivation and engagement levels, which in turn is essential for achievement of one organisation’s strategic goals. We continuously provide opportunities for constant training and development and for career development. We provide support to our employees through internal job rotation that gives them an opportunity to gain a broad experience in a wide range of disciplines. In fact, “engaging our employees for superior results” has been one of our success mantras as we fall under Hewitt’s “Best Employer Zone” in terms of the latest employee engagement survey. This is demonstrated by the fact that GAIL has one of the highest profitability per employee ratio amongst all CPSEs with a continuously increasing “Year-wise Value added per employee ratio”. GAIL values commitment, dedication, integrity and sincerity. Right from the early stages, employees are expected to walk the extra mile to surpass the set expectations. We treat everyone with dignity and respect and have developed policies to promote diversity and equity in the workplace. Our sincere endeavor is to go beyond laws and adopt international best practices to make GAIL a smart organization to work for. We are an equal opportunity employer and recognize people on their merits and skill sets irrespective of their race, caste, religion, colour, ancestry, marital status, gender, age and nationality. We recognize the importance of the communities we operate in and are committed towards addressing their concerns. Our structured framework to identify the issues & needs of community reflect through our social responsibility programs. A robust governance structure following a top-to-bottom approach with a dedicated team helps in evaluating and selecting programs in the identified thrust areas. In other words, we as organisation have embarked upon a journey of mutually beneficial and sustainable relationship with our people as well as the society in which we are operating. 11 Prabhat Singh (Director – Marketing) Being a leader in Natural gas, we have a strong market position with a 75% market share in Natural gas transportation and 51% market share in Natural Gas marketing. We value our customers and significant investments have been made for up gradation of our existing gas transmission network in order to double our transmission capacity and reach out to the newly developing gas consumption centres. We are constantly exploring customers who can switch over to CNG as fuel to replace the polluting fuel under use. In addition, we have a sophisticated Gas monitoring system, duly capable of handling multiple sources of supply and delivery of gas on a real time basis. Our gas customers are facilitated with information through our gas management system to well plan and utilize our gas supply. Apart from educating and generating awareness, we promote product responsibility and have partnered with Indian Centre for plastics in the Environment (ICPE) to research and further propagate the positive impacts of plastics in comparison to other alternatives both in terms of utility as well as environment impact. However it will be our aim to emerge stronger in new business segments such as renewable energy. GAIL Polymer Technology center (GPTC), located in Noida serves as a platform for customers to avail technical solutions and insights that help address their problems. Our customer satisfaction index stood at 89%. Further, regular interactive meets with customers & suppliers ensures systematic and timely addressing of their concerns and also in bringing out improvements in our customer redressal system. 12 S. Venkatraman (Director–Business Development) Moving ahead in our Sustainability journey, our second edition of the sustainability report ‘Shaping the Future’ FY11-12 focuses on our efforts in this direction. As India is on its way to become world’s 3rd largest energy consumer by 2025, ensuring sustainable supply of natural gas to pursue greater energy security is gaining imperative concern for India. At GAIL, we are working towards meeting the exponentially growing demand of Natural Gas. We are aggressively expanding our pipeline & city gas distribution network in India and transcending to trans-national pipeline with TAPI, wherein Gas sales and purchase agreement with Turkmengaz of 38 MMSCMD for 30 years has been executed. In the wake of constrained domestic supplies, we have further expanded our global presence to acquire new expertise & resources through overseas tie-ups in Shale gas and LNG. Our Strategy 2020 envisages diversification in alternate sources like wind & solar energy. This year we moved from being a captive to commercial producer after commissioning of around 100 MW of wind energy projects. Further, we are setting a 5 MW solar PV plant in Rajasthan and bidding for solar energy projects in the country. Being an energy company we have taken strategic steps to improve our technological capabilities. As per the DPE mandate our 1% of PAT is utilized in R&D investments for exploring new opportunities in this field. We have taken up a pilot project for extraction of landfill gas from municipal solid waste in New Delhi to generate CNG. This project demonstrates our commitment towards harnessing all sources of energy. In addition, we are also actively exploring potential technologies in Shale Gas, Underground Coal gasification, Gas Hydrates, Hydrogen, Gas Storage etc. Sustainability is ingrained in GAIL’s vision and we are driven by our commitment to create value for all our stakeholders and also looking beyond compliance of the regulatory requirements. Our Initiatives are driven by our desire to reduce the carbon footprint, Water footprint etc. and have taken concrete targets for reduction of our GHG emissions, water consumption intensity, etc. in SD Aspiration 2020. Further, we have taken up GHG accounting at one of our major sites and plan to take it forward across other sites of GAIL. We follow a top-to-bottom approach for governance of sustainability initiatives in the Company. The Sustainable Development Board Committee regularly meets to plan and prioritise related issues and activities giving thrust to our 13 sustainability initiatives. P. K. Jain (Director – Finance) The year 2012 witnessed a strong financial growth with our turnover increasing by 24% to INR 40,281 crore and PAT increasing by 3% to INR 3,654 crore. We have embarked on a pipeline network augmentation for laying another 7,500 Km of pipelines at an investment of about INR 30,000 crore, ensuring availability of gas & creating access to newer demand centres for major domestic source points and the LNG re-gasification facilities. While perusing the financial growth we also believe in following a growth path that is environmentally & socially sustainable and creates long-term value for all our stakeholders. This ensures long-term success of a business while contributing toward economic & social development. a healthy environment, and a stable society. The role of companies in a society is currently going through a transition that presents important opportunities. In the dynamic global economic condition, it becomes essential for GAIL to recognise its growing significance and develop strategies that work towards a low-carbon economy that provide us with significant business and investment opportunities. 14 Business Profile GAIL started as a Natural Gas transportation company in 1984 and today is India’s No.1 Natural Gas Company.

The materiality determination process forms an integral part of our stakeholder engagement surveys. The next section further describes the material issues that were identified as a part of this process and how GAIL is progressively working on each of these areas. 33 Joint Secretary, MoPNG visit at GAIL Pata Determining Material Issues 34 34 Identification of material issues is one of the most critical steps towards shaping a sustainable future. Material issues are those issues that have the ability to hamper the decision of an organisation’s stakeholders. At GAIL, we conduct the materiality assessment exercise on an annual basis to identify what is important to our stakeholders and subsequently disclose own performance against those. 34 The stakeholder engagement exercise, followed by a comprehensive data analysis gave us a holistic picture of critical concerns, aspirations and expectations of our stakeholders, which subsequently helped us to determine the material issues. This year’s engagement helped us establish the fact that the issues material to our stakeholders haven’t changed since last year. Following is our progress on those material issues in this year: ±± Gas sourcing: India is increasingly focusing on natural gas, as the fuel of choice, ascertained by its growing demand and importance stemming from its environmental and economic benefits. Securing adequate gas supplies to align with the escalating gas demand is of primary importance LNG Ship to GAIL. We are scouting for upstream acquisitions and overseas opportunities to supplement gas sourcing initiatives on spot and long term basis. To ensure an uninterrupted supply of gas, we continue to increase our footprint in LNG and natural gas trading in the international markets. A step in this direction was our acquisition of a 20% interest in Carrizo’s Eagle Ford Shale acreage in 2011, recognizing the future potential of shale gas in India. The strategic rationale behind this transaction was to acquire technical know-how in the shale gas business through secondment of E&P officials in the joint venture equipping us to prepare for future shale gas bidding rounds in India, thereby giving us a competitive advantage. The deal makes GAIL the first public sector enterprise in India to enter highly competitive US shale gas sector. During this year, our subsidiary GAIL Global (Singapore) Pte Ltd. opened its office in Singapore to initiate trading activities in LNG and petrochemical commodities. We also signed a 20-year sales and purchase agreement with Sabine Pass Liquefaction LLC, a unit of Cheniere Energy partners, for supply of 3.5 million tonnes/year of LNG. With the support of the government of India, we are pursuing the import of gas through the proposed national TAPI pipeline originating in Turkmenistan, passing through Afghanistan and Pakistan to India. We have also executed a gas sales purchase agreement with Turkmengaz for 38 MMSCMD for 30 years supply in May 2012. Other relevant information is also provided in the Investors section of the report. ±± Business growth: We constantly look at diversifying our business portfolio and exploring new avenues to fuel business growth. Our petrochemicals business contributes significantly to our profits and to strengthen our market position in this segment, we are doubling the capacity of our petrochemical manufacturing facilities at Pata to 900,000 TPA of polymers. Responding to the increased emphasis laid on capacity expansion in the power sector in India’s 12th five year plan, we are exploring opportunities in gas based power plants. In an attempt towards narrowing the demand and supply gap existing for natural gas resources, we are exploring setting up of an LNG import 35 GAIL Cheniere Deal Signing over Video Conferencing facility in the east coast of India.

In line with our policy, we organized a Gas Management System (GMS), implemented two-day workshop on occupational health risks and ways of mitigating them. The workshop was conducted for all business heads, fire and safety heads, and HR representatives from sites. To ensure compliance with statutory rules and regulations we also conduct regular safety audits and medical health checkups. During this year, we conducted 27 external, seven internal safety audits and conducted medical examination of all employees at the work centres. Further, we have created a corporate occupational health committee that meets every quarter to monitor and improve occupational health of employees.

True sustainability should be integrated into all operations of business from policy and management through to on-ground activities such as purchasing, production and distribution. Sustainability is often approached in an ad-hoc way mostly by adopting random initiatives. This is a good 39 start, but to create a better future, a coordinated process that integrates sustainability in to the business strategy is absolutely essential. As part of our 2020 business strateg y, we plan to Sustainable Development give a significant thrust on diversification into Aspirations 2020 high value creating businesses such as gas based power plants and renewable energ y.

Diversification into clean energy We plan to diversify further into other businesses such as renewable energy and gas-based power generation. Government of India (GoI) has taken several pro-active steps to address the challenge of climate change as a national issue by developing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2008 and more recently announcing to voluntarily reduce India’s carbon emission intensity (GHG emitted per unit of GDP) by 20-25% by 2020 over the emission intensity of 2005. There has been a significant National thrust on moving towards renewable forms of energy, and at GAIL we have developed our own action plan to traverse towards higher renewable energy contribution to National grid and in own operations. We are successfully moving from being captive producer to a commercial producer after commissioning around 100 MW of wind energy project last year. This year we have set up 14.7 MW wind energy project for captive usage in Gujarat and 98.75 MW for commercial usage in the state of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. During FY 2011-12 an investment of INR 674 crore was made in wind energy projects.

This year we had one instance where a show cause notice was served by the local pollution control board for exceeding LPG transmission limit at our Jamnagar unit. An immediate corrective action was initiated by the management and an application was presented to the Pollution Control Board to subsequently revise the permissible limits. 47 Communities : fostering social capital Fostering a social capital will help in satisfying the social needs and substantially improve the overall quality of life of the local communities. We have initiated several social responsibility programs in order to strengthen local economy, increase employment and employability, encourage local prosperity, reduce environmental impact, support community groups and empower them. Keeping the community happy and satisfied ensures our social license to operate. 48 The local communities we operate in, play a pivotal development of the community at large.

The primary aim of the study was to plan CSR interventions of GAIL for FY 12-13 in its operational areas. The report prepared by the external agency assessed needs across all of the above operational units by covering various aspects such as socio economic profiles, educational status, livelihood sources, water availability, sanitary conditions, credit availability, etc. The need identification exercise helped us arrive at focused intervention areas across our facilities to ensure maximum impact through careful planning and deliberation on pressing needs of communities neighboring each of our units. The following intervention areas were identified: ±± Pata and Vijaipur: Provision of solar lights, support in self-employment initiatives and watershed management ±± Jhabua: Provision of toilets at school, training on healthy habits, watershed management ±± Khera: Provision of community toilets and watershed management ±± Hazira: Vocational training ±± Agartala: Promotion of animal husbandry and provision of potable drinking water ±± Rajahmundary: Vocational training and provision of toilets CASE Anhad Gram Village Development Program in Jhabua STUDY Project Anhad Gram, which means village without boundaries, aims at addressing core issues of livelihood, environment and water management. Community Friendly Movement (CFM) is the implementing agency for the project. It is conceived as a sustainable model that promotes village based enterprise to keep urban migration in check and ensure all round development of the villages covered, through creation of employment opportunities. The specific interventions planned under various projects include the following: • Sulndhan Biomass briquetting to provide cleaner fuel for household use: Under this program, smokeless briquettes are created through pyrolysis process. Agro and forest waste is used as fuel instead of conventional fuels like coal, wood and cow dung pallets. This helps protect the community members from illnesses due to smoke inhalation. • Pashudhan Training and development of animal husbandry essentially under poultry and goatry: With 160 beneficiaries under 16 SHGs, the goatry project imparts modern techniques in rearing and feeding, access to equipment and green fodder. It has contributed to improved breeding among the present livestock. The poultry project benefits 42 SHGs, working towards the preservation and propagation of the native breed – Kadaknath. • Jai Mrida Improvement of water table to provide for sustainable and organic farming: The project is supporting ongoing training of over 350 beneficiaries under 30 SHGs to prepare for organic certification under APEDA, to create direct market linkages, and to access and utilize modern farming equipment, biofertilizers and community based irrigation systems. The program also facilitates training and usage of vermin composting, vermin wash, and azolla units to improve farm productivity and soil health. • Post implementation the development model will encompass the following: • Energy conservation due to use of alternate power and fuel sources from biomass and agricultural waste like cob, wild bushes and grass. 52 • Better farm produce due to water conservation and water harvesting techniques • Improvement in crop yield through seeds and organic fertilizers • Forward linkages of crops (cash/farm) by introducing food processing and vacuum packing techniques to reach out to further markets • Currently Project Anhad Gram covers 10 villages and 88 SHGs. We plan to extend the project to 15 more villages and 150 SHGs in FY 12-13.

CASE Improving sanitation and hygiene practices at the village of Devrai Ka Purwa STUDY During our need assessment survey we discovered that the village Devrai ka purwa, situated in Auraiya, UP, suffered from poor hygiene practices and lacked proper infrastructure necessary for sanitary conditions. Due to a large number of dysfunctional toilets, open defecation had become a common practice making the area vulnerable to intestinal diseases and contaminating the surroundings especially during the monsoon season. Moreover, neither solid waste nor liquid waste was properly disposed off. Both the Panchayat Bhawan and the Anganwadi situated in the village campus lacked proper sanitary facilities, whereby hand pumps were in a dilapidated condition and toilets were broken and unusable. Due to this problem, the dropout rate of students, especially girls was relatively high in the area. The objective of the project was to improve sanitation services & hygiene practices of the village by addressing the issues of health, education, agriculture, and livelihood. To fulfill this objective we undertook the following tasks: • 25 families were mobilized to construct a compost pit to dispose organic waste and 16 families were motivated to construct individual household toilets. • Anganwadi toilet was restored and maintained for regular use by children. • The village paths and drainage pipelines were cleaned by facilitating community participation. • Regular workshops and group meetings with school children helped them adopt hygienic practices such as hand washing with soap, cleaning plates after midday meals etc. • Interaction with parents on the issue of girl education helped lower the dropout rate of girls in schools. • The villagers were made aware of various government schemes at their disposal, which they were previously ignorant of. • The community was sensitized towards maintaining and exploring existing infrastructure Health Most rural communities around GAIL’s operational units are grappling with the problem of inadequate healthcare facilities. In response to this growing concern, we had started mobile healthcare vehicles to provide basic medical facilities in remote areas of Pata in Uttar Pradesh and Vijaipur in Madhya Pradesh. Taking this initiative forward, we entered into a strategic alliance with M/s Wockhardt Foundation to provide medical outreach services as its four major workcentres of Pata, Vijaipur, Jhabua, and Khera, extending health care support to 2,25,000 needy patients in FY 11-12. We also helped set up telemedicine centres at various district headquarters adjoining our operational units. These centres are linked to major medical institutes and research centres and are used for both training and treatment. We conduct health camps covering ailments such as cancer, thalassemia, T.B. detection, etc. In the area of mobile connectivity, we have supported various projects by providing ambulances, 54 mobile health outreach programs and distribution of medicines. As part of our routine healthcare programs in neighboring communities, we have initiated several ±± Reconstruction of government primary school health care projects such as reconstructive surgery building at TaktuMajra in Rajpura Tehsil of for leprosy patients, eye care cataract surgeries Punjab state with IOL implants, T.B. eradication programs, malaria camps with treatment and free medicines, family Initiatives undertaken by GAIL to improve planning etc. GAIL’s own hospitals and dispensaries in health infrastructure in FY 11-12: its townships also extend medical treatment to the local villagers. ±± Construction of high dependency unit at J.K.

They also lacked knowledge about the latest agricultural technologies that could help them conserve water and address the problem of water shortage. To educate villagers on water conservation methods and to develop water related infrastructure, a water conservation project was implemented at Khera, which involved construction of ponds, digging of wells, recharging of wells, micro check dams, etc. The project also included training villagers on ground water recharging, construction of check dam and digging of wells. Awareness was created amongst nearby villagers on water conservation techniques and utilization of minimal water for cultivation using modern agriculture techniques. Skill development As quoted by India’s Planning Commission, “skill building is instrumental in improving the effectiveness and contribution of labor to overall production, pushing the production possibility frontier outward and taking growth rate of the economy to a higher trajectory. By empowering the individual, it improves his/her social acceptance.” However rising unemployment and gross disparities in unemployment rates between urban and rural population continue to threaten India’s development story. Our endeavor is to improve employability and contribute to economic growth by imparting relevant industry skills to unemployed youth, creating greater opportunities of livelihood and facilitating socio-economic sustenance. Swavalambh is our flagship program in this direction, initiated in partnership with IL&FS skill school in 2010. The targeted beneficiaries of the program include school dropouts, undergraduate students with low marks, academically less oriented women and other disadvantaged groups. The candidates are trained in retail and facility management, and are provided basic computer skills over a span of six to eight weeks. The course equips the candidates to bridge the preexisting skill gap and better serve the demand of service sectors. Driven by the positive impact of Swavalambh, GAIL has replicated this model in Tandur in the Rangareddy district of Andhra Pradesh and Sagbara district of Gujarat, by opening similar schools in these areas. Lending its support to MoRD’s Swarna Jayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) to promote employment in rural India, GAIL established the GAILAROH Skill resource training center. The program, executed under a PPP model with the MoRD, aims at providing non-formal education to school drop-outs aiding in employment of around 7,000 youths in the areas of UP, Rajasthan and Haryana in a span of two years. Around 3,500 BPL youth have adopted the SGSY scheme and benefited from the program, till date. Another project implemented under AROH called ‘Project Garima’ trains mothers who attend non formal education centres, in skills like cutting, tailoring, embroidery, and handicraft making. The project assists them in developing market linkages, thereby boosting their family income and ensuring greater enrollment of their children in skill development programs. We also promote the empowerment of differently-abled and physically challenged people by providing them specialized motor vehicles, medical aids, equipments and infrastructural support. CASE Establishment of Blanket Weaving Training and Manufacturing Unit at Pata STUDY Engagement surveys with villagers at Pata yielded a pressing need to create employment opportunities in the region. During these interactions it was discovered that a few women carried out carpet weaving at their homes under the banner “Kuteer Udhyog”. However limited availability of raw material and consequent low business volumes were key concerns in ensuring the sustainability of their business. Moreover these women were contracted on piece rate basis, receiving minimal wages, while the raw material suppliers who picked up the finished carpets pocketed large margins. To address this problem we decided to leverage the skill of these women to meet the demand of one of our initiatives which involves distribution of blankets to poor villagers near our operational units. So far we had been procuring blankets from Kanpur. However, our engagement survey informed us 56 that we could tap into the local talent of these women and manufacture these blankets in-house and buy them from local markets, thereby creating an employment opportunity for the villagers. The local community would benefit from cheaper products while the women weavers would benefit from higher volumes and margins. To kickstart this project, we collaborated with a NGO CVPS and a survey was conducted to study the market potential of establishing a manufacturing unit. Based on the response, the first unit was established in Phaphund with 5 looms in November 2011 with two trainers providing blanket weaving training to 15 women trainees for 10 months. A project coordinator was appointed to supervise the project including raw material procurement, selection of trainees, registration of their SHG, product market linkages, reporting, coordination etc. The project has benefited 15 women who have been trained in blanket weaving and have already produced more than 200 blankets. The profit generated from this project will be reinvested and deposited in SHG’s account as rolling fund to ensure its sustainability. The project has received a warm response from other nearby villages and will be replicated in the villages of Kanho and Khanpur in FY 12-13. Education programs ‘GAIL Utkarsh’ and ‘E-Shiksha’. The programs, focused on IIT-JEE coaching and computer In April 2012, the Ministry of Human Resource literacy respectively, develop capabilities and Development declared that despite doubling fund prepare students for a brighter future.

The and drinking water facilities in government schools in reasons for this are poor quality of education and rural India. These support activities have improved abject poverty. Alleviating this problem, GAIL’s the attendance of students in schools, contributing initiative “Padho aur Badho” in collaboration with to their creativity and independence. We have also NGO AROH, aims at providing education to children collaborated with other oil sector PSEs for setting up residing in urban slums in Delhi. Many of these children of an Institute of Petroleum Technology in Assam. earn their living as ragpickers and other menial jobs. The initiative aims at rehabilitating these children and giving them basic education through non-formal “E-Shiksha” training to bring them to the mainstream. More than One of the most important interventions by GAIL 11,000 students have benefitted in the last 2 years in the field of education has been the E-Shiksha from GAIL’s education related programs. program wherein we have set up computer labs in self-sustained power-equipped mobile vehicles We have continued our efforts to increase the with qualified instructors and teaching aids. The impact and enhance the coverage of our two flagship program enables students to accomplish their computer related school curriculum through the mobile computer aided lab and makes computer education accessible to government schools in remote areas. After school hours, the mobile computer vehicles are also available to the villagers of Pata and Vijaipur, for adults to take up courses in typing and basic computer literacy. The program has significantly augmented awareness on computers and technology in nearby villages. Moreover a completion certificate awarded by our NGO partner to successful candidates, for courses registered with the Ministry of HRD, lends credibility and has helped many candidates get employment with local contractors as clerks or book keepers. 57 “GAIL Utkarsh” ±± Solar Lighting: Under this program, GAIL offers scholarships We have initiated two along with CSR to students living in economically pilot projects near our backward sections for coaching required for petrochemical complex engineering entrance examinations. Typically, in Pata for installation coaching classes for engineering entrances are of solar lights and very expensive in India and often unaffordable illuminating villages and inaccessible by a large section of our society.

Some of the initiatives we have taken in this regard Our initiatives in rain water harvesting have resulted include: in an increase in the water level in many villages and have facilitated increased irrigation and cultivation of crops. Increased water availability has enabled adoption of agro farming and inter-cropping practices. Several other water conservation initiatives such recharging of ground water aquifers and construction of check dams have been aptly supported by GAIL, serving the twin purpose of environmental protection and infrastructure development. ±± Wildlife preservation: We have been lending support to Mobile Veterinary Services (MVS) units in the North-East through 58 provision of vehicles for Save the Tiger Project in Malenad-Mysore Tiger conservation area, along with construction of a Field Research Centre at Melinahuluwathi, Bhadra Wild Reserve (implemented through Centre for Wildlife Studies, Bangalore) and support to the Mobile Veterinary Service units running in the wildlife sanctuaries of Manas National Park, through Wildlife Trust of India. ±± Other initiatives: GAIL has also worked towards developing a gas-based crematorium in New Delhi, installation of bio-gas plants for poor slum-dwellers and development of environment parks for thousands of slum dwellers. Right-of-Way and Resettlement & Rehabilitation We follow stringent design and management standards during laying of pipelines. Our pipelines comply with international design standards such as ASME, API, DIN, ISO and National standards like OISD. All pipeline projects undergo a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment and requisite clearances are taken from Ministry of Environment and Forests at planning stages itself. While planning pipeline routes, we analyze options that have lower impact on ecology and environment. Areas such as those that is ecologically sensitive, geographically unstable, with lesser obstaclesrailroads and highways. All contractors involved in pipeline laying operations are mandated to limit activities only within the approved Right-of-way. We adhere to Indian regulation on Resettlement and Rehabilitation; however we have not envisaged any R&R within our projects and operations this year. Environmental performance of reclamation initiatives. The most significant waste our owned operations products generated from our operations include used oil, lube oil and oily sludge. We have appointed CBCP Managing waste authorized waste handlers to process and disposeoff waste products ensuring minimum impact on We consciously measure and monitor our products’ the environment. We continue to recycle slop oil and environmental impact at all stages, from the extraction spent alumina, two of the major waste materials from of raw materials to end-of-life. Waste management is our petrochemicals complex in Pata. Recycling these a critical aspect of our operations and we have taken products reduces material costs as well as the amount several steps to handle and disposeoff waste more of waste going into the landfills. It also lowers the cost efficiently by adopting various recycling, recovery and of transporting waste to the landfill. CASE Disposal of E-waste at GTI STUDY A proposal for induction of new methodology directing safe disposal of e-waste has been initiated at our GTI campus. The following initiatives have been implemented in this regard: • Proper collection and storage of e-waste arising out of consumables such as printer cartridges, toners and batteries • Timely collection of all used batteries by service providers • Efforts to introduce a reverse supply chain of e-waste • Educating OEMs on the need to collect e-waste from their respective sites • Creating awareness among users to ensure proper collection at source and timely return of e-waste • Issuing new consumables only after collection of used cartridges/toners from users 59 The project will yield the following benefits over a period of time: • Environmental Protection: Safe disposal and recycling e waste will help in reducing carbon emissions. • Protection from Health hazards: Unsafe disposal of toner ink could lead to acute health hazards such as irritation, redness and swelling of skin. In case of prolonged inhalation, it creates irritation of the respiratory tract. The International Agency of Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified carbon black as a carcinogenic material which is used in toner powder. Safe disposal will therefore reduce the potentially adverse health impact attributed to improper disposal of e-waste. • Storage space utilization: Effective disposal of e waste will also contribute to optimal usage of storage space in our offices. • Compliance with government’s e-waste policy: This initiative will also help us become compliant the ‘E-waste Management and Handling rule, 2011’ mandated by the Government of India. Managing OUr impact on biodiversity We are mindful of the fact that most of our operations, particularly the pipelines, edge around areas of high biodiversity value and we make a conscious efforts to preserve these areas in their natural form, regularly assessing and managing any impending risks to the flora and fauna. As a foundation to our biodiversity management strategy, all our operations and projects are preceded by stringent procedures of environmental impact assessments, and corrective measures are planned and undertaken at the earliest possible stages itself. Although none of our core operations are close to protected or reserved biodiversity areas as defined under National norms, as a procedure, GAIL mandates all its OIC’s to provide a declaration on clearance of their individual locations on presence / emergence of biodiversity hotspots. We have initiated biodiversity management activities across our work centres in Usar, Pata and Samakhiali. For instance, at Pata we corrected the high alkalinity in soil through extensive soil treatment and restored the soil balance, thereby contributing to an increased green cover in the area. At the Samakhiali unit, situated in the barren lands of Kutch district, the hot weather combined with saline soil precludes healthy vegetation growth. To boost vegetation growth in the area, our employees made a resolution to plant around 10,000 saplings in 2009 and 7,500 saplings in 2011. Within the periphery of our control, green belt area spans over 17.2 million square meters, which is approximately 41% of our total land holdings much beyond regulatory requirements. CASE Conservation of Native Plant Species at GPU, Usar STUDY (Maharashtra) Project Dharohar is a step towards partaking in the “National Mission for Preservation of Ecological Balance and Maintenance of Bio-diversity”. The project looks at exploring native plants conservation landscaping in Usar, to reduce pollution and minimize negative impact on the environment from our operations. The plant located in Alibaug in the Western Ghats, with its available land and other resources intends to conserve these treasures for our coming future generations. We plan to conduct knowledge disseminations and capacity building for this project by 31 January 2013. 60 Managing water resources With increasing water deficit in the country and constantly declining water tables, it has become paramount to conserve critical water resources. Freshwater accounts for a meager 2.5% of global water resources, of which only a third is accessible for human consumption. We have taken several steps to optimize our water consumption and also to assist nearby communities to gain easy access to water resources. During the year, 99% of water was sourced from surface water bodies. We continue to explore opportunities to harvest rain water to substitute surface and ground water consumption at our facilities. In 2010, rainwater harvesting was carried out in a land depression formed due to excavation of soil for construction purpose at the Gandhar unit. Satellite imagery and contouring was used to prepare a scheme to divert the run-off water effectively into the pond. The rainwater harvesting pond thus created was used to collect over 6,000 m3 of rainwater during the monsoon season. To ensure the sustainability of our water conservation initiatives in nearby villages, we continue to organize awareness sessions for villagers on conventional methods of rainwater harvesting near Usar unit, and also provided them with technical assistance to conduct water quality monitoring in the villages. Even though majority of our units do not yield significant wastewater streams, we make a conscious effort to discharge treated waste water in a responsible manner. Emphasis is laid on maximizing the recycling of treated water within our own operations, thus impacting our overall water footprint positively. During the year, out of 2.25 million m3 of wastewater generated, 1.33 million m3 was disposed outside our operational boundaries and 0.87 million m3 of water was recycled / reused back in to the system. At one of our locations, the waste water is discharged outside battery limit. The average values of the following parameter for the month of May 2011 & Jan 2012 are: ±± TSS68.6 mg/l ±± BOD16.26 mg/l ±± COD228.9 mg/l ±± Sulphide0.72 mg/l ±± Oil & grease<10 mg/l ±± Phenolics0.019 mg/l ±± pH7.36 This year, we initiated one of our major water stewardship programs at Vivekananda Sporting Complex in Pata, where treated sewage water would be reused for horticulture and maintenance activities, reducing fresh water consumption by more than 50%.Some of the other projects initiated in the year include: ±± Project Jaldhara, watershed management at Vijaipur (Madhya Pradesh): The project involves activities like water balance & audit through accomplishment of various studies such as geophysical, ground water and hydrological studies to explore watershed management potential in the area. ±± Capacity enhancement of water harvesting reservoir at Gandhar (Gujarat): The facility’s’ sole water source is from a local body, GIDC. We have implemented rainwater harvesting initiatives that will help conserve fresh water and use it for activities such as horticulture, greenbelt development and to supplement fire water in the months following the monsoon season. 61 ±± Zero rain water discharge at Samakhiali (Gujarat): Our plant is located in the arid Kutch district where ground water remains a prime source. At present, there are no facilities to transfer rainwater from storm water drains in the plant to recharge the reservoirs. Having identified this need, we are in the process of developing adequate infrastructure to enable transfer of rain water collected through storm water drains to recharge three underground reservoirs. ±± Rainwater harvesting at RTLoni and RTMadanpur (NCR): The NCR region experiences heavy rainfall during the monsoon season and recognizing this, we have taken up rain water harvesting in various locations in the terminal to replenish ground water. ±± Project Behti Dhara piped canal project at Vijaipur (Madhya Pradesh): The project intends to ensure sustained water availability by construction of a piped canal from Gopi Sagar Dam to the plant. Currently, the open canal is in a poor condition, with seepage, water run-offs and thefts amounting to significant water loss. The project will ensure water availability for GAIL’s upcoming C2/C3 project. It will also generate additional revenue for the state of Madhya Pradesh by realizing the value of water lost in the open canal, without over burdening the dam reservoir. Under our SD aspirations 2020 we have committed to reduce our water consumption intensity by 45% and increase our waste water recycling by 5 % by 2020 in comparison to 2010 baseline. The overall water consumption intensity & waste water recycled as % of waste water generated are presented in the table below: FY 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 Water Consumption Intensity(m3)/Crore) 505.2 419.7 344.9 Waste Water Recycled (% of WW generated) 43% 45% 39% Reducing air emissions Air emissions are one of the most important environmental challenges associated with Oil and Gas industry. We are well-aware of this fact and have taken several effective measures to abate air emissions arising from our operations. We have implemented flaring systems at all major locations to prevent the discharge of hydrocarbons directly into the atmosphere. All boiler and furnace stacks are equipped with on-line analyzers for continual monitoring of emission levels. Across all facilities, we strictly ensure that air emissions are controlled below the stipulated regulatory requirements. We succeeded in reducing our SOx emissions by 38.95% over the last year, while the SPM emissions increased by 4.69%. We stringently follow the national regulations on the phase out of ozone depleting substances. Our operations involve the use of R24 and R-134a, primarily for chilling and air conditioning. Due care is taken through a stringent maintenance process to prevent unwanted leakages of these gases directly into the atmosphere. We have adopted several initiatives to account for GHG gases emanating from our operations. GAIL has taken a lead amongst public sector enterprises to define a target of reducing GHG emission intensity (total GHG emissions/ gross sales) by 33% till 2020 over the 201011 baseline. We are currently mapping our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and part of Scope 3 emissions related to employee commuting and business travel. During the year, scope 1 emissions increased to 2.75 million tons of CO2e, while Scope 2 emissions increased to 0.26 million tons of CO2e in comparison to the previous year. Our move towards a lower carbon growth in the future will be driven through a number of target initiatives such as process optimization, 62 energy audits, adoption of ISO 14064 GHG management systems, tapping opportunities for alternate use of CO2 emission directly released in atmosphere, afforestation and use of modern IT infrastructure. Some of the initiatives adopted in the year to reduce GHG emissions include: ±± At Gandhar, liquid hydrocarbon vapours were recovered by the installation of vapor recovery compressors that helped to reduce 202 MT of CO2 emissions. ±± At Vaghodia, the fire protection system for the LPG control room was replaced from Halon 1301 to NovecTM 1230.The phased out fire suppressant material (Halon) had ozone depleting potential and global warming potential of 10 and 6,900 respectively. In comparison, the new fire suppressant material, NovecTM 1230, has ozone depleting potential and global warming potential of 0 and <1 respectively. ±± Setting up of heat recovery steam generation to recover waste heat of gas turbine compressor at Vaghodia. It was estimated that a saving of 80,589 tonnes of CO2e would be achieved if the same energy is assumed to be produced by natural gas for steam generation. The project will produce 60 MT/Hr of super heated steam equivalent to 44,635 MWH/annum of energy. CASE Fugitive Methane Emission Measurement Initiatives under the Global Methane STUDY Initiative of US EPA GAIL has initiated the identification and implementation of methane emissions reduction through a pilot project at Vijaipur. The project will help us reduce the GHG footprint of the operations through reduction in GHG emissions, minimize product loses and improve overall operational efficiency and safety. Going forward the initiative will be scaled up to involve the following major milestones: ±± Adoption of low emission technologies like vapour recovery systems, ±± Low emission packing/ seals in compressors, pumps and valves. ±± Flare gas reduction and utilization as PNG/ CNG ±± Adoption of technology for identification of fugitive emissions like Infrared/ Thermal imaging and Leak detection systems Under our SD Aspiration 2020, we have committed to reduce our GHG emission intensity (Scope-I & Scope-II) by 33% in comparison to 2010 baseline. The overall GHG emission intensity is presented in the table below: FY 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 63 GHG Intensity (tCO2 e / Crore) 109.4 86.7 73.6 Customers: addressing customer needs Addressing customer needs is a non-negotiable activity.

A CNG station running on landfill gas will be the first of its kind in the world. Not only will the project generate a cleaner fuel but it will help combat global warming by significantly capturing methane which would have otherwise been released into the atmosphere. This project has been appreciated by the Platts Global Energy Awards Committee for commitment towards harnessing all sources of energy. CASE Conversion of waste plastics into fuel STUDY We have conducted bench scale tests to assess the potential of converting waste plastic into fuel, and these tests have given encouraging results. We plan to conduct the pilot scale studies in the next phase. R&D efforts are underway to develop new polymer grades to better suit customer requirements 68 CASE SAY YES TO PLASTIC, SAY NO TO ITS MISUSE!! STUDY Plastic have played an important role in the transforming the quality of human life, impacting activities ranging from clothing to shelter, transportation to communication and entertainment to health care. On account of properties, such as lightweight, high strength and ease of processing, plastics meet a large share of the materials needs of manat a comparatively lesser cost and causing lesser environmental implications, if managed appropriately across life cycle. Plastics are employed in myriad applications where they actually conserve natural resources. About 40-45 percent of plastic is used in plastic packaging alone. For example, aseptic packaging of food in barrier packaging films save refrigeration cost and thereby capital and energy. If we compare plastic packaging with paper – one ton of plastic packaging saves 8-10 trees, generates 60 percent less green-house emission and consumes 40 percent less energy. Edible oils and milk packaged in flexible packages eliminate the use of energy-intensive tin and glass containers. Use of plastic bags has reduced the weight of a milk bottle from 450 gms to 2.5 gms. Rigid HDPE barrels used for bulk chemical storage eliminate resource-intensive and expensive steel drums. Apart from conserving natural resources, use of plastics in such applications saves transportation fuel as plastics are substantially lighter than tin, glass or steel. From advanced polymeric membranes to PET bottles, plastics also play an important role in producing and storing potable water in a safe and cost-effective manner. About 400 plastic chairs replacing that of wood means saving 8-10 trees, while plastic pipes in agriculture increases crop yield by 20-40 percent. You can also visit http://gail. nic.in/final_site/Plastics_for_you.html for more information. The fact that plastics are made from hydrocarbons derived from petroleum has raised questions concerning its sustainability. However, the real issue is with waste management. Regulating littering habit, repeating use of plastic waste, facilitating door to door collection, installing waste collection boxes and encouraging alternate disposal methods like energy recovery and reuse will help to considerably reduce the negative impact of plastics in the environment. Further, the eco-friendliness of plastics becomes apparent when the total “life cycle” is evaluated against an analysis of raw materials, energy, effluents, and methods of disposal of a material from its origin to its final disposal.

SCOPE OF ASSURANCE EVI has been engaged to provide Type 2 Moderate level of assurance as set out in AA1000AS (2008). The scope of the assurance includes the following: 1. Evaluate the adherence to the AA1000APS (2008) principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness and the principles of Global Reporting Initiative G3.1 Guidelines (Oil & Gas Sector Supplement). 2. Evaluation of the reliability of specified sustainability performance information for the period April 2011 to March 2012. OUR APPROACH The assurance process was planned and carried out in December 2012 – January 2013. Our conclusions are based on a review of processes & practices for identification and collation of relevant information, report content and performance data, which included a review of the stakeholder engagement and materiality determination process followed by GAIL. Relevant documentation, our observations with respect to process and systems in place and interaction with respective departments engaging with different stakeholders have formed the basis of our assurance on the principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness required for assurance under AA1000AS (2008). We undertook the following key steps: 1. Site Visits: The EVI team visited a representative set of GAIL’s facilities comprising of four gas processing plants (Pata, Vijaipur, Vaghodia, Gandhar), one petrochemical plant (Pata), two gas compressor stations (Vaghodia, Vijaipur) and one LPG pumping station (Mansarampura) to evaluate the source of data as well and interview data owners. We also made visits to the Corporate Head Quarters in New Delhi. 2. Interviews: In addition to interviewing data owners at the sites we visited, we also interviewed a representative set of people from the senior management to understand the process of stakeholder engagement and materiality determination at GAIL. Processes and systems for engagement with selected stakeholders were reviewed. We also interviewed sample stakeholders on-site to cross-check the robustness of GAIL’s stakeholder engagement process. 3. Data Accuracy Checks: The information disclosed under different indicators in the report was verified by way of collection and corroborating it with the source of the information. We have relied on a sample of various documents and sources like internal SAP system, invoices, work orders, reports submitted to regulatory bodies, utility bills, inter departmental communication etc. as well as on-site inspection and observations. In certain places where we had to rely on company’s internal documentation we have tried cross verification from two different sources in order to minimize the chances of oversight. The verification of company’s financial performance or information provided in the economic section in the report was derived directly from the audited annual report publicly available on GAIL’s official website (www.gailonline.com). Emergent Ventures LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS 1. Scope of assurance is limited to the boundary defined in the report and the period of 1st April 2011 to 31st March 2012. 2. Assurance is subject to no physical verification of things like inventory of material consumed, waste generated, emissions and effluents etc. Assurance relied on the documentation maintained by the company or provided to the company by another third party. 3. The scope of assurance does not cover the statements in the report that describe companies approach, strategy, aim, expectation, aspiration or beliefs or intentions. Emergent Ventures India Pvt.

GAIL has built processes that allow them to identify the material aspects for the company, collect performance data for majority of its facilities and report the information in adherence to the principles of GRI G3.1 guidelines (Oil & Gas Sector Supplement). Our observation on the adherence of the three principles under AA1000APS (2008) is as follows: Inclusivity: We have not come across any material evidence that would lead us to conclude that GAIL has not applied the principle of inclusivity in engaging with its stakeholders. Different departments engage regularly with their relevant stakeholders through multiple engagement channels. However, GAIL needs to continue to build the capacity of its stakeholders on sustainability topics to improve the outcomes of their engagement. Materiality: GAIL has followed a structured process of materiality determination. The company has incorporated viewpoints of external stakeholders in this year’s report. Based on our scope of work and the activities undertaken for the purpose like site visits, interactions and observations, we have not come across any material aspect of sustainability performance that has been excluded from the report. Responsiveness: Based on our observation, interviews and documentation we believe that GAIL has applied the principle of responsiveness with respect to its stakeholders. The work is delegated to appropriate departments who engage, collect views and identify material issues of respective stakeholders and then devise action plans to address those issues. We have not come across any material evidence that would lead us to believe that responsiveness principle is not being applied in dealing with the stakeholders. However, as management on sustainability within the organization matures, it is recommended that depth of response increases and progress highlighted in successive reports. GRI G3.1 Guidelines (Oil & Gas Sector Supplement) Based on the information in the report and the independent assurance sought from us we have found that the company meets the requirement of A+ level of reporting as specified by GRI G3.1 guidelines. Observations and Recommendations Without affecting our overall conclusions on the sustainability report, we would like to bring to notice the following observations and recommendations for the report:  GAIL has expanded its stakeholder engagement process. As GAIL matures its sustainability initiatives a greater cross-section of external stakeholder viewpoints need to be incorporated into the report.  GAIL should further strengthen system(s) for data capturing and managing information. Attention needs to be given to the social performance indicators to increase reliability of reported information. For Emergent Ventures India Private Ltd.

We took several critical decisions that will give our sustainability initiatives a definitive direction. We created several governance procedures to strengthen top management involvement in GAIL’s sustainability agenda and improve implementation and monitoring of our sustainability initiatives. A Board level Subcommittee headed by an Independent Director was created for propagating our sustainability agenda, along with a steering committee headed by Director (BD). To provide a direction and streamline our sustainability initiatives, we also developed a comprehensive sustainability policy. These initiatives cover a wide spectrum of issues related to water conservation, GHG accounting, energy efficiency, watershed management, biodiversity management and renewable energy. We have rolled out our SD Aspirations 2020, where we will provide maximum thrust and achieve well-defined tangible targets on aspects of GHG emissions reduction, energy efficiency, water management and awareness on sustainability. In May 2011, to demonstrate our commitment to sustainability, GAIL became a signatory to United Nations Global Compact. These are some of the critical steps that will be the foundation of our efforts to create a better future for us and the generations to come. We continue to implement innovative projects under the CSR and SD guidelines of the DPE and as a part of our MoU with the MoP&NG. As a part of our Strategy 2020, we have ventured beyond the realms of standard business operations to give a special thrust on promoting renewable energy. Going forward, we will concentrate on further developing aspects of awareness, stakeholder engagement and materiality, strategy and governance at GAIL. We plan to continue with our SD workshops across locations in order to increase the awareness of our employees including Senior Management, customers and suppliers on elements of sustainability. We will be further refining the process of our engagement with stakeholders and streamline the process across locations. This will also help us to completely integrate the materiality assessment process with stakeholder engagement. Achievement of SD Aspirations 2020 will be one of the major areas and eventually we plan to incorporate these aspirations in our Strategy 2020. This move will help us to streamline sustainability at GAIL and also give us a distinct competitive advantage in the market. We are also in the process of creating a senior level multi-disciplinary committee headed by OICs at sites to spearhead the sustainability initiatives at sites and shall also be responsible for authentication and certification of data and information submitted by sites. In the coming year, we plan to benchmark our sustainability performance against our national and international peers. We continue to conduct needs assessment of local communities and also determine the impact of our community development initiatives with the help of TISS. This assessment will play an important role in defining our CSR budgets and initiatives. We also continue to pursue our association with MoP&NG, DGH, PNGRB, OISD, FICCI, CII, TERI, ASSOCHAM, International Gas Union, etc. on various business and sustainability issues in the oil and gas sector. As signatory to the UNGC, we will also communicate our progress on the initiatives adopted under the 10 principles. If you would like to share with us your constructive feedback on how GAIL can shape the future towards betterment of all, queries can be directed to: Mr. Santanu Roy, General Manager (Corporate Planning) at sroy@gail.co.in 115 Mr. Kamal Kishore Chatiwal, Dy.
