Thus, the year 2012 was very challenging for A ­ scom. However, we succeeded in achieving our a ­ mbitious targets, and are pleased to report solid r­ esults for fiscal year 2012. Wireless Solutions increased its already high profitability and was able to further strengthen its leading market position. ­Network Testing achieved a successful turnaround during the second half of 2012. In addition, Ascom concluded successfully the divestment process of t­ he core business units of the former Security Communication Division in July 2012. Given a substantial improvement during the second half-year, Ascom Group generated revenue in a total amount of CHF 449.8 million, representing a growth rate of 2.8%, and closed the full-year 2012 with an EBITDA margin of 10.2%, taking into account a weak first half-year (EBITDA margin of 5.0%). At CHF­­ 20.9 million, Group profit was in line with the previous year. The Board of Directors is confident about the future development of Ascom and will propose­ to the shareholders an increased dividend (in form of a tax free distribution of capital contribution reserves) of CHF 0.35 per share. Ascom Wireless Solutions – strong market position further expanded In 2012, Wireless Solutions has set itself the targets to gain additional market share and to strengthen its leadership position in the healthcare segment. These targets were well achieved and Wireless Solutions showed again an excellent performance in 2012. The division grew organically and through successful acquisitions, it further improved its already high profitability and was able to gain additional market share. Today, Wireless Solutions is – at par with Siemens – the world’s largest manufacturer of professional cordless phones. In addition, with the successful acquisition of the GE Nurse Call business in June 2012, the division has also become one of the biggest nurse call providers worldwide, with strong direct presence in the US and in Europe. The division markets its offerings in three sales channels. During the year under review, the direct sales channel showed good growth particularly in the UK and in the US, and sales with OEM partners performed well.

This goal was reached, and Network Testing achieved a successful turnaround in the second half-year. Restructuring measures were quickly implemented in response to difficult market conditions caused by weak demand from telecom operators. Measures taken to reduce t­ he cost base by CHF 20 million were completely implemented by the end of the year. Network Testing successfully implemented a significant initiative that consisted of three parts: reorganization, re­struc­turing and growth investments. In addition, three experienced international managers have ­been appointed with a view to strengthening the division’s management. Today, Network Testing has a stronger and more focused organizational structure, with its ­three regional business areas, Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, and its three global product units Test ­ & Measurement, Benchmarking & Monitoring, and Reporting & Analysis. In addition, substantial cost reductions have been made as well as growth investments. The full benefit of these cost savings will materialize in 2013. As a result of the restructuring, Network Testing would have reached an EBITDA margin of 14.3% on a pro-forma basis (excluding restructuring expenses and including the full an­nualized cost savings), in 2012. Based on positive effects of the reorganization and supported by a market recovery, in particular in the US, revenue increased substantially in the second half of 2012, compared to the first six months of the year. Divestment of Security Communication – successfully concluded On 31 July 2012, Ascom successfully concluded the divestment process of the core business units of the former Security Communication Division. In the course of the first seven months of 2012, Ascom transferred Defense, Infrastructure Operators, Ascom Austria and the Civil Security business to new owners. The entire divestment process was executed in less than 12 months with a positive impact on the income statement. The interests of customers and employees alike were served preferentially by all transactions. Strategic focus – two globally oriented divisions in Mission-Critical Communication Ascom focuses on its two ­globally oriented divisions, Wireless Solutions and Network Testing. Both divisions are strongly innovation-driven global businesses, with demand stemming from strong underlying megatrends such as the aging population and the data explosion in mobile networks. ­Wireless Solutions has the vision to become the global leader in Mission-Critical Communication in the healthcare segment. With its leading market position, most comprehensive product portfolio and excellent knowledge of c­ ustomer needs, the division is best positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in its addressed markets. Network Testing has the vision and the ambition to become the mobile industry’s independent authority for validating network performance. With its market leadership ­position, its new organizational structure and a significantly reduced divisional cost basis, the division is well prepared for profitable growth in the future. 4 ASCom Annual Report 2012 Letter to Shareholders Key figures Wireless Solutions Key figures Network Testing CHFm 2012 2011 CHFm 2012 2011 Incoming orders 296.1 284.1 Incoming orders 118.6 145.3 Revenue 297.7 276.6 Revenue 130.4 138.9 EBITDA 48.1 41.5 EBITDA (4.6)* 3.4 Number of employees (FTE) 1,247 1,198 Number of employees (FTE) 507 571 * Including restructuring expenses of CHF 11.6 million. Strong second half-year 2012 The economic environment as well as market conditions were challenging in the year under ­review. Ascom has responded rapidly to the significant changes in the business environment and h ­ as taken necessary restructuring measures. As a consequence, Ascom experienced a strong improvement in the results during the second half-year of 2012. Ascom recorded an increase in revenue of about 11% in the second half of 2012 compared to the first six months. For the full-year 2012, Ascom generated revenue of CHF 449.8 million (2011: CHF 437.5 million), representing a growth rate of 2.8%. Ascom closed the second half-year 2012 with an EBITDA margin of around 15%. For the full-year 2012, the EBITDA margin was at 10.2%, taking into account a weak first half-year (EBITDA margin of 5.0%). However, profitability was burdened with restructuring expenses of CHF 11.6 million in 2012. Excluding these expenses, Group EBITDA margin would have been at 12.8%. Despite a difficult economic environment, we continue to substantially invest in R&D to maintain and further expand our technology market leadership. The expenses for R&D in 2012 amounted to­ CHF 49.9 million corresponding to a portion of revenue of 11.1% what is clearly above market level. Only an amount of CHF 0.7 million out of the R&D costs has been capitalized. Ascom Wireless Solutions achieves an EBITDA margin of 16.2% Wireless Solutions contributed about two thirds to total Group revenue and recorded an increase in sales of 7.6% year-on-year, including positive effects of about 5 percentage points through the­ GE Nurse Call business and Miratel acquisitions. For the full-year 2012, Wireless Solutions generated revenue of ­CHF 297.7 million (2011: CHF 276.6 million). In terms of profitability, Wireless Solutions further improved its margins and achieved excellent results. For fiscal year 2012, Wireless Solutions recorded an EBITDA of CHF 48.1 million (2011: CHF 41.5 million) and a higher EBITDA margin of 16.2% compared to the previous year (2011: 15.0%). For the second half-year, the division even posted an EBITDA margin of around 17%. Ascom Network Testing shows good second half-year Network Testing achieved a successful turnaround during the second half-year due to quickly implemented restructuring measures and first signs of improved market conditions. For the second half-year, the division recorded substantial increase in both, revenue and incoming orders compared to the first six months of 2012. Revenue grew by about 15% compared to the first six months of 2012 totaling CHF 130.4 million for the full-year (2011: CHF 138.9 million). Due to the successful restructuring, Network Testing showed a significant improvement in ­profitability in the second half-year with an EBITDA margin before restructuring expenses of 14.4% (10.3% including restructuring expenses). For the full-year, the division achieved an EBITDA of CHF 7.0 million before restructuring expenses, representing an EBITDA margin of 5.4% (2011: 2.4%). Including these expenses, a loss of CHF 4.6 million was reported at EBITDA level. Restructuring measures implemented and executed during fiscal year 2012 reduced the overall divisional cost base by around CHF 20 million. The full benefit of the cost savings will materialize in 2013. ASCom Annual Report 2012 Letter to Shareholders 5 Group profit in line with the previous year Group profit increased substantially in the second half to end the year 2012 at CHF 20.9 million, which is in line with the previous year (H1/2012: CHF 2.6 million; full-year 2011: CHF 23.1 million). As of 31 December 2012, the Ascom Group recorded cash and cash equivalents of CHF 63.1 million (2011: CHF 73.3 million), and a strong equity ratio of 43.1% (2011: 40.2%). Dividend payment – Board of Directors will propose higher dividend payment The Board of Directors is confident about the future development of the Ascom Group and thus will propose to the 2013 Annual General Meeting a dividend payment (in form of a tax free distri­bution of capital contribution reserves) of CHF 0.35 per share, corresponding to an increase of 40% year-onyear and to a payout ratio of 60.3% (2011: 39.0%). EBITDA margin target for 2013 increased to 15–16% The economic environment will remain challenging in 2013, although there are some promising sights of a market recovery. With the successful turnaround of the Network Testing Division during the second half of 2012, and taking into account that Wireless Solutions has achieved an EBITDA ­margin of 16% already in 2012, we are convinced that Ascom may even exceed its communicated targets. Therefore, we plan to reach an EBITDA margin of 15–16% at Group level in 2013 while achieving growth of 5%. In addition, we have set ourselves the goal of achieving average growth of 5–10% in 2014 and 2015. At a Group level, Ascom is aiming for an EBITDA margin of 17–18% in 2015. A word of thanks In 2012, we achieved our ambitious goals, which reflect the dedication and great efforts by our employees. On behalf of the entire Board of Directors and the Executive Board, we would like to take the opportunity to thank all our employees for their hard work. We also extend a special thanks to all our customers for their confidence in our products, solutions and services. And, our thanks also go to you, our valued shareholders, for your trust and interest in Ascom. Both divisions, Wireless Solutions and Network Testing, are well positioned to capitalize on their leading position in their addressed markets. We have established the necessary requirements for achieving our profitability targets that we have set for 2013.

ASCom Annual Report 2012 Corporate governance 29 Risk management As an internationally active group, Ascom is exposed to a variety of risks arising from its operating business. Risk management is therefore an integral part of Group management and hence also part of the business processes. Financial risks (liquidity, foreign currency, interest rate, credit risks) are centrally monitored by Group Treasury in accordance with written guidelines. Capital risk is also monitored using defined ranges for the debt ratio and the equity ratio. Further information on risk management can be found in note 26 to the financial statements of the Ascom Group on page 91 of this Annual Report. Internal Control System (ICS) A Board directive of 11 December 2008 and the ICS manual govern the Internal Control System (ICS). The ICS ensures the implementation of appropriate procedures and measures for the purpose of identifying and monitoring the main financial risks to which the company is exposed. In particular, the aim of the ICS is to ensure the integrity and completeness of accounting, to provide timely and reliable financial reporting, and to prevent, minimize and identify errors and irregularities in the financial statements. In order to achieve these targets, Group companies in scope are determined annually. Hereby, it is ensured that at least 80% of the revenue and of total assets of the Group are covered. The external audit confirms the existence of the ICS in connection with the year-end audit. Additionally, external audit submits improvement suggestions on a yearly basis which are implemented in the following year. 30 ASCom Annual Report 2012 Corporate governance MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD fritz mumenthaler chief executive officer martin zwyssig chief financial officer Fritz Mumenthaler Dr Martin Zwyssig chief executive officer Chief Financial OfFIcer Nationality: Swiss | Born 1958 Nationality: Swiss | Born 1965 > 1985 Master of Economics (major) & Law (minor) from the > 1992 MBA from the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland (lic. oec.

Share premium The share premium represents the excess of the issued share capital’s fair value over its nominal value. Other capital reserves For equity-settled employee share-based payment transactions, IFRS requires entities to recognize an increase in equity when services are received. The Group has chosen to recognize an expense with a related credit in other capital reserves. The Group provides own shares to employees exercising stock options and elected to recognize the excess or shortfall of cash received over the acquisition cost of those own shares in other capital reserves. Currency translation adjustment Shareholders’ equity of Group companies with financial statements in foreign currency is carried at historical exchange rates. The resulting foreign exchange differences are recognized directly in shareholders’ equity under currency translation adjustments until the disposal of the foreign operation.

General information Ascom is an international solution provider with comprehensive technological know-how in Mission-Critical Communication. The company focuses on the areas of Wireless Solutions (high-value, wireless and customer-specific on-site communication solutions) and Network Testing (a global leader in mobile network testing, monitoring and post-processing solutions). Ascom Holding Ltd., the parent company of the Group, is a public limited company and is domiciled in Berne (Switzerland). Ascom registered shares (symbol ASCN) are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich (Switzerland). 2. Summary of the general Group accounting policies 2.1 Basis of preparation The functional and presentation currency of Ascom Holding Ltd. is Swiss francs (CHF). Ascom’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the individual financial statement of each Group company. These are based on historical costs except for the revaluation of certain financial assets at fair value, and are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) including the standards and interpretation guidelines issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as well as the valuation and accounting policies described below. These policies have been consistently applied. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in note 2.25. The closing date for the Group and the individual Group companies is 31 December. 2.2 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures a) The following new standards and amendments to existing standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2012: IFRS 1 (amendment) – “Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time Adopters”, IFRS 7 (amendment) – “Disclosures: Transfers of Financial Assets”, as well as IAS 12 (amendment) – “Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets”. These standards have no effect on the consolidated balance sheet or statement of comprehensive income of Ascom Group, as they are either mostly disclosure regulations or of little significance to Ascom Group. Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 51 b) The following standards and amendments to existing standards have been published but are not yet effective. The Group has not early adopted them.

IAS 19 – “Employee Benefits” was amended in June 2011. Ascom adopts the amended IAS 19 standard in the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2013 with the following major effects on the consolidated financial statements 2012: ■■ At 31 December 2012, shareholders’ equity would be lower by CHF 57.0 million (previous year: CHF 61.1 million) after consideration of deferred income tax. ■■ Net defined benefit liability recognized in the balance sheet would be higher by CHF 75.7 million (previous year: CHF 81.6 million). ■■ Deferred income tax assets (before offsetting) would be higher by CHF 18.7 million (previous year: CHF 20.5 million). ■■ Total comprehensive income of the period would be higher by CHF 4.1 million. The effects on the consolidated financial statements are mainly based on the following amendments of IAS 19: ■■ Elimination of the corridor approach and recognition of all actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income as they occur. At 31 December 2012, the Group’s unrecognized actuarial losses amount to CHF 75.8 million (previous year: CHF 85.7 million). ■■ Immediate recognition of all past service costs. ■■ Net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset (funded status) replaces interest cost and expected return on plan assets. 52 Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2.3 Consolidation The consolidated financial statements cover Ascom Holding Ltd. and all companies over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Profits or losses from disposal of subsidiaries are recorded in profit or loss. The list of the consolidated Group companies is included in note 33. Percentages of the Group’s interest in share capital correspond to percentages in voting rights held. Group companies are included in the consolidated financial statements in their entirety. The Group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 2.4 Foreign currency translation The consolidated financial statements are presented in Swiss francs (CHF), which is the Group’s presentation currency. All assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into the Group’s presentation currency at the exchange rates prevailing on 31 December. Income, expenses and cash flows of foreign entities are translated at average exchange rates for the year where this is considered an appropriate approximation of the applicable period rates. Exchange differences arising from the reconversion of the net investment in subsidiaries in foreign functional currencies are recorded as currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive income. Also taken to other comprehensive income are differences from the retrans­lation of borrowings that hedge such investments in foreign Group companies. Upon disposal of a foreign operation, accumulated currency translation adjustments are recognized in profit or loss. Foreign currency translation CHF ISO code Unit 31.12. Average 31.12. Average 2012 2012 2011 2011 Euro EUR 1 1.207 1.205 1.216 1.232 Pound sterling GBP 1 1.479 1.482 1.455 1.416 Swedish krona SEK 1 0.141 0.139 0.136 0.137 US dollar USD 1 0.915 0.933 0.940 0.886 Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the rate prevailing on the acquisition date. Transactions in foreign currencies are accounted for at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 53 date. Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the conversion of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit or loss. Such balances are converted into the functional currency of the foreign entity at the exchange rates prevailing on 31 December. 2.5 Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allo­ cating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). 2.6 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at purchase or manufacturing cost (i.e. historical cost) less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the items acquired. Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group holds the risks and rewards incident to ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property or the present value of the lease payments (see note 2.19). Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the lease period or, if shorter, the useful life of the asset. Land is valued at cost and is not depreciated. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life as shown in the following table: Useful life in years Buildings 20–40 Installations and transport systems 7–10 Production equipment, measuring and test equipment, IT hardware, furniture 3–5 Tools and demo equipment 3 The assets’ residual value and useful life are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the balance sheet date. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred. Items of property, plant and equipment are eliminated from the balance sheet from their date of disposal. All gains or losses arising from the disposal of such items are included in profit or loss. Where the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is higher than the recoverable amount, these assets are impaired to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 54 Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2.7 Intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization. The amortization charge is calculated on a straight-line basis over the period of its estimated useful ­economic life as shown in the following table: Useful life in years Licenses 3–5 Customer relations 10 Technology 7 Trademarks 5 Internally generated development costs 3 Other 2–5 Purchased goodwill (the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquisition-date fair value of the acquired equity interests) is recorded as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life that is tested for impairment at least once a year. For the purposes of testing for impairment, the goodwill is allocated to the corresponding cash-generating units. Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 2.8 Research and development costs All research costs are charged immediately to profit or loss. Costs incurred on development projects (relating to the design and testing of new or improved products) are recognized as intangible assets when the following criteria are fulfilled: ■■ It is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale. ■■ Management intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it. ■■ There is an ability to use or sell the intangible asset. ■■ It can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. ■■ Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset are available. ■■ The expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably. The capitalized assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective product. Development costs that cannot be capitalized are charged to profit or loss in the period in which they occur. Property, plant and equipment used for research and development activities are capitalized in the same way as property, plant and equipment, and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful life. 2.9 Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets are classified as “Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss”, “Loans and receivables” or “Financial assets available for sale”. Financial liabilities are classified as “Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” or “Other financial liabilities at amortized cost”. Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 55 a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are either held for trading purposes or designated as such. Financial assets held for trading are purchased with the intention of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in the price. Derivative financial instruments with positive replacement value are classified as at fair value through profit or loss. b) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. c) Financial assets available for sale Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial instruments that are either allocated to this category or do not belong to any other category. d) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are either held for trading purposes or designated as such. Derivative financial instruments with a negative replacement value are assigned to the category at fair value through profit or loss. e) Other financial liabilities at amortized cost Other financial liabilities measured at amortized cost particularly include trade payables, borrowings and other liabilities. All financial assets are recorded initially at fair value including transaction costs, except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, for which such costs are immediately expensed. All purchases and sales are recognized on the trade date, i.e. on the day an agreement has been entered. After initial recognition, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are charged to financial income or expenses in the appropriate reporting period. No hedge accounting is applied. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Following initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are recognized at fair value and changes in value are charged to other comprehensive income. Whenever there are indications of a possible impairment, the carrying amount of financial assets that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss are tested for objective substantial indications of impairment to identify concrete need for value reduction. Serious financial difficulties, insolvency proceedings of the debtor or financial reorganization, and default or delinquency in payments (more than 90 days overdue) are considered indicators that the financial asset is impaired. For available-for-sale assets, material or sustained price reductions are indicators of potential impairment. Price reductions of 20% or more are considered material. Sustained price reductions are price reductions that last for at least six months. If there is objective evidence that such a financial asset is impaired, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognized in profit or loss – is removed from equity and recognized in profit or loss. Received dividends on available-for-sale financial assets are recognized in profit or loss as part of financial income. 56 Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Financial assets are derecognized when Ascom gives up its control over them, i.e. when the rights associated with them are sold or expired. At their initial recognition and subsequently, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value. The transaction costs directly identifiable to the purchase of these liabilities are immediately expensed. Valuation of the non-current portion of financial liabilities measured at amortized cost is subsequently carried out at amortized cost value using the effective-interest method. In addition to actual interest payments, financial expenses include annual compound interests and pro rata transaction costs. 2.10 Inventories and work in progress Inventories are stated at the lower of purchase costs/manufacturing costs or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Manufacturing costs include direct material and production costs as well as material and production overheads. The costs are determined using the weighted average method. Value adjustments are made for obsolete and slow-moving items. Construction contracts are recognized according to the stage of completion of the contract (percentage-of-completion method), and the respective effect is recognized in profit or loss. Provisions are made to cover all anticipated losses, as soon as these are identified. 2.11 Trade receivables Trade receivables are carried at the invoiced amount less provision for doubtful debts. A provision for doubtful debts is recognized when it becomes obvious that the originally invoiced amount is not fully realizable. The amount of the provision is determined by reference to the originally invoiced amount less the amount of the expected realization. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a provision account and the loss is recorded in marketing and distribution expenses. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the provision account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against marketing and distribution expenses. 2.12 Other current assets Prepayments and accrued income are stated at nominal value. 2.13 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash, which is restricted for at least 12 months, is recognized as a financial asset. 2.14 Equity Registered shares are classified as equity. Own shares and options to acquire own shares as well as realized gains or losses from disposals and costs relating to capital increases and decreases are recorded in equity. Dividends are charged to equity in the period in which they are approved. Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 57 2.15 Borrowings Liabilities are stated as being current if they are settled within 12 months or if there is no unconditional right to extend the settlement to at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Initial recognition is at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Valuation is subsequently carried out at amortized cost value using the effective-interest method. 2.16 Employee benefit obligations Various employee benefit plans exist within the Group, which are individually tailored to suit the local conditions in their respective countries. For defined contribution plans, the costs to be recognized for the reporting period are the agreed contributions of the employer. In the case of defined benefit plans, the costs to be recognized for the reporting period are determined by external actuaries using the projected-unit-credit method. The liabilities are backed by assets which are managed separately from the assets of the Group by autonomous employee benefit funds (funded employee benefit plans). By contrast, plans that do not have their own assets (unfunded employee benefit plans) are backed by a corresponding employee benefit obligation in the balance sheet. For defined benefit plans with separate funds, the defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled, together with adjustments for unrecognized past service costs. The amount recognized takes into account any unrecognized actuarial gains or losses or outstanding rights. Any assets resulting from surpluses in defined benefit plans are limited to the value of the maximum future savings from reduced contributions. Liabilities are fully provisioned. Actuarial gains and losses result mainly from changes in actuarial assumptions, or from differences between actuarial assumptions and effective values. Actuarial adjustments that exceed the so-called corridor of 10% are debited or credited to profit or loss over the average remaining working life of the insured employees (provided that the criteria for capitalization are fulfilled). The effects of amendments to plans are recognized until the benefits become available to the employees. Other employee benefits (e.g. service anniversary awards) are valued by the method described above and recognized in the balance sheet under employee benefit obligations, with any actuarial gains being recognized immediately. 2.17 Provisions Provisions are made when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If an outflow of resources to settle an obligation is not probable, a contingent liability is disclosed. Provisions for product warranties are made to the extent of the outflow of resources that can be expected to meet the obligation in full. For costs that are expected to arise in connection with plant closures, the disposal of companies or business units and restructuring, provisions are made at the time of the approval and announcement of the planned measures. For onerous contracts, provisions are provided if the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation exceed the economic benefit to be received. 58 Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2.18 Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. a) Sales of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods. Revenue is recorded based on the price specified in the sales contracts, net of the estimated volume discounts, sales tax or valueadded tax as well as credit notes for goods returned. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts and returns. b) Rendering of services Revenue from fixed-price contracts for delivering of services is generally recognized in the period the services are provided, using a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Such revenue could also be recognized based on the services performed to date as a percentage of the total services to be performed. If the selling price of a product includes an identifiable amount for subsequent servicing (multi-element transactions), that amount is deferred and recognized as revenue over the period during which the service is performed. c) Construction contracts Revenue from construction contracts is determined based on the stage of completion using the percentage-of-completion method (PoC) if the stage of completion and expected outcome can be measured reliably. The respective calculation is based either on the costs incurred compared to the total costs to complete or the units completed compared to the total number of contracted units. If circumstances arise that may change the original estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion, estimates are revised. These revisions may result in increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs and are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known to the management. If it is probable that the contract costs will exceed the economic benefit, the potential loss is recognized in profit or loss regardless of the project progress. 2.19 Leases A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee in return for a payment, or series of payments, the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time. a) Lessee accounting Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred from the lessor to the lessee are classified as finance leases. The leased assets are carried at cost not higher than the minimal lease payments and depreciated along with other property, plant and equipment (see note 2.6). The corresponding leasing obligations are shown as liabilities. Per period leasing installments are distributed accordingly as either capital repayments or interest expenses. Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 59 b) Lessor accounting When assets are leased out under a finance lease, the present value of the net minimum lease payments is recognized as a receivable under financial assets. The difference between the gross receivable (gross investment in leases) and the present value of the net minimum lease payments is recognized as unearned interest income. Each lease installment is allocated between the receivable and interest income. When assets are leased out under an operating lease, the asset is included in the balance sheet based on the nature of the asset. Operating lease income is recognized in profit or loss over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis. 2.20 Share-based payments Selected members of Ascom’s senior management receive remuneration in the form of sharebased payment transactions (stock option plans), whereby employees render services as consideration for such equity instruments (equity-settled options). Employees which are residents of the USA are granted share appreciation rights, which can only be settled in cash (cash-settled options). The costs of options are measured initially at fair value at the grant date using a binomial model, further details of which are given in note 19. For equity-settled options, this fair value is recognized over the vesting period under personnel expenses, together with a corresponding increase in other capital reserves in equity, adjusted to reflect actual versus expected levels of vesting. The dilutive effect of outstanding equity-settled options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share (see note 24). The fair value of cash-settled options is recognized under personnel expenses over the period until the vesting date with recognition of a corresponding liability included under other provisions. The liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognized as personnel expenses. 2.21 Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of the respective asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. 2.22 Income tax Income tax is recorded based on the period to which it properly relates. Deferred income tax is recorded in full using the liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities arise on temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for Group purposes and their related tax values. These temporary differences arise mainly from depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, revaluation of certain non-current assets, employee benefit obligations and tax loss carry-forwards, and, in the case of acquisitions, the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired and their tax base. The tax rates and laws enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date are used to determine deferred income tax. Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary deductible differences can be offset. Deferred income tax is recognized on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries. Exceptions are temporary differences for which the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 60 Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2.23 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as completed sale within one year from the date of classification. The assets must be available for immediate sale in their present condition. Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount at the date of their first recognition as held for sale and fair value less costs to sell. Such assets are no longer depreciated or amortized systematically. A possible impairment is included in profit or loss. A discontinued operation is a substantial component of the Group that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale. 2.24 Definition of non-GAAP measures Earnings before interest and income tax (EBIT) as a subtotal includes all operating income and expenses before addition/deduction of financial income and expenses and income tax. Earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as a subtotal includes earnings before interest and income tax (EBIT) before deduction of depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment as well as amortization and impairment of intangible fixed assets. 2.25 Main sources of uncertainty with regard to estimates Below we explain important forward-looking assumptions and other main sources of uncertainty with regard to estimates, which could result in significant value adjustments in respect of assets and liabilities carried on the balance sheet in the coming financial year. Intangible assets from acquisition are initially capitalized at their fair value due to a purchase price allocation at acquisition date. The fair value is determined using the respective methods as disclosed further in note 6. Future assessments of a potential impairment of such intangible assets is dependent on the achievement of the forecasted cash flows as used in the initial business plan. This ultimately also applies to the goodwill that is recognized, since the purchase price allocation normally consists mainly of the portfolio value and goodwill. Goodwill is regarded as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life that must be tested for impairment at least once a year. Determining the present value of goodwill requires an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated and the setting of an appropriate discount rate for calculation of the present value of these cash flows. The estimates of the cash flows are based on medium-term plans. The discount rate applied reflects the risk arising in connection with the respective business activities. Further information on goodwill can be found in note 6. Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 61 For defined benefit plans, the defined benefit obligation is determined using the projected-unitcredit method. Actuarial valuations of significant defined benefit plans are obtained annually. Actuarial assumptions are used in determining the cost of funded and unfunded employee benefit plans. These actuarial assumptions, such as discount rate, expected return on assets, future salary or pension increases and average life expectancy, are estimates and therefore sources of uncertainty (see note 14). Ascom management regularly monitors the net future outflow of economic benefits related to onerous lease contracts. In calculating the value of these provisions, net cash flows of forecasts with a time horizon to 2015 are used and the planned costs are amortized with market-related discount rates. Management continuously updates the provisions for the likelihood of finding tenants for vacant space in the foreseeable future. Further information on onerous contracts can be found in note 15. Restructuring provisions are created in connection with the discontinuation or reorganization of a line of business and the closure or relocation of business locations if there is a detailed formal plan and the implications are known and communicated. Significant judgment is required to determine the costs of restructuring plans (see note 15). In connection with recording revenue from construction contracts it is necessary to reliably determine the project progress and costs. The respective calculation is based either on the costs incurred compared to the total costs to complete or the units completed compared to the total number of contracted units. The contracts are analyzed and reassessed at least at each balance sheet date (see note 16). Ascom Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income tax. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. At the balance sheet date, there were non-capitalized tax loss carry-forwards (see note 22). As a result of future positive developments with regard to income, the possibility may arise that deferred income tax assets in connection with these tax loss carry-forwards will be capitalized at least in part. 62 Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 3. Significant transactions and operational changes Acquisition of technology-related business from Veelong Corp. At 3 January 2012, the Swiss company Ascom Network Testing Ltd. acquired all relevant assets relating to the analysis, post-processing and visualization of mobile network testing data of Veelong Corp. based in Fanwood, NJ (USA). Five key employees of Veelong, including the two founders, joined Ascom Network Testing Division. With this acquisition, Ascom secured the integration of Veelong technology into the strategic growth area of Reporting & Analysis and reduced its third-party dependencies. The purchase price consists of a fixed part of USD 5.6 million, and a performance-related variable part (contingent consideration) to be paid over the next three years. USD 4.3 million of the fixed part were due until 31 December 2012 (deferred consideration). Based on a discount rate of 6%, the fair value of this deferred consideration amounted to CHF 3.9 million at acquisition date. The unlimited contingent consideration arrangement requires the Group to pay in cash between 35% and 45% of the revenue realized in relation to the acquired technology in the years 2012 till 2014 as well as for a successful development of a specified technology until 2012. At acquisition date, the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of CHF 6.7 million is based on a discount rate of 6% and assumed annual revenues related with the acquired technology between USD 10.9 million and USD 13.7 million. CHFm Book value Fair value Fair value adjustments Intangible assets from acquisition – 11.8 11.8 Total assets – 11.8 11.8 Total purchase price 11.8 Offset by Cash 1.2 Deferred consideration (fully paid in the year under review) 3.9 Contingent consideration (thereof CHF 1.8 million were paid and CHF 1.2 million were released in 6.7 the period under review) At the date of acquisition, the Group owed to Veelong Corp. royalty fees of CHF 0.8 million in relation to revenues realized in the previous period. These CHF 0.8 million were recognized as other current liabilities at acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs of CHF 0.1 million were recorded in administration expenses of the previous reporting period. The acquisition of the technology-related assets of Veelong Corp. has no direct impact on revenue of the Group. Acquisition of GE Healthcare’s Nurse Call business At 18 June 2012, Ascom acquired all assets and assumed all liabilities pertaining to the Nurse Call business of GE Healthcare (the healthcare division of General Electric Company). GE Healthcare is one of the three leading vendors of nurse call solutions throughout North America. This acquisition gives Ascom access to the North American nurse call market and creates opportunities to combine GE nurse call systems with Ascom’s existing mobility offering. The acquired business has its main office in Bradenton, FL (USA), and became part of the Ascom Wireless Solutions Division. All 34 employees were taken over at their existing US locations. Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 63 The initial purchase price amounted to USD 19.4 million. In addition, Ascom agreed to an earn-out payment (contingent consideration) which is based on the revenue exceeding the business plan in the period of one year, beginning on 1 April 2012. The total potential amount of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under this contingent consideration arrangement is between nil and USD 6.0 million, whereas the fair value of the contingent consideration amounts to CHF 1.3 million, based on assumed revenue for the earn-out period.

The goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The gross contractual amount of the acquired trade receivables amounted to CHF 2.7 million of which CHF 0.3 million were not expected to be collectible. Therefore, these trade receivables were recorded with a fair value of CHF 2.4 million. Acquisition-related costs of CHF 0.5 million were recorded in administration expenses of the current reporting period. Since the acquisition date, the acquired business has generated revenue of CHF 9.6 million. Due to amortization of intangible assets from acquisition (CHF 0.4 million) and integration expenses the business has contributed a negative result of CHF 0.4 million to the Group’s performance. Based on GE Healthcare’s structure and information, the impact on revenue would have been CHF 18.2 million if the acquisition date of the business had taken place on the first day of the fiscal year. As the business was integrated into GE, an accurate derivation of the profit prior to the acquisition date is impracticable. 64 Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 4. Segment information Operating segments reflect the Group’s management structure and the way financial information is regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision-maker, which is defined as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).

These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the management covering a four-year period. Cash flows beyond the four-year period are extrapolated using a 0.6% growth rate. The discount rate applied is based on a risk-free 10-year bond adjusted for risk. The following assumptions based on experience are applied: 2012 2011 Revenue growth rate (CAGR) 1 – Wireless Solutions 6.1% 8.1% – Network Testing 4.0% 2.4% EBIT margin 1 – Wireless Solutions 13%–15% 11%–12% – Network Testing 4%–19% 0%–14% Pre-tax discount rate – Wireless Solutions 11.7% 10.4% – Network Testing 11.1% 10.2% 1 Based on approved four-year financial budgets, excluding foreign exchange impacts. Based on these calculations, there is no need for impairment. Regarding the sensitivity of changes to underlying assumptions used, Ascom Group showed that even a possible change in the pre-tax discount rate up to 16.5% (previous year: 14.0%) would still not result in an impairment of goodwill, neither in Wireless Solutions nor in Network Testing. Also a reduction in EBIT margin assumption of 8 percentage points (previous year: 5 percentage points) would not lead to an impairment of goodwill. Intangible assets from acquisition consist of customer relations of CHF 25.7 million (previous year: CHF 26.7 million), technology of CHF 26.6 million (previous year: CHF 17.7 million) and trademarks of CHF 2.7 million (previous year: CHF 3.5 million). Customer relations are capitalized using the excessearning method for valuation of the existing customers at acquisition date. Customer relations are amortized over their estimated useful life of 10 years, using the straight-line method. Technology and trademarks are capitalized using the royalty rate method for valuation. Technology is amortized over the estimated useful life of 7 years, trademarks are amortized over the estimated useful life of 5 years, using the straight-line method. In 2012, customer relations of CHF 2.2 million, technology of CHF 14.4 million and trademarks of CHF 0.6 million were capitalized due to the acquisition of the technologyrelated business from Veelong and GE Healthcare’s Nurse Call business. Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 69 Amortization of intangible assets from acquisition of CHF 11.3 million (previous year: CHF 9.4 million) shown as separate line item in the income statement exclusively contains amortization and impair­ment of intangible assets initially capitalized due to a purchase price allocation at acquisition date. Taking into account the function of expense method, this line item could be reassigned as follows: CHF 5.3 million (previous year: CHF 5.4 million) to marketing and distribution as well as CHF 6.0 million (previous year: CHF 4.0 million) to research and development. In the period under review, development costs in the amount of CHF 0.7 million (previous year: nil) were capitalized as intangible assets, and research and development expenses in the amount of CHF 49.9 million (previous year: CHF 45.9 million) were charged to profit or loss. Other intangible assets include mainly software. Following the decision to not fully implement an ERP system under development, an impairment of CHF 1.4 million was recognized in the period under review in profit or loss of the reportable segment Wireless Solutions to completely write off related elements. The following line items are affected by this impairment: cost of goods sold (CHF 0.8 million), marketing and distribution (CHF 0.2 million), research and development (CHF 0.4 million). A reassessment of the remaining expected life and expected future economic benefits to be generated for all other classes of intangible assets did not lead to an impairment charge during the period under review (previous year: nil). 7.

The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy. Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields at the balance sheet date. Expected returns on equity and property investments reflect long-term real rates of return in the respective markets. The expected employer contributions to defined benefit plans for the year ending 31 December 2013 are CHF 2.2 million.

A provision of CHF 12.4 million was initially recognized mainly covering costs related to termination of labor contracts across all functions and onerous license fee contracts. CHF 7.0 million were consumed and CHF 0.8 million released­ in 2012. The remaining cash outflows are expected to occur within one year. The total charge of CHF 11.6 million was assigned to the following line items of the income statement: CHF 5.7 million to cost of goods sold, CHF 2.3 million to marketing and distribution, CHF 2.1 million to research and development as well as CHF 1.5 million to administration. In 2011, Ascom recognized provisions for restructuring its former Security Communications ­Division. In the current period, additional CHF 0.3 million were added and CHF 1.7 million paid out. ­Remaining provisions are expected to be used within five years. Remaining payments of CHF 0.2 million and releases of CHF 0.1 million are in connection with restructuring events recognized before 2010. 78 Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Provisions for onerous contracts mainly include onerous lease contracts for a number of leased properties that are partially vacant with a time horizon to 2015. Ascom does not use the vacant space and the Group experiences difficulties to sublet the premises. The value of the provisions is based on net cash flows using forecasts and by discounting the costs with a market-related discount rate of 6.0% (previous year: 6.0%). Due to the divestment of the main parts of the former Security Communication Division additional lease and other contracts were classified as onerous. Based on current assessment of the management, CHF 4.6 million were additionally provided for such onerous contracts in 2012 and are included in the profit for the period from discontinued operations. Respective cash outflows will occur until 2015. Provisions for warranties are project-related and are based on systematic extrapolation of historical payment patterns, which are verified and adjusted periodically. Other provisions comprise obligations arising from claims or disputes in connection with the operational business of Ascom companies (CHF 2.3 million), provisions for environmental costs relating to premises (CHF 2.5 million), provisions in relation to termination of labor contracts (CHF 0.5 million), provisions in relation to open income tax cases (CHF 1.8 million) and obligations arising from cashsettled share-based payments (CHF 0.2 million). The residual amount represents an accumulation of several minor events. In 2012, the addition of CHF 3.0 million is related to many cases individually not material. After taking appropriate legal advice, the outcome of the legal claims will not give rise to any significant loss beyond the amounts provided at 31 December 2012. In February 2012, Ascom reached an out-of-court settlement of a formerly provisioned litigation in Austria in connection with divested activities. The settlement led to a cash outflow of CHF 0.8 million and a release of unused provision of CHF 0.3 million. 16.

These rates vary significantly. The increase in the weighted average expected ­income tax rate is mainly due to the different contribution of individual Group companies to the total earnings before income tax of the Group.

New owners were sought for the core business units of the former Security Communication Division. At 31 July 2012, the divestment project was completed with the sale of the Civil Security business. The results of the divested business units are included in the profit or loss for the period from discontinued operations. In the period under review, the Group divested the following subsidiaries or businesses: Divestment of Defense business At 1 March 2012, Ruag (Switzerland) Ltd. purchased from Ascom (Switzerland) Ltd. all rights and obligations pertaining to the Defense business unit. All 84 employees and 10 apprentices were taken over at their existing locations. Ascom paid a total cash compensation of CHF 55.8 million for the transferred net liabilities of CHF 73.8 million. In addition, the purchaser has agreed to an earn-out ­payment dependent on future success in the international business during the years 2012 till 2014, capped at an amount of CHF 8.3 million. At closing date, no receivable is recognized for this contingent consideration. Divestment of Infrastructure Operators business At 1 April 2012, Trans Data Management AG (TDM) took over from Ascom (Switzerland) Ltd. all rights and obligations pertaining to the Infrastructure Operators business.

At the balance sheet date, payables due to key management in the amount of CHF 0.4 million (previous year: CHF 0.9 million) existed. Legally independent funds provide for Swiss pensions (see note 14). In the reporting period lease payments of CHF 0.2 million were disbursed to the Swiss pension fund for buildings occupied by the Group (previous year: CHF 0.4 million). In opposite direction administrative and facility management services in the amount of CHF 0.6 million (previous year: CHF 0.6 million) were rendered to the Swiss pension funds in the year under review. At the balance sheet date, a current receivable of CHF 5.1 million (previous year: CHF 6.0 million) was outstanding, subject to an interest yield of 1.5% (previous year: 2.5%). The Swiss pension funds have not owned any Ascom shares in 2012 (previous year: nil). Zürcher Kantonalbank is a significant shareholder of Ascom Holding Ltd. with an interest of 26.74% at 31 December 2012 (previous year: 26.74%). For its hedging and cash management needs Ascom enters into foreign exchange contracts with Zürcher Kantonalbank. At the balance sheet date, forward contracts with a counter value of CHF 13.0 million (previous year: CHF 10.2 million) are open leading to a positive replacement value at 31 December 2012 of CHF 0.1 million (previous year: nil). Throughout the period, foreign exchange deals with net counter value of CHF 92.5 million (previous year: CHF 24.6 million) were settled. These transactions were made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’slength transactions. 26. Risk management As an international company, Ascom is exposed to a variety of financial and non-financial risks that are directly associated with the Group’s business operations. The Group’s risk exposure is addressed in accordance with the principle of risk limitation. Our overall risk management is an integral part of corporate management and the long-term corporate strategy, and it is correspondingly incorporated in the framework of our business processes and procedures. Ascom applies clearly defined management information and control systems to measure, monitor and control the risks to which it is exposed. Our management monitors the effectiveness and efficiency of our risk management activities and control systems at regular intervals and proposes adjustments as required. 26.1 Financial risk Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury and is ensured by the relevant written principles and guidelines laid down by the management and approved by the Board of Directors. In the treasury strategy, the Group’s risk capacity and appetite for the various risk factors are defined. The treasury strategy specifies the limit architecture and thereby defines the extent to which risk exposures will be hedged and the instruments and time-frame for implementation. All strategy proposals in the treasury strategy are reviewed and require annual approval by the Audit Committee. Group Treasury is in charge of risk quantification and hereby measures financial risks by means of at-risk-methodologies, sensitivity analysis and stress testing. Group companies are responsible for the correct identification of the financial risk positions resulting from their business activities. Transactions without underlying core business and all forms of speculation are prohibited. 92 Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Financial risk comprises liquidity risk, market risk and credit risk: a) Liquidity risk The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that sufficient financial resources are available at any point in time in order to be able to completely and timely fulfill all payment obligations of the Group. Group companies prepare, on a monthly basis, a rolling liquidity forecast for a 12-month horizon. Based on these figures, Group Treasury centrally monitors the liquidity position of the Group. Group Treasury compares the planned liquidity requirements with the available funds to detect shortages in a timely manner. In addition, a liquidity reserve is held at all times for unplanned occurrences and undrawn credit facilities are available for financial flexibility. The total of committed credit facilities can be found in note 13. An analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities into the relevant maturity groupings, based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date, is set out below. Contractual commitments in relation to financial guarantees are further disclosed in note 28.

The cash flows shown above are subject to the following conditions and exceptions: ■■ All financial instruments are included for which payments were already contractually agreed on 31 December 2012 and 2011, respectively. Plan figures for future new liabilities are not included. ■■ Foreign currency amounts are translated at the exchange rates prevailing on 31 December. ■■ Variable interest payments for financial instruments are based on the last interest rate fixed on 31 December 2012 and 2011, respectively. ■■ Derivative financial instruments comprise derivatives with negative as well as positive replacement values. This takes into account that all derivative financial instruments, and not only those with a negative replacement value, could have influence on individual timeframes. Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 93 In 2012, Ascom granted a credit line of CHF 2.0 million to a buyer of a divested business (refer to note 28). Earliest possible pay-outs would result in cash outflows of CHF 1.5 million within 12 months and another CHF 0.5 million in 1 to 3 years. Local regulatory limitations related to the transfer of funds exist in a number of countries where Ascom operates, including Brazil, China, India and South Africa. As a consequence, these funds are not available within Group Treasury operations to meet short-term cash obligations outside the respective country. The above described funds are reported as cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet. At 31 December 2012, the balance under such limitations totals CHF 4.6 million (previous year: CHF 5.6 million). b) Market risk Market risk includes foreign currency risk, fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk and other price risk. Changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities can affect the Group’s asset and income situation. Apart from interest rate and foreign currency risk, the Group is not exposed to any other significant financial market risk. Foreign currency risk Due to the global nature of its activities, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk. Foreign exchange gains or losses arise from transactions as well as assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (mainly EUR, USD, SEK and GBP) if these are not the entity’s functional currency. Group Treasury is responsible for managing group-wide foreign exchange transaction risk on an ongoing basis. Annual net transaction risk positions of the Group are derived from planned cash flows on a rolling horizon of 12 months. Group Treasury monitors these positions and loss limits which are the basis for hedging transactions. Respective forward contracts are stated at fair value. All hedging activities are carried out centrally by Group Treasury. The Group has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. These types of translation risk are currently not hedged. The currency related sensitivity of the Group at year end is shown in the following table: CHFm Reasonable Impact Reasonable Impact shift on net result shift on net result 31.12.2012 31.12.2012 31.12.2011 31.12.2011 EUR/CHF +/-15% +/-0.1 +/-15% +/-0.6 GBP/CHF +/-15% +/-0.6 +/-15% +/-0.6 SEK/CHF +/-15% +/-1.7 +/-15% +/-3.5 USD/CHF +/-15% +/-1.0 +/-15% +/-1.8 EUR/SEK +/-15% +/-1.2 +/-15% +/-1.7 USD/SEK +/-15% +/-2.5 +/-15% +/-1.8 The changes are mainly due to foreign exchange gains and losses on cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, loans and forward contracts. Interest rate risk Every interest position is subject to either a cash flow interest risk (associated with floating rate positions) or a market value risk (from fixed interest positions). 94 Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The revolving multicurrency loan facility the Group entered into at 26 May 2011 (see note 13) is the main interest rate risk position in the balance sheet of Ascom. This risk is currently offset with cash surpluses. The Group is holding non-current assets and liabilities which are discounted to reflect the time value of money. All these positions are exposed to interest market value risk. However, neither individually nor in total are these positions material. Based on the interest-bearing assets and liabilities existent at 31 December 2012, a 50 base point higher (lower) level of the market interest rates would lead to a CHF 0.3 million (previous year: CHF 0.3 million) higher (lower) net result on an annual basis. c) Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. Credit risk may result in a financial loss if one party in a transaction is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations. It is Ascom’s objective to limit the impact of a default. Credit risk of financial counterparties is managed centrally by Group Treasury. For banks and financial institutions, only parties with a minimum Standard & Poor’s credit rating of “A” are accepted. Individual risk limits are set by the Board of Directors. The utilization of credit limits and development of credit ratings are regularly monitored. Each Group company is responsible for analyzing the credit risk for each of their new customer and managing the quality of their trade receivables on an ongoing basis. The table below sets out the Group’s six major counterparties at the balance sheet date: CHFm Rating 1 Balance 31.12.2012 Counterparty Bank A A 19.9 Bank B A 11.2 Bank C AA– 5.1 Customer A B– 5.3 Customer B not rated 5.0 Customer C A– 4.9 CHFm Rating 1 Balance 31.12.2011 Counterparty Bank A A 21.5 Bank B A+ 7.2 Bank C AA– 6.4 Customer D BBB+ 4.9 Customer A B– 3.9 Customer E not rated 3.0 1 Long-term credit rating Standard & Poor’s. The number of customers and their geographical distribution reduces the risk of concentration. Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 95 The management does not expect any losses from non-performance by financial institutions where funds have been invested by the Group during the reporting period. The Group monitors the credit worthiness of its key customers by using independent ratings (if available) and by taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors at subsidiary level. Each division has its own policy in place to manage the quality of trade receivables. The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired at the balance sheet date can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings, if available, or to historical information about counterparty default rates: CHFm “A” or better Without public Total rating 1 rating Financial assets 0.4 6.2 6.6 Cash and cash equivalents 62.1 1.0 63.1 Total at 31.12.2012 62.5 7.2 69.7 CHFm “A” or better Without public Total rating 1 rating Financial assets – 7.2 7.2 Cash and cash equivalents 71.6 1.7 73.3 Total at 31.12.2011 71.6 8.9 80.5 1 Long-term credit rating Standard & Poor’s. In 2012, Ascom granted a credit line of CHF 2.0 million to a buyer of a divested business (refer to note 28). No public rating is available of the borrower. 26.2 Capital risk The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for the shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimally leveraged capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. Ascom aims to maintain a stable investment grade rating as perceived by bank partners and debt investors. For its capital management the Group monitors the following ratios: CHFm 31.12.2012 31.12.2011 Net debt including outstanding bank guarantees 1 58.2 (34.3) EBITDA 49.6 54.1 Debt service ratio 1.2 (0.6) Total assets 519.1 506.8 Shareholders’ equity 223.7 203.8 Equity ratio 43.1% 40.2 % 1 Borrowings and outstanding bank guarantees less cash and cash equivalents. The Group is targeted on a debt service ratio not exceeding 3.0 and an equity ratio between 30% and 40%. 96 Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 27.

Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 97 27.2 Fair value estimation For financial instruments that are measured at fair value the following fair value measurement hierarchy has been applied: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices). Level 3: Inputs for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). The following tables present the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date: CHFm Based on quoted Based on other Based on unobTotal prices in active observable inputs servable inputs markets (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Available for sale financial assets Investments in third parties – – 0.9 0.9 Balance at 31.12.2012 – – 0.9 0.9 Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Derivative financial instruments, net – 0.3 – 0.3 Balance at 31.12.2012 – 0.3 – 0.3 CHFm Based on quoted Based on other Based on unobTotal prices in active observable inputs servable inputs markets (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Available for sale financial assets Investments in third parties – – 0.9 0.9 Balance at 31.12.2011 – – 0.9 0.9 The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from a stock exchange. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, overthe-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. Forward exchange contracts are allocated to this level. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. These inputs reflect the Group’s own assumptions about market pricing using the best internal and external information available. Investments in third parties for which the fair value of the market prices cannot be reliably determined are allocated to this level and measured at cost less any impairment. 98 Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 27.3 Derivative financial instruments Foreign currencies are purchased and forward contracts are entered into at Group level as an economic hedge against foreign currency risk. The open contracts comprise the following forward contracts in various currencies: CHFm 31.12.2012 31.12.2011 Contract volume 20.8 41.0 Positive fair value 0.4 0.1 Negative fair value 0.1 0.1 Breakdown by currency (CHFm) 31.12.2012 31.12.2011 CZK – 0.3 EUR 8.5 11.7 GBP – 4.0 SEK 6.1 25.0 USD 6.2 – Total 20.8 41.0 The fair value of derivative financial instruments is included under current financial assets or other current liabilities. The changes in value are recognized in profit or loss under financial income or expenses. 28. Commitments and Contingencies a) Lease commitments – Group as lessee The future minimum payments under non-cancellable lease obligations fall due as follows: CHFm Finance leases Operating leases 31.12.2012 31.12.2011 31.12.2012 31.12.2011 Within 12 months – – 17.7 18.6 Between 1 and 5 years – – 21.1 31.2 Later – – 2.6 3.2 Total – – 41.4 53.0 Significant leasing agreements exist with regard to the sale and lease back of properties used for operational purposes in Berne and Hombrechtikon (Switzerland). Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 99 b) Lease commitments – Group as lessor The future minimum lease receivables under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: CHFm Operating leases 31.12.2012 31.12.2011 Within 12 months 8.6 4.3 Between 1 and 5 years 5.7 15.8 Later – 3.7 Total 14.3 23.8 c) Loan commitments In connection with discontinued operations, Ascom granted a credit line in the amount of CHF 2.0 million to a buyer of a business unit of the former Security Communication Division. Under this commitment portions of CHF 0.5 million can be drawn quarterly. The full amount is due for repayment until 31 July 2016. d) Contingencies As an internationally active company, Ascom is exposed to a multitude of legal risks. These relate particularly to risks associated with product liability, patent law, tax law, and competition law. Some companies are involved in legal proceedings. The results of currently pending law suits cannot be predicted with certainty, which means that decisions of courts or other authorities can cause expenses that have significant consequences for the business and on future results. Wherever a reliable estimate of the financial consequences of a past event is possible, and that the outflow of resources is more likely than not, a corresponding provision is made. At 31 December 2012, contingent liabilities amount to CHF 56.4 million (previous year: CHF 34.1 million). There is no indication that these liabilities will lead to fulfillment payments. The Company has indemnified certain purchasers of divested businesses for potential claims arising from the operations of the divested businesses. There are currently no ongoing proceedings in relation to indemnification. 29. Pledged assets At 31 December 2012, property, plant and equipment with a total carrying amount of CHF 0.6 million (previous year: CHF 0.6 million) and financial assets with a total carrying amount of CHF 0.2 million (previous year: CHF 0.6 million) were pledged. 30. Events after the Balance Sheet date Since the balance sheet date, no events have occurred that have an influence on the 2012 consolidated financial statements. 100 Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 31. Proposal of the Board of Directors For the year ended 31 December 2012, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting on 10 April 2013, a distribution of share premium of CHF 0.35 per share entitled to dividends.

Board of Directors’ Responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of Swiss law. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards as well as the International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 give a true and fair view of the financial position, the results of operations and the cash flows in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law.

Total remuneration for each member consists of a basic salary and a variable component (performancerelated part). The basic salary and variable component are paid in cash. The variable salary component (performance-related part) is linked solely to the achievement of measurable quantitative targets (incoming orders, net revenue, EBIT, net working capital) which are defined at the beginning of each year. The CEO receives a variable salary component of 50% of his basic salary on fully achieving all targets. The other members of the Executive Board receive a variable salary component of 40% of their basic salary on fully achieving all defined targets. If the targets set within the respective member’s area of responsibility as well as the Group targets are exceeded a sum no more than twice the target variable salary component may be paid. Options are allocated on the basis of stock option plans set up each year and agreed in writing. The conditions for exercising such options are defined when they are allocated, with no subsequent changes being made and in particular no repricing. The strike price corresponds at least to the market price on the grant date or to the average market price over a defined number of trading days prior to this date. Management of the Ascom Stock Option Plans is the responsibility of the Board of Directors. In 2012, the CEO received options under the Ascom Stock Option Plan 2012 worth 20% of the total of basic salary and 100% variable salary component.

Risk management in compliance with Art. 663b of the Swiss Code of Obligations Ascom Holding Ltd. is fully integrated into the group-wide risk and control process of Ascom Group (see note 26 of the consolidated financial statements). 112 Ascom Financial Statements 2012 Holding comments on the Financial Statements Comments on the Financial Statements Assets Investments include shares in Group companies amounting to CHF 126.0 million (previous year: CHF 127.2 million). The net decrease in investments is mainly attributable to an impairment recognized in the amount of CHF 1.2 million. In the year under review, loans to Group companies increased by CHF 50.0 million. This net increase is mainly related to M&A activities but also includes a value adjustment in the amount of CHF 25.0 mil­ lion. A subordination agreement in favor of a Group company in the amount of CHF 25.0 million was signed on 31 December 2012. The loans are mainly denominated in CHF, EUR, USD and SEK. Other non-current assets consists of capitalized financing costs in relation to the refinancing of the Group in 2011. Accounts receivables from Group companies consist mainly of short-term receivables denominated in CHF, EUR, USD and SEK. Liabilities and equity Due to the net increase of own shares, an amount of CHF 0.4 million was allocated from retained earnings to reserves for own shares. Bank loan consists of a revolving multicurrency loan facility in an aggregate amount of CHF 140.0 mil­lion. The final maturity date of the loan facility is 24 May 2016. The reduction in provisions is mainly due to releases of provisions for general valuation risks. Income statement Investment income mainly represents ordinary dividend payments from Group companies. In the period under review, investment income includes additionally a capital repayment in the amount of CHF 2.3 million in connection with the divestment of Ascom Austria GmbH. Financial income mainly consists of interest income from loans to Group companies. The increase in financial income derives from increased outstanding loan amounts and foreign exchange gains on Group loans and accounts receivables. Additionally, gains from value adjustments on own shares of CHF 1.5 million are recognized as financial income (previous year: revaluation losses of CHF 3.4 million). Other income comprises trademark fees charged to Group companies of CHF 4.7 million (previous year: CHF 5.0 million), releases of provisions amounting to CHF 27.0 million (previous year: CHF 3.9 million) and a release of a valuation adjustment of CHF 4.0 million due to the full repayment of a Group loan formerly reduced in value (previous year: nil). Financial expenses mainly consist of interests paid to banks and Group companies and bank charges. Administration expenses include CHF 1.0 million (previous year: CHF 1.0 million) of personnel related costs.
