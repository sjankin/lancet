That is the focus of our Strategy Number ONE. Sustainability is an important aspect of our corporate strategy – and we regard it as an investment in our future. As the automotive industry’s top-selling premium car company, we strive to take a leading role in advancing individual mobility. We believe in sustainable mobility and paved the way for it early. In late 2013, we will take the next logical step with our entry into the field of emission-free electromobility. We have been reducing the CO2 emissions of our vehicles for years through our Efficient Dynamics technology package; while our Clean Production concept, for example, reduces energy and water consumption at our plants. In 2012, we made significant progress in integrating sustainability aspects into our supply chain management. This illustrates our holistic approach – from the application of innovative materials and technologies to brand-new vehicle concepts, the use of renewable energy in our production, right up to new working environments for our employees and our global corporate social responsibility activities. This is how we implement sustainability along the entire value chain. We want to understand how people imagine the mobility of the future. We are therefore striving for a high level of transparency with this report and are in ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders, including politicians, academics and NGOs. The stakeholder dialogue events held in Leipzig and New York in 2011 and in Berlin and San Francisco in 2012 are good examples of this. They provide us with important insights that we can integrate into our decision-making and actions. The BMW Group has been one of the top-rated companies in all major sustainability ratings and rankings for some years: we are considered the world’s most sustainable car company. At the same time, we recognise the challenges for the future of our society. We intend to play our part in finding solutions and, at the same time, enhance our future viability. For this reason, my colleagues and I on the Board of Management have defined sustainability targets up to 2020. Our company signed the United Nations Global Compact many years ago and has since implemented its Ten Principles at all our locations worldwide – because premium comes with responsibility, today and in the future.

Legal risks Responsible action in compliance with legislation is one of the basic prerequisites for our success. Applicable law forms the binding framework for our diverse business activities. Increasing internationalisation of the BMW Group’s business activities, general economic conditions as well as the large number and complexity of legal regulations and taxation lead to a situation in which there may be violations due to ignorance of the law. Several years ago, the BMW Group set up a compliance organisation to ensure that its entities, managers and employees comply with the law. Like all companies, the BMW Group is or could be confronted with legal disputes with regard to guarantees, product liability, breaches of property rights and legal proceedings regarding claims of legal violations. These can also have an effect on the reputation of the Group and are mainly procedures that are typical of the industry or result from the adaptation of our product or purchasing strategy to changing market sustainable value report 2012 28 Sustainability Management 1.4 BMW Group Compliance Committee Office is allocated in organisational terms to the Chairman of the Board of Management.

In the year under report, the BMW Group developed a new Business Relations Compliance programme aimed at ensuring the reliability of its business relations. Relevant business partners are checked and evaluated with a view to identifying potential compliance risks. These procedures are particularly relevant for relations with sales partners and service providers, such as agencies and advisers/consultants. Depending on the results of the evaluation, appropriate measures – such as communication measures, training and possible monitoring – are implemented to manage compliance risks. The Business Relations Compliance programme was introduced in selected pilot markets in 2012 and, over the coming years, will be rolled out successively throughout the BMW Group’s worldwide sales organisation. Cooperation with employee representatives Compliance is also an important factor in terms of safe-guarding the future of the BMW Group’s workforce. With this in mind, the Board of Management and the national and international employee representative bodies of the BMW Group signed a set of Joint Principles for Lawful Conduct in 2009. In doing so, all parties involved gave a commitment to the principles contained in the BMW Group Legal Compliance Code and to trustful cooperation in all matters relating to compliance. Employee representatives are therefore regularly involved in the process of developing compliance systems within the BMW Group. Corporate governance The BMW Group manages its business in accordance with principles of responsible corporate governance geared to long-term value creation. In 2002, it confirmed its commitment to these principles in its own Governance Code. Based on the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), this document is regularly updated. You can find more information in the Annual Report under “Statement on Corporate Governance” (p. 152 ff.). Forecast In the coming financial year, the BMW Group plans to examine the possibility of certifying the compliance management system and will create a concept to avoid compliance risks when preparing and implementing events. It will also integrate compliance aspects into its international employee survey. sustainable value report 2012 BMW Group SUSTAINABLE VALUE REPORT 2012 CH.02 Product responsibility shaping mobility Product responsibility 2.1 Our management approach, Page 35 2.2 Fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions, alternative drivetrain technologies, Page 37 2.3 product safety, Page 41 2.4 Resource efficiency and recycling management, Page 44 2.5 The future of mobility, mobility services, traffic management, Page 46 2.6 Customer satisfaction, Page 50 www : bmwgroup.com /svr200 32 Product responsibility www : bmwgroup.com /svr200 Electromobility Electromobility — 01 — 07 — 06 � Team Leader for new vehicle projects — mirco schwarze — BMW plant Leipzig, GERMANY “I want my three sons to grow up in an intact environment.

Here again, the BMW i3 is a good example. BMW’s philosophy includes implementing measures for sustainability through Efficient Dynamics not only in niche models, but as a standard component so that all customers can benefit see Chapter 2.2. An example of this philosophy is the BMW 520d EfficientDynamics Edition BluePerformance. A recent winner of the ADAC “Yellow Angel” award in the category “Car of the Future”, this model exemplifies to the highest degree the principle of sustainability: avoiding losses while using 4.5 litres of diesel per 100 kilometres — The BMW 520d EfficientDynamics energy to the maximum. Supplementing the full package Edition BluePerformance. of BMW Efficient Dynamics measures that are applied in every vehicle are aero wheel rims, reduced rolling resistance tyres, a lowered chassis, a modified transmission ratio on the rear axle and optimised gearshift timing, leading to a 520d Best-practice example for EFFICIENT DYNAMICS: low fuel consumption in the EU test cycle of 4.5 litres per 100 kilometres and a CO2 value of 119 grams per kilometre. And the BMW BluePerformance system with its additional catalyser also reduces nitrogen oxide. With 184 HP, the BMW BMW 520d EfficientDynamics Edition BluePerformance shows that sustainability and driving pleasure are by no means mutually exclusive. � EfficientDynamics Edition BluePerformance – The “Car of the Future” Forecast In the coming years, we will continue to focus on reducing CO2 emissions and expanding innovative mobility services. We have set ourselves some ambitious goals: for example, we want to reduce International requirements CO2 emissions in the European new vehicle fleet by at least 50% by International regulatory requirements for BMW Group 2020 (base year: 1995). We also want to take the lead with our hol­ products are becoming increasingly stringent, particularly istic approach to premium electromobility and to deploy integrated in the area of vehicle emissions. 94% of the vehicles we sell mobility services in order to lastingly change mobility behaviour in are subject to corresponding regulations and tax legislation. selected metropolitan regions. Planning for sales is at the same time made difficult by rapid changes in legislation. This means that we have to be prepared to cope with new framework conditions even before they are announced by legislators. For many years now, the BMW Group has had a Groupwide cross-hierarchy management system in place for this purpose. It ensures that both legal requirements and goals specific to BMW in the field of sustainability and product responsibility are met. Holistic accounting methods The BMW Group assumes responsibility for all of its products and processes. This is reflected in the holistic accounting methods our Sustainability Board approved in 2009 based on our Sustainability Strategy. We assess the environmental, economic and social impact of our products across their entire life cycle. This holistic accounting method complements our long-standing Life Cycle Assessment system (ISO 14040/14044), enabling us to ensure from the architecsustainable value report 2012 Product responsibility 37 2.2 BMW Group vehicles worldwide and constantly work to make them even better.

European dealers are contractually obligated to meet BMW retail standards recycling for old-parts recyc­ling. These standards, along with our global network for returning used components, for example old catalytic converters and in the future thermoelectric genmanagement erators, are helping us to protect resources and make more efficient use of raw materials. By expanding and optimising our recyc­ling structures, we are already today taking into consideration the increasing proportion of electric vehicles that will take to the roads tomorrow. Intelligent design and the use of secondary raw materials enable us to reduce our consumption of valuable resources. New drivetrain concepts, new challenges By optimising our recycling structures, we are already preparing for increasing volumes of electric vehicles in the future. The successive introduction of new forms of drivetrain and the modified vehicle concepts that result are presenting new challenges in the use of resources. One example is the In the initial development and architecture phase, we already increased use of components made of innovative, lightweight design our vehicles and processes with a view to minimising carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), which will be used the use of valuable resources.

Each ELV returned to the BMW Group in this network is recycled at no charge to the last owner. In Europe, the BMW Group has contracts with 1,700 vehicle recyclers. Closed material cycles for polymers Secondary raw materials are finding more and more applications in our vehicles. Up to 15% of the thermoplastic materials in our automobiles are already made from secondary materials or recyclates approved by the BMW Group for the respective component. One example is the substrate used for the centre console and the door balustrade. The use of recyclates in our vehicles enables us to offset the rising prices of raw materials (for example plastic components made from mineral oil, for instance) while contributing to resource efficiency and saving energy. Use of renewable raw materials Wherever it makes technical, business and environmental sense and is socially acceptable, we replace artificial materials with natural, renewable materials.

In 2006, the values for energy, CO2, water, solvents and wastewater per vehicle produced were standardised and set to 1.00 for the environmental efficiency index. Then they were added up and divided by the number of resources. Thus, the initial envir­onmental efficiency figure was 1.00 when it was launched in 2006. In 2012, we exceeded the agreed targets by achieving a value of 0.64. sustainable value report 2012 58 Group-wide environmental Protection technology experts from the production plants and develop reference systems on which to base future planning and process improvements. One recent example is the newly opened Tiexi plant in China, a joint venture with our partner Brilliance Automotive Ltd. State-of-the-art manufacturing processes based on the combined experience of the BMW Group’s global network ensure that production is particularly resource efficient. Environmental aspects were taken into account from the word go – even as early as the building planning stage. The plant is the most sustainable automotive production facility in China with regard to energy and water consumption, waste efficiency and process wastewater as well as the emission of solvents. It is a role model for environmentally friendly projects worldwide. The new plant is one of the most sustainable within the global production network of the BMW Group. Another example of best-practice solutions transfer is a recycling centre close to our Chinese facility in Shenyang, which should be opening in 2016. The centre will be designed along the same lines as our tried-and-tested recyc­ling centre close to Munich.

We are also expanding our highly efficient and sustainable value report 2012 60 Group-wide environmental Protection In addition to renewable energy expansion, we are also focus­ ing on the intelligent use of energy. To this end, we have installed combined power and heat systems at a total of eight locations. These systems allow us to use both the electricity generated as well as the resulting waste heat. We are also continuously improving our vehicle production processes. Innovative technologies such as IPP (Integrated Paint Process in paint shops) and body press tools as well as optimisation of ventilation systems and the closing of energy cycles in our paintshops help us to achieve our efficiency targets. Reducing energy costs in the face of rising energy prices makes the BMW Group more profitable and more competitive. Energy savings pay off In times of emissions trading and allowances, reducing CO2 emissions not only makes environmental sense – it is also a business opportunity for the BMW Group. In the third period BMW plant Steyr — Electricity generated from biomass. of the European CO2 emissions trading system (2013 – 2020), emissions rights allocations will be further reduced. Therefore, every unit of energy saved pays off twofold, as the costs of energy consumption and the purchase of emissions allowances can be reduced as a result. Renewable energy consumption Our vision is to draw 100% of our energy requirements from renewable energy sources. Instead of relying on energy from one specific source, we will decide which concept makes most sense at each location, based on local conditions. In 2010, we implemented a development plan to assess the potential of each production facility. From 2013 onwards, around 30% of the heat required for our engine plant in Steyr will be supplied by a neighbouring biomass thermal power plant (fuelled by timber waste from the region). This will mean an annual reduction in CO2 emissions of up to 3,000 tonnes. BMW plant Rosslyn — Plans for a twin-unit power station fuelled by landfill gas. At our Rosslyn plant in South Africa, the new independ­ ent operator Bio2Watt will provide 40% of the required electricity from a twin-unit power station based on landfill gas (biogas firing, i.e. waste from cattle ranches or chicken farms as well as food waste). This could reduce CO2 emissions by 8,300 tonnes per year. Carbon-neutral electricity will be used for the entire production process of the BMW i3 in Leipzig. For this purpose, four wind turbines will be commissioned on the plant’s premises in the first half of 2013, each with a capacity of 2.5 megawatts. We also plan to install wind turbines at our plant in Tiexi, China.

Each potential new supplier must thus take the BMW Group sustainability requirements into consideration when submitting their proposal. This is a global approach, as the procurement process is centrally coordinated and implemented, even for local requirements. However, it is important to us to source local suppliers to cover a large part of our purchasing needs at our production facilities. For example, at the Spartanburg % location, 80% of our direct purchasing volume was sourced � of purchasing volume at our from local suppliers in 2012. Spartanburg plant in 2012 was sourced directly from local suppliers Sustainable material properties such as the use of secondary aluminium are also addressed in the request for proposal. After the proposal has been submitted, they are included as key decision-making indicators in the procurement process. When the decision for a particular supplier is being made, a standard template provides the relevant committees with all relevant information. Sustainability is one of the decisionmaking criteria, alongside production quality, secur­ity of supply, price credibility and innovative strength. Individual cases of non-compliance in the supply chain When individual cases of non-compliance with our sustainability principles are reported to us, our Supply Chain Response Team handles them. This team is made up of a representative from Operational and Strategic Purchasing, Corporate Strategy, Corporate Communications as well as the sustainable value report 2012 78 Supply Chain Management 4.3 For example, at the European level, the BMW Group collaborates with eight other car companies to add an external dimension to its activities in the area of sustainability in the supply chain.

To attract the best employees and keep them at the company, we offer secure and attractive jobs, a personnel policy geared to the long term, above-average pay and a variety of ways to reconcile work and private life. Despite some difficult general economic conditions for the automotive industry, the BMW Group was able to achieve very good results in 2012. This is mainly due to the commitment, creativity and expertise of our employees. We make every effort to attract the best people to join us and offer the greatest possible job security. Apart from the fixed and variable salary components, we also offer our employees a wide qualification — BMW Group employee training for the new BMW 3 Series. range of social benefits.

Practitioner’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed as to whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the data of the report of the Company for the business year 2012 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the above mentioned criteria of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3.1 (pp. 7 to 17) of the GRI. We also have been engaged to make recommendations for the further development of sustainability management and sustainability reporting based on the results of our assurance engagement. We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000. This Standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement, under consideration of materiality, to provide our conclusion with limited assurance. In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement (for example, an audit of financial statements in accordance with § (Article) 317 HGB (“Handelsgesetzbuch”: “German Commercial Code”)), and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgement. 1 Our engagement applied to the German version of the report. This text is a translation of the Independent Assurance Report issued in German language the German text is authoritative. Selected information of the “objectives, key facts and figures” part are published in the report “Adding Value – Sustainable Value Report 2012” available both as a printable version and as an online version on BMW’s web presence www.bmwgroup.com/svr.

Emphasis of Matter – Recommendations Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following recommendations for the further development of the Company’s sustainability management and sustainability reporting: Further formalization of the internal control system for sustainability data; Further harmonization of worldwide reporting systems to facilitate sustainability data collection.

The paper used (Enviro Top) was produced, climate-neutrally and without optical brighteners and chlorine bleach, from recycled waste paper. All other production materials used also comply with the requirements of the Blue Angel eco-label (RAL-UZ 14). The Blue Angel is considered to be one of the most stringent eco-labels in the world. The CO2 emissions generated through print and production were neutralised by the BMW Group. To this end, the corresponding amount of emissions allowances was erased, with the transaction identification EU-96334 on 25 April 2013. sustaINaBILIty maNagEmENt PuBLIshED By Bayerische motoren Werke aktiengesellschaft 80788 munich Tel. +49 89 382-0
