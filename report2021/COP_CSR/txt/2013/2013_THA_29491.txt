It completed the solar power plant project despite having to deal a number of obstacles that caused the project to delay, but when completed the project will help it reduce its greenhouse emission by 50%. Furthermore, the Company expanded the scope of our environmental activities to include the public by organizing the “Floods, Earthquakes : Taking Thailand beyond Natural Catastrophes” seminar, raising awareness in schools across the country through the Thailand Go Green initiative, as well as supporting environmental projects in the communities surrounding the refinery. In mid-2012, there was an incident that brought great grief to the Bangchak family. The incident caused great panic and concern to residents in and around the communities surrounding the refinery, whereby the management and employees took it upon themselves to reach out to these communities in person to visit the residents, assess the damage and offer immediate assistance to any damage that may have been caused by the incident. It also took the opportunity to improve its refinery unit and have it safely back in operation, by procuring safety experts from abroad to improve the safety system to exceed the safety standards of other refineries. These sincere and prompt efforts have reward the Company with the compassion, understanding, and opportunity it has been given by the communities, who have reaffirm their determination to fight together with the Company. Lastly, on behalf of the management and employees of Bangchak, we are determined to carry on the Bangchak culture to sustainably develop business in harmony with society and the environment.

Besides managing its business to generate steady and continuous value through good governance principles and strict risk management for its business, the Company has applied the concept of sustainable management as an essential element of its strategic planning. To illustrate, it has included a social and environmental indicator among its performance indicators in addition to other indicators, namely financial, customer, process and personnel. This would enable the Company to properly cascade social and environmental goals down to the operation levels (departments and sections). This way, action plans are interconnected or at least do not contradict the social and environmental indicator. At the operating level, besides the above-mentioned cascading of goals, all employees who observed the employee culture of “Be virtuous, be knowledgeable and contributive to society” also contribute to the driving of various action plans, which will be directly and indirectly beneficial and lead to true success. The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 13 Core strategies for sustainable business operation 1 Grow the business and diversify risks to businesses with secure income The Company has defined business growth goals to grow sustainable value for its business by restructuring its revenue from 70% (refining business), 30% (marketing business) today, which is highly volatile by nature of the refining business-whether world market prices or refining margins that are subject to global and regional economic conditions-which could in turn result in the Company’s performance being also volatile. The Company has now restructured its revenue to 50% (refining business), 20% (marketing business), and 30% (clean-energy business) in 2015. This new element, featuring a constant stream of revenue with low volatility caused by external factors, includes solar-energy power generation, biodiesel production from palm oil (including palm planting) and wind-energy power generation. This move grows 2 business value while diversifying risks associated with its future revenue. Carbon Neutral Company The Company recognizes that the oil refining business is extremely energy-intensive, with emission of carbon dioxide in refining processes of crude oil into products. Therefore it has set a goal of zero net carbon dioxide emission to minimize environmental impacts from its own refining business. Specifically, by 2015, the Company is to trim its carbon dioxide emission by some 50% from the business-as-usual baseline as a result of its development of clean energy businesses, including 118-megawatt solar-cell power generation, biodiesel from oil palm, ethanol from cassava, diesel from algae, and efficient improvement of energy consumption and consumption of 3 clean fuels in refining processes. Socially and Environmentally Friendly Business Models (In-process) Aware that business operations that lack social and environmental activities are unsustainable, the Company is determined to do business in such a way that not only can it sustain continuous growth, but also simultaneously generate positive impacts on society and the environment. Such a model that the Company has been operating successfully is the cooperation of retail stations and agricultural cooperatives. The Company buys agricultural products from cooperatives in different communities and uses them for retail stations’ sales promotion to create jobs and revenue in support of the economic and social development of the communities. In the future, the Company, in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, the Ministry of Energy and the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, will initiate a conversion of abandoned orange farms to palm plantations for orange farmers in Rangsit. The palm produce will be their new source of income and promote the use of alternative energy, which has been the Company initiative for more than a decade as in gasohol and biodiesel promotion. In all, this business model benefits the environment and provides higher 4 income to support social development in agricultural communities. Open, Transparent and Verifiable The Company adheres to an open, transparent and verifiable policy in its operations. Operational data are transparently disclosed under good corporate governance and SET rules. Applying proactive environmental management, it discloses the actual data on quality of air and effluents around the refinery by posting such information at the entrance to the refinery and in surrounding communities. 14 Sustainability Report 2012 Such balanced business management goals backed by determined and ethical staff-committed to the employee culture and values-will enable the Company to add value to business as well as society and the environment and become an organization of sustainable growth.

Key risk factors including economics, social and environment which affecting its corporate objectives are grouped below. 1. Economic Risks Risks inevitably facing the Company’s overall performance arise from the volatile oil price and the baht, currency exchange rates, uncertainty of output volumes as well as global and domestic energy demand, the public sector’s policy, and investment choices for new businesses. To tackle such risks, the Company organizes executive seminars to define business strategies compatible with changing circumstances, conducts analyses of risk factors facing new-venture projects at each project stage, conducts risk management for prices and finance, and develops plans to accommodate change and uncertainties. Senior executives also monitor the Company’s performance weekly and monthly to ensure goal achievement. The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 21 2. Social Risk • Consumers’ behavioral change Faced with today’s consumers’ behavioral change and their tendency to choose green products more and more, the Company is committed to clean energy-whether it is 91-octane, 95-octane, E20, E85 gasohol or Diesel Power D-while campaigning for consumers’ awareness of carbon dioxide reduction when they refuel with the Company’s products. The Company raised its investment in solar-cell power generation, ethanol plants, and biodiesel plants based on crude palm oil and palm growing. The Company was the first to support public policy on alternative-energy production and actively push the policy of subsidizing the prices of alternative fuels. • Corporate image and participation with communities and society The Company strictly values compliance with the law and relevant regulations, evident in its leaders that set role models for transparency and social responsibility, as well as the awards presented to the Company all along. Apparently, legislative and regulation changes or the Company’s own strategies for new-venture investments could require certain projects to undergo the approval process for environmental impact assessment (EIA) reports and secure community acceptance. Limitation and delays resulting from this process could pose risks affecting the Company’s operation and costs. • Safety for communities and society To bolster the confidence of the refinery’s neighbors, BCP defined a crisis management plan and an emergency plan and conducted regular drills to ensure the preparedness of personnel and resources for various incidents as defined by the Business Continuity Management (BCM) ISO 22301 standard. Risk management and business continuity concerning the incident at Bangchak Refinery Following the fire incident at Crude Distillation Unit 3 on July 4, 2012, the consequent property damage and loss of business opportunity decreased overall operational capacity and confidence of the investors and the surrounding communities. However, the preventative measures, readiness, response and recovery, which is rehearsed and reviewed regularly, simulating various situations, allowing for immediate response to control the situation, without injury or loss of life. The Company’s responsibility towards the community allowed the company to promptly provide information and assistance to all stakeholders, and control the impact of the incident. 22 Sustainability Report 2012 Communities around the refinery The Company executives and employees together surveyed the impacts and communicated with more than 700 households in 15 communities around the refinery at once after the incident, and assessed the damage for immediate repair work. Recognizing potential impacts on the physical and emotional health and mind of community members, the Company commissioned teams of doctors from Bamrungrad Hospital to provide health inspection to them from day one. Communication and alerting systems for all corners of the communities have also been beefed up. Goverment / investors / social sector Under strict safety standards, the Company accelerated equipment repair for the Distillation. Unit 3 to resume operation as soon as possible. The Company hired world-class experts like Foster Wheeler, DuPont, and Toyo-Thai Corporation to supervise repair work, audit operating and safety systems, and provide engineering consultation to ensure confidence by all beyond international standards. The Company added safety equipment as well as operating and warning systems to ensure adequacy, suitability, and coverage of all refinery areas. 3. Environmental Risk Since more and more severe environmental problems are arising today, evident in the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes and global warming, the Company is committed to developing alternative-energy businesses to stem the emission of greenhouse gases in line with its carbon-neutral company strategy. The Company strictly values environmental matters by conforming to legislation. Waste management is in place, and resource consumption efficiency has been constantly and suitably improved for energy, water, steam, and so on, in all parts of the refinery, oil depots, and offices strictly, as called for by the TIS/OHSAS 18001 occupational health and safety management system and the ISO 14001 environmental management system to control costs and bolster confidence among communities and society around the refinery. Communities can openly and transparently verify data at the Environmental Quality Data Center, located at Piyarom Sports Club and in communities around the refinery. In addition, the Company together with PTT Group have assessed risks for navigation routes between oil depots to prevent accidents. Vessels have undergone improvement to double-hull ones, and management plans are in place to accommodate oil spills and lower the likelihood of oil spills during marine transport. The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 23 About this Report 24 Sustainability Report 2012 This Sustainability Report illustrates Bangchak Petroleum Plc’s (BCP) performance related to social, economic and environmental development.

An exception is the environmental indicators and environmental cost accounts, which reflect performance for the office areas and the refinery on Sukhumvit 64 Road. The calculation basis for energy and greenhouse gases has undergone change for more up-to-date and explicit outcomes. Key issues : This report focuses on key issues that could sustainably affect business, namely: Environment : Neutral carbon dioxide emission Recognizing that the petroleum business is energy-intensive and emits carbon dioxide, a major cause of global warming, BCP has defined a goal for neutral carbon dioxide emission. Refining units have undergone improvement for greater efficiency, and clean energy has been employed to reduce carbon dioxide emission. Society : Safety of communities and society Neighbors’ confidence in safety around the refinery is BCP’s top priority, particularly since more and more residents now prefer condominiums. Despite its compliance with assorted international standards and its quick mitigation of impacts on communities in a responsible manner, accidents did occur that alarmed BCP’s neighbors. BCP continued to make improvements in tackling this risk by devising crisis management plans and emergency plans, regularly undergoing drills under the Business Continuity Management (BCM) ISO 22301 standard, and hiring the world’s best experts to recommend production process and safety standards that are superior to the international standards adopted by other refineries. : Employee care To BCP, employees rank high on its priority list, and therefore it has promoted a better quality of life for them and their families by improving their welfare schemes. It organizes health promotion activities throughout the year; sets up an exercise room and gives employees access to Piyarom Sports Club at members’ rates; and organizes executives’ meetings with employees for moral support during their various work hours and at the New Year at all office buildings. These have provided employees with excellent morale.

Concerns over the Euro debt crisis, especially in Greece and Spain, depressed the price in the first half-year, while in the latter half, it was buoyed by many positive factors, including lower supply from oil production shutdowns in the US Gulf of Mexico, caused by Hurricane Isaac, in September, longer-than-expected maintenance shutdowns of oil fields in the North Sea, and the improving commodity prices as a result of the US government’s QE 3 and QE4 measures to stimulate economic growth and employment. Revenue Revenue from sale of goods and services of Bangchak this year amounted to Baht 162,623 million, made up of Baht 160,366 million from fuel sale, Baht 1,879 million from lube oil sale, and Baht 378 million from solar power generation. This revenue represented a rise of Baht 5,694 million from that of 2012, mainly due to the higher world oil price (averaging USD 2.57 / BBL higher than last year’s level) and the revenue derived from the solar power business after the flood recovery. The marketing business had a margin (excluding that of lube oil) of Baht 0.61/liter (about USD 3.1/BBL) against Baht 0.55/liter (about USD 2.86/BBL) last year. The sales volume through the marketing business was 77.89 thousand barrels per day, a rise of 6.02 thousand barrels per day (8.38%) over last year. Other income amounted to Baht 658 million, of which Baht 73 million was from business-disruption insurance claims and flood prevention expenses of the solar farm business phase 1 in Q2, Baht 310 million from preliminary compensation for the accident at the Third Refining Unit on July 4 this year. In all, the Company posted a net profit of Baht 4.2 billion, a drop of Baht 1.422 billion (25.5%) from last year, since the average refinery utilization was 73.71 thousand barrels per day, while that last year was 85.69 thousand barrels per day as a result of the maintenance shutdown in Q2, and the accident to the Crude Distillation Unit 3 in Q3. The unit resumed operation in October this year. Expenditure In 2012, the Company reduced its operating expenses by Baht 64 million, most of which was for advertisement and public relations. Expenses for society, schools, and communities, including donation in kind and in cash, rose by Baht 31 million. Income tax and local tax expenses surged Baht 102 million, although the corporate income tax rate was trimmed from 30% to 23%. The cost of capital rose by Baht 162 million, thanks to the issuance of debentures to finance new businesses in line with Bangchak’s strategy. In short, the Company’s ability to pay dividends was higher than the announced dividend policy with an increment of Baht 119.73 million over last year. 28 Sustainability Report 2012 Unit : million Baht Business income1/ 2009 2010 2011 2012 Sales and service revenue 107,678.23 134,638.17 156,928.44 162,622.83 Other revenue 229.07 705.18 1,629.06 658.33 Profit before the cost of 11,193.39 4,460.90 6,997.82 5,816.48 capital and income tax Total revenue 113,538.05 135,370.98 157,798.64 164,419.90 Net profit 7,474.89 2,633.87 5,642.58 4,199.89 Unit : million Baht Expenses incurred to distribute income to stakeholders 2009 2010 2011 2012 Operating expenses 375.76 435.65 724.11 659.23 Interest paid to financial 553.81 841.81 748.17 910.48 institutions Taxes paid to government 3,209.50 1,036.79 652.83 755.33 and local authorities Expenses for social / 22.16 28.16 32.05 40.17 community development Social/school donation 18.18 15.06 31.34 54.32 Dividends 1,729.34 1,520.71 1,739.06 1,858.79 Employee’s salary and 977.44 1,049.32 1,176.82 1,310.04 welfare2/ Remark 1/ Financial Statement for BCP only. 2/ Clasification of employee remuneration and employee welfare expenses aligned with the financial statement. The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 29 Environmental Performance 30 Sustainability Report 2012 The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 31 Environmental Management The Company’s key tool for environmental management to continually strive for environmental development is ISO 14001 for its refining units, Bangchak Oil Distribution Center, and Bang Pa-in Oil Distribution Center. For 15 consecutive years, the Company has successfully maintained this system, thanks mainly to the drive of the health, safety, environmental and energy management team (the Company’s top environmental management team) chaired by the Senior Executive Vice President, Refinery Business, and to the awareness of employees and contractors (working on behalf of the Company) who have provided excellent cooperation in conforming to the health, safety, environmental, and energy policy. This year, the Company began earnest implementation of its document management system and its ISO management system, thus improving document control and tracking of actions under various environmental protective measures in the hope of raising online application efficiency. This year, the Company won the fourth tier (Green Culture) of the Green Industry certification from the Ministry of Industry, which illustrated its workforce’s collective green operations in every aspect so that their practices have become part of the corporate culture in keeping with the Bangchak culture of “Creative Leader for Clean Energy”. All employees have been continually trained to be environmentally knowledgeable through training of lead auditors and supervisors of pollution prevention systems in the knowledge of legislation, industrial waste management, and air pollution. Green Production and Carbon Footprint Raw Materials The Company refines imported and indigenous crude oil with modern and environmentally friendly technology. This year, indigenous crude amounted to nearly 2.3 million litres, or 51% of the total crude run, and 2.2 million litres of oil was importes. This lessened the currency outflow and the emissions of greenhouse gases due to crude oil transport. In addition, the Company fed 3% of off-specifications refined oil and slop oil back into its refining processes, thus lowering oil losses and consuming resources more effectively. This year, the Company introduced B100 biodiesel ester and ethanol as extra raw materials in addition to crude oil for the 82 and 88 million liters of refined outputs, as more biodiesel ester in diesel was required by the Department of Energy Business. In addition, there was greater demand for diesel and gasohol. 32 Sustainability Report 2012 Crude oil sources (%) indigenous crude imported crude 2010 2011 2012 Other Raw Materials/Crude Run (million litres) MTBE Ethanol Biodiesel Ester (B100) Used Vegetable Oil 2010 2011 2012 Products The Company’s products include fuel gas, LPG, 91-octane gasoline, gasohol 91 and 95, jet fuel, B2, B3 and B5 PowerD and fuel oil. This year, BCP replaced catalysts in its quality product improvement unit, which converts fuel oil into diesel and gasoline. As a result, the fuel-oil output ratio fell, whereas those of diesel and gasoline rose.

The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 33 Energy In its processes, the Company consumes primary sources of two types : direct energy (FG, LPG, NG, and FO) and indirect energy (electricity supplied by the Metropolitan Electricity Authority, along with electricity and steam supplied by Bangchak Utility Plant (BUP). All energy is classified as non-renewable. This year, the Company consumed a total of 11,114 Tera Joules, a rise from last year, because of 1. A total of 392 Tera Joules of additional energy was consumed, with the EURO IV gasoline processing unit in operation since November 2011 to ensure EURO IV quality conformance. 2. During BUP’s maintenance turnaround from certain periods from February to May, direct energy was consumed for power and steam generation for the refinery’s own use for lack of such energy received from BUP, whose electricity generation was more efficient. 3. During low-output periods, more energy was required to heat oil and recycle it to maintain the minimum output, as was the heating of oil from the cold feed. By energy type, it was found that The difference ratio of primary energy consumption grew by 1.0% from last year, of which energy from FG and NG dropped by 0.5% and that from FO grew by 1.5%, whereas the ratio of delivered electricity dropped by 1% because the Company was consuming primary energy for power and steam generation for its own use during BUP’s maintenance turnaround. 2011 2012 Source of Energy (Tera Joules) (Tera Joules) FUEL (Primary) FG + LPG 5,860.13 6,752.96 NG 2,372.25 1,763.77 FO 704.08 905.06 Electricity Purchasing (Secondary) MEA 98.72 101.45 BUP 462.08 376.49 Stream Purchasing from BUP 1,161.85 1,214.64 Total 10,659.11 11,114.37 Profile of energy consumption (%) 2009 2010 2011 2012 14.1 20.0 22.2 15.9 Natural gas 8.1 29.8 12.4 6.6 Very low-sulfur fuel oil Fuel gas 55.0 60.8 Electricity 54.7 58.3 5.3 Steam 3.4 4.3 1.4 5.9 10.9 10.9 0.0 34 Sustainability Report 2012 Note : Energy consumption in this sustainability report differs from last year’s report in that the total electrical energy purchased from MEA and BUP now excludes energy losses due to the processing efficiency of purchased electricity. This year, the Energy Management Committee continued to manage its refinery efficiency improvement project. Compared with the base year (2010) before the project launch, the Company managed to trim about 146,136 million Btu, equivalent to a reduction of 8,656 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (TOCE) in greenhouse gas emission. Meanwhile, natural gas instead of LPG started being fed into the hydrogen unit, thus lowering the emission by 28,457 TOCE. When combined with the existing project, which had been constantly managed, the Company successfully trimmed greenhouse gas emission by 133,133 TOCE.

Contributing to these efforts was the maintenance turnaround of the Third Refining Unit. This year the Company released 1,036,978 tons CO2e of greenhouse gases. In this report, greenhouse gas data were calculated on the basis of PTT Group Carbon Footprint Guide, the greenhouse gas was downed by 70,081 tons (about 6%) from last year, broken down as follows : 1. Direct emission from processes : 723,269 TOCE 2. Indirect emission from the purchase of electricity and steam from PTT and that of electricity from MEA : 141,721 TOCE 3. Indirect emission from the transport of raw materials and other activities : 171,988 TOCE. Note : Emission in 2011 rose from 626,010 TOCE to 1,107,059 TOCE because of additional reports of indirect greenhouse gas emission from the transport of raw materials and other activities and a change in the calculation method for the hydrogen unit from the feeding rate of liquid to gaseous precursor materials. Water The Company uses water supplied by MWA for the refinery and sources fire water from the Chao Phraya River. Water consumption in 2012 amounted to 2,146,890 cubic metres, a slight drop that of the previous year due to lower refining activities, lower use for maintenance purposes as well as implementation of the following water-saving measures in offices and refining processes : 1. Installed sensors on toilet sinks to lower water losses. 2. Use of treated water for plant watering on the compound, thereby saving 4,800 cubic metres 3. Use of stripped water from the Sour-Water Stripping Unit as Boiler Feed Water (BFW) of Distillation Unit 2 and 3, reducing consumption by 57,120 cubic metres of BFW per year. 4. Treated slightly contaminated condensate water for reuse in the boiler feed water system of the Fourth Refining Unit, thus lowering the requirement for new water by 633,600 cubic meters a year. 5. Used high-quality condensate water in place of regular water for boilers at the Second Refining Unit and the Plant Energy Unit, thus lowering the requirement for water by 166,320 cubic meters a year. 6. Treated water initially with a reverse osmosis system before feeding the water into the demineralization system, thus lowering the requirement for water from system improvement by 38,000 cubic meters a year. 36 Sustainability Report 2012 In addition, the Company took the following measures : 1. Installed an additional reverse osmosis system to treat water before feeding it into the demineralization system to cover the demand for demineralized water by early 2013 so as to lower the need for piped water by no less than 38,000 cubic meters a year. 2. Installed a water filtering system and a reverse osmosis system to treat desulfurized water derived from the sour water stripping unit at the Distillation Unit 4. The resulting water was then used for piped water in the cooling water system. Completion is planned for early 2013 to lower the requirement for water by no less than 85,000 cubic meters a year. Air Pollution As for environmental monitoring, the Company regularly measures stack-air quality to ensure that the total suspended particulate masses (TSPs), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are superior to those announced by the Ministry of Industry and as required in environment impact assessment (EIA) reporting. Because of its close proximity to communities and recognizing the importance of environmental quality, the Company uses clean fuels in its refining process and closely monitor emissions. Continuous Emission Monitoring (CEM) equipment was installed at the refinery’s emission stacks to monitor environment quality and pollutants in the exhausts at all times. Furthermore, the Company has set up two air quality monitoring stations near its neighborhood. The first checkpoint was at Somthawil School, the second checkpoint was set up at the Secretariat Department military housing units. All readings go to the monitors in the Process Control Room and air-quality analytical results are displayed together with those from the CEMs on automatic environment quality signboards installed at the entrance to the refinery and communities in its vicinity as well as in public areas, such as Piyarom Sports Club, for the public to monitor them at all times as well as for the comfort of the surrounding communities. Serious about ozone-depleting Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), the company has established VOC accounting. Its measurement of VOC emissions started in 2010. This year, the Company measured leaked volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from 90% of its machines, except for only the Distillation Unit 3, which started up in late 2012. Measurement showed only about 0.086% coming from significant leaks. The Company repaired these leaks within 15 days as required by law, thus making VOC measurements from its equipment superior to the standard.

The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 39 Water Pollution The Company houses high-efficiency wastewater treatment systems using closelymonitored online measurement devices. Effluent is tested daily by its Environmental Quality Analysis Laboratory, certified by the Department of Industrial Works, Ministry of Industry, and is ISO / IEC 17025-certified. Process water is treated physically, chemically and biologically until the quality exceeds the required standards before discharge through the Bang Aw Canal to the Chao Phraya River. In 2012, the Company discharged a total of 522,733 cubic metres of effluent. The Company is committed to the reduction of water consumption and effluent to save water and make the most efficient use of water. This year, BCP began constructing and installing an effluent water quality improvement unit with modern technology and Baht 214 million in investment to obtain quality water on a par with piped water for use in production processes. The goal was to lower the volume of wastewater and used water by 20%, and the plan was to begin partial implementation in 2013 and complete the construction in 2014. In addition, this year saw the Company attempt to lower environmental impacts arising from very dirty tank-cleaning water. Pre-treatment was first applied with activated carbon before discharging the water into the wastewater treatment system.

The final disposal was handled by the transporter and domestic disposal agents authorized by the Department of Industrial Works (DIW). This year the Company exported from its plants a total of 2,431 tons of waste, consisting of 1,739 tons of hazardous waste (71%) and 692 tons of non-hazardous waste (29%). Waste that underwent treatment and disposal through proper technical means was broken down as follows: 984 tons as replacement raw materials and furnace fuel, 164 tons as safe landfill, 1,077 tons sorted and reused, and 206 tons incinerated. Waste sorting was carried out for sale so that DIW-authorized treating agents could realize full monetary worth, which accounted for 44% of the total waste exported from the plants. This volume was higher than the previous year because this year the volume of waste (iron scrap, electrical wires, and aluminum) soared, following repair work in the wake of the incident of July 4, 2012. 40 Sustainability Report 2012 Industrial Waste by Category (Percentage) 55% 49% 45% 51% 29% 71% Hazardous Waste 2010 2011 2012 Non-hazardous Waste Unit : Tons Total Waste Hazardous Non-hazardous Treatment Method Volume Waste Waste Substitute raw materials and use as fuel in furnaces 984 953 31 Safe burial 164 164 Sorting and reuse 1,077 607 470 Others (including incineration) 206 179 27 Unit : Percentage Industrial waste disposal waste disposal 2010 2011 2012 Landfill 3 7 7 Incineration 72 65 49 Common wastewater treatment Segregated for recycling or reuse 25 28 44 Note : Definition of waste by regulation of Ministry of Industry Thailand There is no any significant incident involving oil spill in 2012. All situations that occurred in areas of refinery had been immediately under managed, controlled and recovered in line with SHEE laws and environmental regulations which have never been affected to water resources and environment at all. The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 41 Transport As a rule, crude oil transport is done by sea, since crude sources lie offshore and the cost is lower than by truck or train. Products of Bangchak Refinery in Bangkok were transported to the Bang Pa-in Oil Distribution Center by pipeline to cut energy consumption for transport and lessen traffic congestion before distribution to the Central Region, the North, and the Northeast by tank trucks. For Western Region and Southern destinations, products were transported by marine vessels to the Samut Sakhon and Surat Thani Oil Distribution Centers. The Company’s trucks run on the less-polluting biodiesel instead of normal diesel, and 16,000-litre trucks were replaced with 20,000-litre and 32,000-40,000 litre ones to lower the numbers of trips and lower fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission. This year saw products transported with 20,000-liters trucks accounting for 2% higher in volume than last year. Furthermore, all Bangchak oil trucks are GPS-monitored to control their speeds and reduce risks of accidents harming the environment. Every driver must undergo defensive driving training, and all trucks must be in working order. Emergency teams are required to be on alert, ready to move in to terminate or control the incidents potentially involving oil leaks. Besides, the Company invested in installing a transportation management system, which not only raised transport efficiency, but enabled it to control transport quality and safety of every Bangchak truck simultaneously nationwide. Compliance Compliance represents good governance and a health, safety, environment and energy (SHEE) policy element to which all employees and contractors working on behalf of the Company must pay attention and strictly adhere in their operations. Besides having a unit responsible for the follow-up, summary and compliance of new and draft laws on SHEE, there are at least two SHEE compliance audits every year conducted by internal and external auditors. The Company also has a legal office responsible for educating and generating awareness of rules and regulations to ensure compliance. The Company has never been fined or punished as a result of non-conformance to environmental laws or acts in violation of laws or regulations during transport. 42 Sustainability Report 2012 Environmental Cost Accounting Recognizing the value of environmental cost accounting in environmental management, resource consumption, and more efficient financial management, the Company has constantly engaged itself in environmental cost accounting-in keeping with its philosophy of “Creating an energy business that is environmentally friendly for sustainable development” -beginning with : 2005 : Initiated the practice for the production line 2008 : Entered data into an electronics system to enable reporting to the management and give units needing the data constant access 2009 : Expanded the reporting scope to the Bang Pa-in Oil Distribution Center. Ever since 2009, the Company’s environmental cost accounts have been established for external agencies and investors through the Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) report and the IR Newsletter every quarter of the year. In addition, such knowledge has been passed on to students and other interested agencies. For this year, such accounts saw a drop of Baht 4,563.44 million from last year. To explain this drop, this year the Company underwent a major maintenance turnaround of all refining units in the second quarter, and then there was a fire incident on July 4, which lowered the Company’s capacity to 73.7 thousand barrels per day, a drop of 12 thousand barrels per day from last year. Therefore, the cost of raw materials inherent in the products fell by Baht 4,745.98 million from the same period despite the rise in the average Dubai crude price from USD 106.56 per BBL last year to USD 109.13 per BBL. As for the cost of non-product raw materials, meaning process waste, this cost rose this year, primarily because of the rising cost (by 23%) and volume (by 42%) of slop oil that incurred rerun costs. This actually resulted from the two above-mentioned incidents. The overall expenses of pollution control apparatus rose by Baht 46.96 million with the apparatus repair incurred at the same time as the refining unit maintenance. Under the Company’s accounting standard, these expenses are to be recorded as assets, evident in the depreciation of the apparatus. Meanwhile, the apparatus maintenance costs dropped by some 38% because the Company was able to cut its effluent and treatment fees by over 12%, thanks to the biodiesel process modification that allowed reuse of waste. Environmentally speaking, besides expenses, the Company generated income from selling unused materials for raw materials for other industries, like glycerine obtained from the biodiesel unit, amounting to Baht 0.15 million more than last year, together with iron and aluminum scrap, which generated Baht 1.73 million more than last year.

This is why the Company has introduced eco-efficiency, an indicator that blends economic with environmental performance outcomes, with the adjusted EBITDA as an element of economic performance against the emission of carbon dioxide equivalent for the Company’s environmental impact. In other words, eco-efficiency rises with either improved economic performance or improved environmental impacts. This year, IRPC continuously carried out its project to lower greenhouse gas emission from several projects : refinery efficiency improvement, lowering of fuel and steam consumption, feeding of low-carbon raw materials to the hydrogen unit and low-carbon fuels to the furnace, and the maintenance turnaround of the Third Refining Unit. As a result, 1,036,978 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (TOCE). Yet, due to the declining adjusted EBITDA this year, the Company’s eco-efficiency registered a drop from last year. Eco-efficiency = Adjusted EBITDA (in Baht million) Carbon dioxide released (TOCE) Eco-efficiency (baht/TOCE) 2011 2012 Eco-efficiency 6,321 5,609 Note : Due to a scope change in BCP’s report on greenhouse gas emission and in the computation of greenhouse gas emission from the hydrogen unit, the value reported here for 2011 differs from what appeared in last year’s report. The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 45 Biodiversity While the Company continues its oil refining business, it exercises profound environmental stewardship to avoid making adverse impacts on biodiversity by monitoring, auditing, and ensuring acceptable environmental qualities both inside the refinery and in communities around the refinery by means of advanced online systems. While the refinery’s surroundings in Phra Khanong District of Bangkok are residential/urban nowadays, the Company continues to exercise its support and stewardship for the environment in both areas to keep them sound. To this end, it staged integrated activities like planting trees to add green areas around the housing areas of government officials attached to the Office of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Defence, to the east, next to its entrance fence, and garbage collection activities in the lower Chao Phraya River, to the west, next to its quay. The Company faces no risk of extinction of local plants and animals. In fact, thanks to Bangchak’s stewardship of the surroundings and nature, more than 70 species of local and migratory birds have made the refinery their habitat. The Company has continually invited the interested public to join its Ornithologist Club activities. It is common for Bangchak Refinery to host Because we’re one family: numerous birds on its compound. Based on the records of Bangchak Ornithologist Club, over the Good care of our homes years the refinery hosted no less than 70 species and surroundings enables of local and migratory birds. Although it is now us to look after local and perceived as an urban refinery, we’ve found birds migratory birds all year common to major urban public parks or suburban areas, round including coppersmith barbets, red-beasted parakeets, blossom-headed parakeets, black-collared starlings, vinous-breasted starlingors those that migrated from the North Pole. These birds make the refinery area their resting and energy-gathering places before heading back home-like common kingfishers, black capped kingfishers, black-naped orioles, asian emerald cuckoos, asian paradise-flycatchers, and brown shrikes. Sometimes we found birds not expected of urban areas, like brown hawk-owls and grey nightjars. This extreme rarity signified our environmental management and stewardship. Bangchak has supported elementary bird-watching activities so as to become a natural learning place for local youths and families to study the ecology and birds’ lives every year and has encouraged employees to volunteer for bird-watching activities organized by the Bird Conservation Society of Thailand or other conservation groups. Pannee Tangcharoenbamrungsuk Network Administration Division employee Chair, Bangchak Ornithologist Club 46 Sustainability Report 2012 Green Procurement Besides exercising environmental care inside the Company, the Company also supports its business partners to do so.The Company values the use of environmentally friendly products through its procurement of products, goods and services, known collectively as Green Procurement. This means that, besides the desired suitability of quality, prices, delivery and services, the Company examine the degree of environmentally friendly production (manufacturing). To elaborate, the life cycles of desired products and services must be compatible with the diagram below as well as socially responsible; business partners must run their businesses by the law, rules, government regulations and abide by labor and safety laws; in treating their employees, business partners must abide by a code of practice and respect for human rights, while avoiding child labor and alien labor.

In addition, the Company prefers cars running on E85, currently the cheapest fuel for motorists, since it commands the lowest price per gallon as well as the following characteristics: 1. Concern about the environment through its reduction of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide (which is at the root of the greenhouse effect), together with black smoke, aromatics, and benzene in emissions. 2. Reduction of oil imports, since ethanol in E85 can be produced domestically from agricultural produce, thus leading to greater energy independence. Octane boosters no longer need to be imported, saving Thailand more than Baht 3 billion a year. 3. Engine efficiency improvement, thanks to its octane rating of 105. 4. Clean burning and cooler burning than gasoline, since E85 burns more completely and with a lower combustion temperature than other fuels. 5. Reduced maintenance costs, meaning longer engine lives due to cleaner and more complete combustion. Photocopying paper The Company bought paper with the likes of the Green Label, produced from at least 30% eco-fiber. The colors used in such paper’s manufacturing process must be free of heavy metals like lead, mercury, cadmium and chromium (+6), must be certified ones or must conform to the Food and Drugs Administration of Thailand or a responsible agency in producing countries or the Green Label projects in other countries. Facial tissues and napkins These products featured 100% eco-fiber, which cut the use of trees in manufacturing processes. Water used in paper manufacturing processes must be free of heavy metals like lead, mercury, cadmium and chromium (+6), must be certified ones or must conform to the Food and Drugs Administration of Thailand or a responsible agency in producing countries or the Green Label projects in other countries. The products must not have bleaching agents containing elemental chlorine and halogens as a composition of the tissue-bleaching process.emental chlorine) 48 Sustainability Report 2012 Name cards Cream-colored the Company name cards, made from Green Card Paper featuring 100% eco-fiber, were not laminated. Wood furniture The Company furniture conformed to the universally-accepted EU Formaldehyde Emission Standard. E1-standard wood is toxic-free, containing as little as 0.005% chemicals for users’ safety. Correction fluids In the interest of users’ safety, the Company prefers Green Label products because correction fluids are the only stationery requiring the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s blessing, since a solvent in such fluids consists of gasoline and trichloroethane, which can harm the respiratory system and cause cancer. This is why correction fluids require FDA’s approval and a relevant Thai Industrial Standards Institute standard. Fluorescent bulbs/tubes Certified by TIS (Thai Industrial Standards) or bearing an international standard, these bulbs/tubes must be efficient with at least 10,000 hours of service life. They were not to contain more than 10 milligrams of mercury in each. Their containers must be made from recycled or corrugated paper of 100% eco-fiber. No foaming materials, laminates or raw materials containing plastics may form part of the containers. Measures must be established for the return of salvaged products and reused properly under technical principles. Cleaning agents These agents were to be natural extracts and biodegradable, without petrochemical solutions. They must not catch fire, be non-volatile and be deodorizing, and must save water in the cleaning process. Smart board Smart boards are a wood substitute containing no carcinogenic asbestos, but rather cellulose, to prevent physical impacts on users. Classified as Eco Use products with little or no impact resulting from application, smart boards are extended-life, ergonomic products requiring less energy. They are reusable, refillable, and degradable. The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 49 Cement The Company prefers cement with Carbon Label certification, which has the blessings of the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (Public Organization) (TGO) and the Thailand Environment Institute (TEI). A certified cement producer has followed greenhouse gas reduction measures in its cement production processes through reduction of electricity, energy, and process waste by 10% or more. Sanitary ware The Company prefers sanitary ware with Carbon Label certification, including toilet bowls and wash basins. In its production processes, raw material preparation, and transport, it is possible to cut greenhouse gas emission. Each Carbon Label shows the ability to cut such emission per unit product through life cycle assessment (LCA), ranging from raw-material preparation, production, application, and post-application management. Serving as an assessment tool for greenhouse gas emission to obtain a given product or service, LCA is shown in CO2 equivalent. Building paint The Company prefers paint certified with a Green Label or a Carbon Label. For a Green Label, the paint must be free of heavy metals, formaldehyde, and environment-impacting compounds. Carcinogenic formaldehyde could irritate the eye, skin, and respiratory tissues. To win a Carbon Label, the paint needs certification by TGO in conjunction with TEI for low greenhouse gas emission in the production processes per unit of goods or services. As for future Green Procurement, the Company will extend this list to promote Green Procurement markets for products and services to encourage producers and manufacturers to pay greater attention to green products. 50 Sustainability Report 2012 Development of Green Products and Services Thanks to Greenergy Excellence-which means striving for an environmentally friendly (“green”) energy business for the benefit of sustainable development together with the Company’s sustainable business, conducted hand in hand with the environment and society-the Company is constantly committed to alternative-energy leadership-whether in development of products and services, development of the image of service stations and their supplementary businesses, development of communication technology, or choice of community products as sales promotional giveaways, a unique feature of the Company. Comprehensive development of EURO IV fuel quality The Company successfully started selling its EURO IV gasoline, gasohol, and diesel ahead of the government’s deadline of January 1, 2012, with its first diesel on sale in 2008 and the rest in December 2011 in a bid to ease air pollution. Top market shares for E20 and E85 The Company promotes sales through marketing programs catering to consumers’ needs and constantly expanded its stations offering E20 and E85 gasohol to cover all regions of the country to accommodate more new vehicles running on alternative energy, thus maintaining its top market shares for both since 2010. In 2012, it topped the E85 market share as well as gasohol sales growth among oil companies.

In 2012, its GE PLATINUM gasoline-engine lubricant won API SN standard certification, today’s ultimate standard issued by The American Petroleum Institute, USA. Saving fuels, raising soot removal efficiency, lowering exhaust volumes, and preserving the surroundings, this product has also won standard certification for gasoline-engine lubricants: dexos1 of General Motors, presented by the Center for Quality Assurance, USA. Green lubricant design In 2012, the Company modified its lubricant container design, opting for functional design and attractive looks while paying due attention to the environment. The gallon container design now has 5% less HDPE, while the corrugated paper carton is now printed with water-based ink, a green fluid uncontaminated with chemicals, thus biodegradable and readily recyclable. A greater proportion of recycled paper is now seen in the Company’s corrugated paper cartons. Lubricant sales (thousand liters) 35,062 28,448 25,301 2010 2011 2012 52 Sustainability Report 2012 First Bangchak Green Station (Vibhavadi Rangsit Road branch) The Company launched a sizeable flagship service station on Vibhavadi Rangsit Road, Bangkok, with several highlights : sales of solely alternative-energy fuels, reliance on solar cells installed for its own power consumption (including stores), use of strictly energy-saving and environmentally friendly power appliances (like LED bulbs), and role as a basic learning source for alternative energy. The year also saw this very station win two awards, namely Pleasant Service Station under the Clean Bangkok Project and the sole winner of the Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health, award for clean toilets, marked by cleanliness, complete amenities, availability, clean smell, handicap-friendliness, and elderly-friendliness. Continued improvement of service station image Thanks to the Company’s quality improvement of its service station surroundings, today it has rebranded 181 standard service stations and 226 community service stations, for a total of 407 branches. In addition, it plans to revamp the image of service stations and supplementary businesses at these stations. In 2012, the Company joined Big C Supercenter in improving Mini Big C convenience stores at service stations to meet the needs of more patrons of service stations, with seven such stores in current operation. Consumers’ No.2 brand A third-party survey of the attitudes of 1,000 fuel patrons nationwide showed that Bangchak remained a Top 2 brand of choice among them for the fourth year running. This was attributed to its continual efforts to improve service station quality-whether it is image, fuel quality, services, forecourt, supplementary businesses, or ambience. The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 53 Development of mobile applications for iPhone and accommodation of Android system The Company recently began developing a mobile application for customers with iPhones who want to download applications to ease their search for nearby Bangchak service stations. In 2012, it remained committed to developing applications for iPhone and accommodating those using the Android system as well. It also added the ability to search for service station types selling assorted fuels, like E20 and E85, to further promote consumption of alternative energy. In addition, it added a search system for supplementary businesses like Baichak, Inthanin, and Green Series Car Care and added an alert system for oil price movement, and a system displaying promotional information, Bangchak ads, and information on benefits and privileges, as well as cumulative points of Bangchak card members. Fostering relations with customers through Bangchak Gasohol Club and Diesel Club cards The Company’s marketing program is a loyalty one (known as the Bangchak Gasohol Club), which this year saw some 550,000 cardholders, who are entitled to a Baht 0.20 per liter of gasohol and to the privileges under the Same Price Project. This means they can pay the same price one day after a price rise goes into effect. The year saw the Company further upgrade this privilege through the Value Points Project, under which members collect points not only from gasohol refueling but also from purchases of goods and services of supplementary businesses at service stations, namely Baichak, Inthanin, and Green Series Car Care. Cumulative points are good for discounts for both refueling and supplementary business purchases. To further promote alternative-energy consumption and accommodate mushrooming models of new cars under the government’s promotion this year, the Company launched a Double Point campaign for buyers of E20 gasohol by giving them a discount of Baht 0.40 per liter (as opposed to Baht 0.20 per liter) from June 5 to November 30, 2012. To foster customers’ continued loyalty to alternative energy and positive relations with cardholders, the Company organized activities for them, including visits to Royal Chitralada Projects, paying homage to Buddha images at Bang Nam Phueng, learning to make EM potions to help the Chao Phraya River stay clean, learning bouquet techniques, learning coffee-making, learning make-up techniques, watching movies, and arranging golf lessons with a professional (Pro Waen). In addition, the Bangchak Gasohol Club card project raised consumers’ awareness of environmental stewardship and enabled them to play a part in it by informing them on gasohol sales slips about the volume of carbon dioxide reduction achieved each time they refuel with an alternative-energy fuel. In early 2012, the Company launched the Diesel Club card for those patrons of its green, EURO IV diesel. Cardholders would enjoy Same Price and Value Points privileges in the same way as Bangchak Gasohol Club cardholders. Today the new card boasts 100,000 members. 54 Sustainability Report 2012 Bangchak Chueam Yong Thai with community service stations The Company issued Bangchak Chueam Yong Thai (Linking with Thais) cards for customers of cooperative service stations (the so-called community service stations) to promote sales and customer relationship activities suiting individual local areas. Besides boosting sales, thus strengthening these service stations, this move nurtures the community economy. Today, under an expanding headcount, more than 110,000 have joined the membership. Bangchak and the use of community products as giveaway items A distinct quality of the Company in choosing its sales promotional items at service stations lies in its promotion of community products of different provinces, a form of job creation and decentralization of income to strengthen community economies and lead to self-reliance. In 2012, two community products were featured. Luk Yee Kuan (sweetened velvet tamarind) was made by housewives in the three southernmost provinces. Agricultural produce under the Royal Project of Doi Kham Food Products Co., Ltd., under the operation of the Bureau of the Crown Property, was also featured. Customer satisfaction survey outcomes for 2012 This year, the Company (through a company called Idea 360 degrees) launched a customer satisfaction survey among 984 patrons of its service stations from May 24 to July 22, 2012. Customers scored the Company 5.56 out of a possible 7, or 79.4%. The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 55 Bangchak … my preferred service station When I think of service stations selling gasohol, Bangchak is always the first to come to mind. Of course, other brands have a variety to offer, but Bangchak focuses on gasohol, thus underlining its image for those preferring gasohol. Besides, Bangchak stations boast Bangchak Gasohol Club cards. Each time I fill my tank, I get points, which attract Bangchak users. Simply put, you pay the regular price for gasohol but your points can be redeemed-good as cash! It’s easier on the wallet if you’re a regular patron of Bangchak gasohol. Ms. Wannisa Uea-areeworakul, STGMM Co., Ltd. Costomer As a Thai company, BCP has won my trust, for we could do business while growing together. Its focus is on alternative energy, with a keen sense on the environment. Today, environmental matters are vital. The earth and the environment need sincerity toward each other. We can’t just let problems slip by, but must act sincerely, frequently, and spend time on them. I feel that Bangchak is ready and already pays attention to it. Bangkok has grown by leaps and bounds in residential areas. What used to be a suburban area, like the Bangchak refinery, has now become an urban neighborhood. BCP should therefore focus on how to live alongside communities, for instance, by regularly engaging in activities with them and taking their safety to heart or engaging them in emergency drills together. I love the idea of using community goods as sales promotional Mr. Pattanachai Thanasiri giveaways, as do most other Bangchak patrons. The Company Service station operator, should inform people more through various magazines so as Baw Nam Man Co., Ltd., Pathum Thani to reach more customers. 56 Sustainability Report 2012 Communication Customers can inquire about and search for product information by reading product and service labels, and accessing marketing information at the Bangchak customer service center, manned by officers that have passed standard training on communication with customers while taking into account human rights. Customers get fair treatment in their search, apart from accurate, useful and not misleading information; the Company officers also listen to recommendations while remaining prepared to cater to customers’ needs and keeping their data confidential. Finally, communication is done through the Company website and online social networks, including Facebook. Other operations in marketing and advertising did not violate the laws, also no complaints on privacy right of customers. Safety, health and environment Recognizing the criticality of safety, health and environmental standards, the Company has installed vapor recovery systems at the Bangchak oil depot on Sukhumvit 64 Road and the Bang Pa-in oil depot in addition to all service stations in Bangkok and its perimeter in an effort to bolster confidence among depot and service station users. Emergency drills regularly take place. Bangchak service stations house wastewater treatment systems before releasing effluent to the outside, looks after the cleanliness of toilets, lawns, trees, drainage and garbage sorting and disposal. As a result, the Company has never faced any compliance issue and has never been subjected to significant fines or liability for damages arising from unsafe products.

Its employees and contract employees must be at least 20 years old. It has no policy of hiring child labor or practicing forced labor or gender discrimination. As for contract employees, it requires that contractors treat their workers as required by labor laws, social security, compensation laws and others related to labor protection. Otherwise, contractors will be regarded as violating their contracts, for which the Company can revoke their contracts without prior notice. Weekly training is given by the Safety Section to contractors and safety officers before the start of work on matters related to the Company’s safety, environment and energy, goals, policies and regulations to minimize operation risks due to incompatible procedures. Emphasis is given on the respect of human rights to minimize risks resulting from a lack of understanding that could lead to unfair treatment, visitors’ or stakeholders’ safety concerns. Compensation Management The Company’s compensation management is administered with fairness, suitability to the employees’ responsibilities and competence. The Company has also adjusted its compensation to compete with peer companies and attract competent people to work with it and stimulate current employees to improve their performances. The Company’s performance appraisal system has clear criteria according to KPIs so that both superiors and subordinates may share understanding, leading to both job and employee improvement. In line with the changing social, economic and business circumstances, the Company has provided more extensive welfare for employees and their families than that required by the law. This year, the Company improved its welfare schemes to suit current economic circumstances and be comparable to peer companies, including raising the ceiling for medical care expenses for employees and families, shift pay, lodging and pay for provincial work, among others, to boost employee morale and strengthen employee engagement. Besides the normal welfare, during the spread of epidemics such as the 2009 flu, the Company provided vaccination to all employees. It also provided hand-gel in buildings, distributed masks and campaigned for the prevention. Those diagnosed with potential 2009 flu infection could be excused from work with pay. It also focused on employees’ physical wellbeing through activities like anti-obesity and waistline reduction for shapely wellbeing, promotion of food quality from Bangchak Kitchen, and expansion of annual check-ups to suitably cover each age group. As a result, employees have become healthier and stronger, with fewer sick days and no record of occupational diseases. Upon the retirement, the Company provides employee several forms of welfare such as pension, regulatory compensation and provident fund.

Its assorted activities have one common goal: to cultivate virtues and keen awareness of fellow employees, the organization and society at large. This year, the Company elevated employee relations to employee engagement under three phases: Phase 1, “ASK” Make plans so as to decide the factors affecting employee engagement; design survey questions test, try, and refine these questions until a questionnaire that reflects such engagement emerges and conduct the survey across the organization. Phase 2 “ANALYZE” Summarize and analyze survey outcomes against past records, and benchmark them with leading organizations in Thailand and peer companies (those in the petroleum business worldwide) to develop organizational improvement and development plans. Phase 3 “ACT” Improve and develop the organization; monitor development outcomes and inform employees.

Based on employee engagement survey outcomes, the Company has developed the following activities : Executive Development on Human Resource Management All executives-from section heads to the President-are to be developed to manage people so that they may appreciate different needs among people and nurture surroundings that favor employee engagement. This year, the Company encouraged its senior executives to undergo external training to promote their leadership potential and forge networks with external organizations through the likes of a higher certificate on public administration and public laws, Director Certificate Program, and Senior Executive Program. Employee Welfare Improvement To ease employees’ healthcare burdens, the Company raised medical care and dental care allowances to include employees’ family members. Such improvement was carried out by raising the ceiling for medical care expenses for employees and families, extension of healthcare entitlement for parents to medical care as private hospitals’ outpatients, adjustment in travel expenses for employees, and an increase in shift pay. The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 65 In addition, the Company retained these core employee relations activities: Employees’ birthdays: BCP asked employees with birthdays in the same months to jointly perform religious ceremonies, dine, and engage in public services by visiting communities around the refinery. Songkran water-pouring: This allowed employees to pass on fine Thai traditions by staging a water-pouring ceremony where the Board Chairman and the President wished employees well on the traditional Thai New Year. Bangchak family day: This allowed executives, employees, and their families to meet and engage in activities for good fun and cordial relations among all. BCP founding day: On the founding day this year, the management and employees together engaged in alms-giving to 59 monks. Thank You Party: At this party, BCP thanked all employees for their hard work and dedication through the year. Bangchak Petroleum Plc Labor Union All the Company employees are treated fairly and enjoy equal rights under Company regulations, whether they belong to the labor union or not. Set up under the law with 20% of the workforce as its members, Bangchak Petroleum Plc Labor Union cooperates with the Company in looking after employees’ well-being through regular consultations with top management while getting feedback from employees about their needs to develop the Company’s labor aspects. The president quarterly communicates business performance and variation of the Company to all employees by “PS meet employees”. The Company also instituted an Employee Committee, consisting of 13 employee representatives appointed by the labor union and coming from employee elections. The committee is engaged in consultations with representatives from top management on matters of welfare and benefits to ensure their suitability. To date, the consultation sessions went well, with all concerns or queries properly addressed, thus resulting in high employee satisfaction. Employee Satisfaction (Percentage) 87.11 90.58 81.75 2010 2011 2012 66 Sustainability Report 2012 Employees’ Clubs The Company encourages the establishment of employees’ clubs to enable those with similar interests to form clubs focusing on their interests to support employees’ learning to responsibly engage in work processes together through different club activities for physical exercise, recreation and public services, including various sports clubs, Ornithologist (bird study) Club, Bangchak Thai Marine Conservation Club, Bangchak Loves Community Club, Photography Club, Music Club, and Volunteer & Social Development Club. Employees can freely initiate activities for their own benefit in line with the Company culture. Lunch Project for Needy Children This project arose from employees’ conscience and culture of “contributive to society”. In view of food shortages and malnutrition among society’s children (particularly those in the refinery neighborhood) employees each donate a small sum of money deducted from their salaries. Regularly and constantly since 1988 others have donated money on special occasions to support the lunch project for schools that still need it. Currently 16 schools and one foundation are part of this project. Mutual care and concern I’ve been working here for over two decades, of which the endear Bangchak to us last decade was also spent as a member of the employee committee. All along, I’ve been touched by the concern expressed by executives for employees and their families, who are expected to live their lives amid good surroundings with physical and mental preparedness. Bangchak cultivates in employees habits like money-saving, sufficiency, and social service in ways we can, while taking care of our communities and the environment. Concern about fellow employees and executives has somehow increased our engagement, love, and sense of belonging to Bangchak. One impression and success indicator about employee engagement is evident in everyone’s unity and collaboration in hard times, whether you’re talking about flood prevention or about overcoming problems and repairing the refinery fast, efficiently, and safely. I’m most touched by the image of executives visiting our sites and earnestly engaging in genuine dialogues everyday. As Bangchak’s 29th anniversary draws near, our Pairat Kaewsila performance has improved by leaps and bounds, and our growth Machinery Section has been somewhat steady. In short, I’m confident that we’ll Maintenance Service Division Head of the Employee Committee and be working in this home with reasonable security. Manager of the Bangchak Youth Soccer Club The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 67 Employee Development The Company is continuously focusing on employee’s development in order to promote potentiality, competitiveness at the international level and valuable society members. Its culture is based on the concept of “being virtuous, knowledgeable and contributive to the society”, leading to a company of excellence. In addition, the Company regards it as everyone’s responsibility to develop and promote knowledge sharing among its personnel. Competency management, the principle used by the Company to develop its personnel, begins with individual competency assessment to identify competency gaps. This year, the Company’s assessment improved to the from 180-degree to the 360-degree variety-consisting of joint assessment among staff, their superiors, and third-party superiors-for clearer and more efficient assessment together with individual development plans to fill each person’s gap. Besides individual development, BCP has instituted team development through crossfunctional cascade projects designed to capitalize on the talents of employees of each professional line and have them work together on projects to grow the market and new projects, leading to competition and corporate innovations. Other instances included group activities on quality control (the Quality Control Circle (QCC) technique), KAIZEN group activities, and activities associated with the Community of Practices (CoPs) which enable knowledge-sharing among those of the same professions or those with similar interests-this is part of knowledge management leading to lifelong learning. The Company amended its system for seeking approval, data compilation, reporting, and result monitoring for training for easier retrieval and a shortened process. This year, the Company continually designed and improved training curricula to cater to corporate goals and directions (short-term and long-term) and develop its personnel’s knowledge, skills, and experience so that they might command specialized, technical, and management knowledge, and the knowledge needed to accommodate emerging businesses. Below are the highlights of BCP’s curricula improvement this year: 1. Orientation and BCP Way : This training informed newcomers about corporate expectations and provided them with an overview of the Company’s businesses so that they might master and adjust to the culture, vision, mission, values, policies, and business processes to maintain efficiency as well as love, engagement, and happiness at work. 2. BCP Business Supply Chain Economics : This training concerned the principles of the oil and alternative-energy businesses related to the Company in economics and costs, ranging from supply procurement, production, sales, delivery, to the related business environment, product knowledge, planning, procurement, and production processes. 3. BCP Technical Development Program : This training prepared newcomers and those with little experience in operation, engineering, maintenance, and technical aspects to learn and review current apparatus and hone their skills so that they might become self-reliant and cope with present and future assignments. 68 Sustainability Report 2012 Bangchak Way: Putting its heart in molding its people Bangchak’s strength lies in its people. After all, Bangchak puts its heart in molding its people, who are members of a big, growing family. True, we’re not gigantic, but we do have our identity: Bangchak people are always concerned about one another. A true friend can always be found here. Employees receive decent welfare and constantly see their executives’ role models in thinking, managing, and dedicating themselves, which in turn influence my style. Bangchak puts its heart in taking care of employees to take the company to great things together. When it celebrated its 28th anniversary, I recounted Bangchak’s push through increasingly challenging policies and goals. Despite hindrances along the way, never has Bangchak given up. I am as old as the company (28 years old) and am Trip Kiratibutra convinced that the Bangchak Centenary is bound Analyst, Corporate Strategy Division to happen-although I’m unlikely to be there to Corporate Administration and Information celebrate with the company! Well, better for the Technology younger generation to absorb the Bangchak Way and celebrate for me. As for specialized curricula, besides what the Company organized in response to the needs of various units (like finance, marketing, law, safety, and environment), it encouraged employees to get outside training to share views, knowledge, and experience with external agencies. In addition, the Company organized training on the respect for human rights, as done every year, including changes in plans and policies for investment in provident funds, labor laws, and laws dealing with investment and labor in AEC member countries. It also supported seminars and study tours so that employees might share knowledge and experience with those from other organizations and then apply them for the Company’s benefit. The average number of training hours per person this year was 71. The Company’s critical courses dealt with English (spoken and written) to accommodate Thailand’s approach to AEC. Others included the Executive Development Program, Senior Executive Program, Advanced Senior Executive Program, improvement of business processes, innovation for organizational sustainability, safety officer (management level), hazard identification through HAZOPS, defensive driving, BCP Culture CSR, corporate governance, risk management, and organizational management for excellence. The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 69 Training hours per Person by Level (hours) 82 26 49 35 29 33 43 8 15 22 73 53 53 20 16 Level 1-2 Level 3-4 Level 5-6 Level 7-9 Level 10-13 2010 2011 2012 Training Expenses (million baht) 33.5 26.15 21 14 2009 2010 2011 2012 The Company’s employee development policy is to undertake projects using cross-functional teams and formation of CoPs without relying on direct training. This form of personnel development calls for more development hours and lower training expenses. Skill Development and Lifelong Learning The Company emphasized on knowledge management, so that it has set an objective of being a learning organization, defining the direction by searching for and setting the structure and scope, managing, collecting and transferring knowledge, as well as promoting knowledge sharing among employees and to external organizations. This year, BCP participated in knowledge-sharing activities among PTT Group in knowledge management (KM) activities and CoPs on operational excellence, engineering, human resources, and finance, accounting, and taxes, among others. The ultimate aim was to apply the knowledge gained and evolve it into best practices to create innovations useful for BCP’s businesses and business improvement. Improvement and development of the KM Web format for modernity, simplicity of use, and familiarity enabled greater search from various archives. BCP founded Blog Awards to encourage employees to share stories and knowledge through their own weblogs, a useful channel for knowledge and experience-sharing. Moreover, the Company has set up the BCP Trainer Project, under which the development of an employee is undertaken by another employee. The coaching project allows employee specializing in given fields to transfer tacit to explicit knowledge. This way, the knowledge remains in the Company and employees can fill in for others. It is also an opportunity for employees to regularly exercise and review their own knowledge and experience. Some knowledge that has been transferred including environment, safety, information and technology, accounting and corporate social responsibility. 70 Sustainability Report 2012 Career Development Career development is a process which derives from a plan for manpower, capability and competence in line with the Company’s strategies, directions and objectives.

But what makes me very proud is the image of Bangchak and communities. It’s engaged in so many public services as opposed to pure profit-making. To begin with, Bangchak joined communities in launching community service stations. It’s also a leader in alternative energy that strives to bolster energy security through nature’s own energy and agricultural produce. Bangchak’s activities strengthen children’s knowledge foundations of nature and energy saving, so that children may one day become adults with an understanding of energy production and consumption Withoon Phuengprasert to accommodate future change-this development is crucial Senior Editor, Komchadluek Newspaper to society as a whole. In short, Bangchak is a corporation with a clear role in this aspect. I’m impressed with Bangchak’s executives that took the company out of the economic crisis in 1997, turning a crisis into an opportunity-a grave burden into the development of one of Thailand’s most sophisticated refineries today. Speaking of Bangchak, what come to my mind are alternative energy, business transparency, and environmental friendliness-all these qualities are already impressive. I just want Bangchak to keep it up, like the lasting quality of salt, and never give in to obstacles. You have my moral support!

This has been our practice for the past 28 years of business existence. To play a more intensive role in community participation and social development, the Company has elevated its efforts focusing on participation by inducing the capability of target groups and encouraging initiatives and actions on their own to form a learning process at work and developing the ability to solve problems by themselves, thus leading to self-reliance. This is why the Company has driven participation by target groups in all communities and society (immediate and remote) through the extension of projects presented in its Project Citizen last year and environmental projects, which form the Company’s corporate culture that seeks to expand its network and new, more diverse projects. While the Company has survived the incident at the Distillation Unit 3, which affected its business and its neighbors alike, thanks to the readiness of equipment, prudent management, and personnel’s dedication, the Company promptly responded to the incident, both internally and externally. These included visits to all residences to express its profound apology and the offer of prompt repair to those that sustained damage, thus easing their concerns and gaining their confidence in our responsibility and timely management. As a result of this incident, the Company has also added measures and secured the best available international experts to audit and improved its work and safety processes beyond international standards adopted by other refineries. In addition, the Company clearly informed its stakeholders-particularly its refinery’s neighbors-of news and information about various measures,. 82 Sustainability Report 2012 Communities and society around the refinery In defining its strategies here, the Company reviewed its own strengths, the ISO 26000 standard, and community needs. This year it elevated its work to focus on community participation for sustainable, self-reliant society by allowing communities to initiate and benefit from their proposed projects. Simply put, the Company is now a project mentor rather than a player, an operating partner rather than a giver or taker. The origins of Bangchak’s community relations and social responsibility activities have given rise to assorted projects Origin Policy/approach New project in 2012 • Corporate strength / • Leadership in alternative-energy development • Buying of used vegetable oil from markets culture and CSR role model and communities around the refinery • Two environmental seminars (Floods, Earth• Forging understanding of and confidence in quakes : Taking Thailand beyond Natural refinery safety systems Disasters & Development of Thailand’s EIAs toward ASEAN) • Education on safety systems at the refinery and the quay, and inspection of equipment readiness, proper handling of incidents, and employee capability to foster confidence in the Company’s safety in emergencies • Education on chemical knowledge and chemical safety All along, I’ve developed fond feelings for Bangchak because of its genuine recognition of communities. In times of community trouble, Bangchak consistently came to the rescue of people of all ages. Its assorted activities range from education, sports, knowledge about the health of the elderly, to the cataract surgery project-all these we’ve really appreciated. BCP’s genuinely lovable and down-to-earth employees constantly visit communities, impressing us all. To state the quality of Bangchak in another way, I’d call Bangchak a GIVER, who values others with genuine, lasting concern, CONSISTENT for its better and better projects, and a RELATIVE, who acts like a brother with care and love for each other, day in, day out.

Instances were the Thai Puppet Local Wisdom Project, Phun Sin Sang San Siraphon Project at Phun Sin School, Robots and Electronics for Education at Phra Khanong Phitthayalai School, and a project to develop learning centers under the Economic Sufficiency philosophy at Wat Nam Phueng Nok School. Bangchak Youth Scholarship Project : The Company has been committed to supporting and giving new academic opportunities to Thai youths, especially those with good grades and good behavior but coming from poor families. It has provided scholarships for seven consecutive years now to students from the primary level to university level selected from the 20 schools under the Company’s Lunch program and from the communities around the refinery (at the discretion of the community committees and school directors). A total of 563 scholarships valued at over 2 million baht have been awarded. Bangchak GIFTED Project : Bangchak values the laying of a strong academic foundation for schoolchildren in grade 5 with outstanding scholastic records through the captioned project. Selected students are given a special tuition in Mathematics, Science, Social study and the English language every day after school. Mention the word Bangchak, and I’d suddenly think about the surroundings. I’m impressed with Bangchak Refinery as an environmental role model for communities by cultivating awareness and environmental stewardship in them. After all, a good environment implies a good quality of life. For one thing, Bangchak’s environmental stewardship has enabled us to watch birds on the refinery’s compound, which is not just a knowledge center, but a role model for this community and Thai society. Having worked with Bangchak for roughly a decade, I’ve witnessed development in its continual activities conducted with communities-which underscore its dedication and earnest intention, starting from the initiation, assessment, to development of activities. Working with Bangchak, it’s clear that it has genuine friendship to offer along with the spirit of a mentor. Besides direct knowledge, Bangchak constantly supports, helps, and learns with us. Its people’s smiles are always there when we work together. In other words, this Thai service station brand has been Thais’ true friend all along. Sunee Summa Director, The Bangchak (Nak Puen Uppathum) School 86 Sustainability Report 2012 Safety Bangchak’s Concern about Safety in Schools, Communities, and Condominiums : The Company encourages its neighbors to learn about and be prepared for assorted emergencies, emergencies, including fires, chemical spills, and natural catastrophes. It supplies fire extinguishers and repairs existing apparatus. This was an ongoing project to educate students and enable them to survive emergencies. Sports The Ninth Bangchak Youth Futsal Tournament Project The Company organized the annual Bangchak Youth Futsal Tournament, in its Ninth year, to give youths a platform for developing sporting skills; promote physical strength, discipline and sportsmanship ; deter youths from using drugs and allow a sharing of experiences when they compete with other schools. It also organized a team cheering competition to allow youths to creatively express themselves. This event was participated in by 29 schools from various districts of Bangkok Metropolis. Bangchak Youth Sports Camp The Company, together with the Royal Thai Navy Department of Welfare, organized the Bangchak Youth Sports Camp to teach sports to encourage youths around the refinery to spend their school breaks wisely ; promote physical, mental, and emotional health and deter them from drugs and broaden their non-classroom experience. The project also enhances sporting and togetherness spirit among community children. The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 87 Quality of Life Waen Kaeo for students in schools located around Bangchak refinery : The Company in conjunction with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand and the Waen Kaeo Project dispatched a complimentary optometrist unit to serve 600 students in schools located around the refinery to solve eyesight problems and raise the learning capability of youths. Cataract surgery for community patients : The Company’s policy is to develop and promote decent quality of life for its neighbors, an extension of the Waen Kaeo Project. Together with Ban Phaeo Hospital, it therefore dispatched a complimentary unit to screen cataract patients for surgery. A total of 18 patients underwent such surgery. One Family, Year 19 : The Company promoted family and inter-family activities with a focus on physical and mental wellbeing through its promotion of knowledge and understanding of good physical and mental health care. It also promoted hands-on learning activities with guidance by experts in various fields and by employees that were skillful in the likes of Bangchak Yoga, Wonders of Messaging, Spiritual and Physical Forces Bring Happiness and Success, Project to Promote Volunteering by knitting balaclavas for victims of the cold in the North and the Northeast, and Do It Yourself, which included decoupage cardboard box-making and making of cloth key rings. 88 Sustainability Report 2012 Environment Sapling Planting, Phu Long Reforestation and Thot Pha Pa, Raksa Ton Nam (Monk Robe Offering, Keeping Water Source) Projects : Convinced of the inter-relationship among all lives and the environment, the Company recognizes the need to take care of the environment (forests in particular), which makes living things’ existence sustainable. It values activities and work procedures that conserve nature and the environment by cooperating with the Phu Long Reforestation Project of Sukhato Temple and Mahawan Temple, Chaiyaphum, in conserving the Lam Pathao watershed (Phu Long), storing and reforesting the area. In this seventh year, six schools from the refinery’s surrounding communities and two local schools joined the program and produced 6,000 saplings each year (covering roughly 21 rai) to teach children the importance of conserving forests and engage them in the forest conservation effort. In addition, students joined the Company staff in taking the saplings to Phu Long Forest and offering robes to monks to raise funds to monitor the Phu Long Forest area and Mahawan Forest Temple in Chaiyaphum, where two revered monks (Kham Khian Suwanno and Paisarn Wisalo) are the abbots. Promotion of Environmental Awareness and Management in Schools : This collaboration between schools and the Company under the Bangchak Promotes, Schools Create Project saw schools conceive activities to develop and improve the surroundings of schools and communities, with students managing projects, including a project to restore clear water for Bang Na Canal by Wat Bang Na Nok School, a project on garbage sorting by Wat Bang Nam Phueng Nok School and Bangchak School, a project on EM potion-making, a project on junior botanists by Bangchak School, and a project to cut energy consumption by Rung Rueng Upatham School and Wat Bang Na Nai (Ruen Sayamanon) School. Public Park : In conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, the Company planted trees and landscaped some 2 rai of land into a public health park to serve as a green patch for the people of Phra Khanong around the housing area of the Secretariat Department, Office of the Permanent Secretary, in Bangchak. Trees were planted by employees, residents, and military officers on World Environment Day. The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 89 Relations and Cultural Conservation Community house calls : Recognizing the value of Thainess, the Company staged activities to conserve Thai culture by asking employees to pay the refinery’s neighbors a visit on significant occasions like the New Year, Songkran (the traditional Thai New Year), and Mother’s Day. Mobile Communities Project : This project is in its forth consecutive year. The Company this year took 80 elderly people living around the refinery to pay homage to Buddhist relics in Suphan Buri on Songkran Day (Traditional Thai New Year’s Day) and visit the century-old Sam Chuk Market. Khrop Khrua Bai Mai Bulletin and Rop Rua Bangchak Newsletter : The Company produces Khrop Khrua Bai Mai bulletins and Rop Rua Bangchak newsletters to pass along assorted information. This year, the bulletin focused upon the environment and disasters to alert people and educate them on the changing nature as a result of global warming in an effort to encourage people to mitigate impacts. The bimonthly periodical has 4,800 subscribers, and information appearing in the bulletin is posted on Facebook. Taking Kids to Movies : In supporting non-academic learning for those around its refinery, the Company organized a “Taking Kids to Movies” activity for 300 children and parents from eight neighboring communities at a special screening of “Madacusca3 and Ecco”, a film that depicts a part of the Thai history to cultivate patriotic and unity spirit in the children. National Children’s Day : Out of its love, care, and recognition of children’s significance as our nation’s future, the Company staged the National Children’s Day event to give children entertainment, knowledge, and arcade games fitting age groups, along with many gifts and a lot of food and drinks under the “Kids protect the world” theme, with more than 5,000 participating neighbors. Economic The Company continued to provide income to the communities around its refinery by ordering food, sweets and drinks for its assorted activities and hired local people to deliver Khrop Khrua Bai Mai bulletins to the refinery’s neighboring residents. In addition, the Company gave special hiring considerations to those interested, qualified community members at both the Company and Bangchak service stations. 90 Sustainability Report 2012 Remote Communities and Society Remote communities Aspect Target Continuing project Education and Restoration of well-behaved youths to society; • Thailand Go Green 2012 Contest Project under the awareness of environmental stewardship; “Combating Catastrophes with Alternative-energy environment knowledge of alternative energy and Innovations” catastrophes; promotion of sufficiency, • Good Intellects to Society Project (a short film called integrity, and volunteering for public services “Love Project … from the Heart of a Good Guy”) • BCP Talent Internship Program • BCP Open House: Sunny Bangchak Socioeconomic Mutually beneficial businesses to form • 584 cooperative service stations nationwide networks linking community organizations • Promotion of local community products as business networks, thus strengthening communities and developing human potential for self-reliance under Economic Sufficiency philosophy Environment and Thais’ recognition of environmental • A project to buy used vegetable oil for biodiesel stewardship and knowledge as a form of production society immunity in times of catastrophes, particularly • “Thais’ Handbook for Disaster Response, Read before floods, which have ravaged Thailand most Water Revisits” often Speaking to Bangchak, I feel we’re of the same tongue. What the company has been doing are already good, but I’d say it should do better because of its great potential-and it should tag along other companies! My advice is to start with a clear concept, not just activities. Dr. Qwanruedee Chotichanathawewong President, Thailand Environment Institute The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 91 Education Thailand Go Green 2012 Contest : Combating Catastrophes with Alternative-energy Innovations : This continuing project was designed to identify the best of youths in alternative energy to win a trophy bestowed by HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn and scholarships amounting to Baht 2 million together with a study tour to Japan. To achieve this, the Company called for students to master knowledge of local natural catastrophes and how to survive them through innovations on alternative energy. A moderator provided knowledge on how to combat catastrophes for students to spread such knowledge in schools and communities through suitable modes of learning, including internet-based photos of catastrophes, a song entitled “Learning to Combat Catastrophes”, and campaigns and exhibitions publicizing innovations on alternative energy among network schools and communities around schools. This was an extension of knowledge and a promotion for Thailand to go green through the past six years. This year’s contest saw nearly 700 schools apply, and students managed to spread such knowledge to some 2,200,000 others in neighboring communities and schools. Good Intellects to Society (a short film called “Love Project … from the Heart of a Good Guy”) : To improve society’s quality of life while encouraging youths to become aware of environmental stewardship and how to lead lives with sufficiency, honesty, integrity, and with a volunteering spirit, the Company produced a short film to cultivate five key elements of knowledge, namely the environment, effective consumption of energy, social responsibility, good governance, and Economic Sufficiency philosophy. These will forge immunity for people and their respective organizations, thus leading to sustainability. The film was shown at Inthanin Coffee outlets, run by the Company and located in public and private universities nationwide, Bangchak service stations, department stores, hospitals, and offices. 92 Sustainability Report 2012 Economic Community Service Station / รูปเกษตรกร สินค้าชุมชน (น�้ำสตรอเบอร์รี่, ลูกหยีกวน) Cooperative service stations : These stations originated from the idea of fuel barter with rice, a sharing and barter of necessities for life, by the Si Prachan Agricultural Cooperative of Amphoe Si Prachan, Suphan Buri province. The Company first donated the rice to student lunch programs at schools located around the refinery, whereas cooperatives sold bartered fuels to their members. This trust between communities and the Company has since developed the barter trade into modern trade formatted by service stations belonging to cooperatives and community service stations. Today, 578 community service stations are owned by community members, with others serving as station members. Such is a unique business with a concept and culture of mutual support, which encourage Thais to form business networks. Besides generating income from fuel sales, community members derive year-end bonuses for their families, thus not only benefiting economically but also forging community strength and self-reliance. This year saw a total sales turnover by such service stations of over 62 million liters a month, or about 28% of the Company’s nationwide sales turnover. Fuel sales through cooperative service stations (Million liters/month) 52 53 62 2009 2010 2012 Promotion of local community products : The Company’s unique choice of sales promotional items continually focuses on promoting provincial community items. This promotion of local jobs indeed enables communities to rely on themselves and command self-sufficiency. This year two such products were highlighted, namely sweetened velvet tamarind from more than 2,000 households in the three southernmost provinces (Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat) and Doi Kham strawberry juice from Chiang Mai province under the operation of the Bureau of the Crown Property, totaling 614,412 cartons, which supported some 100 farmers’ households in the Upper Northeast, namely Sakhon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom, Mukdahan, Amnat Charoen and Kalasin. The Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited 93 Environment Environmental technical seminar : The Company values education and helpful data to brace the public for catastrophes, particularly the tendencies of those catastrophes in certain parts of the world and Thailand, to ensure their understanding of global climate change, global warming, and impacts of catastrophes, particularly floods. It organized a seminar entitled “Floods, Earthquakes: Taking Thailand beyond Natural Disasters”. Its free publication entitled “Thais’ Handbook for Disaster Response, Read before Water Revisits” (300,000 volumes, in both Thai and English) was distributed to the interested public and posted on Facebook as well as the Company’s website for free downloading. Besides, BCP organized a seminar entitled “Development of Thailand’s EIAs toward ASEAN” to provide an approach for operators required to prepare good EIA reports. At the seminar, technical views were shared to further develop formats of EIA reports commissioned by the private sector and the deliberation process of the public sector. That way, project development could be simplified and shortened to give projects a competitive edge once AEC comes into force, so that projects may prove both good and green. A project to buy used vegetable oil for biodiesel production : Continually, BCP has proactively run this project, under which volunteering employees have ventured into Bangkok markets to buy used vegetable oil, alternating between Saturdays and Sundays for the sixth year. They urged vendors and the public to join hands in this environmental stewardship move and look after their own health by selling the oil to BCP for biodiesel production. 94 Sustainability Report 2012 Awards of 2012 The year 2012 saw continual recognition of the Bangchak Petroleum Plc, by the public as well as various entities, as a company with transparent corporate governance and management with efficiency, social responsibility, and environmental awareness. • SET Awards of Honor, presented at the SET Awards 2012 event, organized by the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and Finance and Banking Magazine: Top Corporate Governance Report Award, in its seventh straight year.
