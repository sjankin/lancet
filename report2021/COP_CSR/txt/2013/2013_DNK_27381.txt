6 August 2013 CEO STATEMENT As Managing Director of Iver C. Weilbach & Co. A/S, I would like to express the company’s continued support and commitment to the UN Global Compact. As a small company our ability to influence global society is limited, but by joining with other companies in this initiative we feel that a significant impact can be achieved. By renewing our commitment to the UN Global Compact we pledge to incorporate the ten principles within the areas of Human Rights, Labour, the Environment and Anticorruption, into our business practices. In addition, we will collaborate with our customers, suppliers, business partners, subcontractors and other stakeholders to promote the UN Global Compact, and address potential issues in our sphere of influence. Sincerely Torben Frerks Managing Director UN Global Compact Communication on Progress (COP) In 2011, we held an internal Weilbach workshop to address the UN Global Compact’s ten principles. Amongst other things we:  Mapped and prioritized company critical issues across the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, both internally and in the value chain  Developed a strategy and determined the actions to be taken for the prioritized areas (policy, targets, performance indicators, outcomes) During this workshop it was decided that although we would address all of the ten principles, our main focus initially would be on two areas: Labour (principles 3,4,5, and 6) and the Environment (principles 7,8 and 9). These principles were deemed to be the most relevant for our company and areas where we could make the greatest impact. The UN Global Compact Management Tool and the Global Reporting Initiative have been used for guidance. Human Rights PRINCIPLE 1 BUSINESSES SHOULD SUPPORT AND RESPECT THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY PROCLAIMED HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLE 2 MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES Focus area Weilbach has developed a policy addressing Human Rights, which is in line with the UN Global Compact. Initially we have focused on three areas: 1. Health and Safety. 2. Wages. 3. Working Hours. Internal initiatives Our own operations are covered by Danish legislation for the Human Rights area. In addition to following legislation, we have voluntarily implemented: 1. A safety team to deal internally with Health and Safety issues. 2. Health insurance to all our employees. External initiatives We have stated to inform our business partners about our policy, and started conducting assessment on the human rights risks within our sphere of influence. Year Number of audits 2010/11 0 2011/12 1 2012/13 2 Labour PRINCIPLE 3 BUSINESS SHOULD UPHOLD THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND THE EFFECTIVE RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF FORCED AND PRINCIPLE 4 COMPULSORY LABOUR PRINCIPLE 5 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOUR PRINCIPLE 6 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT OF EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION Focus area Weilbach has developed a policy based on the UN Global Compact’s principles addressing Freedom of Association, the Elimination of all forms of Forced or Compulsory Labour, the Abolition of Child Labour, and the Elimination of Discrimination in respect to employment and occupation. Internal initiatives As almost all Weilbach employees are located in Denmark, they are covered by the Danish government’s legislation and requirements securing the rights of workers in regards to the above-mentioned principles. Therefore no action has been taken internally, and we do not plan to take any. External initiatives We have started to inform our business partners, suppliers and subcontractors of our policy and expectations in regards to labour issues. In addition, we have started to assess the risks in our sphere of influence and incorporate labour issues in our contracts and in our audit procedures.

Weilbach’s environmental impact is limited, as we do not have production facilities. However, we are focusing on promoting environmental responsibility by reducing our energy usage in our offices, thereby reducing our environmental impact. Electricity In 2011 we decided to reduce our environmental impact internally. Since then we have implemented: 1. New low energy lights. 2. Motion sensor lights which automatically switch off lights when a room is empty. 3. “Standby power” switch offs. 4. Solar heat reduction film on windows (to reduce the use of air conditioning). 5. New low energy pumps. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the daily electricity power consumption. Yearly electricity power consumption in KWH 80.000 70.000 60.000 50.000 40.000 Building 2 Building 1 30.000 20.000 10.000 0 2009 2010 2011 2012 Heating In 2013 we have started a process to reduce our energy consumption for heating.

Isolation of window sill and door frames. Expected finished in October 2013. Anti-corruption PRINCIPLE 10 BUSINESSES SHOULD WORK AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ALL ITS FORMS, INCLUDING EXTORTION AND BRIBERY We have developed a policy stating that we are against corruption, bribery and all forms of fraudulent behaviour. We intend to inform our business partners about our policy, as well as conduct an assessment of potential risks within our sphere of influence.
