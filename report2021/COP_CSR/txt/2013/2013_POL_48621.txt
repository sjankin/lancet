Elektrociepłownia Białystok completed conversion of the other coal-fired boiler to fluidized-bed boiler type BFB powered by biomass in 2012. It significantly boosted its generation capacity based on renewable energy sources. Currently, in Białystok CHP generation capacity from renewable energy sources amounts to: thermal energy generated from renewable energy sources 98.4 MWt, energy generated from renewable energy sources 56.6 MWe. To maximize energy generation from renewable energy sources, Białystok CHP uses the so-called condensing turbine TZ4. It is powered by bleeding steam turbine CHP TZ1 of a pressure of 1.0 MPa. Elektrownie Wodne company is responsible for the development of projects in the field of wind energy. In February 2013 Elektrownie Wodne received permission to build a wind farm Baczyna of 15 MW. The new plant is scheduled for the first quarter of 2014. Remaining 27.5 MW in a group of own projects managed by Elektrownie Wodne, is a Choszczno wind farm. Its construction is planned for 2014. The Company is also developing a pilot photovoltaic farm with a capacity of 1 MW, located in Jastrów. Its commissioning is scheduled for the end of 2015. The Company is also interested in Złotów wind farm with a capacity of 12 MW. Its launch is expected in 2014. 25 wind turbines with a total capacity of 50 MW are the basic units of electricity generation from renewable sources in the Windfarm Polska company.

Among employees of ENEA Capital Group there are no cases of occupational diseases. Still employees of some companies are highly vulnerable to accidents at work related with its nature (live-line working, operation of electrical equipment), hence the emphasis on the implementation of occupational safety and health rules in the generation segment companies, ENERGOBUD Leszno, Eneos or ENEA Operator. In 2012 there was one fatal accident in ENEA Operator. Social labour inspectors are elected by employees in ENEA Capital Group. Some companies in “generation” and “distribution” segments conduct extensive projects to promote occupational safety and health rules and educate employees in this field. Employees of all companies may, among others, take part in annually organized and enjoying great popularity, multiphase OSH competition of ENEA Capital Group. From the other hand, ENEA Operator fitters compete in the organized by the Company Live-line working 2010+” competition. The competition is a part of the implemented since 2010, project Live47 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT OF ENEA CAPITAL GROUP 2012 line working 2010+ , which concerns the implementation of live-line working on overhead lines, cable lines and distribution systems up to 1 kV . In addition to the compulsory OSH trainings, the companies train employees in first-aid. ENEA Capital Group employees with instructor qualifications in this field contribute through volunteering in firstaid education. CASE STUDY Premedical rescue in ENEA Operator ENEA Operator pays great importance to training and education of employees in first-aid. Within the periodic OSH trainings organized by ENEA Operator also first-aid classes are held. Premedical Rescue Teams operate in the Company. Nearly all employees of the Company (5,000 people) were trained in first-aid. Premedical Rescue Coordinators passed state examinations of Qualified First-Aid and are certified instructors to conduct training in the Company. Everyone involved in the project take part in regular trainings and various exercises, simulations and emergency manoeuvres. 4.3. Trainings and education ENEA Capital Group companies seek to develop competences of its employees and adjust the scope of trainings, including highly specialized trainings to current needs and development plans of a given company. This aspect is one of the strategic areas included in the Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy of ENEA Capital Group. A long-term program implementation of live-line working (LLW) carried out by ENEA Operator is particularly significant from the point of view of the Capital Group of ENEA and the quality of services offered to Clients. LLW is a modern way of exploiting networks and electrical equipment. For its effective implementation a series of professional trainings for employees is required. Average number of trained personnel in ENEA Operator in relation to the LLW Training Plan is 0.99. Comprehensive ENEA Management System is another example of educational projects carried out by ENEA S.A in developing core competencies of employees.
