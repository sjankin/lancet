Now, we are one of the top two PC companies in the world. In addition, we have prepared well and built a strong foundation to lead the industry into the PC+ Era by maintaining our long-held commitment to delivering innovative, high-quality PCs while expanding Lenovo’s product portfolio to include tablets, smartphones and smart TVs. With this leadership position comes increased responsibility, and we take our role in shaping the future of our planet very seriously. We consistently work to improve our sustainability efforts in terms of how we do business, how we treat our people, and how we care for the communities in which we operate and the environment around us. That means we live up to our commitments and take ownership for what we do. This is the Lenovo Way. For Lenovo, sustainability means integrating social and environmental values with the traditional economic measures of success in our development and delivery of superior products and services. Lenovo is making significant investments in developing economies and in providing consumers in our ever-expanding population with their first digital experience. Throughout this report, you will find examples of Lenovo’s performance with respect to successes, challenges and short and long-term sustainability targets. Noteworthy among these are: • Lenovo was selected as a constituent stock on the 2012 Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index (HSCSI) in Hong Kong – a tradable index and useful indicator for investors seeking socially responsible companies to include in their portfolios – with an improved AA rating. This is the third year of the Index and the third in which Lenovo has been selected, acknowledging Lenovo’s ongoing commitment to sustainability. Lenovo was also rated as “Prime” by oekom research AG, an independent research institute specializing in corporate responsibility assessments. • Through our period of amazing growth, we maintained our commitments to Lenovo’s Environmental Policy: working to ensure compliance, acting to prevent pollution and reduce environmental impact, striving to develop products with environmental attributes and pushing to improve global environmental performance. • In 2012, Lenovo was recognized with multiple awards in the area of employee health and safety, highlighted by those received for its manufacturing plants and facilities located in Shenzhen, Huiyang, Shanghai and Beijing, China; Whitsett and Morrisville, North Carolina, USA; Monterrey, Mexico; and Pondicherry, India. 06 Contents • Lenovo is the world’s number one PC company in the education market and recognizes that in order to succeed in tomorrow’s workforce, students across the globe must be fluent in the technologies that will power the global economy of the 21st Century. With that in mind, we embarked on our Space Lab initiative that enabled students worldwide to submit experiments through YouTube for a chance to see them conducted in space. We also partnered with the National Academy Foundation to create and deliver a cutting-edge curriculum designed to foster and develop interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education among high school students by teaching them how to create and market their own mobile apps. Despite our many recent achievements, we recognize that our sustainability efforts are never complete. Some ongoing efforts include: • Building upon Lenovo’s culture of integrity by promoting increased transparency in communicating with our stakeholders about sustainability programs and progress. • Aligning the environmental work of companies both recently acquired by or in joint ventures with Lenovo, and assuring that new facilities built include environmental attributes to ensure energy efficiency and minimize environmental impact, and ensure that we continue to build one sustainability culture worldwide. • Supporting Lenovo’s existing compliance obligations while also responding to new regulatory and voluntary commitments as the company grows throughout the world. • Continuing, even as we grow rapidly around the world, to work towards Lenovo’s ten-year commitment to reduce greenhouse gases. • Increasing the energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint of Lenovo’s expanding portfolio of products. • Working across the entirety of Lenovo’s global supply chain to improve environmental protection and promote the use of environmentally preferable technologies while also ensuring that every stage of each product’s life is taken into consideration – from manufacturing, transportation and installation to use, service and recycling. The remarkable progress that Lenovo has made this past year has put us in position to become the leading PC+ company in the world. We know that leadership is not measured only by financial results and sales figures, but also by making positive contributions to society. Our goal is to be recognized as a great company for both what we do and how we do it. We will accomplish this goal and we will do it the Lenovo Way – with commitment to our customers, our employees, our communities and our environment. On behalf of Lenovo’s 27,000 employees, I am proud of what we have achieved and fully committed to continuing our strong momentum and to ever improving our sustainability efforts for today, tomorrow and years to come. Thank you. Yuanqing Yang Chairman & CEO Lenovo 07 Contents A message from Peter Hortensius, Our Chief Sustainability Executive For the last year, I’ve had the honor to serve as Lenovo’s Chief Sustainability Executive and Chair of the Sustainability Working Committee. In that time, our company has experienced tremendous growth, made extraordinary progress, and achieved many milestones across our sustainability initiatives. Our goals have always been the same – to deliver innovative, high quality products and services to our customers in a way that demonstrates our commitment to the wellbeing of our employees, protection of our environment and dedication to the health of the local communities in which we work and live. At Lenovo, we believe that true leadership in sustainability does not begin and end with us alone. It must instead cover the entire spectrum of our global supply chain and the life cycle of our products. This past year, Lenovo has made many strides to infuse our sustainability policies and initiatives up and down our supply chain, into newly acquired companies and across the broader industry. For example, as members of the Electronics Industries Citizenship Coalition (EICC), Lenovo is helping to drive a global, standards-based approach to supplier monitoring across a range of sustainability and social responsibility issues, and I am proud to report that in fiscal year 2011/2012, 100 percent of our suppliers signed formal agreements committing to the EICC code. This is strong progress, but it isn’t enough. As you’ll see in this report, while we highlight the many successes we’ve had in expanding and strengthening our sustainability efforts over the past year, we also underscore areas where we can do better. As Lenovo continues to grow as a company and make inroads in new markets around the world, the work of environmental stewardship of social responsibility becomes increasingly complex, including the need to combat climate change. Over the coming year, we’ll meet these challenges the Lenovo way – with a global mindset that embraces transparency and fuels a sense of its own long-term responsibility. Throughout the next year and years to come, we will welcome and value the feedback of all stakeholders as we work to continuously improve our commitment to our customers, our employees, our planet and our local communities. Thank you.

Lenovo’s GHG Emissions and Energy Inventory Specifics: Lenovo started to verify GHG emissions data in FY 2009/2010. At the end of FY 2011/12 Lenovo adjusted its historical CO2e emissions data to account for previously unreported data from fuel usage at two locations and acquisition and integration of the Lenovo Mobile Phone company into the newly created MIDH division (all values in green were adjusted accordingly). Lenovo will integrate emissions data from Medion and NEC-PC beginning with the FY 2012/13 reporting year. Approximately 4% of purchased energy (electricity and steam) is estimated based upon energy use at similar Lenovo facilities with metered usage. Product transportation emissions include key downstream suppliers representing 60percent of global logistics spend. Emissions from waste include non-hazardous waste, hazardous waste and waste water from all manufacturing and R&D locations. No product waste is included. Renewable Energy Credit represents 1 MWh and carbon offset represents 1 MT CO2e. These are not deducted from Lenovo’s reported GHG emissions (reported and calculated separately) taken into consideration internally when evaluating progress towards emissions targets. 3. Water data includes manufacturing and research & development sites. Lenovo started to verify waste & water data in FY 2011/12. 4.

(e.g. Milan is undergoing the LEED certified interior process and As a responsible corporate citizen, Lenovo is proudly committed new headquarters building in Beijing is pursuing China Green 3 to demonstrating leadership in environmental affairs in all Star and LEED Gold certification). 58 Contents Environmental Information on Lenovo Expansion Project Through standard practices, the Lenovo expansion project incorporates several environmental products and practices into the construction and fit-out of the building. The building features environmentally friendly products that reduce energy consumption, reduce waste generated and achieve certification from various environmental agencies. Many of the products contain recycled content in both pre-consumer and post-consumer forms (see definitions of pre and post-consumer forms below). By using products made from recycled materials, there is less demand for harvested raw materials as well as less waste generated. Some product materials are regional, meaning they are harvested and manufactured within 500 miles of the project site. This allows regional economies to profit and compete. The use of regional products results in a decrease in transportation, and therefore a proportional decrease in pollution from transporting vehicles, as well as lower shipping costs. The following list documents products, the manufacturers and the environmental contributions made. All information is from letters from the company, phone calls, literature distributed by the company and from organization’s websites. The beneficial impacts from these contributions are very important to achieving a sustainable building environment for our expansion. • Steelfab structural steel is composed of 80.0 percent post-consumer and 10.0 percent pre-consumer recycled content. • Steelfab structural steel is harvested and manufactured within 500 miles of the project site. • Cook & Boardman hollow metal doors and door frames contain 24.6 percent post-consumer and 6.6 percent pre-consumer recycled content. • Carlisle Syntec roofing insulation and bonding adhesive are each made from 19.0 percent post-consumer and 15.0 percent pre-consumer recycled content. • Use of high-albedo/highly reflective white roof material finish contributes to the reduction of heat-island effects and helps maximize energy savings. • Use of T5 lamps in the expansion help decrease the energy load for general purpose lighting. • Motion detectors have been installed on all overhead lighting in the expansion to reduce energy consumption.

Lenovo had already developed technical products, resulting in a number of environmental benefits. Based specifications for PCs that included environmental attributes upon this success, Lenovo and selected PIC recycled plastic such as energy efficiency. In addition, all commercial products suppliers began to develop and qualify new grades of recycled were designed to meet China’s energy-saving targets. plastics with post-consumer content (PCC) plastics in 2007. With the globalization of Lenovo’s reach, the company took Lenovo continued to use PIC recycled plastics until the end environmental sustainability a step further in 2005 by adopting of 2011, but their use in Lenovo products rapidly declined as a comprehensive Environmentally Conscious Products Program qualified PCC recycled plastics became available and Lenovo’s aimed toward leadership in the global PC business.

Content After Lenovo’s purchase of IBM’s PC Division in May of 2005, Transitioning to Post-consumer Recycled Content Lenovo’s initial use of recycled content plastics was achieved with Lenovo began using post-consumer recycled plastic content post-industrial content (PIC) plastics in the molding of ThinkPad (PCC) in select monitors in early 2007, and today uses PCC bottom covers and ThinkCentre and Workstation bezels. In some across all PC product categories, including all Lenovo ThinkPad cases, these materials were also used to manufacture selected Edge notebooks and ThinkVision monitors. Currently, all internal parts (e.g., card stiffeners). This success was critical in ThinkPad Edge notebooks contain at least 10 percent postgaining the confidence of Lenovo product development teams consumer recycled content. Many Lenovo commercial desktops and suppliers in using engineered recycled content plastics and use significant amounts of PCC, including the ThinkCentre overcoming the misconception that these materials were inferior. M92p Tiny (39 percent), the ThinkCentre M92p and M82 Tower The key to Lenovo’s success in this area was in selecting quality (42 percent), and the ThinkCentre M92p and M82 Small Form PIC sources and working with the plastic manufacturers and Factors (36 percent). compounders in engineering PIC recycled plastics with equivalent Lenovo expanded the use of PCC to workstations and desktops properties and performance to that of the prime material targeted in late 2007. In October 2009, Lenovo introduced the ThinkPad for replacement. One mistake or failure would have severely SL410 and SL510 notebook models, both of which contain damaged future chances of success, so each PIC recycled greater than 10 percent net PCC.
