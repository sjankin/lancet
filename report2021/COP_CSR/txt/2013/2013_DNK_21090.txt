To keep and develop this position, we are convinced it is a prerequisite to conduct our business in a responsible manner – “Doing Business the Right Way”. Sustainability for materials, products, and operations To create and offer sustainable products, ScanCom control all materials for meeting all relevant regulation in our markets. For the wood used in our products, ScanCom as a pioneer regarding this, has more than 10 years’ history in using FSC certified hardwood and today use 100 % FSC hardwood with an objective within short time to reach 100 % FSC for teak Stig Maasbøl Group CEO as well. ScanCom International A/S At the same time we continuously optimize our operation activities to reduce consumption of energy and resources, increase recycling, and reduce emissions. Related to this our main operation site in Vietnam will soon receive ISO 14001 certificate. Social accountability It is important for ScanCom to assure respect for human and labour rights. BSCI monitoring of all operations in Vietnam since 2008 and SA 8000 certificates for the operations in Brazil (2012) and Indonesia (2001) with own Code of Conduct is part of this. SA 8000 and OHSAS 18001 certificates in near future for the Vietnamese operations will reinforce this policy. Now also being a UN Global Compact participant sends a clear signal to all our stakeholders we are committed to do business the right way. Requirements to contract manufacturers and key suppliers Built into the BSCI CoC, SA 8000, and UN Global Compact are requirements for improving CSR level in the supply chain. ScanCom actively practice this by performing CSR audits at the key suppliers and contract manufacturers and requesting them signing our Code of Conduct, and we have targets for continuous improvement on that policy. UN Global Compact commitment After a difficult year with economy problems in key markets I am very pleased that ScanCom even under these conditions were able to remain true to our basic CSR values and make progress or keep same high level on all the 10 UN Global Compact principles. For the new season ScanCom will continue commitment to UN Global Compact – Doing Business the Right Way is part of our DNA. 5 ScanCom International A/S Legal Structure Finance figures Below are given the finance figures for ScanCom International A/S. Only comment here is that the lower activity due to economical problems in key markets and bad summer weather in Europe in 2011 is reflected in the financial results of the year. 6 ScanCom International A/S Performance indicators and objectives Performance indicators and objectives For the first year of participating in UN Global Compact ScanCom selected the performFor theindicators ance first year of participating given below Compact Globalset in UNand relatedScanCom selected the performance indicators given objectives. below and set related objectives.

The figure may seem high but is actually below normal level in similar industries in South East Asia. Although suffering from a high rate of employee turnover, ScanCom still account and manage effectively occupational health and safety training for its direct employees. General introductory training course on safety was delivered to 2065 new employees. Safety technical know-how and compulsory safety courses – such as for pressure vessels, chemical handling, fire safety, boilers, and forklifts – were conducted for 1383 people. Beside the organized training concept, the health and safety team has also delivered so-called HSE talks on the shop floors during their routine inspections. 2964 employees participated in these talks. Overtime The high labour turnover mentioned above together with the seasonal nature of outdoor furniture industry has in the past caused problems with too high overtime rates. However, by improved planning and reduced labour turnover rate this is now coming under control. Number of overtime hours per head was reduced from 147 to 71 from season 10/11 to season 11/12, i.e. 52 %. Wages and benefits In Vietnam legal minimum wage is frequently adjusted, but ScanCom always compensated employees at a significant higher level, applying principles for actual living costs instead of minimum wage. In season 11/12 lowest wage level for workers was around 30 % higher than legal minimum. Furthermore, ScanCom continued policy of extra 2.5 % health and social insurance for workers compared to legal requirement plus extra support for employees with children. 9 ScanCom International A/S Environment Environment Materials used, recycling, and waste Materials Data used, recycling, and waste Resource consumption for season 11/12 and related output and waste figures are shown below.

Use of own wells will be continued until the industrial zone is able to supply sufficient water. 10 10 ScanCom International A/S Recycling ScanCom continuously try to increase recycling of materials. New methods for recycling together with increase in sales volume of products – mainly wood plastic composite furniture – based on recycled materials are the reasons for the general increase in recycling. Development activities in recycling will be continued. Waste Principles for registration of waste have been changed – and changes are still ongoing – so the development in waste figures for the listed two seasons are not comparable. Solid waste is segregated and disposed of by licensed contractors and following local regulation. Details are reported to the management of the industrial zone and other local authorities. ScanCom is cleaning waste water to level B before discharging to the centralized waste water treatment plant of the industrial zone. The waste water is checked and reports quarterly. Two new operational units are included for 11/12. ISO 14001 certification of environment management system In line with ScanCom’s strategy for certification of management systems for relevant units we had the objective of having ISO 14001 certificate mid 2012. The project got slightly delayed and certificate will be received spring 2013. Measuring CO2 emission Systems are prepared for registration of data for calculation of CO2 emission and registration is in implementation. Data will be available for season 13/14. FSC wood ScanCom was one of the pioneers in using FSC wood for outdoor furniture and is today the world’s biggest manufacturer of FSC hardwood garden furniture. ScanCom is today using 100 % FSC hardwood in our operations in Vietnam – including our contract manufacturers. ScanCom Indonesia is now FSC certified and is working towards having all production made by FSC teak. What is not FSC today, is all made of legal teak. Taken the above into account ScanCom can meet any regulation on wood in all markets and provide all relevant documentation for customers. Anti-corruption ScanCom two years ago established our own Code of Conduct which is updated every year. The Code of Conduct is communicated to all employees and all new employees receive training in the content. Furthermore, the Code of Conduct is communicated to all subcontractors, contract manufacturers, and key suppliers – and they are requested to sign the code. 11 ScanCom International A/S BSCImonitoring BSCI monitoring Contract manufacturers Contract manufacturers For season 11/12 social compliance training module was organized by ScanCom for 25 contrac For season 11/12 manufactures social compliance in hardwood in poly module group, 6 training was organized rattan weavers group and 3 cushion for by ScanCom 25 manufactur contracted manufactures in hardwood group, 6 in poly rattan weavers In this training, ScanCom CSR also communicated the updated ScanCom code of conduct group and 3 cushion manufacturers. contracted In this training, manufacturers and messageScanComfromCSR also communicated ScanCom Group CEO on updated the anti Scanand b corruption Com code practice of of conductrelationship. to contracted manufacturers and message from ScanCom Group business CEO on anti corruption and best practice of business relationship.
