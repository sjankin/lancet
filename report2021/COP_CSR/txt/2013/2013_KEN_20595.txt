Business Environment The 2011/2012 financial year was characterised by a negative macroeconomic environment, and the country’s economic growth rate declined from 5.8% in 2010 to 4.4% in 2011. This was attributable to below normal rainfall, high interest rates and high international oil prices, as well as a highly charged political environment as the country prepares for the next general election. A lower GDP growth of between 3.5% to 4% is projected for the year 2012. Electricity consumption, which has a direct correlation to GDP growth, recorded a low growth of 3.5% in 2011/2012 compared to 8.8% in 2010/2011. 16 THE KENYA POWER & LIGHTING COMPANY LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011/12 Chairman’s Statement Financial Performance Electricity sales increased to 5,991 million units from 5,785 million units the previous year, representing a growth of 3.6%. The growth in sales is attributed to increased number of customers and consumption and was realised in spite of an increase in system losses by 1.1% to 17.3% compared to 16.2% in the previous year as a result of extensive expansion of the electricity distribution network, and increased transmission of electricity from the Coast from the newly commissioned Kipevu III generation plant. The transmission constraint will be resolved with the commissioning of the 400kV Nairobi-Mombasa transmission line, currently under construction, by 2013. During the year, the Company reached the two million customer mark after connecting a record 307,000 customers, which was an increase of 15% from the previous year. Revenue from electricity sales increased to Shs.45,008 million from Shs.42,485 million the previous year, representing a 6% growth. The poor hydrology experienced during the first half of the financial year resulted in a reduction in hydro generation, and an increase in generation from thermal sources by 12% from 2,236GWh the previous year, to 2,509GWh. The thermal plants include the emergency power plants contracted from Aggreko, which were retained in service to mitigate generation shortfalls. Stima Loan for This, coupled with high global fuel prices, resulted in a 62% increase in the fuel cost recovered from affordable electricity customers, to Shs.41,896 million compared to connection Shs.25,913 million the previous year. Foreign exchange recoveries rose by Shs.4,004 million from Shs.4,755 million the previous year to Shs.8,759 million, due to increased foreign exchange denominated transactions and fluctuations of the shilling against major world currencies during the year. The power purchase costs (excluding fuel and foreign exchange costs) increased by Shs.866 million from Shs.20,214 million the previous year, to Shs.21,080 million due to capacity charges paid for the emergency power plants, and increase in unit purchases from 6,895GWh the previous year to 7,197GWh. Previously, the Government subsidised part of the capacity charges for the emergency power, but this was discontinued during the year under review. The expansion of the Company’s electricity network and facilities to support increased demand and improvement of the quality of power supply, led to an increase in the transmission and distribution expenditure by Shs.1,985 million to Shs.19,680 million compared to Shs.17,695 million the previous period. The increase is also attributable to higher depreciation due to increased capital investment, and staff expenses in line with the growth of the business in general. 17 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011/12 | THE KENYA POWER & LIGHTING COMPANY LIMITED Chairman’s Statement Profit Dividend The Company recorded a profit before tax of Shs.8,506 million compared to The Directors recommend to members that in addition to the interim dividend Shs.6,254 million the previous year.

The Register of Members and of Transfers will be closed Company has intensified implementation of system expansion, reinforcement for one day on 20th December 2012 to facilitate dividend processing. and upgrade projects aimed at improving the quality and reliability of power Appreciation supply, reducing system losses and creating capacity for new customer I take this opportunity to sincerely express my gratitude and appreciation to connections. Some of these projects have been financed with funds from all shareholders, my fellow Directors, staff, the Government, our customers various development partners mainly under the US$225.8 million Energy and business development partners, for their continued support, which has Sector Recovery Project (ESRP) and the US$102 million Kenya Electricity contributed to our good performance. Expansion Programme (KEEP). As a result of the intensive investment, the Company’s capital asset base has grown from Shs.21,088 million in 2004/2005 financial year to Shs.105,973 million in 2011/2012 financial year. This capital investment is aimed at improving the quality of power supply, network expansion and accelerated connection of new customers. Over the same period, the number of customers increased Mr. Eliazar O Ochola from 735,144 to 2,038,625. Chairman The Company also continues to use internally generated funds for system expansion and reinforcement as a pre-investment for future business growth. 26th October 2012 Most of the loans contracted by the Company for the system expansion, such as under the ESRP and KEEP programmes, have been fully disbursed, and this has necessitated higher application of the Company’s own funds as a stopgap measure, which has had a temporary impact on the Company’s cashflow. The Company will continue to implement the system expansion programme with a view to growing the business, as well as supporting the country’s Vision 2030 socio-economic blueprint which seeks to increase electricity access of Kenyans to 50% by that year. The expansion will also enable the delivery of quality supply of electricity throughout the 47 counties. The Company is sourcing for additional long term funding for the capital investment programme. Towards this, the Company recently obtained a loan of US$50 million from the International Finance Corporation which will be disbursed by June 2013. Further, the Company has procured medium term funding to enhance its liquidity and current assets positions.

Joseph Njoroge, MBS Managing Director & CEO Nairobi 26th October 2012 51 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011/12 | THE KENYA POWER & LIGHTING COMPANY LIMITED Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities The Kenyan Companies Act requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of the Company as at the end of the financial year and of its operating results for that year. It also requires the directors to ensure that the Company keeps proper accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time, the financial position of the Company. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company. The directors are responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Kenyan Companies Act, and for such internal controls as directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The directors accept responsibility for the annual financial statements, which have been prepared using appropriate accounting policies supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards and in the manner required by the Kenyan Companies Act. The directors are of the opinion that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the financial affairs of the Company and of its operating results. The directors further accept responsibility for the maintenance of accounting records which may be relied upon in the preparation of financial statements, as well as adequate systems of internal financial control. Nothing has come to the attention of the directors to indicate that the Company will not remain a going concern for at least the next twelve months from the date of this statement. _________________________ Director ________________________ Director ________________________ Director 26th October 2012 52 THE KENYA POWER & LIGHTING COMPANY LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011/12 Report of the Auditor-General REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Unqualified Opinion The accompanying financial statements of Kenya Power & Lighting Company In my opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, Limited set out at pages 54 to 102, which comprise the statement of financial the financial position of the Company as at 30th June 2012 and of its financial position as at 30th June 2012, the statement of comprehensive income, performance and its cash flows of the year then ended in accordance with statement of changes in equity and statement cash flows for the year then International Financial Reporting Standards and comply with the Companies ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory Act, Cap 486 of the Laws of Kenya. information, have been audited on my behalf by Deloitte and Touché auditors REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS appointed under Section 39 of the Public Audit Act, 2003.

Management is also responsible for the submission of its financial statements Edward R. O. Ouko to the Auditor-General in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Public Audit Act, 2003. Auditor-General Nairobi Auditor-General’s Responsibility My responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based 26th October 2012 on the audit and report in accordance with the provisions of Section 15 of the Public Audit Act, 2003. The audit was conducted in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require compliance with ethical requirements and that the audit be planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my unqualified audit opinion. 53 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011/12 | THE KENYA POWER & LIGHTING COMPANY LIMITED Statement of Comprehensive Income for the Year Ended 30 June 2012 2012 2011 Note KShs’000 KShs’000 Electricity sales 7(a) 45,007,884 42,485,593 Foreign exchange adjustment power purchase 7(b) 6,093,868 3,425,194 company operations 7(b) 2,664,832 1,330,378 Fuel costs adjustment 8(b) 41,895,843 25,912,856 95,662,427 73,154,021 POWER PURCHASE COSTS Non-fuel costs 8(a) 21,079,695 20,213,817 Foreign exchange cost 7(b) 6,093,868 3,425,194 Fuel costs 8(b) 42,788,616 26,150,566 69,962,179 49,789,577 GROSS PROFIT 25,700,248 23,364,444 OPERATING EXPENSES Distribution 9(a) 5,338,545 4,835,045 Commercial services 9(b) 3,255,597 3,079,179 Energy transmission 9(c) 2,079,675 2,016,247 Administration 9(d) 9,006,029 7,764,480 9(e) 19,679,846 17,694,951 Operating income 6,020,402 5,669,493 OTHER OPERATING INCOME 7(c) 1,788,118 1,412,954 OPERATING PROFIT 7,808,520 7,082,447 Finance costs 11(b) (1,216,272) (414,835) Interest income 11(a) 489,182 171,477 Net foreign exchange gains/(losses) 11(c) 1,425,263 (584,338) PROFIT BEFORE TAX 12 8,506,693 6,254,751 Income tax expense 13(a) (3,889,577) (2,035,185) PROFIT FOR THE YEAR 4,617,116 4,219,566 OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Net losses on revaluation of available-for-sale treasury bonds 19(b) (127,397) TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME 4,489,719 4,219,566 Basic earnings per share (KShs) 14 2.36 2.16 Diluted earnings per share (Kshs) 14 2.36 2.16 54 THE KENYA POWER & LIGHTING COMPANY LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011/12 Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2012 2012 2011 Note KShs’000 KShs’000 ASSETS NON CURRENT ASSETS Property and equipment 16 105,671,370 84,590,569 Prepaid leases on land 17 131,709 131,764 Intangible assets 18 169,520 Investments in government securities 19(a) 1,298,506 105,972,599 86,020,839 CURRENT ASSETS Inventories 20 10,286,376 8,960,830 Trade and other receivables 21(a) 14,211,800 16,273,419 Tax recoverable 13(c) 194,059 Investments in government securities 19(a) 1,171,109 Short term deposits 22(a) 506,168 1,539,999 Bank and cash balances 22(b) 1,983,931 8,182,369 28,159,384 35,150,676 TOTAL ASSETS 134,131,983 121,171,515 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES CAPITAL AND RESERVES Ordinary share capital 23(a) 4,878,667 4,336,593 Share premium 24 22,021,219 22,042,004 Reserves 25 16,611,667 13,227,779 TOTAL EQUITY 43,511,553 39,606,376 DEFERRED INCOME 28 12,362,327 7,472,912 NON – CURRENT LIABILITIES Deferred tax 26 9,496,455 6,500,449 Trade and other payables 27(a) 15,823,485 19,661,135 Borrowings 29(a) 21,512,025 19,757,132 Preference shares 30 43,000 43,000 46,874,965 45,961,716 CURRENT LIABILITIES Trade and other payables 27(b) 21,990,795 22,181,838 Tax payable 13(c) 37,886 Provision for leave pay 32 989,378 830,734 Borrowings 29(a) 6,250,288 4,764,171 Dividends payable 33 425,184 353,768 Bank overdraft 22(b) 1,689,607 31,383,138 28,130,511 TOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 134,131,983 121,171,515 The financial statements on pages 54 to 102 were approved and authorised for issue by the board of directors on 26th October 2012 and were signed on its behalf by: Chairman Director Managing Director and CEO 55 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011/12 | THE KENYA POWER & LIGHTING COMPANY LIMITED Statement of Changes in Equity for the Year Ended 30 June 2012 Redeemable 7.85% noncumulative Investments Ordinary preference Share Revaluation revaluation Retained Proposed share capital share capital premium reserves reserve earnings dividends KShs’000 KShs’000 KShs’000 KShs’000 KShs’000 KShs’000 KShs’000 Total Note 23(a) Note 23(b) Note 24 Note 24 Note 19 Note 25 Note 15 KShs’000 As previously presented At 1 July 2010 Prior year reclassification 1,582,560 15,899,250 1,758,423 7,856,913 1,643,731 28,740,877 -Revaluation reserve* (1,758,423) 1,758,423 -Transfer of excess depreciation* 455,626 (455,626) -Deferred tax on excess depreciation* (136,687) 136,687 -Proposed dividends** 1,643,731 (1,643,731) Restated 1,582,560 15,899,250 318,939 10,940,128 28,740,877 Preference shares conversion 1,532,458 (15,899,250) 14,366,792 Rights issue 1,221,575 8,306,714 9,528,289 Restructuring costs (note 24) (631,502) (631,502) Transfer of excess depreciation (455,626) 455,626 Deferred tax on excess depreciation 136,687 (136,687) Total comprehensive income 4,219,566 4,219,566 Dividends paid 2010 (1,643,731) (1,643,731) Interim dividends paid 2011 (607,123) (607,123) At 30 June 2011 restated 4,336,593 22,042,004 13,227,779 39,606,376 * Prior year reclassification relates to reversals of the revaluation reserve and related deferred tax that arose on the revaluation of the transmission lines in the year 2002.

Future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets are projected, taking into account market conditions and the expected useful lives of the assets. The present value of these cash flows, determined using an appropriate discount rate, is compared to the current net asset value and, if lower, the assets are impaired to the present value. Pensions Actuarial assumptions are made in valuing future defined benefit obligation and are updated periodically. The principal assumption relates to the discount rate. The discount rate is equal to 12.5%, which is the rate determined by reference to market yields on the treasury bonds at the end of the reporting period. Provision for doubtful debts The estimated provision for doubtful debts is based on the period for which the debt was outstanding combined with some knowledge of the financial position of the debtor and/or the circumstances surrounding the underlying transaction. This policy is to ensure that the Company regularly evaluates debts and their recoverability, maintains timely and appropriate provisions account in order to accurately reflect the condition of the statement of financial position. It is also intended to promote well-reasoned, effective work plans for nonperforming debts and effective internal controls to manage the level of such debts. Provisions for impairment are maintained at an amount adequate to cover anticipated credit related losses. Specific provisions are established where full recovery of the principal is considered doubtful. Specific provisions are made against finalised customer accounts net of deposits. Provisions are determined primarily by reference to historical ratios of write-offs to balances in default. General (portfolio) provisions for bad and doubtful debts are maintained to cover non-identified probable losses and latent risks inherent in the overall debt portfolio. The provisions are determined having regard to the general risk profile of the credit portfolio, historical loss experience, economic conditions and a range of other criteria including status of the pending court cases. 69 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011/12 | THE KENYA POWER & LIGHTING COMPANY LIMITED Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) 5.
