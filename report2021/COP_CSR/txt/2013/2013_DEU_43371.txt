Working in close cooperation with our suppliers, we constantly check the chemicals in terms of their physiological and ecological safety and optimize their use by using them in low doses. In order to achieve greater transparency about the use of chemicals in our laundries, we are introducing a uniform Group-wide real-time system to record usage levels, which we will then use as the basis for continuously improving the efficiency of the chemicals used.
