His first initiatives as CEO display a keen alignment management transitions in our Company.” with our values of operational excellence. Market environment Precious metal miners faced volatile metal prices, higher production costs and growing social and environmental pressures. The weak gold price of the first half of the year recovered during the second half of the year as central banks increased reserves and investors sought protection against economic uncertainty and possible inflation. Demand also improved in certain markets such as India and China. As a result, the average realised gold price increased 5.6% over 2011, to US$1,674.1 per ounce. After five months of continuous decline, the silver price hit a low of US$27.34 in July, from where it recovered some lost ground and closed the year at US$30.2. Physical purchases by investment funds provided support for silver prices, whilst lower industrial demand, the debt crisis in the euro zone and weak economic growth in the United States limited the recovery. The average realised price of silver was US$31.4 per ounce, 9.8% lower than in 2011. Across the industry, producers also faced an increased shortage of skilled labour and higher unit costs for operating materials such as explosives, tyres and reagents. In addition, the global decline in new high grade ore deposits affected cash costs per ounce as miners continued to invest in lower grade, less economic deposits. The industry also received additional and deserved scrutiny for its community and employee relations this year following a number of labour conflicts and social concerns. Whilst our Group has long enjoyed productive and beneficial relationships at the local level, we are not immune to such risks and thus continue to prioritise Alberto Baillères community relations and investments in areas that reinforce the Non-executive Chairman creation of stakeholder value.

We will continue to pursue executing its organic growth strategy, resulting in record gold and operational excellence and the disciplined development of new stable silver production.

Cash holdings totalled US$613.8 million at 31 December 2012, and with no debt on the balance sheet our capital funding options remain flexible. Miners have come under some pressure to take on more debt in a bid to increase shareholder returns, yet over the decades that I have worked in this industry, the idea of re-leveraging balance sheets has emerged with almost as much frequency as cyclical downturns and calls for de-leveraging. 16 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Chairman’s statement continued Advancing our investment in safety (US$) 2009 2012 2.6m You will find more information on our HSECR system on pages 78-94 2011 (5.2 million) Sustainable development Risk capital investment US$ As a Board and through our HSECR Committee, we work to ensure 2012 2011 that the Group adheres to responsible and sustainable business practices.

Fresnillo plc also benefits from its primary and long-term operational presence in Mexico. The country’s newly elected government seems keen to retain and strengthen business friendly policies. Mexico must still contend with such challenges as shortfalls in public security and education, but the political transition has been marked by an encouraging outreach to the private sector for shared opportunities to reinforce the economic foundations of the country. Alberto Baillères I am confident that Fresnillo plc will continue to advance its proven Non-executive Chairman strategy in precious metals in 2013. The dynamic leaching plant at Herradura will be commissioned during the year; construction has commenced at San Julián, opening up a significant new mining district, and is expected to remain on track; the expansion of Saucito has been approved and we will analyse the best way to further optimise production, including the potential construction of a plant to treat pyrites which would improve gold and silver recoveries. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 17 Strategic Review Overview Herradura: We are evaluating an expansion of the To create value for stakeholders across main pit and assessing the potential development of a new underground mine. precious metal cycles, we focus on high-potential silver and gold projects that can be developed into low-cost, world-class mines.

Mr Alvídrez Mr Alvídrez brings extensive industry Chief Executive Officer experience to the position. He joined Peñoles in 1988 and has held senior operational and executive positions across Peñoles and Fresnillo, including in metals purchasing, treasury and finance. He most recently served as General Manager of Peñoles’s Madero mine, one of Mexico’s largest zinc mines. Mr Alvídrez holds a degree in Mining Engineering from the Universidad de Guanajuato (Mexico) and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania (USA). www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 19 Octavio Alvídrez was appointed CEO of Fresnillo plc in August 2012, taking the reins from Jaime Lomelín who Q: Looking at operating performance in 2012, what stands out for you? Overview led the Company since its IPO in 2008 and served as Chief Executive of Peñoles for the 21 years prior. A: Once again, I will start with our people. We shouldn’t take pride in a safety record that shows an improving fatality rate. Zero tolerance is zero tolerance, and no fatality is ever acceptable. He begins his tenure as CEO near the midpoint of the Yes, we are doing a lot to move the needle forward on safety in general, but regarding this specific issue I am not patient. Company’s ambitious ten-year targets set for 2018, overseeing a far-reaching exploration programme, From a production standpoint, obviously record gold production a multi-year project delivery schedule and a growing stands out, which largely reflects the start-up of our new Noche Strategic Review Buena mine. In no small measure, however, we also benefited from portfolio of operating mines, as well as implementation the contribution of higher ore grades at Saucito and higher volumes of the 2012–2016 HSECR Action Plan. of ore processed at Ciénega, San Ramón and Saucito. I emphasise this because it underscores our strategy of maximising current operations. In the following interview, Octavio Alvídrez reflects on his role, discusses 2012 performance, and outlines the Attributable gold production Koz Group’s strategic priorities. This interview, as well as the full Strategic Review and Performance sections 2012 2011 448.9 on pages 24-55 and 57-107, correspond to our fourth Communication on Progress as signatory of the United Performance Nations Global Compact. Q: What might stakeholders expect from you as the CEO? How will your leadership differ from that of your predecessor? Second, I would say that our performance in silver was noteworthy A: I am keenly aware of stepping into the shoes of such a well-respected leader in our industry. Mr Lomelín was a mentor to me and many other mining professionals in Mexico. He was given the expected decline in ore grades at Fresnillo. The extent to which we were able to keep total production stable in the year reflects greater throughput at that mine as well as higher ore grades at San Governance able to combine technical expertise with a broader view of the industry Ramón and the ramp-up of Saucito. Fresnillo will remain our key silver landscape, and I certainly hope to follow in his footsteps in that regard. producing mine for some time – and indeed it is still the world’s largest primary silver mine – but we are reaching an inflection point where we As for strategy, to be frank, our stakeholders can expect a great degree must look for growth in silver production elsewhere in the portfolio, of continuity. We are committed to the 2018 goal of producing 65 million and invest accordingly. I should also note that in 2012 we benefited ounces of silver per year and 500,000 ounces of gold, and doing so from an increase in silver ounces accrued under the Silverstream profitably and sustainably. The vision we’ve had from the time of the Contract with Peñoles. IPO – to maintain our position as the world’s leading silver miner and a top Mexican producer of gold – won’t change under my leadership. Third, I would highlight the rate at which we successfully converted resources into reserves. This is one of the strongest indicators of That being said, management styles obviously differ, and I will have my Financial Statements future production, and I am pleased to note the 23.6% and 19.6% own take on how we execute and prioritise shorter term objectives, increase in proven and probable silver and gold reserves, respectively. how I work with my colleagues, the culture we foster and expectations we set for ourselves. Q: Yet the Company’s financial performance couldn’t keep pace with previous years’ growth. Are you Q: What were your initial priorities when you came on board last August? concerned about volatility in precious metal prices? A: This may sound trite, but I believe people truly are our most important asset. I knew the Company well from my previous A: To say that we disregard metal prices would be inaccurate, but in reality, because price movements affect everyone in this industry, we must focus on what we can control – namely costs, management roles, but I wanted to take the time to listen and speak productivity and having safe and sustainable operations. To the extent with our people at every operating mine and development site, we look at market factors, it is to ensure that we extract the most as well as with our exploration team, union leaders and key suppliers. economically viable material at any given time. We are fortunate in Their insights into the day-to-day operations are extremely valuable, that we are positioned to withstand a fair amount of volatility and still and I wanted that perspective as part of my comprehensive review generate healthy cash flow and EBITDA. This is because of our low of mine plans, development projects and exploration programmes. embedded cash costs and conservative financial structure. What I walked away with was a deep appreciation for the team we have in place – the calibre, commitment and professionalism of our workforce is truly impressive. Without a doubt, my number one priority must be safeguarding our people. 20 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Q&A with the Chief Executive continued Q: You are strengthening in gold, does this spell a change in strategy for silver? Q: 2012 was the first year rolling out the HSECR Action Plan. Has the implementation gone according to plan? A: It is understandable to think that might be the case looking at the past year or two. Indeed, the remarkable growth in gold production, dovetailing as it did with record prices, nicely mitigated the A: Yes, we have hit the right milestones for year one. Following the assessment PwC conducted of our HSECR system in 2011, we’re taking an approach to sustainability that looks at systems, natural decline in silver ore grades at our Fresnillo mine. And we also processes and data holistically, and are now working to ensure that have a number of exciting gold projects coming on stream. gaps are closed. But the reality is that our strategy has not changed. If you look at our One area that garnered particular attention in our industry this year, ten-year plan and 2018 targets, gold production is slated to rise from and rightfully so, was employee and community relations following today’s level of around 470 thousand ounces to 500 thousand ounces, the tragic events in South Africa. Our own policy has always been to whereas silver growth will be exponentially greater, increasing from collaborate with communities and secure their engagement at the around 40 million ounces to 65 million ounces. We will still be a silver earliest stages of exploration, and we continue to enjoy effective company at heart, but one with an impressive profile in gold. and mutually beneficial relationships. Notwithstanding, the Group took the step in 2012 of incorporating public perception of mining activity as a potential risk that must be monitored and mitigated. Q: So what keeps you up at night? In terms of the HSECR Action Plan, in 2012 we formally adopted a A: I will say it again: safety. It is so fundamental to our license to operate. Changing ore grades, fluctuating input prices, equipment requirements, all those are the operational realities of Sustainable Development Policy and put in place leadership teams at each business unit. We established prevention and performance indicators and developed criteria and guidelines governing institutional mining, and our Company has proved exceptionally capable of thriving programmes and how budgets are shaped to incorporate HSECR across metal cycles. I am confident we can continue to execute and issues. We are now putting in place the tools to validate our deliver on our strategy. monitoring and reporting systems. Where we aim to make further progress is in the process already underway, namely taking our Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations framework and embedding the culture and Q: Won’t all that be challenging in the context of bringing on major projects in the next five years? systems of safety and sustainability throughout the organisation. This in complete alignment with the Board’s direction and the values our Company holds dear. A: On the contrary, these systemic enhancements will in fact support the ambitious growth plan we’ve laid out, which nearly doubles our operating assets in the next few years. Having a rigorous operating framework with embedded sustainability measures is extremely beneficial. We have already trained and equipped the team that is set to operate the dynamic leaching plant coming online before the end of 2013, and we started construction on the San Julián development project a few months ago. Engineering work is currently being conducted at Saucito II, and Juanicipio, and conceptual engineering at Orisyvo. So yes, there’s a lot on our plate but we have the people, resources and now systems to accomplish great things.

What challenges and opportunities do you anticipate with that? As you saw in 2012, we are not necessarily doing this all on our own. The association agreement we signed with Orex Minerals of Canada has us exploring and developing our adjacent mineral concessions Overview A: We have very strict and consistent criteria when it comes to in Coneto, Durango as one large project. exploration, in terms of tonnage, ore grade and production The challenges in Peru are more of distance, but there too we work costs. District consolidation – in the form of proximate mining to consolidate our land position. We have had a team there for some concessions – makes a lot of sense because we can leverage time, investing in the critical work of community engagement and existing infrastructure. But we must also continue to extend our stakeholder outreach whilst exploring some interesting prospects. resource base, using the same strict criteria of course, as we This year, for example, we saw some exciting preliminary results have done at San Julián. Our exploration programme, to which Strategic Review at the Pilarica silver project. US$318.9 million was allocated in 2012, is focused on areas with proven geological potential that may become new districts for us. Q: For the shorter term, what are your priorities for 2013? Are there specific milestones you are targeting? Exploration expenditure across the value chain A: Within the context of our broader strategy and path to 2018 targets, we will be looking at the safety programme and full HSECR framework, along with cost cutting and efficiency initiatives Investment at current mines helps replenish reserves to ensure we’re aligned with market realities such as the expected and explore areas of influence; at development project inflation in operating materials even as our mine development we convert resources into reserves and expand the total programme will require additional stripping and longer haulage Performance resource base; prospecting and drilling at early stage distances.

The market factors to which we have Competitive environment exposure are those common to the Revenues for mining companies primarily depend on the prevailing prices for the metals contained in the mineral concentrates they precious metals industry, as well as produce. These metals are globally traded, and like its competitors, those specific to companies operating Fresnillo plc does not control the prices it receives for its products and does not hedge exposure to gold and silver prices. in Mexico. Amongst major precious metal mining companies, Fresnillo plc is unique in that silver and gold contribute approximately half of net revenues each. In silver, we consider our peer group to be other primary silver miners, although much of global output is derived as a by-product of gold, lead, zinc and copper mining. Irrespective, Fresnillo plc has long been amongst the top three global producers of silver, both by-product and primary. In gold we benchmark our performance against global miners with similar annual production profiles, which are the medium-sized gold companies. Advancing our market position Global silver producers The precious metals market 2008 2012 Demand for silver and gold For silver, demand is driven by fabrication (industrial applications, 3rd jewellery, coins and medals, photography and other applications) Production 35moz and investment (bullion and Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs). Fabrication still constitutes the largest demand for silver, although its significance declined in 2012 compared to 2011, whilst investment Production 41moz demand rose. Underlying the change in demand mix is a long-term trend of decline for both photographic use of silver and silverware, combined with Medium-size gold producers the current slowdown in industrial demand due to weak economic growth and industrial production, and a reduction in certain 2008 2012 applications such as photovoltaic silver due to lower silver use per 6th unit. In contrast, jewellery posted modest growth in 2012 as healthy gains in emerging markets more than offset losses in western Production 264koz countries. The rise in retail and institutional silver investment, in which ETFs have been instrumental, has outpaced all other demand Production 473koz in recent years, making it a key driver behind the rise in silver prices. For gold, demand is largely driven by its status as a safe haven, with consumers and investors buying the metal to protect their savings and purchasing power in an environment of high inflation and low interest rates, and as a means to diversify away from the US dollar. In some markets gold has strong cultural allure, with China and India leading the demand for gold jewellery. ETF investors and central banks also continue to support demand for gold. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 25 Overview Peer group comparison World silver supply and demand 2012 2011 2010 2009 2012E* 2011 2010 2009 2008 Primary silver producers Production in moz Silver Supply Moz 2 Fresnillo plc 41 42 42 41 Mine production 797.0 763.8 751.4 716.1 683.6 Silver Wheaton 27 24 22 17 Net government sales 8.4 12.0 44.2 15.6 30.5 Pan American Silver Corp. 25 22 24 23 Net producer hedging – 10.9 50.4 – – Coeur d’Alene Mines Corp. 18 19 17 17 Scrap 260.7 256.9 228.6 199.9 200.9 Strategic Review Hochschild Mining 14 15 18 19 Implied net disinvestment – – – – – Silver Standard Resources 9 7 6 N/A Total Supply 1,066.0 1,043.6 1,074.6 931.5 915.0 Hecla 6 9 11 11 Silver Demand2 Moz Silver Corp Metals 5 6 5 5 Fabrication: Global silver producers (by-product and primary) Industrial 454.4 481.9 499.5 406.5 492.7 Fresnillo plc 41 42 42 41 Photographic 54.2 66.1 72.1 79.3 101.3 Performance KGHM Polska Miedz 41 41 37 42 Jewellery 178.7 176.5 182.6 173.6 171.0 BHP Billiton 39 39 47 42 Silverware 45.1 48.5 53.5 61.3 59.8 Goldcorp Inc. 30 28 20 9 Coins & Medals 89.7 118.3 99.4 78.8 65.3 Total fabrication 822.1 891.5 907.2 799.4 890.1 Pan American Silver Corp. 25 22 24 23 Net producer de-hedging 10.0 – – 17.4 8.5 Medium-size gold producers Attributable production in koz Implied net investment 233.9 152.2 167.4 114.7 16.4 Agnico Eagle 1,044 985 988 493 Total Demand 1,066.0 1,043.6 1,074.6 931.5 915.0 Randgold 795 696 440 488 Governance Petropavlovsk 710 630 507 487 Polymetal 589 443 444 311 Silver ETF holdings2 million of ounces Fresnillo plc 1 473 449 369 277 Oceana 233 252 269 300 800 Coeur d’Alene Mines Corp. 226 221 157 72 BHP Billiton 156 178 158 174 600 Aurizon 137 164 141 159 Financial Statements 400 Kazakhmys plc 129 151 127 135 200 Hochschild Mining 112 127 144 157 07 08 09 10 11 12 1 Total gold production 2012: 687 thousand ounces; 2011: 663 thousand ounces; 2010: 545 thousand ounces; 2009: 391 thousand ounces. 2 Source: Thomson Reuters GFMS, Copyright: Thomson Reuters GFMS, 2013. * Estimated figures. 26 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Market Overview continued Silver and gold supply Silver price Mine output provides the majority of silver supply, and recycling and The price of silver fluctuated significantly over the year, from a low of scrap provide much of the remainder, with government sales a minor US$26.7 per ounce in July to a high of US$37.2 in February.

Risk management framework diagram from 2011 The annual risk identification and assessment process is integrated with the strategic planning process. Executive Management assesses the level of risk inherent to achieving the Company’s strategies, and incorporates controls into the strategic plan to mitigate this.

This universe was narrowed positioning of our principal risks in terms down into major risks monitored by Executive Management and the Audit Committee, and then further consolidated into the principal risks of impact and likelihood: monitored by Executive Management and the Board of Directors.

To a certain extent this inaccurate perception stems from the industry’s insufficient engagement efforts with H C A A local communities and ineffective communications regarding F the widespread benefits of mining. Whilst there has been no direct H impact on Fresnillo plc to date, public opinion in recent years has I J E Impact put increased pressure on regulators regarding the ability of mining companies to operate. Such pressure has impacted the industry J E in a number of ways, from delays in obtaining permits and licences, to community protests, negative media coverage, and blockades of projects and mines, resulting in the derailment or shutdown of select mining operations (temporary and permanent) around the world. Due to this increased pressure, the Executive Committee proposed to the Board the inclusion of this new risk within the principal risks to be closely monitored. The Board approved the proposal and included this risk in its risk appetite and mitigation discussions during the year. Very low Unlikely Likelihood Almost certain Risk A. Security B.

Risk rating Risk Risk appetite 2011 2012 Change Description of risk change A. Security Low High Very high The state of insecurity in regions of Mexico where we operate has continued to increase, with a number of incidents in areas closer to our operations and exploration projects. Strategic Review B. Impact of global High High High Among industry and financial analysts who follow metals prices, macroeconomic some see cyclicality in the industry and predict a downward trend for long-term average silver prices. developments C. Projects Medium High High The change in risk reflects two factors: higher exposure due to the level of committed risk capital for the San Julián project that was approved in 2012; and, helping offset that factor, greater certainty about the mineral resources at our advanced exploration projects, which increased over the past year, as well as enhancements in our investment governance process and system of capital project Performance controls that improve our ability to deliver growth through development projects in time and on budget. D. Access to land Medium High High Negotiations for land in Mexico, combined with an increase in land requirements, remain a challenge. Foreign mining companies in general and Canadian ones in particular have set certain precedents for future negotiations in their agreements with indigenous community (ejido) leaders. E. Potential actions Low Medium High In December 2012 the Mexican Government enacted an amendment by the government to the Labour Law; we have retained advisors to help ascertain and Governance analyse any possible impact. Pressure for a mining tax/royalty in Mexico continues to increase. Mexican legislators have taken steps to move in this direction. The Company, through the Mining Chamber and directly through our high ranking executives and Chairman, will continue to lobby against any mining royalty and to ensure that fiscal regulations do not curtail growth or investment. F. Public perception Low N/A High The potential for social activism is a growing global phenomenon against mining within the mining sector with the potential to impact all strategic areas; there have been recent examples impacting other mining Financial Statements companies in Mexico. G. Safety Low High High Accident rates have declined due to our strict application of procedures and greater supervision of safety for personnel and contractors, however the risk remains high and we have still not met our safety goals. H. Environmental Low Low Low Our mature environmental management programme continues incidents to reduce the likelihood of a significant environmental incident. I. Exploration Medium Medium Medium Continued investment in the exploration programme has stabilised this risk and we foresee no change in risk status based on available information. J. Human resources Medium Medium Medium Competition for skilled personnel remains a challenge, however we have begun to see results from our recruitment and retention strategies. For those risks with a risk rating that is above our risk appetite, management takes action to reduce the level of risk.

Since 2008, we have thought carefully about how we apply the principles of good corporate governance of all of its shareholders but also of its and sought to ensure that the Board and its Committees fulfil all employees and contractors as well as the of their obligations and commitments. In doing so, I believe that the Fresnillo Group is governed in the best interests not only of communities, and indeed the countries, all of its shareholders but also of its employees and contractors in which its operations are located.” as well as the communities, and indeed the countries, in which its operations are located. Strategic Review Just over a year ago, we commissioned an external evaluation of the Fresnillo Board and I was particularly pleased that this exercise commented on the progress that the Board has made towards becoming an effective working group over the past few years. The Board and each of the Board Committees has had to find its role and best way of working within the framework that we established in 2008 and I believe that the Board evaluation exercise demonstrated the progress made in this regard. The context of the Group has been a key factor in determining our Performance approach to Board succession and development. In the past year we have made two significant appointments – the appointment of our first female Non-executive Director and the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer. Neither of these appointments was made lightly and both have been the result of many months of deliberation involving my Board colleagues, including of course the members of the Nominations Committee. The decisions were based on merit and the expected contributions of each candidate. Perhaps the greatest area of tangible progress in the way that the Board Governance Mr Alberto Baillères works over the past few years has been seen in the development of the Chairman of the Board Group’s approach to risk governance and ethical business principles and practices (particularly those that are relevant to the UK Bribery Act). The management team have initiated a thorough approach to both of these with clear accountability provided by the Audit Committee and ultimately by the Board. To a lesser extent, but nonetheless still important particularly in the current climate, has been the consolidation of the Group processes for monitoring and approving related party transactions over the past five years. The role of the Audit Committee has been key in this and we have tried to demonstrate more fully Financial Statements in this report how we see these processes working. We should not be complacent and the current safety performance of the Group points to a continued need for the HSECR Committee and the Dear Shareholder, Board to oversee management efforts to make the necessary The London Stock Exchange is currently considering how companies improvements in that very important area. with controlling shareholders such as Fresnillo plc should be regulated.

At the time of the Company’s IPO in 2008, the Board sought to establish a transparent governance system, primarily through the Relationship Agreement, which ensures that the Company benefits from Mr Baillères’ leadership and experience whilst being able to demonstrate to other shareholders that the Fresnillo Group is capable of carrying on its business independently. In particular, the Relationship Agreement ensures that transactions and relationships between the Fresnillo Group and its major shareholder are at arm’s length and on competitive commercial terms. Since that time, the Board has sought to build on that system. Thus the duties of the Audit Committee have since been expanded to ensure that financial aspects of related party transactions are reviewed by that committee. Fernando Ruiz has, since 2008, been a retired partner and consultant in the firm Chevez, Ruiz, Zamarripa y Cia., S.C., a firm providing professional services to the Company. Guy Wilson retired as a partner of Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s auditors, in 2008. Mr Wilson was not involved in the provision of audit or any other services to the Company by Ernst & Young LLP prior to his retirement. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 119 Overview Related party governance in practice There are a number of checks and balances which ensure that there is full transparency in the way that related party transactions are dealt with by the Board.

Since 2008, the process by which the Relationship Agreement has been implemented has been developed as specific issues have been addressed by the Board and the Independent Directors under the terms of the Relationship Agreement; the current arrangements are summarised below.

The Board changes during 2012 are, however, the culmination of a process which has been overseen by the Nominations Committee since Fresnillo plc listed in 2008. From the start, the Board and the Nominations Committee were aware that succession issues would need to be addressed and, additionally, during the intervening period, diversity in Board composition has become an issue that has attracted much comment. Thinking for the long term has always been ingrained into the culture and values of this Company and it follows that change is not always rushed. This is certainly true of the work of the Nominations Committee when dealing with Board succession. Nevertheless, 2012 has been a year in which much of the thinking and planning behind the scenes over the past few years has come to fruition. The appointment of María Asunción Aramburuzabala demonstrates our commitment both to gender diversity and to ensuring that the best qualified people serve on our Board. At the time we noted that the appointments of both Mariasun and Alejandro Baillères brought a broad range of experience of Mexican and international business to Board discussions, strengthening the overall mix of skills and experience on the Board. They also give our Board a more balanced age profile within our group of Non-executive Directors. This development sits well with the appointment of our new Chief Executive Officer which could be characterised as a passing of the stewardship of Fresnillo plc to a new generation. The Nominations Committee will continue to monitor the membership of the Board to ensure that it provides the right leadership needs for the Company as it continues with its long-term growth strategy.

The financial statements are prepared by management and reviewed for audit purposes by Ernst & Young LLP prior to being considered by the Audit Committee. Our hard-close audit for the 10 months to 31 October 2012 greatly assists this process, enabling issues to be raised and resolved on a timely basis. Our financial statements, subject to minor disclosure and presentational adjustments, have remained relatively stable over the past five years. The Audit Committee members receive a draft of the full Annual Report some weeks prior to the March meeting, enabling them to ensure that the numbers therein are consistent with those in the financial statements or are sourced from appropriate data. More importantly, they can assess whether the words used are consistent with their understanding of the Company’s business obtained through Board and Audit Committee meeting papers; discussions at those meetings; and other interaction that they have with management; using their experience to assess whether the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable. The above, however, is history; our priorities over the next few years, in addition to our normal review of financial statements and related accounting policies, are: – Continuing to monitor the implementation of the risk management controls to ensure that they are embedded within the organisation. – Ensuring that the internal control environment responds effectively to the organisational growth of the Group as implementation of our strategy unfolds and that internal audit is appropriately aligned in accordance with the suggestions included in Independent Audit Ltd’s independent report that we commissioned this year.

April Follow-up Issues The Audit Committee has evolved its approach to evaluating the going concern basis of preparation for the statutory accounts. This includes assessing whether, in adverse circumstances, there are adequate liquid resources to fulfil the stated strategy. This means that with production profiles at each mine being relatively predictable and with budgeted expenditure for capital investment and exploration being necessary to achieve the strategy, the fundamental risk lies in metal prices, as PTU, tax and dividends are mathematical calculations from operating results. The approach, therefore, is to flex silver and gold prices down to a level at which the Company exhausts its cash resources at 31 December 2014. Those flexed prices are compared to all available external market predictions of the worst future prices of those metals and then, only if not satisfied that there is an adequate cash margin even at those depressed prices, would the Board consider what other actions management could take to ensure adequate cash resources. 130 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Corporate Governance Report continued Risk Management and Internal Controls In December each year, the Audit Committee agrees the process by which the Board will undertake a review of the Group’s system of Since 2008, the Audit Committee has invested a significant amount internal controls.

Strategic Review Fixed remuneration forms a higher proportion of the total than in many of its peer group companies reflecting more closely custom in Mexico. Similarly, changes in share value are not a determinant of variable payments. Instead, my colleagues and I believe that relating a significant portion of such compensation to finding and proving commercially viable long-term gold and silver reserves and resources is the most appropriate way to align the interests of executives and shareholders in matters over which the former have responsibility and control. Consequently, there may be years where share prices fall Performance as a result of falling gold and silver prices but the quantum of variable remuneration may go up and vice versa. While the new Chief Executive Officer is not currently a Board member, and therefore the UK regulations do not strictly require us to report on his remuneration; we have nevertheless reported on Octavio Alvídrez’ remuneration since becoming Chief Executive Officer as if he was a Board member, given our commitment to transparent reporting. Since Fresnillo has become a separately quoted company, the Governance maximum level of variable payments has been increased to provide an extra level of incentive for individual achievement. However, our overall approach diverges from much international practice which we, as a committee, monitor carefully. We are confident that our structure provides an efficient balance to reconcile the best interests of all of our stakeholders.

The list of subsidiary undertakings presented in this note represents the Full List of Subsidiary Undertakings, required to be submitted by Section 409 of the Companies Act 2006. 2. Significant accounting policies (a) Basis of preparation and consolidation, and statement of compliance Basis of preparation and statement of compliance The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 2011, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial instruments and defined benefit pension scheme assets which have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) except when otherwise indicated. 156 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial position as of 31 December 2012 and 2011, and the results of operations and cash flows for the years then ended. Entities that constitute the Group are those enterprises controlled by the Group regardless of the number of shares owned by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Entities are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. These interests primarily represent the interests in Minera Penmont, S. de R.L. de C.V., Minera El Bermejal, S. de R.L. de C.V., Minera Juanicipio, S.A. de C.V. and Exploraciones y Desarrollos Mineros Coneto, S.A. P. I. de C.V. not held by the Group. The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the amount attributed to such interests at initial recognition and the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Any losses of a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance. (b) Changes in accounting policies and disclosures The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011. New and amended standards and interpretations Standards and amendments issued but not yet effective or early adopted up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed below. This listing is of standards and interpretations issued, which the Group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. The Group intends to adopt those standards when they become effective. – IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation – Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (‘OCI’): The amendments to IAS 1 change the grouping of items presented in OCI. Items that could be reclassified (or ‘recycled’) to profit or loss at a future point in time would be presented separately from items that will never be reclassified. The amendment affects presentation only and has no impact on the Group’s financial position or performance. The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012. The Group currently does not have items in OCI that will never be recycled through earnings and therefore, the adoption of this revised standard would not impact the current presentation of the statement of comprehensive income except for the potential impacts of IAS 19 described below, which requires that actuarial gains or losses arising from employee benefits that are currently recognised in the income statement would have to be presented in OCI as items that would never be recycled to the income statement. – IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Amendment): The IASB has issued numerous amendments to IAS 19. The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and is applicable retrospectively from the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Group is currently assessing the impact this interpretation will have on the financial position and performance. The most significant impacts of this standard as it relates to the Group’s consolidated financial position and results of operations are expected to be as follows: – Presentation changes to the statement of comprehensive income: the net actuarial gain recognised in the year will be presented within OCI, instead of being recognised in the income statement; and – Financial performance change: due to presentation changes, the profit/(loss) of the year and earning per shares will be impacted. The Group is currently assessing the full impact of the remaining standards and interpretations (as detailed below): – IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement: The standard reflects the first phase of the IASB’s work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. In subsequent phases, the IASB will address hedge accounting and impairment of financial assets. The Group is in the process of identifying the potential impacts of the current changes to IFRS 9 and will quantify the effects on its consolidated financial position and results of operations in conjunction with the other phases, when issued, to present a comprehensive picture of such impacts on its consolidated financial statements. – IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: The standard replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. It also includes the issues raised in SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 require management to exercise significant judgement to determine which entities are controlled, and therefore, are required to be consolidated by a parent, compared with the requirements that were in IAS 27. This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. The Group is currently assessing the impact this interpretation will have on the financial position and performance. – IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities: IFRS 12 includes all of the disclosures that were previously in IAS 27 related to consolidated financial statements, as well as all of the disclosures that were previously included in IAS 31 and IAS 28. These disclosures relate to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities. A number of new disclosures will also be required. This standard will become effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 with the adoption of IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IAS 27 (2012) and IAS 28 (2012). The Group will include the relevant disclosures required by IFRS 12 upon adoption. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 157 – IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value when fair value is required or permitted. The Group is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its financial position and performance. This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. Given the Group does not currently have non-monetary assets measured at fair value, the potential impacts of this new standard would be in relation to its financial instruments measured at fair value. – IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine (New interpretation): This interpretation provides guidance for the Overview recognition of production stripping costs as a non-current asset. It establishes that stripping costs are recognised as a non-current asset, to the extent the benefit is improved access to ore and only if it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the stripping activity will flow to the entity, the component of the ore body for which access has been improved can be clearly identified and the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with that component can be measured reliably. This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The Group is currently assessing the impact this interpretation will have on the Group’s financial position and performance. The IASB has issued other amendments resulting from Improvements to IFRSs that management does not consider to have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group. Strategic Review (c) Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These judgements and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Judgements Performance Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are: – Determination of functional currencies note 2(d): The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. – Evaluation of projects status note 2(e): The evaluation of project status impacts the accounting for costs incurred and requires management judgement. This includes the assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals to justify the commencement Governance of capitalisation of costs; the timing of the end of the exploration phase and the start of the development phase and the commencement of the production phase. These judgements directly impact the treatment of costs incurred and proceeds from the sale of metals from ore produced. Estimates and assumptions Significant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements include: – Estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources 2(e): Estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources are used to determine the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, in accounting for deferred stripping costs and in performing impairment testing. Estimates are based on information compiled by appropriately qualified persons in conformity with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code. Financial Statements There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves and mineral resources. Assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available. Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of ore reserves and mineral resources and may, ultimately, result in the ore reserves being restated. Changes will impact the carrying value of assets and depreciation and impairment charges recorded in the income statement. – Determination of useful lives of assets for depreciation and amortisation purposes notes 2(e) and 12: Estimates are required to be made by management as to the useful lives of assets. For depreciation calculated under the unit-of-production method, estimated recoverable reserves are used in determining the depreciation and/or amortisation of mine specific assets. This results in a depreciation/amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the estimated remaining life of mine production. Each item’s life, which is assessed annually, has regard to both its physical life limitations and to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the asset is used. – Estimation of the mine closure costs notes 2(k) and 20: Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for mine closure cost as there are numerous factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable. These factors include estimates of the extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, technological changes, regulatory changes, cost increases, mine life and changes in discount rates. Those uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided. The provision at the balance sheet date represents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future closure costs required. – Income tax notes 2(q) and 10: Judgement is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are recognised on the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. 158 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued – Silverstream note 14: The valuation of the Silverstream contract as a derivative financial instrument requires significant estimation by management. The derivative has a term of over 20 years and the value of this derivative is determined using a number of estimates, including the estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources and future production profile of the Sabinas mine, the estimated recoveries of silver from ore mined, estimates of the future price of silver and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. For further detail of this arrangement, see note 14. For further detail on the inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value of this derivative, see note 29. The impact of changes in silver price assumptions, foreign exchange, inflation and the discount rate is included in note 30. (d) Foreign currency translation The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the parent company’s functional currency. The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. For all operating entities, this is US dollars. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined. For entities with functional currencies other than US dollars, as at the reporting date, assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency of the Group by applying the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in other comprehensive income. On disposal of an entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that operation is recognised in the income statement. (e) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. The cost less the residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item’s estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items. Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis for mine buildings and installations, plant and equipment used in the mine production process or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset when not related to the mine production process. Changes in estimates, which mainly affect unit of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively. Depreciation commences when assets are available for use. Land is not depreciated. The expected useful lives are as follows: Years Buildings 5–12 Plant and equipment 4–11 Mining properties and development costs 3–14 Other assets 2–14 An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising at de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is de-recognised. Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. Assets are not depreciated when classified as held for sale. Disposal of assets Gains or losses from the disposal of assets are recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. Mining properties and development costs Payments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the development of the project when incurred. Purchased rights to ore reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination. Mining concessions, when capitalised, are amortised on a straight line basis over the period of time in which benefits are expected to be obtained from that specific concession. Mine development costs are capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment. Mine development activities commence once a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project. When an exploration prospect has entered into the advanced exploration phase and sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals has been obtained pre-operative expenses relating to mine preparation works are also capitalised as a mine development cost. The initial cost of a mining property comprises its construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the mining property into operation and the initial estimate of the provision for mine closure cost. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 159 Revenues from metals recovered from ore mined in the mine development phase, prior to commercial production, are credited to mining properties and development costs. Upon commencement of production, capitalised expenditure is depreciated using the unit of production method based on the estimated economically proven and probable reserves to which they relate. Mining properties and mine development are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value, if any. Overview Construction in progress Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. The cost of construction in progress is not depreciated. Subsequent expenditures All subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying amount of those parts that are replaced, is de-recognised. All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred. Stripping costs Strategic Review In surface mine operations, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste material in order to gain access to the ore bodies (stripping activity). During development and pre-production phases, these costs are capitalised as part of the initial cost of development and construction of the mine and charged as depreciation to the cost of sales, in the income statement, based on the mine’s units of production once commercial production begins. Removal of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a surface mine. This activity is referred to as production stripping and commences at the time that saleable material begins to be extracted from the surface mine. The costs of production stripping are charged to the income statement as operating costs. Further development of a surface mine may occur following initial extraction of saleable material and during the production phase. Stripping activity costs associated with such development activities are capitalised as mining properties and development cost within property, plant and equipment, Performance using a measure that considers the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume, for a given volume of ore production. This measure is known as ‘stripping ratio’. The amount capitalised is subsequently depreciated over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body related to the stripping activity, by using the units of production method. The capitalised stripping asset is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, less impairment in value as applicable. Cost includes the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform the stripping activity that improves access to the identified component of ore, plus an allocation of directly attributable overhead costs. The costs associated with incidental operations are excluded from in the cost of the stripping activity asset. (f) Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be Governance recoverable. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount. Such reviews are undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash flows independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level. If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reflect the asset at the recoverable amount in the balance sheet. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount of an asset The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Fair value is based on an estimate of the amount Financial Statements that the Group may obtain in a sale transaction on an arm’s length basis. In assessing value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independently of those from other assets, or groups of assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. The Group’s cash generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Reversal of impairment An assessment is made each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years. Such impairment loss reversal is recognised in the income statement. (g) Financial assets and liabilites Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held to maturity investments; or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Group recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred. Financial assets are offset with financial liabilities and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 160 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets classified as held-for-trading and other assets designated as fair value through profit or loss at inception are included in this category. Financial assets are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the short term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value, presented as finance costs or finance income in the income statement. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale. After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. Gains or losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Long-term receivables are stated at amortised cost. Loans and receivables from contractors are carried at amortised cost. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding categories and are not held to maturity investments. Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market; therefore a fair value can be reliably measured. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with mark-to-market unrealised gains or losses recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the financial asset is derecognised. Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are de-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense. Fair value In determining estimated fair value, investments in shares or portfolios of listed securities are valued at quoted bid prices. When quoted prices on an active market are not available (and for listed non-actively traded securities), fair value is determined using a valuation technique. Valuation techniques include using a recent arm’s length transaction, if available, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models. If the range of reasonable fair value is significant and the probabilities of the various estimates cannot be reliably assessed, the investment is not re-measured at fair value. De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement. (h) Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired receivables are de recognised when they are assessed as uncollectible. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 161 Available-for-sale financial investments If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement. In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Group considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged, by considering the size of the decline in this value and the historic volatility in changes in fair value. Reversals in respect of equity instruments Overview classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement. (i) Inventories Finished goods and work in progress inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method based on cost of production which excludes borrowing costs. For this purpose, the costs of production include: – personnel expenses, which include employee profit sharing, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore; Strategic Review – the depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore; and – related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). Operating materials and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. An allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventories is determined by reference to specific items of stock. A regular review is undertaken by management to determine the extent of such an allowance. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. (j) Cash and cash equivalents Performance For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts. (k) Provisions Mine closure cost A provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure, restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas) based on a mine Governance closure plan, in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs. At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future economic benefit and is depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates. The provision is reviewed on an annual basis by the Group for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations. Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting the mine closure cost liability and the related asset originally recognised. If, for mature mines, the revised mine assets net of mine closure cost provisions exceed the recoverable value, that portion of the increase is charged directly as an expense. For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss. (l) Employee benefits Financial Statements The Group operates the following plans: Defined benefit pension plan This funded plan is based on each employee’s earnings and years of service. This plan was open to all employees in Mexico until it was closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007. The plan is denominated in Mexican Pesos. For members as at 30 June 2007, benefits were frozen at that date subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index (NCPI). The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an independent actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. The discount rate is the yield on mxAAA (Standard & Poors) and AAA-mex (Fitch Ibca) credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur. Past service costs are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. If the benefits have already vested following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, the past service cost is recognised immediately. The defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan. Defined contribution pension plan A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due. The contributions are based on the employee’s salary. This plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme. 162 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Seniority premium for voluntary separation This unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days of salary per year for those unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service. Non-unionised employees with more than 15 years of service have the right to a payment equivalent to 12 days for each year of service. For both cases, the payment is based on the legal current minimum salary. The cost of providing benefits for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an independent actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur. Other Benefits for death and disability are covered through insurance policies. Termination payments for involuntary retirement (dismissals) are charged to the income statement, when incurred. (m) Employee profit sharing In accordance with the Mexican legislation, companies in Mexico are subject to pay for employee profit sharing (‘PTU’) equivalent to ten percent of the taxable income of each fiscal year. PTU is accounted for as employee benefits and is calculated based on the services rendered by employees during the year, considering their most recent salaries. The liability is recognised as it accrues and is charged to the income statement. PTU, paid in each fiscal year, is considered deductible for income tax purposes. (n) Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date including whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies: a) There is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement; b) A renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term; c) There is a change in the determination of whether fulfilment is dependent on a specified asset; or d) There is a substantial change to the asset. Group as a lessee Finance leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset, or if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are reflected in the income statement. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Group as a lessor Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned. Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting commences or ceases from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios a), c) or d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario b) above. For arrangements entered into prior to 1 January 2005, the date of inception is deemed to be 1 January 2007, in accordance with the transitional requirements of IFRIC 4. (o) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes. Sale of goods Revenue is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes. The Group recognises revenue on a provisional basis at the time concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are delivered to the customer’s smelter or refinery, using the Group’s best estimate of contained metal. Revenue is subject to adjustment once the analysis of the product samples is completed, contract conditions have been fulfilled and final settlement terms are agreed. Any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue once they have been determined. In addition, sales of concentrates and precipitates throughout each calendar month, as well as doré bars that are delivered after the 20th day of each month, are ‘provisionally priced’ subject to a final adjustment based on the average price for the month following the delivery to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract. Doré bars that are delivered in the first 20 days of each month are finally priced in the month of delivery. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 163 For sales of goods that are subject to provisional pricing, revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have been met using the provisional price. The price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and hence separated from the sales contract. At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract until the quotation period ends. The selling price of the metals can be reliably measured as these are actively traded on international exchanges. The revaluing of provisionally priced contracts is recorded as an adjustment to revenue. Other income Overview Other income is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. (p) Exploration expenses Exploration activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource. Exploration expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred and are recorded in the following captions: Strategic Review – Cost of sales: costs relating to in-mine exploration, that ensure continuous extraction quality and extend mine life, and – Exploration expenses: – Costs incurred in geographical proximity to existing mines in order to replenish or increase reserves, and – Costs incurred in regional exploration with the objective of locating new ore deposits in Mexico and Latin America and which are identified by project. Costs incurred are charged to the income statement until there is sufficient probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project. (q) Income tax Performance Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the country the Group operates. Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: Governance – where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and – in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except: Financial Statements – where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and – in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. (r) Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group uses derivatives to reduce certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange which impact its financial and business transactions. Hedges are designed to protect the value of expected production against the dynamic market conditions. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement. 164 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles, European foreign exchange options are valued using the Garmar-Kohlhagen formula. The Silverstream contract is valued using a Net Present Value valuation approach. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for the undertaken hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: Cash flow hedges For derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded as in other comprehensive income and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. For gains or losses related to the hedging of foreign exchange risk these are included, in the line item in which the hedged costs are reflected. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised directly as finance costs, in the income statement of the related period. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in other comprehensive income from the period that the hedge was effective remains separately in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the income statement. When hedging with options, the Group designates only the intrinsic value movement of the hedging option within the hedge relationship. The time value of the option contracts is therefore excluded from the hedge designation. Changes in fair value of time value is recognised in the income statement in finance costs. Embedded derivatives Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract, with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand alone derivatives. (s) Dividend distribution Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company’s shareholders or Board as appropriate. Dividends payable to minority shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company’s subsidiaries. 3. Segment reporting For management purposes the Group is organised into operating segments based on producing mines. At 31 December 2012 the Group has six reportable operating segments following the successful conclusion of the development of the Noche Buena mine in February 2012 and commercial production starting in March 2012. The following segments represent the Group’s six producing mines as follows: – The Fresnillo mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, the world’s largest primary silver mine; – The Saucito mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine; – The Ciénega mine, located in the State of Durango, an underground gold mine; including the San Ramón satellite mine; – The Herradura mine, located in the State of Sonora, an open pit gold mine; – The Soledad-Dipolos mine, located in the State of Sonora, an open pit gold mine; and – The Noche Buena mine, located in State of Sonora, an open pit gold mine. The operating performance and financial results for each of these mines are reviewed by management. As the Group´s chief operating decision maker does not review segment assets and liabilities, the Group has not disclosed this information. The exploration services provided by the exploration companies listed in note 1 and projects under development have been aggregated into the Other segment below. Management monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of performance assessment and making decisions about resource allocation. Segment performance is evaluated without taking into account certain adjustments included in Revenue as reported in the consolidated income statement, and certain costs included within Cost of Sales and Gross Profit which are considered to be outside of the control of the operating management of the mines. The table below provides a reconciliation from segment profit to Gross Profit as per the consolidated income statement. Other income and expenses included in the consolidated income statement are not allocated to operating segments. Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for on an arm’s length basis similar to transactions with third parties. In 2012 and 2011 all revenue was derived from customers based in Mexico. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 165 Operating segments The following tables present revenue and profit information regarding the Group’s operating segments for the year ended 31 December 2012 and 2011, respectively: Year ended 31 December 2012 Overview Adjustments SoledadNoche and US$ thousands Fresnillo Herradura Ciénega Dipolos Saucito Buena Other10 eliminations Total Revenues: Third party 817,731 526,921 303,863 177,553 223,226 108,110 – – 2,157,404 Inter-Segment – – – – 39,062 – 80,180 (119,242) – Segment revenues 817,731 526,921 303,863 117,553 262,288 108,110 80,180 (119,242) 2,157,404 Segment Profit9 656,099 369,551 217,729 112,226 206,356 68,345 75,614 (50,439) 1,655,481 Strategic Review Hedging – – – – – – – – (2,111) Depreciation – – – – – – – – (253,890) Employee profit sharing – – – – – – – – (48,776) Gross profit as per the income statement – – – – – – – – 1,350,704 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Capital expenditure 85,529 109,153 81,875 8,674 54,387 42,018 138,367 – 520,003 1 Capital expenditure consists of additions to property, plant and equipment, excluding additions relating to changes in the mine closure provision.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses amounting to US$67.9 million (2011: US$63.6 million). (d) Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,256 million (2011: US$992.5 million). Financial Statements Income Tax (‘Impuesto Sobre la Renta’ or ‘ISR’) and Business Flat Tax (‘Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Unica’ or ‘IETU’) In accordance with the Mexican tax law, the Group companies in Mexico are subject to Income Tax (‘ISR’) and Business Flat Tax (‘IETU’). IETU is an alternative minimum corporate income tax, effective in January 1, 2008 which replaced the business asset tax as a minimum tax. Companies are required to pay the greater of their mainstream corporate income tax liability for the year or their liability to IETU. The income tax rate for 2011 and 2012 is 30%, On 17 December 2012 new temporary tax rates were published in the Official Daily of the Federal Government. Consequently, the tax rate for 2013 will be 30%, the tax rate for 2014 will be 29% and the tax rate from 2015 will be 28%. Deferred taxes have been calculated at the rate applicable to the year the amounts are expected to materialise. IETU is calculated at the rate of 17.5% and applies to the sale of goods, rendering of independent services and temporary use or enjoyment of goods. In calculating the charge to IETU, deductions are allowed for certain expenses incurred in generating income. In respect of the Group, in 2012 and 2011 management undertook calculations to determine the impact of the IETU provisions on the Group. As a result of such analysis, management concluded that there was no material impact on the Group, since the mainstream corporate income tax liability for each Group company was forecast to be greater than the future potential IETU charge, accordingly, no IETU liability was recognised in either year. 172 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 11. Earnings per share Earnings per share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. The Company has no dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Silverstream contract On 31 December 2007, the Group entered into an agreement with Peñoles through which it is entitled to receive the proceeds received by the Peñoles Group in respect of the refined silver sold from the Sabinas Mine (‘Sabinas’), a base metals mine owned and operated by the Peñoles Group, for an upfront payment of US$350 million. In addition, a per ounce cash payment of $2.00 in years one to five and $5.00 thereafter (subject to an inflationary adjustment commencing on 31 December 2013) is payable to Peñoles. Under the contract, the Group has the option to receive a net cash settlement from Peñoles attributable to the silver produced and sold from Sabinas, to take delivery of an equivalent amount of refined silver or to receive settlement in the form of both cash and silver. If, by 31 December 2032, the amount of silver produced by Sabinas is less than 60 million ounces, a further payment is due from Peñoles of US$1 per ounce of shortfall. The Silverstream contract represents a derivative financial instrument which has been recorded at fair value and classified within non-current and current assets as appropriate. Changes in the contract’s fair value, other than those represented by the realisation of the asset through the receipt of either cash or refined silver, are charged or credited to the income statement. In the year ended 31 December 2012 total proceeds received in cash were US$110.6 million (2011: US$103.1 million) of which, US$13.6 million was in respect of proceeds receivable as at 31 December 2011 (2011: US$7.2 million). Cash received in respect of the year of US$97.0 million (2011: US$95.8 million) corresponds to 3.8 million ounces of payable silver (2011: 2.9 million ounces). As at 31 December 2012, a further US$11 million (2011: US$13.6 million) of cash corresponding to 378,345 ounces of silver is due (2011: 520,088 ounces). The most significant drivers of the US$117.7 million unrealised gain taken to income (2011: US$159.9 million) were the updating of assumptions utilised to value the Silverstream contract, most significantly the forward price of silver, the unwinding of the discount and the difference between payments already received in 2012 and payments estimated in the valuation model as at 31 December 2011. A future downturn in the forward price of silver, which may happen given the cyclical nature of prices, would result in recognising an unrealised loss in the income statement.

Performance 20. Provision for mine closure cost The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated cost to decommission and rehabilitate the mines at the estimated date of depletion of mine deposits. The present value of the provision at 31 December 2012 has been calculated using an annual real discount rate of 4.5 percent (2011: 4.33 percent). The unwinding of discount charge in 2012 has been calculated using a nominal discount rate of 7.5 percent (2011: 7.75 percent). Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning, dismantling, and reclamation alternatives and timing and the levels of discount and inflation rates. Mexican regulations regarding the decommissioning and rehabilitation of mines are limited and less developed in comparison to regulations in many other jurisdictions. It is the Group’s intention to rehabilitate the mines beyond the requirements of Mexican law, and estimated costs reflect this level Governance of expense. The Group intends to fully rehabilitate the affected areas at the end of the life of the mines. The provision is expected to become payable at the end of the production life of each mine, based on the reserves and resources, which ranges from 2 to 38 years from 31 December 2012 (3 to 38 years from 31 December 2011).

These leases have renewal terms at the option of the lessee at lease payments based on market prices at the time of renewal. There are no restrictions placed upon the Group by entering into these leases. Overview The Group has put in place several arrangements to finance mine equipment through loans and the sale of mine equipment to contractors. In both cases, contractors are obligated to use these assets in rendering services to the Group as part of the mining work contract, during the term of financing or credit, which ranges from two to six years. The Group considers that the related mining work contracts contain embedded operating leases.

Contingencies As of 31 December 2012, the Group has the following contingencies: – The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. – Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods. Governance In addition, because a number of tax periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest. It is not practical to determine the amount of any such potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable. – On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the ‘Separation Agreement’). This agreement relates to the separation of the Group and the Peñoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 (‘Admission’). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the case of Peñoles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly Financial Statements attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Peñoles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate. – Peñoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to (i) any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation (including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo Group, provided that Peñoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peñoles Group on or after Admission), the Global Offer or Admission and (ii) certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions. Peñoles’ liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 million. If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peñoles’ tax consolidation pays an intra-group dividend in excess of its net income tax account (‘Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta’ o ‘CUFIN’) account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation, it is required to pay Peñoles an amount in respect of that tax. 182 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued – On 30 November 2012, the Mexican government enacted a new federal labour law. Management is currently evaluating the new labour law for any potential impacts on the operations and financial position of the Group but it is currently impracticable to estimate any such effects as at 31 December 2012. – In 2009 five members of the El Bajio agrarian community in the state of Sonora (the “Claimants”), who claim rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Minera Penmont”), lodged a legal claim with the Unitarian Agrarian Court of Hermosillo, Sonora to have Minera Penmont vacate an area of this surface land. The land in dispute encompasses a portion of surface area where part of the operations of Soledad and Dipolos, one of Minera Penmont’s three operating mines, are located. Soledad and Dipolos represents approximately 22.0 percent of the gold production of Minera Penmont and 12.7 percent of the Group’s attributable gold production. Although the Claimants obtained a ruling in their favour by the Mexican Supreme Court in September 2012, certain legal proceedings are currently progressing to challenge the standing of this ruling, including a challenge by the El Bajio agrarian community as a whole as well as a collective challenge by multiple other members of said agrarian community. In parallel with this, Minera Penmont is in the process of seeking the expropriation of the disputed land in its favour, a process defined under Federal law in Mexico. It is not expected that this matter will have a significant impact on the Company’s operations or financial position but it is not currently possible to determine the amount and timing of any financial impact that may arise. Minera Penmont’s mining concessions are held by way of separate title to that relating to the surface land. 26.

(b) Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of the financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

Performance A reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance for Level 3 financial instruments other than Silverstream (which is disclosed in note 14) is shown below: 2012 2011 US$ thousands US$ thousands Balance at 1 January: (14,479) 6,162 Changes in fair value 4,262 6,162 Realised embedded derivatives during the year 4,081 (26,803) Governance Balance at 31 December (6,136) (14,479) Silverstream contract: The fair value of the Silverstream contract is determined using a valuation model (for further information relating to the Silverstream contract see note 14). This derivative has a term of over 20 years and the valuation model utilises a number of inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the nature of these inputs and/or the duration of the contract. Inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the future price of silver, future foreign exchange rates between the Mexican Peso and US Dollar, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. The sensitivity of the valuation to the inputs relating to market risks, being the price of silver, foreign exchange rates, inflation and the discount rate Financial Statements is disclosed in note 30. The estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable silver reserves and resources, the related production profile based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of silver from ore mined. The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time. Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Peñoles, the operator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine and provided to the Company. The production profile and estimated payable silver that will be recovered from ore mined is based on the latest plan and estimates, also provided to the Company by Peñoles. The inputs assume no interruption in production over the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years. Embedded derivatives within sales contracts: Sales of concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are ‘provisionally priced’ and revenue is initially recognised using this provisional price and the Group’s best estimate of the contained metal. Revenue is subject to final price and metal content adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery (see note 2 (o)). This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and is separated from the sales contract. At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the relevant sales contract. The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a non-observable input to this valuation. At 31 December 2012 the fair value of embedded derivatives within sales contracts was US$(6.1) million (2011: US$(14.5) million). The revaluation effects of embedded derivatives arising from these sales contracts are recorded as an adjustment to revenues. 188 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued (c) Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with costs incurred in Mexican Pesos and other currencies. The Group entered into a number of forward derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

These derivative instruments mature over the period from 15 March 2013 to 14 June 2013 with a weighted average rate of SEK6.78: US$1. The Group does not apply hedge accounting for SEK:USD forward contracts, therefore, changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement in the year. The Group also entered into Mexican Peso-US dollar collars to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Collar derivative instruments mature over the period from 7 January 2013 to 12 August 2013.

These derivative instruments mature over the period from 13 March 2012 to 12 March 2014 with a weighted average rate of SEK6.69: US$1. The Group does not apply hedge accounting for SEK:USD forward contracts, therefore, changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement in the year. The Group also entered into Mexican Peso-US dollar collars to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Collar derivative instruments matured over the period from 9 April 2012 to 12 November 2012. The collar instruments hedged costs denominated in Mexican Peso amounting to US$82 million with a range of floor prices from MX$12.00 to MX$13.50:US$1 and a range of capped prices from MX$12.65 to MX$16.04:US$1. The fair value of the put options at 31 December 2011 was an asset of US$0.1 million, and the fair value of the call options at 31 December 2011 was a liability of US$6.2 million. The Group also entered into Euro-US dollar collars which matured on 2 July 2012. The collar instruments hedged costs denominated in Euros amounting to €5 million with a range of floor prices from US$1.31 to US$1.37:€1 and a cap price of US$1.50:€1. The fair value of the put options at 31 December 2011 was a liability of US$0.5 million, and the fair value of the call options at 31 December 2011 was an asset of US$0.1 million. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 189 The following table summarises the movements in deferred gains or losses on derivative instruments qualifying for hedge accounting, net of tax effects, recorded in other comprehensive income for the year: As at 31 December 2011 2012 2011 Overview US$ thousands US$ thousands Beginning balance (5,881) 2,172 1 Gains/(losses) recycled to income statement during the year 2,488 (7,158) Deferred tax recycled (746) 2,147 Gains recycled to the value of other assets 965 – Deferred tax recycled (289) – Unrealised gains/(losses) before tax arising during the year 5,924 (4,341) Strategic Review Deferred tax on unrealised (losses)/gains arising during the year and taken directly to equity (1,777) 1,302 Ending balance 684 (5,878) 1 Gains recycled to income are included in cost of sales. 30. Financial risk management Overview The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale assets and trade payables. Performance The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: – Market risk, including foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks – Credit risk – Liquidity risk This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. Governance The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. Financial Statements (a) Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates will affect the Group’s income or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. 190 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Foreign currency risk The Group has financial instruments that are denominated in Mexican Peso, Euros and Swedish Krona which are exposed to foreign currency risk. Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar include the purchase of services, dividends, fixed assets, spare parts and other items. As a result, the Group has financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican Peso. In order to manage the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk on expenditure denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, the Group has entered into certain forward and option derivative contracts with maturity dates from 2013 to 2014 (see note 29 for additional detail). The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican Peso, reflecting the impact on the Group’s profit before tax and equity, with all other variables held constant.

The financial assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, the Silverstream contract and available-for-sale financial assets. The Group’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties’ failure to honour their obligations. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counter party. The Group’s financial assets are with counterparties with what the Performance Group considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 26, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Group’s financial assets were neither impaired nor past due, other than ‘Other receivables’ as disclosed in note 16. The Group’s policies are aimed at minimising losses from foreign currency hedging contracts. The Company’s foreign currency hedging contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings. The Group has a high concentration of trade receivables with one counterparty Met-Mex Peñoles, the Group’s primary customer throughout 2012 and 2011. A further concentration of credit risk arises from the Silverstream contract. Both Met-Mex and the counterparty to the Silverstream contract are subsidiaries in the Peñoles group which currently owns 77 percent of the shares of the Company and is considered by management to be of appropriate credit rating. The Group’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents investing Governance in a number of financial institutions. Accordingly on an ongoing basis the Group deposits cash and cash equivalents on a short term basis with a range of financial institutions, depending on market conditions. In order to minimize exposure to credit risk, the Group only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of P-1 (Moody´s) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poors) and above, and only for periods of less than 30 days. As at 31 December 2012 the Group had concentrations of credit risk as 53 percent of cash and cash equivalents was deposited with one financial institution and 46 percent was held in short term Mexican government paper. The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See note 13 for the maximum credit exposure to available-for-sale financial assets, note 17 for cash and cash equivalents and note 26 for related party balances with Met-Mex. The maximum credit exposure with relation to the Silverstream contract is the value of the derivative as at 31 December 2012, being US$487.8 million (2011:US$478.1 million). Financial Statements 194 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued (c) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows from operations and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Management considers that the Group has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities. Capital management The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value. Management considers capital to consist only of equity as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains or losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder’s capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Group’s dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows, including cash flows from the Silverstream. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 195 Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Fresnillo plc We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Fresnillo plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the parent Company Statement of Comprehensive Income, the parent Company Balance Sheet, the parent Company Cash Flow Statement, the parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 18.

Corporate information Fresnillo plc (‘the Company’) is a public limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 6. The Company is a Mexican resident for taxation purposes with tax residency in Mexico City. For further information see note 5. Industrias Peñoles S.A.B. de C.V. (‘Peñoles’) currently owns 77 percent of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baillères family, whose beneficial interest is held through Peñoles. The country of incorporation of Peñoles is Mexico. Copies of Peñoles’ accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx. The primary activity of the Company is as holding company for the Fresnillo Group of companies. The financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2012 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 11 March 2013. 2. Significant accounting policies (a) Basis of preparation and statement of compliance The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 2011, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s financial statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which considers the realisation of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at 31 December 2012, the Company is in a net current liability position due to an increase in the intercompany loan. The Company’s Directors confirm that Fresnillo plc’s subsidiaries have funds and distributable earnings available for distribution sufficient to repay the intercompany loan and to fund other forecast liabilities of the Company to be incurred in the next twelve months. Further, given that the loan counter-party is a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that it will not request a repayment of the loan until such time as the Company has sufficient cash balances to make the repayment. As such the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements of the Company is deemed appropriate. The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial instruments which have been measured at valued at fair value. The financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$000) except when otherwise indicated. The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated. (b) Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011. New and amended standards and interpretations Standards and amendments issued but not yet effective or early adopted up to the date of issuance of the Company’s financial statements are listed below. This listing is of standards and interpretations issued, which the Company reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. The Company intends to adopt those standards when they become effective. – IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation – Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (‘OCI’): The amendments to IAS 1 change the grouping of items presented in OCI. Items that could be reclassified (or ‘recycled’) to profit or loss at a future point in time (for example, upon derecognition or settlement) would be presented separately from items that will never be reclassified. The amendment affects presentation only and has no impact on the Company’s financial position or performance. The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012. The Company currently does not have items in OCI that will never be recycled through earnings and therefore, the adoption of this revised standard would not impact the current presentation of the statement of comprehensive income. The Company is currently assessing the full impact of the remaining standards and interpretations (as detailed below): – IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (as revised in 2012): As a consequence of the new IFRS 10 and IFRS 12 (see below), what remains of IAS 27 does not change the recognition and presentation requirements as it relates to accounting for subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities, and associates in separate financial statements (cost method or fair value) and as a result the adoption of this revised standard is not expected to impact the parent Company financial statements. The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, with early adoption permitted. – IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement: The standard reflects the first phase of the IASBs work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. In subsequent phases, the IASB will address hedge accounting and impairment of financial assets. The Company is in the process of identifying the potential impacts of the current changes to IFRS 9 and will quantify the effects on its financial position and performance in conjunction with the other phases, when issued, to present a comprehensive picture of such impacts on its financial statements. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 201 – IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: The standard replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. It also includes the issues raised in SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 require management to exercise significant judgement to determine which entities are controlled, and therefore, are required to be consolidated by a parent, compared with the requirements that were in IAS 27. This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January Overview 2014 with early adoption permitted. The Group is currently assessing the impact this interpretation will have on financial position and performance – IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on the financial position and performance. This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with early adoption permitted. Given that the Company does not currently have non-monetary assets measured at fair value, the potential impacts of this new standard would be in relation to its financial instruments measured at fair value. Given the Company does not currently have non-monetary assets measured at fair value, the potential impacts of this new standard would be in relation to its financial instruments measured at fair value. Strategic Review The IASB has issued other amendments resulting from Improvements to IFRSs that management does not consider to have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group. (c) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These judgements and estimates are based on management’s knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimation is in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the financial statements. Performance Judgements Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are: – Determination of functional currency note 2(d): The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. Estimates and assumptions Significant areas of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the consolidated financial information include: Governance – Impairment and subsequent reversal of impairment of investments in subsidiaries notes 2(e) and 6: The Company assesses the investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. A value in use assessment requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an impairment charge. At 31 December 2012, no impairment Financial Statements has been recognised. – Valuation of derivative financial instruments notes 2(l) and 17: Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. (d) Foreign currency translation The Company’s financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company. The functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined. 202 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued (e) Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and financial policies, generally by owning more than 50% of voting rights. Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment. When the Company incurs increases in or return of share capital, to/from its subsidiaries, such movements are recognised as an addition or return of capital to the original cost recognised in investment in subsidiaries. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the investment in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. When this information is not available the fair value is determined based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries, using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount. Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss is reversed to profit or loss to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. (f) Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held to maturity investments; or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Company recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred. Financial assets are offset with liabilities and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Financial assets Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets classified as held-for-trading and other assets designated as fair value transactions through profit and loss at inception are included in this category. Financial assets are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term. Derivatives are also classified as heldfor-trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale. After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Long-term receivables are stated at amortised cost. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding categories and are not held-to-maturity investments. Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market; therefore a fair value can be reliably measured. After initial measurement, available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value with mark-to-market unrealised gains or losses being recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the financial asset is derecognised. Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are de-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense. Financial liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process. Fair value In determining estimated fair value, investments in shares or portfolios of listed securities are valued at quoted bid prices. When quoted prices on an active market are not available (and for listed non-actively traded securities), fair value is determined using a valuation technique. Valuation techniques include using a recent arm’s length transaction, if available, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models. If the range of reasonable fair value is significant and the probabilities of the various estimates cannot be reliably assessed, the investment is not re-measured at fair value. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 203 De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, Overview such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement. (g) Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss Strategic Review is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. The Company first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. Performance If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired receivables are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible. Available-for-sale financial investments If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortisation) Governance and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement. In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Company considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged by considering the size of the decline in this value and the historic volatility in changes in fair value. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement. (h) Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months. Financial Statements For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts. (i) Share capital Ordinary shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue. The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue. (j) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes. Trademark royalties Trademark royalty income is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received. Interest income Interest income is recognised as interest accrues (using the effective interest method; i.e. the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset). Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established. (k) Income tax Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 204 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: – where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and – in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: – where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and – in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. (l) Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. In the Group’s consolidated financial statements these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Company’s stand-alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges. Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement. Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. Embedded derivatives Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Company first becomes party to the contract, with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives. (m) Dividend distribution Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 3. Profit or loss attributable to the parent Company The profit for the Company is US$434.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 (2011: US$507.5 million). In accordance with the exemption granted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 a separate income statement for the Company has not been presented. 4.

Performance The amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities before offset as at 31 December considering the nature of the temporary differences are as follows: Year ended 31 December 2012 2011 US$ thousands US$ thousands Prepayments and other 3,774 (5,660) Derivative financial instruments (515) 4,064 Available-for-sale financial assets (16,386) (8,110) Governance Net deferred tax balances (13,127) (9,706) (c) Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries The Company has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,256 million (2011: US$992.5 million). Income Tax (‘ImpuestoSobre la Renta’ or ‘ISR’) and Business Flat Tax (‘Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Unica’ or ‘IETU’) In accordance to the Mexican tax law, the Company is subject to Income Tax (‘ISR’) and Business Flat Tax (‘IETU’). IETU is an alternative minimum Financial Statements corporate income tax, effective in January 1, 2008 which replaced the business asset tax. Companies are required to pay the greater of their mainstream corporate income tax liability for the year or their liability to IETU. The income tax rate for 2011 and 2012 is 30%, On 17 December 2012 new temporary tax rates were published in the Official Daily of the Federal Government. Consequently, the tax rate for 2013 will be 30%, the tax rate from 2014 will be 29% and the tax rate from 2015 will be 28%. The deferred taxes have been calculated at the rate applicable to the year the amounts are expected to materialise. IETU is calculated at the rate of 17.5% and applies to the sale of goods, rendering of independent services and temporary use or enjoyment of goods. In calculating the charge to IETU, deductions are allowed for certain expenses incurred in generating income. The Company is a Mexican resident for taxation purposes. In 2012 and 2011 management undertook calculations to determine the impact of the IETU provisions on the Company. As a result of such analysis, management has concluded that there was no material impact on the Company, since the mainstream corporate income tax liability of the Company is forecast to be greater than the future potential IETU charge. Accordingly no IETU liability was recognised in either year. 206 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 www.fresnilloplc.com Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 6.

The Company’s exposure to currency and liquidity risk related to trade and other payables in disclosed in note 18. 13. Contingencies As of 31 December 2012 the Company has the following contingencies: – The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. – Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of the corporate income tax return, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods. In addition, because a number of tax periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest. It is not practical to determine the amount of any such potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Company has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable. – On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the ‘Separation Agreement’). This agreement relates to the separation of the Fresnillo Group (‘the Group’) and the Peñoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 (‘Admission’). The Separation Agreement provides for crossindemnities between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the case of Peñoles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Peñoles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate. – Peñoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to (i) any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation (including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo Group, provided that Peñoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peñoles Group on or after Admission), the Global Offer or Admission and (ii) certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions. Peñoles’ liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 million. If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peñoles’ tax consolidation pays an intra-group dividend in excess of its net income tax account (‘Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta’ or ‘CUFIN’) account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation, it is required to pay Peñoles an amount in respect of that tax. – On 30 November 2012, the Mexican government enacted a new federal labour law. Management is currently evaluating the new labour law for any potential impacts on the operations and financial position of the Group but it is currently impracticable to estimate any such effects as at 31 December 2012. – In 2009 five members of the El Bajio agrarian community in the state of Sonora (the “Claimants”), who claim rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Minera Penmont”), lodged a legal claim with the Unitarian Agrarian Court of Hermosillo, Sonora to have Minera Penmont vacate an area of this surface land. The land in dispute encompasses a portion of surface area where part of the operations of Soledad and Dipolos, one of Minera Penmont’s three operating mines, are located. Soledad and Dipolos represents approximately 22.0 per cent of the gold production of Minera Penmont and 12.7 per cent of the Group’s attributable gold production. Although the Claimants obtained a ruling in their favour by the Mexican Supreme Court in September 2012, certain legal proceedings are currently progressing to challenge the standing of this ruling, including a challenge by the El Bajio agrarian community as a whole as well as a collective challenge by multiple other members of said agrarian community. In parallel with this, Minera Penmont is in the process of seeking the expropriation of the disputed land in its favour, a process defined under Federal law in Mexico. It is not expected that this matter will have a significant impact on the Company’s operations or financial position but it is not currently possible to determine the amount and timing of any financial impact that may arise. Minera Penmont’s mining concessions are held by way of separate title to that relating to the surface land. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 209 14.

Financial Risk Management Overview The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, are comprised of trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale assets and trade payables. The Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing foreign exchange risk arising on the activity and transactions of its subsidiaries. The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: – Market risk, including foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risks – Credit risk – Liquidity risk This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework. The Company’s risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. (a) Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, or interest rates will affect the Company income or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2012 213 Foreign currency risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchase of services, dividends and other items. As a result, the Company has financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso. Overview The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Company’s profit before tax with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods. There is no impact on the Company’s equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.

The Company’s earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any floating element of the Company’s interest bearing loans and borrowings and interest earned on cash balances. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of all financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of available-for-sale assets to a reasonably possible change in market price of these equity instruments, reflecting the effect on the Company’s profit before tax and equity: Effect on equity: Increase/(decrease) Effect on profit before tax: increase/(decrease) Year ended 31 December in equity price increase/(decrease) US$ thousands 2012 30% – 38,233 (30%) – (38,233) 2011 20% – 18,972 (20%) – (18,972) (b) Credit risk Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Company’s ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets and derivative financial instruments. The financial assets are trade and other receivables, intercompany loans, cash and cash equivalents and availablefor-sale financial assets. The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties’ failure to honour their obligations. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Company’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counter party. The Company’s financial assets are with counterparties with what the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 14a, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Company’s financial assets were neither impaired nor past due. The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising losses from the foreign currency hedging contracts. The Company’s foreign currency derivative contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings The Company’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in a number of financial institutions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Company only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of P-1 (Moody´s) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poors) and above, and only for periods of less than 30 days. The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See note 7 for the maximum credit exposure for available-for-sale investments, note 9 for cash and cash equivalents and note 14 for related party balances. (c) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Performance Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities. Capital management The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value. Management considers capital to consist only of equity as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains and losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder’s capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Company’s dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows.

demonstrated economic viability. All figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Metal assays were capped where appropriate. Mineral resources are reported at variable metal equivalent cut-off grades and assuming 100% metal recovery except for Orisyvo, Lucerito, Candameña and Guachichil where mineral resources are reported inside a conceptual pit shell based on reasonable mining and processing costs, and recoveries for all material types. Equivalent metal grades are based on US$1,400 per ounce of gold, US$27.00 per ounce of silver, US$0.96 per pound of zinc and US$1.00 per pound of lead. 2 Portions of the Valdecañas deposit within the Minera Juanicipio SA property where Fresnillo plc holds a 56% interest.
