Principles for reporting The purpose of SE’s CSR report is to give a comprehensive, overall balanced presentation of CSR-related opinions, goals, topics, activities and results for 2012 at the group level. We believe that the report meets this goal. The report also serves as the annual ProgressReport, as required by the United Nations Global Compact, and the mandatory Corporate Social Reponsibility report (CSR) pursuant to the Danish Annual Reports Act §99a. The report has been drafted based on the reporting principles in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the accompanying sector supplement for utility companies. As the sector supplement for telecomIntroduction munications is still being drafted, this will not be used. An overview of relevant GRI indicators and references appears on page 50. The selected themes in the report are based on SE’s CSR strategy, which was creLegitimate and responsible businesses practices ated in 2011, as well as inputs from the ongoing dialog with our customers, interested parties and partners and selected based on an assessment of interest and importance. Based on these assessments, the most interested parties include SE’s Improving customers’ sustainability and digitalization major customers, the board of Representatives, directors, employees, partners, suppliers, the media and NGOs.

It may sound a little bombastic when we start off with our general CSR vision, especially since SE is a group that ideally should be recognized for expressing things clearly and distinctly. We also believe that it is important to have visions. However, the most important thing is for visions not just to be bombastic declarations, but for them to be into reality. We would like to demonstrate this in the second version of our CSR report. The CSR is, in fact, a natural part of the way we at SE do business, and a part of our cooperative DNA. Our CSR vision should therefore be carried out in our business dealings and in the way we take on every single day. At SE we would like to run a healthy business, where profitablity and sustainability support each other and where we actively contribute to society. We do not see sustainability and profitability as being at odds with each other – on the contrary. Both have great possibilities for creating growth and development in the society that surrounds us. Being sustainable while also earning money is a focal point that can lift us up and prepare us for the possibilities that the green and digital society of the future brings with it. It is common sense. >> >> 12 – 13 welcome CSR is an ongoing process We do what we say … In 2011, SE created a vision and strategy statement for CSR, which was a natural part At SE we back up our words with actions. When we say of the process of our business plan “20i15”. In 2012 we continued this development, that we will reduce climate impact, we first start in house always bearing in mind that it should benefit the customers. Creating the best total and use the skills that we have to create the most suscustomer experiences therefore also means ensuring that the product is delivered to tainable and profitable operations.

We do not solid growth and opportunities for the society we are a part of, and which create a want to just go with the flow, but would like to be an exstrong foundation for the fossil-free and digitalized society of the future. ample that will be an inspiration to others. Our CSR is business-driven, and for us a legitimate and responsible way of doing With the ambition of participating in the initiative, in 2012 business is the basis of our four big building blocks: That we lead as a role model by we acceded to the United Nations Global Compact, strengthening our own sustainability and digitalization.

Therefore we continuously place great demands on the foundation on which proper business practices should be based, including the high standards of the responsibility that is displayed by our suppliers and collaborators.

Our vision is to be the preferred partner tannery in China. for large Danish and foreign companies, municipalities and public institutions which want to reduce their energy costs and show climate awareness by creating a basis for a CO2-neutral society. At SE Big Blue we have gathered some of Denmark’s strongest skills in energy and climate efficiency with the clear goal of creating visible energy savings on the bottom line of the largest companies and municipalities in Denmark. With the purchase of the shares of consulting engineering company Enervision in 2012, we took over full ownership of a company that is behind a number of the largest energy efficiency projects in the history of Denmark. This is a fundamental milestone in our ambition to gather Denmark’s strongest skills in energy and climate efficiency. SE Big Blue delivers full-service solutions One of our great strengths is that we can act as a full-service provider, handling all parts of the process the customer requires. A process that forms the basis for Before the end of 2015, making energy consumption more efficient and neutralizing any additional climate SE Big Blue aims to reduce impact. total Danish energy consumption In 2012, the Danish EU presidency succeeded in negotiating an energy efficiency by the equivalent of 25% of directive which, according to the EU Commission’s own calculations, opens electricity consumption in an energy efficiency market of DKK 1,500 billion. The directive is also expected to create a six-digit number of workplaces up to 2020.

We will actively contribute to converting the entire energy system in South Jutland from fossil to the modern, digital and sustainable energy system, also known as “Smart Grid”, a major element of which is fiber broadband. Since 2006, we have been involved in a project with Energinet.dk to ensure that we will be able to meet and handle the the energy system’s challenges of the future with factors such as wind power. Our energy system is in fact going to be transformed to be better at handling wind power and other energy sources with wide fluctuations. Contrary to fossil fuels, enNumber of ergy sources such as wind power are naturally harder to store and consequently broadband customers control. A control mechanism therefore needs to be incorporated to control the amount of energy being consumed.

We focus on creating a working framework in which job satisfaction means positive experiences. A happy employee means a healthy business, which is fundamental to the total customer experience.

We constantly strive to maintain a unique and inclusive employee culture where also invite external employees with special work-related everyone can reach their full potential.

As a consumer-owned cooperative, we feel a great responsibility and an obligation to ensure growth and development in our supply area. The fundamental concept at SE is to unite the two megatrends – sustainability and digitalization – thereby strengthening the immediate area and creating new business opporutnities. In past years there has been a lot of discussion about the “outer regions of Denmark”, and the synergies that are necessary to strengthen competitiveness, create and maintain workplaces, develop skills and promote cohesion. We believe that sustainability and digitalization are two important cornerstones of the solution. The fiber broadband creates growth and security We want to roll fiber broadband out for all of South Jutland, because we are certain that it will help create the basis for the necessary growth and development in the region. Fiber broadband gives business customers a competitive advantage and bolsters the opportunity for home workplaces. It gives citizens new access to public educational and welfare services, and gives the individual family completely new opportunities or experiences on their digital media. SE’s investment in fiber broadband is thus an investment in Danish society and the future. According to the most recent broadband map, created by the Danish Telecommunications Authority, we are the leading fiber region in Denmark, and combined with the most recent broadband reports from the EU, the most fiber-intensive region in FIBER BROADBAND Europe. A high-speed connection is very important for how attractive a residential ACCESSABILITY area is for local competitiveness. It is about the number of local companies, job opportunities, schools, etc. Therefore, roll-out will help smooth out challenges that are Broadband map created by the Danish Business Authority in 2012. The colors clearly show that characteristic to the “outer regions of Denmark”. It also helps create opportunities South Jutland is the leading fiber region for more digital communication, which brings with it greater security and improved in Denmark. opportunities that geography has limited in the past. At the same time, the fiber network promotes growth towards a sustainable and climate-friendly Denmark, including new business opportunities and more workplaces.
