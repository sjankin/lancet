Communication on Progress Year: 2012 STATEMENT BY GM For The Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Ghana Limited, incorporating the principles of the Global Compact into our business means ensuring sustainability for our numerous stakeholders such as our consumers, customers, regulators, share holders and our communities. It also means finding new ways to support the principles and updating our current practises that support the principles. As such, we as a company have the intention of implementing a new sustainability programme called the Source Water Protection Plan (SWPP). The purpose of this plan is to encourage the judicious use of water in our operations and to minimise its wastage. We believe this will go a long way to promote our environmental responsibility to the people and communities we operate in. On the people front, for the first time this year, the company gave out Christmas baskets or goodies to outsourced or third party employees in addition to our permanent employees, something that was a great concern for all and brought smiles and cheers to many faces and their families. This gesture was to support the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation principle. We have also created a new interface called bOnPC/iScala interface which updates the iScala to avoid any human intervention and ensure data integrity. This is part of our efforts to check corruption in the company and rather promote fair business. The bOnPC installed some years ago continues to provide complete transactional processing solutions to our daily operations. We still encourage our employees to use the systems in place to perform fair business and not engage in anything that encourages corruption. Productivity –based incentive schemes since its inception has still been in operation and remuneration for Management staff is still linked to business performance. Our performance management cycle lasts for a P 1/7 year, during which objectives are set and agreed on, then carefully monitored over 3 interim assessments, culminating in a final evaluation which is done at the end of the year leading to rewards. Our relationship with our communities and the planet through our corporate social responsibility is still going strong. Schools and hospitals facilities were rehabilitated in line with our strategies to enhance education and better health for the deprived in society. And at the workplace, there has been a consistent approach in ensuring gender equality by way of recruitment and promotion. Also in commemorating World Aids Day, several posters were put up by our trained peer educators to create awareness about the HIV disease. Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) were also conducted at the plant premises for all staff and health personnel educated staff about the disease. We continue to have a mutual relationship with all our Local Unions, labour regulatory authorities and agencies in promoting the human and labour rights of all. Our next social audit which ensures that the company and all third parties comply with standard workplace practises will be carried out again in 2013 after a successful one in March 2010. With all these strategies and activities in place, The Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Ghana continues to imbibe the ten principles of the Global Compact into its business to ensure that sustainability is achieved for all.

We have consistently maintained our scope on our Coca-Cola systems as well as OHSAS 18001:2007 to our operations. In line with this we successfully applied and got certified in Occupational Health & Safety OHSAS 18001:2007. To ensure the continual safety of our workforce, visitors and contractors, work rules on safety practices have been developed and strictly enforced through coaching, awareness creation, refresher trainings, structural modification and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Use. To ensure root cause of injuries are captured and addressed, an accident reporting system is designed and recorded. P 3/7 WORKFORCE ENGAGEMENT We support the rule of law and collaborate with the labour authority in the legal resolution of complaints.

As at December 2012, we had no records of Human Rights abuses. rd In March 2010, both company and all 3 parties partook in an external social audit in which we all successfully passed. The purpose of the audit was to demonstrate our compliance with local labour laws in our supply chain. In the audits, particular emphasis was laid on child labour, forced labour, abuse of labour, and freedom of association, collective bargaining, wages and benefits, working hours, overtime, health, safety and environment. Results showed a high level of compliance. TCCBCG is also committed to investigating any allegations of human rights abuses made against the company.

A General Meeting between the Union Executives and the whole members of the Union is held quarterly. These meetings are approved and expensed by company. Top management holds quarterly communications meetings with the Local Union, COCASSA, UNICOF and CCMA. These meetings serve as platforms where the associations hold free face-to-face discussions with the Chief Executive and his team. The company holds annual staff durbars – a general meeting of all staff with the Executive Management. The meeting is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). It is an open forum in which the discussions centre on the general P 4/7 “health and welfare” of the Company.

The management – employee associations’ relations have been strengthened with a seamless and continuous twoway dialogue with employees, communicating the business strategy and listening to employee opinions and concerns. The communications channels for employees include open door policies, employee forums and confidential dialogues. The elected Union Executive Office holders received training in July 2012 on the following topics: The New Ghana Labour Act (Act 651), Industrial Relations, Productivity Based Bargaining, Discipline at the Workplace and Performance Management.

This system provides detailed business information on all daily transactions that feeds into other applications for all levels of reporting and analysis. It also serves as a good auditing tool. In addition, there has been a bOnPC/iScala interface which updates the iScala to avoid any human intervention and ensure data integrity. P 7/7
