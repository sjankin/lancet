Obtain certificates, pre­assessments or draft reports from design team if they exist. The rating, % performance, scheme name and scheme year have been provided by certified assessors in formal reports or are included in the final certificate. Scores of draft reports and pre­assessments are liable to change before final certification. For the Hereford development, there are a large number of BREEAM pre­assessments which have been combined into one row with an indicative representative score.
