Valorization, recognition and training are strategies to foster employee engagement and people performance RELATÓRIO ANUAL 2012 management In 2012 BM&FBOVESPA stepped up its investment and initiatives in employee and leader training, in organizational climate management, and in the development of a new organizational culture. Opinion of Value Survey In 2011, as part of the evolution of its management model, organizational culture and continuous workplace improvement process, BM&FBOVESPA conducted an organizational climate survey called Opinion of Value to RELATÓRIO ANUAL ANNUAL REPORT 2012 2012 diagnose the level of employee satisfaction and engagement, and find out about the expectations and aspirations of the workforce. Employees voluntarily formed 20 working groups, which during 2012 drew up action plans to cover the requirements pinpointed by the survey. The actions were grouped as outlined below. RELATÓRIO ANUAL 2012 ANNUAL REPORT 20 Corporate communication – One of the main findings of the survey was the need to enhance the organization’s capacity to plan and prioritize targets, align targets between areas, and give direction to its teams. The actions adopted to achieve this enhancement included the creation of a Strategic Planning Unit, the implementation of important initiatives such as communication of the 2012 Corporate Plan to all levels of the organization, the alignment and sharing of targets across units up to the Executive Board level, the creation of a Project Portfolio Management Committee (CGP), and preparation of the 2013 Corporate Plan approved by the Board of Directors. Training and development – The company continued to invest in the Leaders Days Program, external assessment activities, coaching, and other structured face-to-face programs for managers focusing more intensely on such subjects as performance and recognition, and training and development. 30 31 capítulo 5 people management Processes – Several working groups identified proorganization through practical actions and projThe number of leaders trained in 2012 was 250, note that no one employed by the company was cesses as a root cause and called for processes to ects for the coming year. with a total of 546 participations in the various paid the minimum wage either in 2012 or in previbe improved.

Support for the clearinghouse integration project also included internal knowledge multiplication training for teams, totaling 20.77 hours. Human Rights In 2012 the company continued to deliver on its commitment to analyze and accredit suppliers in accordance with its procurement policy, focusing above all on the mitigation of risks relating to corporate image, labor claims, child labor and slave labor. In addition, the company requires supplier clearance certificates, credit checks with Serasa Experian, and checks with the Office of the Comptroller General (www.cgu.gov.br) and the Transparency Portal (www. portaltransparencia.gov.br/ceis/SaibaMais). The standard service agreement contains clauses prohibiting conditions analogous to slave labor. At end-2012 it had 319 accredited suppliers, 178 of whom were classified by branch of activity. It should be noted that 56% of the suppliers analyzed and accredited could pose some kind of human rights risk. hr2 Although supplier evaluation focuses mainly on tax, civil and labor law matters in the federal, state and municipal spheres, the policy calls for notification of the responsible manager if any violation of human rights is detected, and for appropriate steps to be taken. To verify these items, moreover, the company requires prospective suppliers to complete a questionnaire prior to a visit to their premises to make sure they have a procurement policy and an underage apprentice program in place. hr6 As in previous years, BM&FBOVESPA registered no cases of discrimination on grounds of ethnic origin, color, gender, religion, ideology, nationality or social origin, and received no reports of child labor or violation of the rights of indigenous peoples in 2012. hr4| hr7 | hr9 40 41 6. BM&FBOVESPA is a pioneer of social, environmental and corporate governance sustainability 4.1 initiatives World reference in sustainability 4.16 | 4.17 BM&FBOVESPA has been a pioneer in many aspects of sustainability: in 2004 it was the first exchange in the world to sign up to the UN Global Compact; in 2010 it was the first exchange in any emerging-market country to commit officially to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), an initiative led by institutional investors from several countries in partnership with the UN Global Compact and the UN Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI); and it was the first exchange in the world to become a GRI organizational stakeholder, also in 2010. GRI is a network that sets internationally accepted standards and develops strategic recommendations to enhance sustainability reporting. In addition, to encourage analysts to take socio-environmental and corporate governance issues into account in their assessments of stock prices and investment decisions, at the start of 2011 the Exchange issued its first Integrated Annual Report encompassing both financial and non-financial information in a single document at a meeting with the Brazilian Association of Capital Market Analysts & Investment Professionals (Apimec). In early 2012 BM&FBOVESPA adopted Report or Explain guidance recommending that listed companies state in the Reference Form whether they publish a regular sustainability report and if not, why not. The first results of the initiative were published during Rio+20, the UN Conference on Sustainable Development held in June. A new update in October resulted in more than 50 companies announcing sustainability reports or explaining their absence. Also at Rio+20, BM&FBOVESPA, Nasdaq OMX, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the Istanbul Stock Exchange and the Egyptian Exchange signed a pledge to promote long-term responsible investment and work for the re42 43 capítulo 6 sustainability porting of social, environment and corporate govSustainable development initiatives Governance  Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) – Tracks ernance information by companies listed on these Novo Valor website  Special Corporate Governance Index – Novo the return on a portfolio of stocks issued by exchanges, within the scope of the UN’s SustainPromoting sustainable development is a key priorMercado (IGNM) – Tracks a theoretical portfocompanies with a recognized commitment to able Stock Exchanges initiative (SSE). ity for BM&FBOVESPA.

BM&FBOVESPA sees product and new technology investments operational RELATÓRIO ANUAL as determinants in 2012 and financial strengthening its strategic performance position Macroeconomic conditions The year of 2012 was yet another year marked by global economic instability. This scenario led to a low growth of the main economies of the Eurozone and USA, as well as a slowdown in China. In Brazil, despite the disappointing performance in terms of the economy growth, the highRELATÓRIO ANUAL ANNUAL REPORT 2012 2012 light is the important economic structural changes unlocked by the plunge in real interest rates, which closed the year at levels comparable to those of the principal emerging market economies. The significant change in baseline interest rates is expected to change savings behavior as well, driving people to RELATÓRIO and seek new investment opportunities ANUAL diversify 2012 from ANNUAL REPORT 20 traditional investments as savings accounts, treasury bills and money market mutual funds. The new scenario has unveiled opportunities for investments in lesser-known instruments which until recently the average saver would hardly ever consider and are more akin to capital market investments, as is the case of real estate investment funds (REITs), of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and, potentially, also the stock market. Factors as the prospective change in the savings behavior of individuals, coupled with the need to spur economic growth in the coming years, which should happen primarily through heavy investments in infrastructure, place the domestic capital markets in a key position both to help enable and to capture the growth opportunities that lay ahead.

Intangible Assets of R$8,757 (2011 – R$ 10,475) related to the depreciation of equipment used in developing these projects. Goodwill Properties with a carrying value of approximately R$38,973 were pledged as collateral in lawsuits, BM&FBOVESPA is not allowed to assign these assets as collateral for other lawsuits or sell them. The goodwill of R$16,064,309 is attributed to expected future profitability, supported by an economic and financial appraisal of the investment, According to the guidelines of CPC 01/IAS 36, the goodwill must be The depreciation of fixed assets considers the expected useful lives of those, Annual rates of depreciation of tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when there are indicators that impairment may have fixed assets at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011: occurred, Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, Impairment losses recognized on goodwill are not reversed. Buildings 2,5% BM&FBOVESPA uses external and independent experts to assist in measuring the recoverable amount of the Furniture and fixtures 10% asset (ie, its value in use). The report submitted by the experts did not reveal the need for adjustments to the value of goodwill at December 31, 2012. Computer devices and equipment 10 a 25% Based on expectations of growth of the Bovespa segment, the projected cash flow considers revenues and Facilities 10% expenses related to activities of the segment (CGU – Bovespa). The period of projection of these flows extends from December 2012 to December 2022. The perpetuity is obtained by extrapolating the 2022 cash Telephone system 20% flow by an equivalent expected long-term growth rate for nominal GDP of 8.37% per year. Other 11% a 33% The management uses a projection period of ten years based on the perception that the Brazilian capital market, in the equity segment, should experience sustained growth until reaching maturity in the long-term. 122 123 notes to the financial statements To determine the present value of the projected flow, the experts used an average pre-tax discount rate of 16.60% per year from December 2012 until December 2016. Afterwards, the discount rate stabilizes at 15,75% a year, capturing the inflationary expectations of the period. The two main variables that affect the value in use calculated are the estimated discount rates and growth in perpetuity. The management of BM&FBOVESPA conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the impacts of changes in these variables on the calculated value in use. The discount rate equivalent before taxes for the entire period is 15.92% per year, and an increase of 1.10 percentage points (110bps) in this rate (from 15.92% to 17.02% per year) would reduce the value in use by 13%. Regarding the growth rate in perpetuity, a reduction of 0.50 percentage point (50bps) in the rate (from 8.37% to 7.87% per annum) would reduce the value in use by 5%. The variations of the parameters affecting the value in use for the purposes of this sensitivity analysis were determined based on a standard deviation of discount rates in the last five years, for the first, and of a standard deviation of the average of 10 years of changes in real Brazilian GDP, for the second. The value in use has a lower sensitivity to changes in net revenue. Considering a reduction in average annual revenue growth by 16% in the period between December 2013 and December 2022, the value in use would be reduced by 15%. None of these three scenarios, analyzed separately, resulted in values ​​below the carrying value of the investment at December 31, 2012.

At December 31, 2012 29,920,085 146 147 notes to the financial statements Considering the aspects above, a modified Binomial method (Cox-Ross-Rubinstein) was used to determine of the balance the reservations made ​​by the participant contributions and Company as time, up to 90% of the fair value of the options granted which consider the existence of two distinct periods in relation to the the balance of the reserves formed by contributions from the sponsor, or (ii) the redemption of 100% of the possibility of anticipated exercise (before and after the vesting dates), This method produces results which balance of the reserves constituted by the contributions of the participant and as time Company, up to 50% are equivalent to the results of the Black & Scholes model for non-complex European options, having the reserve balance made ​​up of contributions from the sponsor.

As the income tax and social contribution taxable bases arise not only from the profit that may be generNet changes in deferred tax during the year: ated, but also from the existence of non-taxable income, non-deductible expenses, tax incentives and other variables, there is no immediate correlation between accounting profit of BM&FBOVESPA and the income BM&FBOVESPA and subject to income tax and social contribution, Therefore, the expectation of the use of deferred tax assets Consolidated should not be considered as the only indicator of future income of BM&FBOVESPA.
