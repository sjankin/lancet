The relevant indicators were included in 2011 HR reporting. In 2012, a new deﬁnition and uniﬁed calculation method was implemented to enable the data to be compared; ■ the data on actual working hours is based on Prevention reporting covering a workforce of 27,288 employees. Relative to HR reporting (workforce of 30,336), Prevention reporting does not take into account the employees in entities acquired within the last 3 years nor in sales offices.

This relates mainly to countries in mature economic areas. Compensation – Worldwide 2010 2011 2012 % of non-managers on minimum wage 2% Additional note: nine reporting scopes have employees on minimum wage.

With respect to the wage gap for non-managers, note that Legrand’s industrial operations are assembly labor intensive. These workshops are essentially staffed by women and the qualiﬁcation level required is low. Concerning the wage gap for managers, note that these jobs are essentially staffed by men, the explanation for which lies in the nature of the Group’s engineering businesses (electronic, electrotechnical and electromechanical ﬁelds), and its sales and marketing activities (sales engineers). Pay for these jobs is above the average in the Company. In addition, female employees are younger on average than their male counterparts in both categories. 96 2012 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT LEGRAND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Workplace and community actions: policy and results 2012 05 Geographical breakdown of workforce 2010 2011 2012 Mature countries 48% 45% 44% New economies 52% 55% 56% TOTAL 100% 100% 100% Additional note: the breakdown covers 100% of employees with ﬁxed-term or open-ended employment contracts (registered workforce).

This “open-ended contract turnover” indicator is calculated based on the total number of terminated open-ended contracts divided by the open-ended contract workforce at the beginning of the year.

(2) In 2001, the Legrand Group entered into an agreement with an insurance company for the provision of services relating to pensions, retirement and services of a related nature to the members of the Group Executive Committee beneﬁting from the French pension system for salaried workers. At December 31, 2012, the Group’s commitment in connection with this agreement amounted to approximately €11.9 million, of which approximately €0.4 million of net assets, while the remaining €11.5 million is accrued in the accounts. Furthermore, the Social Security contributions due on the capital component of annuities according to the level of the pension are accrued in the provisions for €6.0 million. At December 31, 2012, the Executive Committee has nine members, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Additional pension entitlements are calculated to set total pensions, including these additional entitlements and all other amounts received after retirement, at the equivalent of 50% of the average of the two highest amounts of compensation received by the beneﬁciaries in their last three years with the Group. To beneﬁt from the additional pension, employees must have been with the Group for at least ten years and have reached the legal retirement age. In the event of the beneﬁciary’s death, the Group will pay the surviving spouse 60% of the supplementary pension. Corporate officer’s pension entitlements at retirement would represent roughly 1% of his total compensation (salary and bonus) per year of service with the Group.

These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account balances, transactions or disclosures. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, using sample testing techniques or other selection methods, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and signiﬁcant estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall ﬁnancial statement presentation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the ﬁnancial position of the Group as at December 31, 2012 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. 2012 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT LEGRAND 225 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE GROUP’S ASSETS, LIABILITIES, 09 FINANCIAL AND RESULTS FINANCIALINFORMATION CONSOLIDATEDPOSITION CONCERNINGTHEGROUP’SASSETS,LIABILITIES,FINANCIALPOSITIONANDRESULTS Statutory Auditors’ Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements, in accordance with ifrs for the year ended December 31, 2012 ■ II JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS In accordance with the requirements of Article L. 823-9 of French Company Law (Code de commerce) relating to the justiﬁcation of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: Goodwill and intangible assets represent respectively € 2.455,2 million and € 1.823,5 million of the total consolidated assets of your Company and have been recorded as a result of the acquisition of Legrand France in 2002 and of other subsidiaries since 2005.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of ﬁnancial position of the Company as at December 31, 2012 and the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. ■ II JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS In accordance with the requirements of Article L. 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) relating to the justiﬁcation of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matter: Note 1.3 to the ﬁnancial statements sets forth the accounting policies related to the valuation of investments in participating interests.
