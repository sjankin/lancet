In accordance with our corporate mission of “Contributing to Society through Healthcare,” we continue to supply medical technology in the form of products and services to numerous countries around the world, and proactively address the host of issues that surround healthcare. Continuing to Advance Healthcare, around the World The global medtech market is now at a turning point. In advanced countries, markets are slowing down and the focus is on constraining rising healthcare costs. In emerging countries, medical demands are expanding, but there is also downward pressure on prices. These changing environments are sometimes viewed as a headwind, but we believe the business segments in which Terumo operates will continue to offer opportunities for growth. For example, intravascular intervention is no longer limited to the arteries of the heart. Now this technique is also applied to those in the brain and the legs, as well as other parts of the body. Furthermore, in the Blood Management business, in addition to blood transfusion, demand for therapeutic apheresis is growing. And as efforts to help prevent medical errors and reduce the risk of infections increase in the General Hospital business, the need for safety-oriented devices will surely continue to grow. Aiming to seize such opportunities and thus continue contributing to society through healthcare, Terumo’s new four-year midterm management plan began in April 2013. This plan sets a policy of ensuring “Sustainable and Profitable Growth,” based on our long-term goal of establishing a greater global presence. mid-term plan YUTARO SHINTAKU President and Representative Director TERUMO CORPORATION Social and Environmental Report 2013 1 Social and Environmental Report 2013 Participation in United Nations Global Compact In 2012, Terumo became a signatory member of the United Nations Global Compact. This action reflects Terumo’s agreement with the Ten Principles of the compact, which relate to human rights, labor practices, the environment and anti-corruption measures. Terumo has given shape to the mission of “Contributing to Society through Healthcare” by setting out Five Statements A Message from the President (formulated in 1996). These principles guide the Group’s global business development to make a valuable contribution to healthcare worldwide. Going forward, Terumo will continue to fulfill its responsibilities as a global enterprise, while aiming to achieve sustainable growth. Relevant s­ ections The Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact of the report Businesses should support and respect the protection of Human Principle 1: internationally proclaimed human rights; and P8, 23–24 Rights Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.

TERUMO CORPORATION Social and Environmental Report 2013 8 Social and Environmental Feature Report: Contributing to Society through Healthcare Report 2013 Smaller incisions, less pain, quicker recovery Coronary blood vessels are not the only ones that become narrowed or blocked. For example, buildups of plaque that adversely affect circulation can also happen in arteries in the legs. If not treated, gangrene may set in, and in the worst case, amputation may be required. In the past, peripheral arterial disease was treated with bypass surgery, which used other blood vessels to Feature Report: Contributing to secure blood supply. Now, there is a new alternative. With the same procedures as those used in coronary arteries, balloon catheters and stents can widen affected arteries and improve circulation. Around the world, patients all hope the same thing: less pain, minimal invasive treatment, and swifter return to daily life. Society through Healthcare Endovascular treatment, which is easier on patients, now extends to the entire body The aging of populations and the prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases have caused significant increases in neuroendovascular and peripheral arterial diseases as well as in coronary diseases. Endovascular treatment, which relies on therapeutic intervention catheters inserted through wrist or thigh vessels can be accomplished via minimal incisions, a process much easier on patients than open surgery. Patients are also pleased that the scars of intravascular treatment are virtually invisible. With our long history of products for coronary intervention treatment, Terumo is ready to support vascular treatment in the rest of the body as well, helping patients return to life as quickly as possible. TERUMO CORPORATION Social and Environmental Report 2013 9 Social and Environmental Report 2013 Peripheral stent that conforms to the movement of legs The peripheral stent produced by Terumo not only keeps the blood vessels open, bends and twists with the movement of the patient’s legs as well. Feature Report: Contributing to Society through Healthcare Peripheral stent Neuroendovascular coil for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms In neuroendovascular therapy, more and more aneurysms are being treated with endovascular coiling, which fills the aneurysm with platinum coils to prevent blood from entering it. Aneurysms located deep within the brain, which are difficult to treat surgically, can be treated with coiling. Hydrogel coils of MicroVention, Inc., a company of Terumo group, have gel in the spaces ­between the individual coils, which improves the impermeability of the packed coils within the aneurysm. Endovascular coiling now accounts for fully 50% of neuroendovascular aneurysm treatments in Western countries. Some 30% of cases in Japan are treated by coiling, a share that continues to increase. Neuroendovascular coil Interview We had the opportunity in our Vascular Center Berlin to implant the first peripheral stent of Terumo a couple of years ago. Afterwards we achieved more experience, especially comparing normal ballooning with bail-out stenting with primary stenting, using Terumo’s peripheral stent in the superficial femoral and Karl-Ludwig Schulte, M.D. popliteal arteries. Vascular Center Berlin Results using this flexible rapid-exchange stent with high radial force were excellent and it Dept. Internal Medicine became our work horse for daily practice. TERUMO CORPORATION Social and Environmental Report 2013 10 Social and Environmental Report 2013 Offering the hope of therapy to those with serious diseases Autoimmune disorders, inflammatory diseases, certain viral diseases and other conditions that do not have known causes are among the many disorders for which effective therapy is either very difficult or nonexistent. These difficult disorders place tremendous physical and mental stress on patients and their families. To such patients, Terumo BCT, a subsidiary of Terumo, Feature Report: Contributing to extends hope by offering another type of therapy. With conditions such as myasthenia gravis, which can confine patients to wheelchairs, apheresis therapy now offers these patients the possibility of walking again. Society through Healthcare Terumo BCT supports development of apheresis therapy In apheresis therapy, the patient’s blood is separated into plasma, platelets and leukocytes by a centrifuge. Plasma that contains pathogenic factors is then extracted, and a substitute such as plasma—­ provided by a blood donation—and the remaining components are transfused to the patient. Terumo BCT’s therapeutic apheresis system extracts plasma with higher efficiency and lower cellular content*1. This aims at reducing the burden on the patient during the process. *1 Compared to previous Terumo products Interview I think that more physicians should consider plasmapheresis for certain diseases where it’s ­indicated because plasmapheresis has the distinct advantage of not having the side effect ­profiles as many of the other drugs.

In Japan, Terumo Patients’ Day took place on May 22 in central Tokyo. It featured a panel discussion with patients who had been treated using Terumo’s medical devices and their physicians. Participants heard about the firsthand experiences of Terumo Patients’ Day, which was Poster patients receiving interventional therapy after a heart held in Tokyo attack, of people being treated for diabetes, and leukemia patients who had received stem cell transplantation. This helped associates reaffirm Terumo’s mission as a firm involved in healthcare.

Our call center staff are committed to maintaining and improving the level of satisfaction of all callers and to ensuring that urgent inquiries, such as those related to patients receiving healthcare at home, are responded to aroundthe-clock. Additionally, the center is enhancing its mechanism for internally reflecting customer feedback in the improvement of existing products and the development of new products. Inquiries are addressed by staff with specialized knowledge Reflecting Customer Feedback in Our Products Together with Customers Medical Safety Information Management in Japan We accumulate information that we receive from our customers on the quality, safety and appropriate use of our products at our Safety-Related Information Dept. Using this information, we promptly develop and fine-tune our communications and deliver them via a number of methods, including attaching important information to products, disseminating information on our Web site or via industry organizations, and sending MRs to medical institutions to provide face-to-face explanations. Furthermore, we use the accumulated information to develop and improve products and support medical safety training for medical institutions (T-PAS*). * T-PAS: Terumo Proactive Action for Safety, training programs based on Terumo’s predictive safety measures. Supporting Medical Institutions’ Training Programs In order to prevent medical errors associated with medical devices like syringes and I.V. solution sets, Terumo conducts T-PAS training in which participants simulate the critical incidents warned and described on the attachment inserted in package. Conducted on-site at medical institutions, the training is designed to help participants better understand how such incidents occur.
