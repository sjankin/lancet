POMEROY 2013 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT BY CMS 3 OF 15 EcoVardis Survey Pomeroy was tasked to complete an environmental impact survey. Questions were asked about consumption of energy, waste production, sustainability and stewardship. Fortunately, Pomeroy has been addressing many of these concepts such as measuring, monitoring and tracking consumption, encouraging employee health and safety and promoting a sustainable work environment through building improvements and recycling. The following are some of the big ticket responses. REPORTED RESULTS ENV6100 : Electricity consumption (in the unit(s) that fit(s) you best) (year n‐1) Total in MWh 4849 MWh Year n ‐1 ‐202 MWh Electricity usage has gone down. See Appendix A for electricity data. ENV6101 : Energy consumption of fossil fuels such as oil, gas or coal (in the unit(s) that fit(s) you best) (year n‐1) Total in MWh 2011 MWh Year n ‐1 451 MWh Gas costs have increased, which could it be attributed to cold weather. See Appendix B for gas data. ENV660 : Direct GHG emissions (emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company, electricity not included, in the unit (s) that fit (s) you best) (year n‐1) Total in Tons 3,390 Tons Year n ‐1 ‐142 Tons Overall GHG emissions are on the decline. See Appendix C for GHG data. Note more to follow. POMEROY 2013 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT BY CMS 4 OF 15 Recycling Program The Pomeroy US Headquarters campus recognizes the importance of waste reduction. The facility encourages employees to participate. The current goal is for a year to year increase in recycling materials. Trends show an increase in recycling followed by a decrease. This data indicates first Pomeroy focused on recycling materials already in use. After recycling became part of the standard practices, Pomeroy pursued avenues to reduce consumption of waste generation, such as reusing paper materials. Cardboard Recycling Year Tons 2009 190 2010 146 2011 239 (bought a new card board compactor) 2012 137 2013 129 Paper Recycling Year Tons 2009 126 2010 118 2011 148 2012 121 2013 68 Currently recyclable paper stock is taken to Cincinnati Recycling. Plastic, Aluminum and Glass Recycling • These items are collected throughout the campus. • These items have a dedicated dumpster and recycled. • However, the quantity removed is not currently tracked. Light Bulb Recycling • These items are collected throughout the campus. • These items are recycled through the trash company Rumpke. • However, the quantity removed is not currently tracked. POMEROY 2013 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT BY CMS 5 OF 15 Indirect Greenhouse Gas Emissions The Pomeroy US Headquarters campus aims for a goal of year to year decrease in energy consumption. The following report identifies the indirect greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the electricity purchased by Pomeroy. GHGs are emitted when fossil fuels are combusted to generate electricity. Therefore any GHGs produced are indirect emissions. Over the past four years, electricity and natural gas usage data have been collected for each energy consumer at the facility. The facility location is used to determine the correct emission factors to use, as different parts of the country use different fuels to generate electricity. The attached Appendix A & B display purchased energy and quantify the equivalent emissions. Overall, the data trend shows a decline in electricity consumption, even with increased expansion. Note consumption of natural gas increased during the measured years. This increase can be attributed to older than average temperatures. Consistent efforts have been made to be more energy conscious and efficient. Some conservation actions include installing more efficient equipment. Building optimization measures have been implemented by the facilities management from monitoring this data. Plans for future improvements include further optimizing building operation plan and an education plan for employees on health, safety and conservation measures. Appendix C contains a summary of GHG emissions from a variety of sources including company‐owned vehicle transportation, purchased energy and waste disposal. It is not intended to address outsourced activities such as supplier manufacturing operations or service‐oriented businesses such as cleaning services. Carbon‐cutting actions such as recycling, waste prevention, and energy efficient product purchasing demonstrate Pomeroy’s commitment towards sustainable business practices, therefore reducing the GHG emissions associated with their activities. POMEROY 2013 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT BY CMS 6 OF 15 Electric Savings from Hand Dryer Upgrades Electric hand dryers are used in restrooms to reduce paper generation and waste from towel consumption. Traditional hand dryers can be ineffective requiring multiple attempts and increased electric costs. Upgrading to high efficiency air blade hand dryers is an improvement because they decrease dry time by wiping hands with higher velocities of air, utilize zero heating elements and supply filtered air. The following is a brief comparison of the energy consumption and savings earned by switching from hand towels to electric dryers and installing high efficiency units instead of standard dryers. There are many factors that go into the energy cost savings, but this analysis should provide a rough estimate. The following assumptions were made. The operation is 18 hours a day, 6 days a week and 52 weeks a year. Average hand drying is assumed to be 120 dries per hour, or 673,920 dries per year. Owen Electric is Pomeroy’s current energy supplier and the approximate energy cost per kilowatt hour is $0.08. Reduced Waste Average hand towel usage is approximately 2.5 hand towels/ dry or 300 towels/ hr. If there are 4800 linear ft/ case of towels, annual consumption would be 6,318 cases of hand towels. At $15/ case, the cost of hand towels could be estimated at $94,770 annually. In terms of waste, this is equivalent to 7429 lbs of paper trash produced per year. Energy Consumption Standard Dryer High Efficiency Dryer Time to Dry 40 Seconds 12 Seconds Power Consumption 2.1 kW 1.5 kW Power Consumption per Dry 0.023 kWh/ dry 0.005 kWh/ dry Cost Per Consumption $1.87/ 1000 dries $0.40/ 1000 dries Number of Hand Dries Annually 673,920 673,920 Annual Consumption per Dryer 15,725 kWh 3370 kWh Yearly Energy Cost per Dryer $1260 $270 Approximate Initial Cost of Dry $300 $1200 Total First Year Cost $1560 $1470 Annual electricity savings per dryer would be approximately $988.42. The payback for installing one high efficiency dryer is less than one year. POMEROY 2013 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT BY CMS 7 OF 15 Reduced Water Consumption from Urinal Upgrades Traditional urinals use 1 gallon of water per flush. The proposed low flow urinals use 0.5 gallons of water per flush. Upgrading 12 fixtures to low flow will save 50% of the water cost for operation. Additionally, using bio-friendly urinal cakes will effectively address odor issues commonly associated with no flow/ low flow fixtures, without the use of toxic chemicals. The following is a brief comparison of the energy consumption and savings between standard flow and smart flush urinals. There are many factors that go into the energy cost savings, but this analysis should provide a rough estimate. The following assumptions were made. Restroom operation is 18 hours a day, 6 days a week and 52 weeks a year. Average urinal use varies from 30-80 flushes per day, assume 50 flushes average. Water Consumption Existing Standard Urinals Proposed Smart Flush Urinals Water used per Flush 1 Gallon/ Flush 0.5 Gallon/ Flush Number of Urinals 12 12 Approximate Flushes/ Day 50 50 Yearly Consumption Per Urinal 15,600 Gallons 7,800 Gallons Yearly Consumption for 12 Urinals 187,200 Gallons 93,600 Gallons Annual savings per urinal upgrade would be approximately 7,800 Gallons. Upgrading (12) urinals with the same usage over one year, provides approximate savings of 93,600 Gallons annually. POMEROY 2013 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT BY CMS 8 OF 15 Employee Awareness Pomeroy values employee health and safety. Programs are under development to improve workplace environment and promote safety. Currently, Pomeroy provides employees at each of the buildings with fruit. Each day fresh fruit is made available in the common areas. This produce is free and encourages employees to make smart snack choices. A new safety program is on track to be implemented in the next year. This will include information passed on through regular emails about best safety practices and measures to be taken in the workplace environment. Pomeroy also has been promoting environmental awareness and sustainable measures by encouraging employees to use energy saving practices in their day to day activities. From upgrading equipment employees use daily, such as energy efficient monitors, to promoting recycling of office supplies. Pomeroy has demonstrated a clear interest in environmentally friendly and sustainable business from employees to business practices. Appendix E lists some sustainability tips that could be added to the end of company wide emails. A sample of these tips could also be included in the upcoming safety program newsletters. These tips could even be displayed in frequently visited locations throughout the office, such as break rooms, hallways or near printer/copier machines. POMEROY 2013 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT BY CMS 9 OF 15 Sustainable Consumption Consumerism effects the environment from the creation, use and disposal of products. The following items are good ways to approach sustainable consumption. Sustainable and Environmentally Friendly Purchasing The EPA recommends looking at a product’s content, manufacturing process, packaging and shipping methods when making a decision to purchase a product. Consider selecting products that minimize the presence and exposure to harmful chemicals such as those that are corrosive, carcinogens or ozone depleting. Chose items that are made from renewable resources, recycled content and are biodegradable. Select refillable or reusable bottle, bulk shipping and efficient packaging with clearly identifiable instructions for use and disposal. Waste Reduction Preventing waste saves money. Waste is paid for it twice product is bought and then again when it is disposed of. By consuming and throwing away less, you will reduce the need to handle, treat, and dispose of waste. Potential waste prevention measures: • Purchasing durable, long‐lasting materials • Striving to eliminate raw materials that are not incorporated into your final product or service • Using products that are free of toxic materials • Reducing the amount of packaging • Conserving water and/or energy • Implementing in‐process recycling Supplier Inquiry Consider extending the environmental stewardship to suppliers. Does this supplier: • Have a formal environmental management system? • Take steps to reduce waste and emissions? • Monitor and/ or measure of environmental impacts?

Bring your own mug to the café. Bring reusable bags to the grocery store. 2. Turn off lights, microwaves, or any other electric devices when you leave the room or house. 3. Replacing one incandescent light bulb with an energy‐saving compact fluorescent bulb means 1,000 pounds less carbon dioxide is emitted to the atmosphere and $67 dollars is saved on energy costs over the bulb's lifetime. 4. In North America, fruits and vegetables travel an average of 1,500 miles before reaching your dinner table. Buy local whenever possible. 5. Packaging makes up a third of all garbage tossed in the U.S. To cut down on waste, avoid single‐serving foods and beverages. Instead, buy items in bulk and portion them out into reusable containers. 6. Planting trees help reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide. 7. Swap disposable plastic bottles for a reusable BPA Free water bottle. 8. Consider saving energy by washing your clothes in cold water and line drying. 9. Recycle! Stop and check to see if your trash can be recycled! 10. Old electronics can be recycled: laptops, TVs, cell phones, etc. Fuel Economy 1. Slow down. Reducing your speed to 55 mph from 65 mph may increase your fuel efficiency by as much as 15 percent; cut it to 55 from 70, and you could get a 23 percent improvement. National Geographic Society, Green Guide 2. Check your tire pressure. Under inflated tires cause poor fuel economy. 3. Check your air filter. Restricted airflow lowers engine performance. 4. No need to gun it. Accelerate reasonably to avoid wasting fuel. 5. Consider car pooling to work, riding a bicycle to the store or taking public transportation. Water Savings 1. Turn off faucets while scrubbing hands, faces and teeth. You could save 4 Gals/ min! 2. Report or fix leaks and drips! 3. Consider replacing fixtures with low flow fixtures.
