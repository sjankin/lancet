1-Aug-13 ManpowerGroup 2012 Sustainability Report CEO’s Message Today, the word sustainability has different definitions, meanings and connotations. A lot of focus around sustainability has been on environmental and natural resources. When we think about sustainability, and what it means for our company and the important impact we have on society, we turn to the mission that has been laced into the legacy of ManpowerGroup: connecting people with work. A legacy built over six decades by just three CEOs in the history of the company, our mission stands for the dignity of work and employment opportunities for everyone. ManpowerGroup supports the United Nations Global Compact, In a world, where we're pushing upwards of millions and millions of and continues to be committed people unemployed globally, the world needs solutions that are to making the Global Compact scalable and sustainable globally. Those solutions need to be and its principles part of our centered around another scarce resource that deserves more strategy, culture and day-to-day attention now than ever before -talent. operations. FI We live in an age where supply and demand for workers no longer This 2012 Sustainability Report C NA serves as our annual match up. The skilled people that companies need are often Communication on Progress. O L unavailable, and their businesses suffer for it. Young people and other inexperienced individuals are being left behind while M V Jeffrey A. Joerres economies and societies pay the price. And with compressed Chairman and CEO IN E business cycles forcing shorter skills life-cycles and unprecedented pressure on margins, unleashing human potential becomes the G RS world's economic and societal sustainability savior. SO IO Ensuring the sustainability of the world's workforce is what ManpowerGroup has been doing since we opened our doors 65 O N years ago. Human potential is a limitless resource, but the key to success is knowing where to find it and how to cultivate and sustain N it. You'll see proof of that here in our 2012 Sustainability Report, where we share how ManpowerGroup builds talent sustainability that helps businesses do well, while building communities and inspiring people to pursue more than a job, but a rewarding livelihood. We enable sustainability by building agility, employability and vitality in the world's workforce. For instance, you will find examples of how we foster innovation and flexibility, such as Competitive Wisconsin’s Be Bold Initiative. You will learn how business and personal success are gained through our training, skills and workforce developmental programs, including the Manpower Logistics Academy in Belgium, the Manpower Vocational Training Centers in India, and the Placement Program in France. And, we will show you what can happen when you tap into the potential of individuals, like youth, refugees, and others whose talents are too often overlooked. Talent Sustainability Page 4 Updated 1-Aug-13 ManpowerGroup 2012 Sustainability Report Together with governments and educators, businesses and community partners, and the millions of people who come to us seeking opportunity, we see no limits to what is humanly possible. And in uncertain economic times like these, I'm proud to say that we're strengthening our resolve to be at the epicenter of finding solutions to unlock potential and prosperity. At the end of the day, we help connect people to the jobs they want and need, and we help build businesses so they can employ more people. This is the power of ManpowerGroup: a company powered by people who connect the ambition of business to the potential of individuals to achieve more than they imagined, and thereby ensuring a sustainable workforce for the future.

Perhaps that’s where most businesses can have the greatest impact. But, in a time of unprecedented unemployment, combined with critical talent shortages, there is also a great need and opportunity for the world to shift its focus to talent as a critical resource for sustainability.

Internships help prepare young people to successfully enter the world of work with actual experience in a professional environment, a letter of recommendation, a well-written resume, marketable job skills and professional references – all assets that help individuals begin and move ahead in their careers. In a difficult economy, where employers may not be willing to hire permanent staff, we give people an opportunity to work through temporary or project-based assignments. Temporary-to-permanent placements also give individuals a foot in the door with desirable companies. This also enables employers to create jobs, without having to commit to the burden of permanent staff. In a recent study by Boston Consulting Group and CIETT, 62% of employers surveyed indicated that without the possibility of leveraging temporary employment for certain projects, they would choose not to do them or leverage already over-burdened internal resources, rather than creating new jobs.

This need drives our local programs and partnerships, which strive to equip people with the skills and opportunities they need to become more employable and earn sustainable livelihoods. Through programs initiated by local operations in communities throughout the world, we provide people from all walks of life with the skills and connections to employment opportunities that enable them to earn sustainable livelihoods.

The initiative — part of CWI's ongoing “Be Bold” efforts to develop and advocate for strategic policies to enhance how Wisconsin competes, grows jobs and strengthens its economy — clarifies how producing clusters of in-demand skilled workers could help the current workforce, support employers and position Wisconsin as a top destination state for both talent and businesses.

Researchers are also talking with representatives from Wisconsin's education and training workforce ecosystem in an effort to profile best practices.

Now, with help from ManpowerGroup and its company Manpower Telge Jobbstart (MTJ), more than 700 refugees and immigrants have found work.

Global Reporting Initiative We have fully incorporated the GRI G3 framework into our reporting approach, and self-declare this report at Application Level B. The complete GRI Index can be found here>> United National Global Compact We have been a participating member of the UN Global Compact since 2006. This report serves as our seventh Communication on Progress. We have provided references to the relevant UNGC Principles in our GRI/UNGC Index, available here>> Environmental Performance We strive to be transparent in reporting our environmental impact. FI In addition to the GRI framework, we use a number of tools and resources to help us determine the areas of most materiality for our C NA business, including such questionnaires and assessments as the O L Carbon Disclosure Project, EcoVadis, Ecodesk, and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, as well as client-specific questionnaires. M V IN E For those areas that we deemed material, we have focused on G RS collecting data from key business operations, representing approximately 80% of our annual revenues. These business units SO IO typically have the resources available to track environmental performance, and in many cases already have processes in place O N to capture the necessary data. A high percentage of our business operations are carried out in leased spaces in large buildings, N where it is not cost effective (or in some cases possible) to obtain hard data on environmental indicators such as energy use or water consumption. We have therefore limited data collection to the real estate which we either own or fully control, typically headquarters buildings in our key markets. We collected environmental data for the 2011-2012 fiscal year using a pilot of Enablon -a web-based sustainability data management system. We then used tools provided by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to estimate emissions based on that data. As we develop simple and efficient ways to manage and report on the environmental impact of our largest operations, we expect to apply those best practices across more of our markets in future. About this Report Page 41 Updated 1-Aug-13 ManpowerGroup 2012 Sustainability Report Stakeholder Engagement We have engaged a number of internal and external stakeholders in discussion around a number of topics related to CSR, sustainability and reporting: • In-depth analysis of assessments and questionnaires from clients and analysts • Interviews with analysts • Research around world of work trends • Regular interaction with governments, labor organizations, industry associations, clients and candidates • Feedback from employees • Internal multi-departmental stakeholder taskforce This engagement process resulted in the development of a new sustainability platform, as well as an approach to reporting that is both simpler and more comprehensive.

In a typical year, ManpowerGroup will interact with and/or interview more than 10 million people and connect up to 4 million people with work opportunities while we serve some 400,000 clients across 80 countries and all industry sectors, including businesses of all size, governments and NGOs. ManpowerGroup actively and continuously measures satisfaction among our clients, candidates and associates. The satisfaction programs are directed at the country level and differ by line of business to allow for customization unique to geography and business line. One common metric that is collected throughout the majority of ManpowerGroup’s operations is the Net Promoter Score FI (NPS). NPS and overall satisfaction scores are tracked and analyzed by business line and by country, where they are most C NA meaningful and actionable. Each geographic region and business line sets improvement targets on an annual basis for NPS scores, O L and in some regions for the overall satisfaction score, and M V cascades these throughout the organization as part of overall IN E business planning process. G RS SO IO O N N About this Report Page 43 Updated 1-Aug-13 ManpowerGroup 2012 Sustainability Report Materiality of Reporting Topics People are at the core of our business. As a service business that specializes in workforce solutions, our focus areas are around talent, labor and human rights. We also want to ensure that we are a good influence on the communities and environments in which we operate. We took a two-step approach to determining the topics that we would include in our report. First, using the results of our dual-focus stakeholder engagement we gave each of the GRI performance indicators 2 scores: the first based on perceived importance to our stakeholders, and the second based on relevance to – and potential impact of -our business strategy. Using these scores, we developed overall scores for each reporting category, which we then used to prioritize our reporting focus. We then chose the indicators within the categories that were most relevant to our business.
