In April 2013, the Marubeni Group took up the challenge of achieving more growth and progress under the new medium-term management plan Global Challenge 2015. The plan is defensive on one hand, and aggressive on the other. In terms of the former, Marubeni will refine risk management, rigorously enforce compliance, and take other steps to strengthen its “defensive” systems and structures. On the “aggressive” side of our plan, we will continue to bolster existing businesses and actively make new investments in line with our overall portfolio strategy. These actions should build a strong earnings structure as well as a solid financial base, allowing us to realize sustainable growth and at the same time further elevate the Marubeni Group’s corporate value. The Marubeni Group sees corporate value as delivering greater added value for stakeholders in our work. This will contribute to the development of society and earn the Marubeni Group trust as a member of the global society. To this end, every Group member will work as one to build a Marubeni Group that is more ambitious, stronger, and flexible.

As a company, Marubeni will also continue to play its the global environment by conducting fair and upright corporate part in the growth of the global economy, while always striving to activities. enrich the society within which it operates. In order to achieve all the elements of the aforementioned goal, Marubeni is committed to the following six basic principles of business: 1. Conduct Fair and Open Business Activities 2. Develop a Globally Connected Company 3. Create New Value Through Business Vision 4. Respect and Encourage Individuality and Originality 5. Promote Good Corporate Governance 6. Safeguard Ecological and Cultural Diversity M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 73 A Message from the Chairman Teruo Asada Chairman of the Board Aiming to Enhance Corporate Governance at Marubeni The ultimate aim of corporate governance is not only to enhance earning capacity and prevent misconduct but to build systems to ensure that a company can gain the trust and confidence of society. To attain this goal, Marubeni has developed a compliance system based on its Management and Sustainability Company Creed of “Fairness, Innovation and Harmony” as it engages in diverse businesses and sectors in regions around the world. Moreover, in management we strive to ensure fairness, transparency, efficiency and appropriateness, which we consider vital to the sustainable growth of the Company. To enhance the efficacy of corporate governance at Marubeni, we have thoroughly separated supervision and execution functions in management: the roles of chairman and CEO have been separated; an executive officer system has been introduced; and two outside directors have been elected to the Board of Directors in addition to three outside corporate auditors. In this way, we have taken powerful measures to enhance the oversight functions of management. Elsewhere, Marubeni is striving for greater coexistence with society and the environment by strengthening proactive communication with shareholders and other stakeholders, and through a firm stance with respect to timely and appropriate information disclosure. When it comes to corporate governance, no system or mechanism is foolproof. The Japanese government is currently bringing a number of industry experts together to deliberate on revisions to Japan’s system of corporate laws, and it seems likely that there will be some reforms to the system in the future. Marubeni will respond to these reforms positively and appropriately, actively adopting effective systems with the aim of creating an even better corporate governance system. We will continue our efforts to improve our corporate value in this way. 74 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 13 Corporate Governance Basic Approach to Corporate Governance ended March 31, 2012, we again submitted our internal control In keeping with the spirit of our Company Creed of “Fairness, report for the year ended March 31, 2013, which concluded that Innovation and Harmony” and the Marubeni Corporate Principles, “internal control is effective.” the executives and employees of the Marubeni Group observe relevant laws and regulations, as well as our own corporate rules.

A company is a member of society that must live up to the expectations of its stakeholders and act in a socially responsible manner. This is the real meaning of compliance: to ensure that all employees and executives have a strong awareness of their responsibilities and to ensure that all activities adhere to high ethical standards. Management and Sustainability Marubeni has compiled the Marubeni Group Compliance Manual, which specifies the standards of behavior that Group employees are expected to follow in all of their daily work activities. Every year, the Company’s employees and executives, as well as presidents of all Marubeni Group companies, take an oath to adhere to the code expressed in this manual. In the foreword to the manual, top management sends a message that defines Marubeni’s stance on compliance: “When you are faced with a choice between integrity and profit, choose integrity without hesitation.” Every Marubeni Group employee is expected to take this slogan to heart, and apply it in their daily work activities. The Company holds group training programs and e-learning programs on a timely basis to educate personnel on general compliance issues and to keep up to date on regulatory changes and economic and social trends. In addition, the Chairman of the Compliance Committee makes periodic visits to Group companies and overseas offices to provide training and raise awareness of compliance. These and other measures help to ensure that all individuals in the Company possess the necessary understanding and awareness of compliance issues, and know-how to apply their knowledge. Overseas subsidiaries and offices develop their own compliance systems in accordance with the laws, regulatory structures and business customs of each country in which they operate.

Investment and Credit Committee Integrated Risk Management Management and Sustainability Decision-Making Marubeni operates in a diversified range of industries and regions. Request for Approval Regular Reporting (Specific Matters) Therefore, the Company has established an integrated risk manDiscretionary agement system which not only focuses on the micro level of the Reporting (Important Matters) individual risk factors, but also takes a macro view of the various factors that affect the entire Marubeni Group. Integrated risk management takes a broad overview of the assets for the entire Group, gauging risk based on the exposure of these assets to each specific risk factor—industry risk, country risk, credit risk for Business Divisions Portfolio Units each client, and so on. These risks form the basis for calculating Value at Risk (VaR), which takes into account dispersion effects and correlations to calculate maximum risk. VaR is used as a primary benchmark for our portfolio management. Integrated risk management looks at various risk factors in a comprehensive way to enable managers to understand risk as a single monetary value. By using computer simulations that reflect the latest information, Marubeni has made it possible to grasp the degree of risk in more detail than ever before. We calculate PATRAC based on risk assets—a value based on the maximum decline in the value of Group assets as quantified by the Company. PATRAC indicates profit after tax following adjustment for risk, and Marubeni has adopted PATRAC as an important management indicator, using it to screen proposals requiring approval, as well as to evaluate the performance of each portfolio unit. Each business unit constantly takes steps to adjust its portfolio in a flexible manner, seeking to improve PATRAC in order to achieve maximum returns for a given level of risk, enabling Marubeni to achieve steady and balanced earnings growth. 82 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 13 CSR Activities Approach to CSR Pursuing CSR Together with Our Stakeholders The ability of the Marubeni Group to fulfill its responsibilities as a In order to exist in harmony and prosper alongside society and member of society requires every individual within the Group to the global environment and attain sustainable growth, Marubeni adhere to the Company Creed of “Fairness, Innovation and Harbelieves that efforts must be made to pursue a balance among mony,” and to give CSR considerations high priority as they parthree domains in terms of value and assessment.

M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 83 Message from the Chair of the CSR & Environment Committee Takeo Kobayashi Executive Officer, Chairman of CSR & Environment Committee Marubeni will promote CSR activities as a means of realizing sustained growth and earning stakeholders’ trust. The Marubeni Group believes that sustained growth is a realistic goal which can be achieved. To do this, we must first remain true to the spirit of the Company Creed of Fairness, Innovation, and Harmony. In addition, all employees must possess a firm awareness of CSR within their corporate activities. Finally, we must strive to practice sound management that helps to create a society capable of coexisting with the environment. Management and Sustainability We aim to contribute to the sustained development of society and resolve social issues through our business activities. We will expand our businesses that benefit people around the world. These include businesses for developing and providing a stable supply of mineral resources, maintaining and operating water and sewage systems and seawater desalination facilities, promoting the planting of trees, providing a stable supply of quality grain, and promoting renewable energy efforts. In recent years, greater emphasis has been placed on addressing human rights and labor issues, such as child labor and forced labor. In light of this trend, at Marubeni we revised our Basic Supply Chain CSR Policy in March 2013, and we will seek the understanding and cooperation of our clients as we actively promote CSR supply chain management. Looking at our social contribution activities, we continue to run programs such as providing scholarship funds for young people in emerging economies, making donations for areas struck by natural disasters, and encouraging employees to volunteer in local cleanup efforts. The most widely recognized of all of the Marubeni Group's social contribution activities is the Marubeni Foundation, a social welfare corporation we established in 1974. Through this foundation, we provide ¥100 million to social welfare facilities across Japan each year since 1975. The foundation is also a prominent supporter of efforts to recover from the Great East Japan Earthquake. Moving into the future, Marubeni will remain a trusted partner of our stakeholders. We will continue to promote CSR activities not only in the economic realm, but also in environmental and social fields. 84 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 13 Supply Chain Management Basic Supply Chain CSR Policy As part of the CSR management that we promote together with In December 2011, Marubeni partially revised its Basic Supply our stakeholders, the Marubeni Group is aiming to achieve CSR Chain CSR Policy, which was established in October 2008.

Fluctuations in Interest Rates Marubeni and its consolidated subsidiaries procure necessary funds from financial institutions, the issuance of bonds and other means from capital markets. Furthermore, net interest-bearing debt is procured at fixed interest rates and floating interest rates. The interest risk of the majority of the operating assets held by the Group offsets the interest rate risk associated with debt, and through asset-liability management, the Group utilizes interest rate swaps and other agreements to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations. Nevertheless, changes in market interest rates could adversely affect the Group's business results and financial condition.

When party to such litigation, predicting the outcome is impossible given the inherent uncertainty of these matters. The Company cannot guarantee that such litigation will not adversely affect the Group's business results and financial condition. Environmental Risk Marubeni and its consolidated subsidiaries conduct business activities globally across a broad range of industries, and environmental pollution as a result of these activities could result in business stoppage, pollution remediation expenses, and legal fees in response to litigation by local residents. In addition, the Group's social reputation could be damaged. In the year ended March 31, 2000, an environmental management system was introduced to cope with such environmental risks, under which various initiatives have been implemented to assess the potential environmental burden and reduce environmental risk, including environmental impact evaluations for each new financing and development project. In the event, however, that some form of environment impact occurs, it could adversely affect the Group's business results and financial condition. Financial Natural Disaster Risk Earthquakes and other natural disasters could cause damage and loss to the Group's offices and facilities and inhibit the normal business activities of Marubeni and its consolidated subsidiaries. While every effort has been made to implement appropriate countermeasures, such as the formulation of business continuity plans, earthquake countermeasures, and fire prevention drills, the potential for damage from natural disasters cannot be completely mitigated. Consequently, there is no guarantee that such disasters will not adversely affect the Group's business results and financial condition. 108 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t

Financial 120 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 13 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2013 1. Nature of Operations and Basis of Financial Statements Marubeni Corporation (the “Company”), a Japanese corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries engage in import and export trades of domestic and overseas products and commodities, including domestic and offshore trades in fields which cover extensive types of commodities such as agri-marine products, textile, forest products and general merchandise, paper and pulp, chemicals, energy, metals, machinery, finance, logistics, information industry, development and construction and others. In addition, the Company offers various services and engages in diversified business such as investments in domestic and foreign businesses, exploration of natural resources and others. The Company maintains its books and records and prepares its financial statements in Japanese yen. The accompanying consolidated financial statements differ from the consolidated financial statements issued generally in Japan. In addition to the consolidation adjustments, they reflect certain adjustments not recorded in the Company’s books, which in the opinion of management are appropriate to present the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The translation of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts for the year ended March 31, 2013 is included solely for the convenience of readers outside of Japan and has been made at ¥94 to $1, the exchange rate prevailing on March 31, 2013. The translation should not be construed as a representation that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at this or any other rate. The Company will prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 instead of U.S. GAAP. The date of transition to IFRSs has been designated as April 1, 2011. 2. Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the Company and the accounts of all majority owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries and variable interest entities (“VIEs”), of which the Company and/or its subsidiaries are the primary beneficiary (together, the “Companies”). Significant intercompany transactions and accounts among the Companies have been eliminated. Certain subsidiaries have been included on the basis of a fiscal year-end on or after December 31, but prior to the parent company’s fiscal year-end of March 31. During the intervening periods, one such subsidiary recognized impairment losses of ¥13,682 million―before tax ($165 million) on its portion of oil and gas properties as a result of the impairment indicators caused by the change of production plan M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 121 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) due to production impediment having occurred in its production facilities in January, 2013, its 1st quarter of the subsequent fiscal year. Investments in affiliated companies The Companies’ investments in affiliated companies (investees owned 20% to 50% and other investees over which the Companies have the ability to exercise significant influence) are stated at cost, adjusted for equity in their undistributed earnings or accumulated losses since acquisition. Dividends received from the affiliated companies are deducted from the investments in the affiliated companies. No amortization is recorded for equity method goodwill which is the excess amount of the cost of investments in the affiliated companies. When declines in the value of investments in the affiliated companies are other than temporary, the investments are written down to fair value and impairment losses are recognized. Whether declines in the value of investments are other than temporary is determined by examining the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost as well as the recoverability based on projected business results. Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates due to inherent uncertainty in nature. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of investment securities, impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, realization of deferred tax assets, employees’ Financial retirement benefits and uncertain tax positions. Foreign currency translation Assets and liabilities included in financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies are translated into Japanese yen at the respective year-end rates. All income and expense accounts are translated at the average rates prevailing during the year. The resulting translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency-denominated receivables and payables are translated into Japanese yen at the year-end rates with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings. 11 122 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 13 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Cash equivalents The Companies include deposits in banks, certificates of deposit and securities purchased under resale agreements with an original maturity of 3 months or less in cash equivalents. Investments in debt and marketable equity securities The Companies determine the appropriate classification of investment securities as trading securities, held-to-maturity securities or available-for-sale securities at the date of purchase. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Companies have positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and interest on securities classified as held-to-maturity are included in interest income. When there are declines in the value of held-to-maturity securities that are judged to be other than temporary, if the Companies intend to sell the debt securities or it is more likely than not that they will be required to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis excluding credit losses, they are written down to fair value by recognizing impairment loss on investment securities. If the Companies do not intend to sell the debt securities and it is more likely than not that they will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis, declines in fair value of these investments that are judged to be other than temporary are classified as credit losses or other losses. The Companies recognize the credit losses in impairment loss on investment securities and the other losses with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Trading securities are held for resale in anticipation of short-term market movements and stated at fair value. Realized gains and losses on trading securities are calculated based on average cost and included in gain on sales of investment securities. Marketable equity securities not classified as trading and debt securities not classified as trading or held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale securities and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The amortized cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion are included in interest income. Interest and dividends on investment securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income and dividend income, respectively. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are calculated based on the average cost and included in gain on sales of investment securities. If the declines in fair value of available-for-sale securities are judged to be other than temporary, debt securities are accounted for on the same basis as held-to-maturity securities, and marketable equity securities are written down to fair value with recognition of impairment losses. 12 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 123 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Whether declines in the value of investments are other than temporary is comprehensively determined by examining the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost. Non-marketable equity securities Non-marketable equity securities are stated at cost. Declines in value judged to be other than temporary are written down to fair value by recognizing impairment loss on investment securities. Whether declines in the value of investments are other than temporary is determined by examining the extent to which the value of net assets is less than cost and other factors. Inventories Inventories, which primarily consist of commodities, merchandise and real estate held for sale, are stated at the lower of cost (primarily specific or moving average cost) or market (generally replacement cost). Inventories included real estate held for sale of ¥62,375 million ($663,564 thousand) and ¥66,483 million at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Allowance for doubtful accounts In evaluating the credit risk relating to financing receivables, the Companies categorize them based on the potential exposures for credit ratings of debtors, geographical and other considerations. The allowance for credit losses for financing receivables is determined based on a historical bad debt ratio or an estimated collectable amount by the credit risk category. When a financing receivable is impaired, the allowance for credit losses is determined based on discounted cash flows using the financing receivable’s initial effective interest rate, observable quoted prices or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. When financing receivables are legally or contractually determined to Financial be uncollectible, the financing receivables are offset against their respective allowances. Leases The Companies lease fixed assets under direct financing leases, sales-type leases and operating leases as lessors. Income from direct financing leases and sales-type leases are recognized by the amortization of unearned income over the lease term at a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment. Sales revenue on sales-type leases is recognized at the beginning of the lease term. Rental revenue on operating leases is recognized over the lease term on a straight-line basis. The Companies lease fixed assets under operating leases and capital leases as lessees. For capital lease obligations, interest expense is recognized over the lease term at a constant periodic rate on the lease obligation. Accumulated depreciation of the leased assets is recognized over the lease term on a 13 124 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 13 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) straight-line basis or a declining-balance basis. Rental expense on operating leases is recognized over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Depreciation Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and property leased to others excluding mining rights is determined by the straight-line method or the declining-balance method based on the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (buildings and structures from 2 to 60 years, machinery and equipment from 2 to 45 years). Mining rights are primarily amortized by the straight-line method or the unit-of-production method based on the estimated useful lives of 9 to 30 years. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment (including property leased to others) is ¥70,925 million ($754,521 thousand) and ¥61,936 million for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Intangible assets subject to amortization with useful lives are amortized by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives. Impairment of long-lived assets (property leased to others, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets) Property leased to others, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization that are held and used or to be disposed of other than by sale are evaluated for impairment and written down to fair value if the sum of their expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Goodwill and other intangible assets The Companies do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. The Companies review them for impairment at least annually. The Companies test goodwill for impairment using the two-step process. The first step is a screen for recognizing an impairment loss at the reporting unit level, and the second step measures the amount of the impairment, if any. Business combinations The Companies use the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations. The Companies separately recognize and present acquired intangible assets as goodwill or other intangible assets. 14 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 125 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Asset retirement obligation The Companies recognize a liability for an asset retirement obligation of long-lived assets at fair value at the time that the obligation is incurred and capitalize the same amount of the liability. The liability is accreted to the present value each period over time and the capitalized costs is depreciated over the useful life of the related long-lived assets. Oil and gas producing activities Oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for the successful efforts method of accounting. The costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells, and costs of development wells and related plant and equipment are capitalized, and amortized using the units-of-production method. Exploratory well costs are expensed if economically recoverable reserves are not found. Other exploration costs, such as geological and geophysical costs, are expensed as incurred. Proved properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The proved properties are written down to fair value and impairment losses are recognized if the carrying value may not be recoverable. Unproved properties are assessed at least annually for impairment. Unproved properties are written down to fair value and the impairment losses are recognized whenever the carrying value may not be recoverable. Mining operations Mining exploration costs are expensed as incurred until the mining projects have been established as commercially viable by a final feasibility study. Once established as commercially viable, costs are capitalized as development costs and are amortized using the straight-line method or the units-of-production method based on the proven and probable reserves. The stripping costs incurred during the production phase of the mines are accounted for as variable production costs included in the Financial costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. Employees’ retirement benefits The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have pension plans or severance indemnities plans covering substantially all employees other than directors. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries measure the projected benefit obligation and pension cost based on an actuarial valuation and the fair value of plan assets. The funded status, which is the net of the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligation are measured at the date of the fiscal year-end and recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. 15 126 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 13 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Revenue recognition and the total volume of trading transactions The trading transactions undertaken by the Companies take many forms and consist of those in which the Companies act as a principal and those in which the Companies act as an agent. In agency transactions, payment for goods is made directly by the purchaser to the supplier. The Companies receive commissions from the purchaser and/or the supplier. The Companies derive revenues from sales of goods, performance of services and commissions on trading transactions. Although the Companies legally act as a principal, when the Companies are not the primary obligor and do not have general inventory risk, the Companies generally present the transactions net. The presentation may change according to changes in form or substance of transactions. The total volume of trading transactions, which is voluntarily disclosed in the statements of income, includes the sales value of all transactions in which the Companies participate, regardless of the form of such transaction, based on similar practices of Japanese trading companies. This information is not required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Companies’ revenues and commissions are recognized when they are realized or realizable and earned. Revenues and commissions are realized or realizable and earned when the Companies have persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the goods have been delivered or the services have been rendered to the customers, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Sales of goods and other: In acting as a principal, revenues from the sales of goods are recognized when the delivery conditions are met. These conditions are considered to have been met when the goods are received by the customers or the title is transferred to the customer. In addition, revenues are recognized when the inspection testing is fully completed and any future obligations become inconsequential or perfunctory and do not affect each customer’s final acceptance. Performance of services: Commissions are recognized when the contracted services to the third-party customers are completed. In acting as an agent, the Companies recognize commissions when contracted services are fully rendered to the customers. Construction arrangements: Revenues from construction projects are accounted for by the completed-contract-method unless revenues and costs to complete and extent of progress toward completion of construction are reasonably estimable, in which case the Companies use the percentage-of-completion method. The measurement of the percentage to completion of construction is primarily based on the cost-to-cost method. Losses on construction contracts are recognized in the period when the losses become probable. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenues from trading and other activities. 16 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 127 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Consumption taxes Revenues, cost and expenses in the consolidated statements of income do not include consumption taxes. Other―net Other―net includes gains and losses incurred in liquidating subsidiaries and affiliated companies, such amounts were ¥29 million ($309 thousand) of gains and ¥191 million of losses for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The aggregated amounts of gains and losses on sales of loans, included in other―net were ¥141 million ($1,500 thousand) of losses and ¥238 million of gains for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Derivative instruments and hedging activities The Companies recognize all derivative instruments at fair value as an asset or liability. Accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives is determined by whether the derivatives are eligible for a hedging instrument or not, and the purpose of holding and the designation of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as a hedging instruments are recognized in earnings. Depending on the purpose of the hedges, the derivatives are designated as a hedging instrument of fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or hedge of net investments in foreign operations. Changes in the fair value of derivatives held and designated as a hedging instrument of fair value hedge are offset against the changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments and are recognized in earnings. The Companies use derivatives for hedging the volatility in the fair value of commodities or firm commitments and the volatility in the fair value of assets and liabilities with a fixed interest rate. Changes in the fair value of derivatives held for hedging risks in the cash flow of the hedged items Financial are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the changes in the fair value of the hedging items are recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is immediately recognized in earnings. The Companies use derivatives for hedging changes in future cash flow from changes in market price risk and foreign currency risk in forecast purchase and sales of commodities and other, and changes in future cash flow from change in interest rates in assets and liabilities with a floating interest rate. 17 128 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 13 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) For derivative and non-derivative financial instruments designated as a hedging instrument for foreign currency exposure of a net investment in foreign operations, gains or losses from changes in the fair value and the exchange rate are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the currency translation adjustment to the extent the hedges are effective. Gains and losses related to the hedge ineffective portion and related to the portion of hedging instruments excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are included in other―net on the consolidated statements of income. Offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts The Companies offset the fair value of derivatives contracted with the same partner in master netting agreements and the fair value of receivables recognized for the right to receive a return of cash collateral or a liability recognized for the obligation to return cash collateral against net derivative positions in master netting agreements. The amount of derivative liabilities offset was not material at March 31, 2013. The amount of derivative liabilities offset was ¥1,568 million at March 31, 2012. Fair value measurement The Companies measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The inputs used in fair value measures are categorized into three levels based upon the observability of inputs in markets. Guarantees The Companies recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken at the inception of a guarantee. Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recognized to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered more likely than not to be realized. For the years ended March 31, 2013, adjustment of the beginning-of-the-year balance of the valuation allowances attributable to continuing operations was ¥19,384 million ($206,213 thousand) (income), which was due mainly to a result of a review of future realizable value for the deferred tax assets previously recorded. For the years ended March 31, 2012, adjustment of the beginning-of-the-year balance of the valuation allowances attributable to continuing operations was not significant. The Companies recognize the financial statement effects of tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on technical interpretations, that the tax positions will be sustained upon examination by the 18 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 129 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) tax authorities. Benefits from the tax positions that are more likely than not are measured at the largest amount of benefit to be realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in other―net. Accounting for noncontrolling interests Changes in the Companies’ ownership interest that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions of the consolidated entity. If the Companies lose control, the Companies recognize gains or losses from changes in the Companies’ ownership interests in net income. Noncontrolling interests are remeasured at fair value and included in gain on sales of investment securities. Reclassification Certain reclassifications and format changes have been made to the prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.

Acquisitions There were no significant acquisitions for the year ended March 31, 2013. After the reporting period but before the financial statements are issued, the following acquisition occurred. On June 19, 2013, the Company acquired 89.5% of shares of NEC Mobiling, Ltd. ( NM ), a listed company of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. 1st Section for ¥71,637 million ($762,095 thousand) in cash. NM conducts the following businesses: ・Distributor for mobile network operators (Operation of shops) ・Sales of mobile phones and related merchandise ・Diagnostics, repair & maintenance services for mobile phones ・Sales of mobile phones and solutions (from consultation on implementing mobile phones to operational support)for corporate uses. The Company intends to acquire the remaining shares until September 2013. Through this acquisition, the Company aims to establish various coordination and synergies between NM and the Company Group, especially with Marubeni Telecom Co., Ltd., by sharing its experiences and knowledge about shop management and business strategies of the mobile industry. After the acquisition, the Company aims to seek substantial benefits through its management integration by concentrating and sharing its respective economic resources of NM and Marubeni Telecom Co., Ltd., and creating competitive values especially on the areas of shop management and business for corporate clients. Further information related to the accounting for this business combination, such as the acquisition date fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including goodwill has not been disclosed because the initial accounting for this acquisition, including determination of the acquisition date fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has not been completed as of the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements.

(continued) As a result of decreases in the estimated future cash flows due to the worsened business conditions and changes in management strategies, the Companies recognized impairment losses on goodwill of ¥800 million ($8,511 thousand) and ¥1,452 million, which were included in loss on property, plant and equipment in the consolidated statements of income, for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows. Due to decreases in expected future cash flows, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries recognized impairment losses primarily on their properties, facility, real estate and plant, based on their fair values, in the total amounts of ¥28,632 million ($304,596 thousand) and ¥7,428 million, which were included in loss on property, plant and equipment in the consolidated statements of income, for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The fair value was primarily estimated using the discounted cash flow method or third-party appraisals. The segments affected by the impairment losses were primarily Energy of ¥27,677 million ($294,436 thousand) and ¥5,768 million for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The impairment losses for the year ended March 31, 2013 primarily resulted from company’s determination to sell off the Niobrara oil and gas properties held by a North American subsidiary. 8. Asset Retirement Obligations The Company and certain of its subsidiaries recognize asset retirement obligations. The asset retirement obligations are primarily related to the costs of dismantlement and removal of oil and gas production facilities owned by subsidiaries engaged in oil and gas producing activities. These liabilities are included in long-term debt, less current portion and accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Financial consolidated balance sheets. The changes in asset retirement obligations for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2013 2012 2013 Balance at beginning of year ¥ 30,283 ¥ 25,377 $ 322,160 Liabilities incurred 378 7,270 4,021 Liabilities settled (1,375) (1,813) (14,628) Accretion expense 1,411 1,404 15,011 Revisions to cost estimate 15,545 (759) 165,372 Other 5,730 (1,196) 60,958 Balance at end of year ¥ 51,972 ¥ 30,283 $ 552,894 Note: “Other” includes foreign exchange rate changes. 35 146 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 13 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 9.

The standard terms provide that the proceeds from the sales of any such collateral be delivered to the respective bank to be applied against outstanding acceptances. However, the Companies have, in general, followed the practice of paying acceptances on their maturity dates. Given the substantial volume of the Companies’ transactions, it would not be practical to determine the total amount of inventories and/or proceeds from the sales of such inventories covered by outstanding trust receipts. As is customary in Japan, security, if requested by a lending bank, must be given and, regardless of presence of security, the bank has the right to offset cash deposited with it against any debt or obligations that become due and, in the case of default or certain other specified events, against all debt payable to 36 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 147 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) the bank.

To strengthen its asset-liability management and to hedge against interest rate risk and foreign currency exposures, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into interest rate swap agreements, including interest rate and currency swap agreements, on short-term loans and long-term debt. The floating interest rates are, in general, based upon 6-month or 3-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) or 6-month or 3-month TIBOR (Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate). The interest rate swap agreements are to remain in effect through the maturity dates of the short-term loans and long-term debt. On March 31, 2013, the Company had an unused long-term line of credit arrangement of ¥300,000 million ($3,191,489 thousand). Based on this arrangement, the Company classified short-term loans of ¥55,250 million ($587,766 thousand) to long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2013, as the Company had an intention and ability to refinance when they become due. On March 31, 2012, the Company had an unused long-term line of credit arrangement of ¥245,000 million and an unused long-term line of credit arrangement of ¥55,000 million. As a result, the Company had unused long-term line of credit arrangements of ¥300,000 million at March 31, 2012 in aggregate. Based on these arrangements, the Company classified short-term loans and long-term debt due within 1 year of ¥246,681 million to long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2012, as the Company had an intention and ability to refinance when they become due. In addition to the above, the Company had an unused short-term line of credit arrangement of $555 million and $515 million at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

No such request has been received for the year ended March 31, 2013. Certain of the long-term debt agreements stipulate that certain subsidiaries, upon the lenders’ request, submit for the lenders’ approval on the proposed appropriations of income, including dividend payments, before such appropriations can be submitted to the shareholders. No such request has been received for the year ended March 31, 2013. 11. Employees’ Retirement Benefits The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have cash-balance plans based on the Japanese Defined Benefit Corporate Pension Plan Act and other defined benefit pension plans. These plans cover substantially all employees other than directors. In addition to the pension plans, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have lump-sum retirement plans to be paid upon retirement or severance based on the years of service and compensation

and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: 2013 2012 Discount rates 2.2% 2.5% Rates of increases in future compensation levels 4.9% 4.9% Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets 2.7% 2.7% The overall expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are calculated based on the historical average returns for certain years adjusted by the components of the current asset portfolio and the target rate of return based on the future investment plan. In making investment decisions, the main objective is to secure the necessary return over the long term to cover pension and retirement benefit payments. The primary investment policy is to analyze the risk/return characteristics by asset class and to invest in a diversified portfolio taking into consideration of the correlation among asset classes. The Company sets a policy asset mix with investments in equity securities, debt securities and other assets. Based on this policy, the Company selects multiple investment managers who execute the strategy. When selecting an investment manager, the Company gives consideration to management philosophy and content, investment management policy and investment style, investment control systems including information collection mechanisms and decision-making processes, compliance systems, investment experience and the track record of the investment manager as well as their investment professional in charge of managing pension assets. Plan assets are generally invested 30%, 60% and 10% in equity securities, debt securities and other, respectively at March 31, 2013. The investments which are executed by investment managers are outlined as follows: Equity securities are selected primarily from stocks that are listed on the securities exchanges. Prior to investing, the Company has investigated the business condition of the investee companies and appropriately diversified investments by type of industry and other relevant factors. Debt securities are selected primarily from government bonds, public debt instruments and corporate bonds. Prior to investing, the Company has investigated the quality of the issuing conditions, including issuers, rating, interest rate and repayment dates, and has appropriately diversified the investments. Pooled funds are selected using strategies consistent with the equity and debt securities described above. As for investments in life insurance company general accounts, the contracts with the insurance companies include a guaranteed interest rate and a return of capital. With respect to foreign investments vehicles, 44 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 155 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) the Company has investigated the stability of the underlying governments and economies, the market characteristics such as settlement systems and the taxation systems. For each of such an investment, the Company has selected the appropriate investment country and currency.

As a result of these amendments, the statutory income tax rate was reduced from approximately 41% to 38% effective from the year beginning April 1, 2012, and to approximately 36% effective from the year beginning April 1, 2015 and thereafter. Taxes on income applicable to the Company would normally result in the statutory tax rate of approximately 38% and 41% in Japan for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. . A reconciliation of the statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate expressed as a percentage of income before income taxes for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: 2013 2012 Statutory income tax rate 38.0 % 41.0 % Tax effect of subsidiaries’ operations 0.4 % 1.3 % Tax effect of permanent differences (0.1)% 0.8 % Difference in tax rate of foreign subsidiaries (1.8)% (2.6)% Tax effect on equity in earnings of affiliated companies and undistributed earnings of subsidiaries (17.6)% (8.5)% Other (3.3)% 0.2 % Effective income tax rate 15.6 % 32.2 % 48 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 159 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Income before income taxes for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2013 2012 2013 Domestic ¥ 88,229 ¥ 72,145 $ 938,606 Foreign 159,314 188,838 1,694,830 Total ¥ 247,543 ¥ 260,983 $ 2,633,436 Provision for income taxes for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2013 2012 2013 Current: Domestic ¥ 15,447 ¥ 24,158 $ 164,330 Foreign 32,363 28,934 344,287 Deferred: Domestic (9,628) 17,160 (102,426) Foreign 369 13,697 3,926 Total ¥ 38,551 ¥ 83,949 $ 410,117 Significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at March 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2013 2012 2013 Deferred tax assets: Allowance for doubtful accounts ¥ 13,174 ¥ 15,695 $ 140,149 Inventories 2,973 3,045 31,628 Investment securities 26,803 42,427 285,138 Employees' retirement benefits 36,937 35,759 392,947 Unrealized profit on intercompany transactions 23,406 18,393 249,000 Net operating loss carryforwards 54,067 26,937 575,181 Other 40,905 29,749 435,159 Financial Total deferred tax assets 198,265 172,005 2,109,202 Valuation allowance (53,198) (41,902) (565,936) Total deferred tax assets net 145,067 130,103 1,543,266 Deferred tax liabilities: Property, plant and equipment 58,736 38,079 624,851 Undistributed earnings 12,617 11,376 134,223 Investment in affiliated companies 23,646 37,264 251,553 Other 39,183 29,606 416,841 Total deferred tax liabilities 134,182 116,325 1,427,468 Net deferred tax assets ¥ 10,885 ¥ 13,778 $ 115,798 The net changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets were ¥11,296 million ($120,170 thousand) of increases and ¥4,462 million of increases for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 49 160 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 13 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) At March 31, 2013, certain subsidiaries had net operating loss carryforwards amounting to ¥146,174 million ($1,555,043thousand), subject to expiration as follows: Thousands of U.S. Years ending March 31 Millions of yen dollars 2014 ¥ 4,107 $ 43,691 2015 6,291 66,926 2016 3,568 37,957 2017 5,234 55,681 2018 8,478 90,191 2019 and thereafter 65,922 701,298 Indefinite period 52,574 559,299 Total ¥ 146,174 $ 1,555,043 No provision has been made for Japanese income taxes on the undistributed earnings of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries earned prior to March 31, 1993 or on part of the undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries with no distribution plan, which amounted to ¥411,935 million ($4,382,287 thousand) and ¥361,647 million at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company intends such earnings to be permanently reinvested. Determination of the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability is not practical. Realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets depends on the Company generating sufficient taxable income or the Company executing certain available tax strategies. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. Unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2013 and April 1, 2012 were not material. Although the Company believes that its estimates and assumptions of unrecognized tax benefits are reasonable, uncertainty regarding the final determination of tax audit settlements and any related litigation could affect the effective tax rate in the future periods. Based on each of the items which the Company is aware of at March 31, 2013, no significant changes to the unrecognized tax benefits are expected within the next 12 months. Interests and penalties related to income tax are included in other―net in the consolidated statements of income. Both the interests and the penalties accrued as of March 31, 2013 in the consolidated balance sheets, and the interests and the penalties included in other―net in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended March 31, 2013 are not material. 50 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 161 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) The Companies file income tax returns in Japan and various foreign tax jurisdictions. In Japan, the income tax examinations of the Companies by the tax authority for years through the year ended March 31, 2011 have been substantially completed. In the United States, the income tax examinations of the Companies by the tax authority for years through the year ended March 31, 2008 have been substantially completed. 13. Equity The Corporation Law of Japan (the “Law”) provides that an amount equal to 10% of the amount to be distributed as distributions of capital surplus (other than capital reserve) and retained earnings (other than legal reserve) be transferred to capital reserve and legal reserve, respectively, until the sum of capital reserve and legal reserve equals 25% of the common stock account. The amount of retained earnings available for distributions under the Law is based on the amount recorded on the Company’s books maintained in accordance with Japanese accounting practices. The adjustments to conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements but not recorded on the books, as explained in Note 1, have no effect on the determination of retained earnings available for the distributions under the Law. Such distributions can be made at any time by resolution of the shareholders or by resolution of the Board of Directors if certain conditions are met. The retained earnings available for distributions amounted to ¥199,103 million ($2,118,117thousand) at March 31, 2013.

Financial Instruments Fair value of financial instruments The estimated fair value of the financial instruments of the Companies has been determined using Financial available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value. Consequently, the estimates are not necessarily indicative of amounts that could be realized or would be paid in a current market exchange. 61 172 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 13 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) The following methodologies and assumptions were used by the Companies in estimating the fair value disclosures of the financial instruments: Cash and cash equivalents, and time deposits: The carrying amounts of the cash and cash equivalents, and time deposits reflected in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair value. Investment securities, securities and other investments: The fair value of investments in debt securities is based on quoted market prices or estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the estimated current rates offered to the issuers for securities with similar terms and remaining maturities. The fair value of marketable equity securities is based on quoted market prices. The carrying amount of the marketable equity securities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets represents their fair value. It was not practical to estimate the fair value of the investments other than debt securities and marketable equity securities without incurring excessive costs. The carrying amounts of the portion of the portfolio for which fair value could not be estimated was ¥155,796 million ($1,657,404 thousand) and ¥159,005 million at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and represented the cost of this portion of the portfolio, which, management believes, has no declines in fair value considered to be other than temporary. Non-marketable securities included in the above were in the amount of ¥93,559 million ($995,309 thousand) and ¥100,240 million, at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Of those securities that were not evaluated for impairment, because the Company did not identify any events or changes in circumstances that might have had a significant adverse effect on the fair value of those investments, were in the amounts of ¥89,788 million ($955,191 thousand) and ¥100,147 million at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For the carrying amounts and fair value of debt securities and marketable equity securities on the consolidated balance sheets, see Note 4 to consolidated financial statements. Long-term notes, loans and accounts receivable–trade and long-term receivables to affiliated companies: The fair value of long-term notes, loans and accounts receivable – trade and long-term receivables to affiliated companies is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the interest rates currently being offered to borrowers for similar long-term notes, loans and accounts receivable – trade with similar credit ratings. 62 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 173 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Short-term loans: The carrying amount of the short-term loans reflected in the consolidated balance sheets approximates their fair value. Long-term debt: The fair value of long-term debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the current borrowing rates for borrowing arrangements with similar terms and remaining maturities. Interest rate swap agreements: The fair value of interest rate swap agreements is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the current swap rates for interest rate swap agreements with similar terms and remaining periods. Foreign exchange contracts: The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is estimated based on the quoted market prices of comparable contracts, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. Commodity futures and forward contracts: The fair value of commodity futures and forward contracts is estimated primarily based on the quoted market prices of comparable contracts, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences.

Fair Value Measurements The Companies measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value.

Short-term and long-term investments categorized into Level 2 consist of primarily government and corporate bonds. Derivative instruments categorized into Level 2 consist of primarily derivatives related to commodity contracts, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. These assets are measured based upon quoted prices of identical assets not categorized into Level 1 in markets that are not active or similar assets or liabilities in active markets. These assets are valued primarily based on a market approach using observable inputs such as commodity price, foreign exchange rate and interest rate. Short-term and long-term investments categorized into Level 3 consist of primarily government and corporate bonds. Derivative instruments categorized into Level 3 consist of derivatives related to credit risk and commodity contracts. These assets are measured primarily based on a market approach using inputs that are reasonably available or inputs many market participants use with reasonable confidence because observable inputs are not available due to lack of similar assets or liabilities in active markets or inappropriate market price by a decline of liquidity. The Companies recognize inter-level transfers of financial assets and liabilities at the end of each quarter period.

The assets the Companies measure at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at March 31, 2013 and 2012 were followings: Millions of yen 2013 2012 Level 1 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 3 Total Assets: Securities and investments in affiliated companies ¥ 3,201 ¥ 43,486 ¥ 46,687 ¥ － ¥ 22,295 ¥ 22,295 Property leased to others, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets － 3,995 ¥ 3,995 － 5,908 ¥ 5,908 Thousands of U.S. dollars 2013 Level 1 Level 3 Total Assets: Securities and investments in affiliated companies $ 34,053 $ 462,617 $ 496,670 Property leased to others, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets － 42,500 42,500 Non-marketable equity securities are stated at cost. Investments in affiliated companies are stated at cost, adjusted for equity in their undistributed earnings or accumulated losses since acquisition. When declines in the value of investments in affiliated companies are other than temporary, the investments are written down to fair value and the impairment losses are recognized as a result of comprehensive examination of the recoverability for the investments based on projected business results and the percentage of decline for net assets against the investment, and other relevant factors. If the Company loses control of its subsidiaries due to the change in the ownership interest, retained interest is remeasured at fair value. As a result, the net write-downs amounted to ¥20,994 million ($223,340 Financial thousand) of losses and ¥1,699 million of gains for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Companies recognized impairment losses on equity-method investments in The Daiei, Inc. which is included in impairment loss on investment securities in the consolidated statements of income. Nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consist primarily of property leased to others, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. Property leased to others, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment and written down to their fair value if the sum of their expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Companies review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually. These assets are written down to fair value and impairment losses are recognized if they are determined to be impaired. As a result, the write-downs 69 180 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 13 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) amounted to ¥29,432 million ($313,106 thousand) and ¥8,880 million for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Valuation techniques of fair value measurement are primarily the discounted cash flow method that uses as inputs the future expected cash flows generated from the investees and related assets. The assets and liabilities which the Companies do not measure at the fair value in the statement of financial position but for which the fair value is disclosed are long-term notes, loans and accounts receivable–trade, long-term receivables to affiliated companies (less allowance for doubtful accounts) and long-term debt (including current portion) for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012. These inputs used for the fair value measurements are categorized within level 3. For valuation technique and input information used to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities, see Note 18 to consolidated financial statements. 20. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Risk management The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are exposed to market risks such as foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price and enter into derivative transactions, including non-derivative financial instruments which are designated as hedging instruments, to hedge the risks. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries also enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have internal regulations regarding position and loss limits and the actual positions and gains/losses are periodically reported to management. Although the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are exposed to credit risks in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, such risks are minimized by avoiding concentration of counterparties, selecting counterparties with high credit ratings and maintaining strict credit control. Furthermore, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries generally enter into master netting agreements with each of its counterparties. The master netting agreements provide protection in the event of bankruptcy of the counterparty in certain circumstances and mitigate the credit risk exposure from these transactions. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have departments which confirm all derivative transactions and month-end outstanding balances directly with the counterparties separated from the departments which execute derivative transactions. In addition, the Company has a “Risk Management Division,” in its Tokyo Head Office. The Risk Management Division independently analyzes various risks and exposures, reports the results of the analysis, and monitors and controls financing activities comprehensively. Furthermore, the Risk Management Division obtains derivative transaction data from the financial subsidiaries and the foreign corporate subsidiaries, reports to management periodically in 70 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 181 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) cooperation with the related departments, and strengthens the Company’s unified control over derivative transactions globally.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are using foreign exchange contracts as a hedge of a net investment in foreign currency. Management of interest rate risks The Company and certain of its subsidiaries enter into interest rate swap agreements primarily to convert the fixed interest rates on the principal of certain assets and liabilities to floating interest rates. Management of commodity price risks The Company and certain of its subsidiaries enter into commodity futures, commodity forward contracts, commodity swaps and commodity options primarily to hedge the risks from changes in commodity prices associated with certain inventories, firm commitments and forecast transactions. Fair value hedging strategy The Company and certain of its subsidiaries primarily designate, as a fair value hedge, currency swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of foreign currency denominated receivables, payables and firm commitments, commodity futures and forward contracts to hedge the exposure to the changes in fair value of certain inventories and firm commitments, and interest rate swap agreements to hedge the fixed interest rates on the principal of certain assets and liabilities. Gains and losses related to the ineffective portion of hedging transactions and the portion of hedging instruments excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were not significant for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.

Gains and losses related to the ineffective portion of hedging transactions and the portion of hedging instruments excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were not significant for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012. Gains and losses reclassified into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because it is probable that the original forecasted transactions would not occur were not significant for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries expect to reclassify ¥4,084 million ($43,447 thousand) of net loss on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the 12 months ending March 31, 2014, due to actual export and import transactions or receipts and payments of interest.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities The Company and certain of its subsidiaries enter into long-term purchase contracts for certain goods and products in metal and machinery industries at either fixed or variable prices. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries generally enter into sales contracts for such purchase contracts with customers. At March 31, 2013, the total amount of the long-term purchase contracts was approximately ¥597,000 million ($6,351,064 thousand), of which deliveries were at various dates through 2036. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries had commitments to make additional investments or loans in the aggregate amount of approximately ¥309,000 million ($3,287,234 thousand) at March 31, 2013. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries provide various types of guarantees for the obligations of the affiliated companies and customers in the ordinary course of business. The guarantees are primarily for the monetary indebtedness to the benefit of third parties. Should the guaranteed customers fail to fulfill their obligations, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries would be required to fulfill the obligations under these guarantees. The outstanding balances of guarantees were ¥299,219 million ($3,183,181 thousand) and ¥249,945 million, including ¥203,475 million ($2,164,628 thousand) and ¥172,566 million to the affiliated companies, at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The outstanding balances of guarantees represent the maximum potential amount of future payments without consideration of the possibilities of fulfillment of the obligations. Therefore, such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses on these guarantees and indemnifications, and they greatly exceed anticipated losses. Some guarantees are secured by secondary guarantees provided for the Company and certain of its subsidiaries by third parties. The amounts secured by secondary guarantees provided for the Company and certain of its Financial subsidiaries by third parties were ¥22,377 million ($238,053 thousand) and ¥21,058 million, including ¥16,993 million ($180,777 thousand) and ¥18,274 million to the affiliated companies at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Guarantees with the longest term will expire in 2037. The liabilities recognized for the guarantees were ¥1,197 million ($12,734 thousand) and ¥1,212 million at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 83 194 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 13 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) The Company manages the risk of fulfillment of obligations under the guarantees by setting the appropriate line of credit and by undertaking provisional measures in accordance with the credit risk rank to which each guaranteed customer belongs. The Company determines the rank of each customer before entering into the guarantee agreements according to the customer’s credit risk which is estimated and reviewed based on the customer’s financial information. The possibilities of fulfillment of obligations under the guarantees which would have a material effect in the consolidated financial statements were estimated to be remote at March 31, 2013. A provision for loss on guarantees was recognized for the amount that was considered probable. The outstanding balance of the export bills of exchange discounted by the negotiating banks were ¥11,440 million ($121,702 thousand) and ¥13,358 million at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The outstanding balance of notes receivable endorsed was ¥241 million ($2,564 thousand) at March 31, 2013. There was no notes receivable endorsed at March 31, 2012. If a customer fails to fulfill its obligation with respects to the bills, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries would be obligated to repurchase the bills based on the agreements with the banks. The Companies and the affiliated companies conduct business activities on a global scale and are involved in transactions which are subject to the oversight by various types of authorities, both in Japan and abroad. Such business activities are exposed to risk and, from time to time, may involve legal actions, claims or other disputes. Although there were various issues outstanding at March 31, 2013, management is of the opinion that settlement of all such issues outstanding would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations, or cash flows of the Companies. 24. Variable Interest Entities The Company and certain of its subsidiaries hold variable interests in VIEs, which is defined in ASC 810-10, in the form of investments, loans and others. In assessing whether the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are the primary beneficiary of a VIE and shall consolidate the VIE, the Companies perform a qualitative analysis whether they have both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries hold subordinated investment securities and other interests without voting rights in VIEs, whose operations are real estate developments, and consolidate them as the primary beneficiary. 84 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 195 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) The following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of the consolidated VIEs' assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2013 and 2012.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries hold variable interest in the VIEs that have not been consolidated by them because they are not the primary beneficiary while they hold investments, loans and others in the VIEs whose operations are financing and leasing. The total assets of these VIEs were ¥ 435,396 million ($4,631,872 thousand) and ¥430,230 million at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The following table presents the carrying amounts and Financial classification of the assets and liabilities that relate to the Companies’ variable interests in these VIEs in the consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2013 and 2012. The following table also presents the amounts of the maximum exposure to loss as a result of the involvement with these VIEs. The maximum exposure represents the amounts of a loss which the Companies could incur from the variability in value of the investments, and does not necessarily represent the anticipated loss to be incurred from the involvement with the VIEs. 85 196 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 13 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Millions of yen Variable Interests on The maximum Variable Interests on The maximum consolidated balance Sheet exposure to loss consolidated balance Sheet exposure to loss 2013 2012 Securities and other investments ¥ 6,230 ¥ 6,230 ¥ 4,581 ¥ 4,581 Long-term notes, loans and accounts receivable trade 12,533 12,533 12,277 12,277 Lease contracts － 31,546 － 19,736 Total ¥ 18,763 ¥ 50,309 ¥ 16,858 ¥ 36,594 Thousands of U.S. dollars Variable Interests on The maximum consolidated balance Sheet exposure to loss 2013 Securities and other investments $ 66,276 $ 66,276 Long-term notes, loans and accounts receivable trade 133,330 133,330 Lease contracts － 335,596 Total $ 199,606 $ 535,202 25. Gains or Losses on Loss of Control of Subsidiaries The Companies recognize gains or losses as changes in the Companies’ ownership interests in net income and the difference between carrying amount and fair value of retained noncontrolling investments remeasured is included in net income, if the Companies lose control of subsidiaries. The amount of gains or losses in net income by remeasuring retained noncontrolling investments at its fair value upon losing control of former subsidiaries was ¥2,582 million of gains for the year ended March 31, 2012. Valuation techniques of fair value measurement are based on various factors, including the sale price of the Companies’ former ownership interest and the discounted cash flow method that uses the future expected cash flows generated from the investees and related assets. The amounts of gains or losses in net income as changes in the Companies’ ownership interest was ¥5,642 million of gains for the year ended March 31, 2012, including gains on remeasurement of retained noncontrolling investments, which the Company recognized upon losing control of subsidiaries. Gains or losses recognized by these accounting treatments were presented in gain on sales of investment securities. These sales transactions were not made with the related parties of the Companies. Certain former consolidated subsidiaries became affiliated companies after sales transactions which resulted in loss of control. Gains or losses on loss of control of subsidiaries were not significant for the year ended March 31, 2013. 86 M a r u b e n i c o r p o r at i o n A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 013 197 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 26.
