For instance, our initiatives within C02 efficiency enable us to reduce our fuel consumption, and since fuel prices are at an all-time high and account for around 6070% of total voyage costs, this consequently reduces our costs. 2012 has been an intense CSR journey for NORDEN. We have established a CSR strategy, an Employee Code of Conduct and updated our Anti-Corruption Policy. In addition, we commenced our work within the field of responsible supply chain management by entering into an industry cooperation developing a common industry toolbox for responCarsten Mortensen, President & CEO on the right and Michael Tønnes sible supply chain management.

Reporting To ensure transparency and consistency in NORDEN’s CSR reporting, we GRI guidelines and have collected data and developed our report in accordance with the Global sector supplement Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G3.1 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines and Logistics and Transportation Sector Supplement. Only indicators that are relevant to our business and stakeholders have been chosen. UN Global Compact’s We have thus created a CSR reporting model which is tailored for NORDEN principles and our business and is based on recognised standards such as GRI and NORDEN’s CSR UNGC. This report also serves as NORDEN’s Communication on Progress reporting model (COP) Report 2012 to the UN Global Compact.

CSR strategy 4 CSR report 2012 / NORDEN’s performance NORDEN’s performance The following outline gives an overview of some of the key targets set for 2012 and the results achieved.

NORDEN's Dry Cargo transports, 2012 NPP transports, 2012 7% 2% 12% Coal Fuel oil 9% Grain Gas oil 15% 32% 40% Other Gasoline 10% Steel products Naphtha Cement products Other, uncategorised 14% 17% Iron ore 24% 18% Forest products In 2012, NORDEN transported a total of 64 million tons of dry cargo compared to 60 million in 2011. Similar to last year, NORDEN’s largest dry cargo commodity was coal with a little more than 25 million tons transported. But even though NORDEN grew volumes by 6% during the year, coal’s share of total dry cargo volumes transported decreased. The volume of grain transported, on the other hand, increased to more than 11 million tons in 2012. Together, these two less cyclical commodities represented 57% of NORDEN’s transported dry cargo volumes. In 2012, Norient Product Pool (NPP) transported a total of 28 million tons of liquid cargo compared to 21 million in 2011, which corresponds to an increase of close to 32%. Fuel oil remained the largest liquid commodity category with similar volumes as last year. However, fuel oil's share of total liquid cargo volumes transported decreased due to volume increases within gas oil, gasoline and naphtha on the more traditional routes, such as gas oil from North America to South America and Europe and gasoline from Europe to North America. NORDEN'S loading countries in 2012 NORDEN's discharging countries in 2012 Dry Cargo and Tanker Dry Cargo and Tanker The above maps display NORDEN’s discharge and loading locations around the world in 2012. Only few coastal areas have not been visited by a NORDEN vessel during the year, with the main exception being the piracy affected areas around Africa, which have intentionally been avoided. In addition, some countries have only been used as either a loading or a discharging area/port. While NORDEN has customers all over the world, Europe and North America remain the main destinations within both segments. For instance, NORDEN’s Dry Cargo Department has future contracts to carry salt from Chile to the USA, biomass/wood products from the USA to Europe and coal from Svalbard, Norway, to Northern Europe. While NORDEN’s Tanker Department carries large volumes of refined oil products, particularly fuel oil, from the Baltic and the Black Sea to Northern and Southern Europe, respectively. The majority of gas oil and gasoline is carried on the more traditional routes – gas oil from North America to South America and Europe and gasoline from Europe to North America. 6 CSR report 2012 / CSR strategy CSR strategy To ensure a business-driven approach to CSR, NORDEN has developed the CSR strategy “On the right course” which is in line with our business strategy and provides us and our business partners with a clear direction for CSR in NORDEN. The purpose of NORDEN’s CSR strategy is to focus on those issues which are important to our business and to our stakeholders; to make CSR part of our value proposition to our customers, business partners, investors and employees; to strengthen our position as part of our customers' and business partners’ responsible supply chain; and to communicate and measure our CSR ambitions and efforts. CSR strategy process The first step in establishing a CSR strategy was to conduct an extensive desk top research and series of internal and external interviews to ensure that our strategy reflects the risks and opMichael Tønnes-Jørgensen, chairman of the CSR Executive Body, kicking portunities which we, as a shipping company, face as well as off the CSR anchoring campaign by presenting the CSR strategy and Code of Conduct at the employee information meeting on 25 of January 2013. the expectations which our stakeholders have.

In 2012, NORDEN’s 10 Climate Action Plan initiatives helped reduce CO2 emissions from owned vessels by 7.7% thereby more NORDEN had 9 virtual arrival voyages in 2012, carried out by than meeting our target of 3.5%. This reduction is included in Norient Product Pool, compared to only 1 in 2011. This is partly the total CO2 emissions reduction data for owned vessels (EEOI) due to the automation of our system, where the operators are described in the paragraph “Total reduction of CO2 emissions”. prompted by our in-house IT system when a voyage would benefit from becoming a virtual arrival voyage. We are pleased with The illustration on page 9 shows how large a share of the CO2 this positive development, as virtual arrival holds benefits for the reduction each initiative contributed with in proportion to the customer, the environment and NORDEN.

Time charter voyages are excluded from EEOI as NORDEN does not control the operation of the vessel and therefore has no influence on various parameters affecting EEOI, including cargo utilisation and speed orders. In the 2011 CSR report, the distance used to calculate Total EEOI included both laden and ballast voyages. According to the EEOI formula, only laden distances should have been used. Therefore, the calculation method has been corrected, and the data since 2007 has been recalculated. 6) www.transport.gov.pl/files/0/1790756/GHGWG231.pdf. 10 CSR report 2012 / Vessel safety Vessel safety Vessel safety is a key priority and focus area for NORDEN.

Recently, tanker vessels have been hijacked and their cargo stolen. NORDEN monitors this development closely. Piracy NORDEN has adopted basic principles for anti-piracy measures which can be summed up in three words: avoid, detect and delay pirate attacks. NORDEN has not had any incidents of piracy on our vessels in 2012. NORDEN maintains the focus on having comprehensive antipiracy instructions and guidelines as well as protective measures in accordance with the BMP48 standards. In 2012, we used independent external security experts to assess some of our vessels in regards to security equipment and procedures. These inspections help us in assessing whether there are areas where we could increase our efforts. The proposal to alter the procedures for armed guards on vessels, as mentioned in last year’s CSR report, has been approved. Danish shipowners have obtained a 1-year permission allowing the use of armed guards on board their vessels. Still, NORDEN has decided to continue assessing the necessity of using armed guards on a case-by-case basis.

Cultural Performance Driver, in the autumn of 2012. However, due to implementation of our new IT system, we have decided to postpone the survey to avoid overburdening our employees. The survey will be held in the first quarter of 2013. In addition, a workplace assessment will be held in the beginning of 2013, where the focus will be on the physical and psychological working environment. These two surveys will enable us to structure our work in the coming year and assess which initiatives would be relevant to develop and implement. We are still facing the same challenges as last year concerning gender distribution in NORDEN. We are aware that, historically, shipping is primarily a male profession and therefore, we aim at creating a more balanced distribution between men and All first and second year Shipping and Finance Trainees in NORDEN women when possible.

In January 2015, all ECAs will introduce a sulphur content limit of 0.1%, which is a huge challenge as it is doubtful that enough low sulphur fuel oil will be available in 2015. Consequently, we will have to use gas oil instead of fuel oil and this may result in an increase of more than 50% in bunker costs when sailing in the ECAs. For NORDEN and the rest of the shipping industry, this increase is likely to cause rising freight rates in all ECAs. Impact from bunker quality Due to significantly deteriorating bunker quality with increasing amounts of catalytic fines in the bunker oil and due to the fact that the refining industry has increased the catalytic cracking, we frequently see accelerated wear on main engines. NORDEN as well as other shipping companies are therefore incurring increasing and substantial costs in relation to repairs, maintenance and cleaning of bunker tanks.

UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights Traditionally, companies only focused on respecting and minimising their adverse impacts on few specific human rights such as discrimination. However, with the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, companies are expected to ensure that their business operations do not have adverse impacts on any human rights listed in the International Bill of Human Rights. In addition, the principles emphasise a process-oriented approach, where both the supplier as well as the specific company should develop and implement The MR product tanker NORD GOODWILL at Kalundborg, Denmark. the following 3 processes: a policy statement, due diligence and remediation.

In 2012, the direct energy consumption by primary energy source in joules was 42,186.57. (b) CO2 emissions from vessels are calculated from the fuel quantity consumed on a voyage times the duration of the voyage (calculated pro rata) times the CO2 emissions factor for each bunker type (for residual fuel oil the CO2 emissions factor is 3.13, and for marine diesel oil and marine gas oil the CO2 emissions factor is 3.19 (source:”Second IMO GHG Study 2009”). (c) Scope 1 emissions include emissions from owned vessels operated by NORDEN and also emissions from owned company cars. Scope 2 emissions include emissions from land-based activities at NORDEN’s offices worldwide, except from the Annapolis office since electricity is integrated in rental costs. Scope 3 emissions include emissions from chartered vessels, business travel by air transport and leased company cars. (d) SOx emissions are weighted as SO2 emissions since this is presumably what the emissions will become in time. SO2 emissions are calculated from the fuel quantity consumed during the year times the average sulphur content in the bunker fuel (in 2012: 2.31%) times 0.02 since sulphur is about twice as heavy as oxygen. The formula is provided by MAN Diesel & Turbo SE. The figures stated for 2009, 2010 and 2011 are the simple average sulphur content while the figure for 2012 is the weighted average sulphur content. NORDEN will continue to report on the weighted average sulphur content, as it gives a more fair depiction of our SO2 emissions. (e) NOx emissions are weighted as NO2 emissions since this is presumably what the emissions will become in time. NO2 emissions are calculated from the energy that the main engine produces times the Tier I NOx limit which is 17 gr/kWh, as NORDEN’s owned and operated vessels are Tier I compliant. The energy produced is calculated using the fuel oil consumed in kg divided by the SFOC which in this case is estimated to be 0.173 kg/kWh (source “Project Guide for MAN S50MC-C7 two-stroke engine, 6th Edition, January 2009”).

Table 8: Global Reporting Initiative The GRI indicators from last year’s report have been revised in 2012 by the CSR Executive Body and the CSR Department. This process has led to a reduction from 14 performance indicators to 11 indicators aligned with the CSR strategy. The report boundary includes assets in the parent company, subsidiaries and joint ventures, as well as employees in the parent company and subsidiaries.
