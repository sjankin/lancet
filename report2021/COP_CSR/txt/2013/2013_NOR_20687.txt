The company invests on commercial terms and is committed to social and environmental sustainability throughout the business. The company’s headquarter is in Oslo. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the SN Power Group for the year 2011 were authorized for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors on 14 February 2012. The following text describes the most important accounting principles used in the consolidated accounts. These principles have been applied consistently to all reporting, unless otherwise stated. BASIC PRINCIPLES The consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) as adopted by the EU. The following new and revised or amended Standards and Interpretations have also been adopted in these ﬁnancial statements. Their adoption has not had any signiﬁcant impact on the amounts reported in these ﬁnancial statements but may affect the accounting for future transactions or arrangements. Applicable to Standard/ accounting periods Interpretation Title Date of issue commencing on Improvements to IFRSs (Various Standards and Interpretations) Improvements to IFRSs May 2010 1 January 2011 At the time of presentation of the ﬁnancial statements, the following standards and interpretations are issued by IASB but not entered into force for the ﬁnancial year 2011. Management assumes that these standards and interpretations will be applied in the Group ﬁnancial statements from the ﬁnancial year 2012 or later, and have not assessed the potential effect of these new standards. Applicable to Standard/ accounting periods Interpretation Title Date of issue commencing on IFRS 9 Financial Instruments November 2009 1 January 2015 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements May 2011 1 January 2013 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements May 2011 1 January 2013 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities May 2011 1 January 2013 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement May 2011 1 January 2013 IAS 1 change Presentation of Items of Other June 2011 1 July 2012 Comprehensive Income IAS 12 change Deferred Tax – Recovery of Underlying Desember 2010 1 January 2012 Assets IAS 19 (revised in 2011) Employee Beneﬁts June 2011 1 January 2013 IAS 27 (revised in 2011) Separate Financial Statements May 2011 1 January 2013 IAS 28 (revised in 2011) Investments in Associates and Joint May 2011 1 January 2013 Ventures IFRS 7 change Disclosures Offsetting Financial December 2011 1 January 2013 Assets and Financial Liabilities IAS 32 change Offsetting Financial Assets and December 2011 1 January 2014 Financial Liabilities SN POWER 29 ANNUAL REPORT 2011 OVERVIEW RESULTS SN POWER GROUP RESULTS STATKRAFT NORFUND POWER INVEST AS The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis. The functional currency of the parent company is US dollars (USD), and the SN Power Group ﬁnancial statements are presented in US Dollars (USD). All values are rounded to the nearest USD thousand unless otherwise stated. CORRESPONDING FIGURES All ﬁgures in the income statement, the balance sheet, the cash ﬂow statement and notes to the ﬁnancial statements are presented with the previous year’s corresponding ﬁgures. The corresponding ﬁgures are based on the same principles as ﬁgures for the current period, but some reclassiﬁcations have been made to increase comparability. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of the Group’s ﬁnancial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the reporting date. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates will be recognized in the period they occur only if applicable in that period. If changes also concern future periods, the effect is distributed over both current and future periods. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future. The areas in the ﬁnancial statements of SN Power Group that are most affected by signiﬁcant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions are: Useful life of tangible and intangible ﬁxed assets Depreciation is based on management estimates of the useful lives of the assets and their residual values. Estimates may change due to changes in scrap value, technological development, environmental and other conditions. Management reviews the future useful lives of each component and the residual value annually, taking into account the above mentioned factors. Provisions and contingent liabilities IAS 37 deﬁnes when to recognize a provision in the ﬁnancial statements. Management must make estimates and use judgment in determining the expected probability of an outﬂow of resources and a reliable estimate of the amount. Purchase price allocation related to new investments in subsidiaries, associated companies, and joint ventures When entering into new investments in subsidiaries, associated companies or joint ventures, the Group will measure the cost of the business combination according to IFRS 3. Management must use judgment in deﬁning and allocating fair values of assets, liabilities and direct costs attributable to the combination. Contracts related to purchase and sale of energy Contracts related to purchase and sale of energy that meets the deﬁnition of ﬁnancial instruments, are valued at fair value through proﬁt and loss. The calculation of fair value on such contracts imply in most cases use of a wide range of estimates, of which the determination of future price curves in the market are the most signiﬁcant. Impairments SN Power Group has signiﬁcant investments in ﬁxed assets, associated companies and joint ventures. These assets are tested for possible impairment where indications of loss of value are present. Such 30 SN POWER ANNUAL REPORT 2011 OVERVIEW RESULTS SN POWER GROUP RESULTS STATKRAFT NORFUND POWER INVEST AS indicators might be changes in market prices on energy or capital, shift in production capacity or other economic and legal circumstances. Calculating the recoverable amount requires a series of estimates concerning future cash ﬂows, of which price curves and rate of return are the most signiﬁcant. Development costs Development costs are recognized in the balance sheet when it is probable that these will result in future economic beneﬁts. Establishing such probability involves extensive use of judgement based on previous results and experience. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to optimize the use of equity to maximize shareholder value. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust debt exposure, dividend payments to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group’s policy is to use project ﬁnancing in all investments and in the long run to keep the gearing ratio in operating companies above 50%. The gearing ratio is deﬁned as interest bearing debt divided by Total equity and liabilities: 2011 2010 Total interest bearing debt 445 253 356 425 Total equity and liabilities 2 494 402 1 770 562 Gearing ratio 17.9 % 20.1 % CONSOLIDATION The consolidated ﬁnancial statements comprise the ﬁnancial statements of the parent company Statkraft Norfund Power Invest AS and its controlling interests in other companies as of 31 December 2011. Elimination of transactions Intra-group balances, unrealized proﬁt, income and expenses resulting from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities where the Group has a controlling interest. Controlling interest is normally attained when the Group holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights and is capable of exercising ﬁnancial and operational control over the company. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. Correspondingly, they are deconsolidated from the date control ceases. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal. The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The purchase method implies that the cost of acquisition is allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities according to fair value on the acquisition date. Costs exceeding fair value of identiﬁed assets and liabilities are recorded as goodwill, and judgments are made annually whether the carrying amount can be justiﬁed based on future earnings. Non-controlling interest is the share of proﬁt and equity that is not held by the majority owners. This is reported separately in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income and on a separate line under equity in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. SN POWER 31 ANNUAL REPORT 2011 OVERVIEW RESULTS SN POWER GROUP RESULTS STATKRAFT NORFUND POWER INVEST AS Functional currency is assessed for each subsidiary based on company speciﬁc indicators. The accounts of these subsidiaries are converted to the Group’s presentation currency (USD) by calculating all balance sheet items at the closing rate at the year end, whilst all income statement items are converted at the average rate for the year. Any conversion differences affecting balance sheet items are recorded directly against equity. Associated companies and joint ventures Shares in companies where the Group exercises a signiﬁcant, but not controlling inﬂuence, and shares in companies with joint control are treated in accordance with the equity method. Signiﬁcant inﬂuence normally means that the Group owns between 20% and 50% of the voting capital. The Group’s share of the companies’ net result adjusted for amortization of excess value, is shown on a separate line in the consolidated income statement. The investments are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as non-current assets, recognized at the value which equals the historical cost price including directly assigned transaction costs adjusted for the accumulated share of results adjusted for depreciation and amortization of excess values during the period of ownership, dividend received and possible exchange rate adjustment. Conversion differences are recorded directly against equity. The consolidated ﬁnancial statement includes the Group’s share of proﬁt or loss from the date on which signiﬁcant inﬂuence is attained and until such inﬂuence ceases. REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue comprises the fair value for the sale of goods and services, net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts. Intra-group sales are eliminated in the group accounts. Revenue is recorded as and when earned. (a) Power sales Revenues from power sales and transmission are recognized as income when delivered. (b) Sales of services Sales of services are recognized in the accounting period in which the services are rendered. (c) Dividend income Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established, normally when approved by the General Meeting. (d) Income from associated companies The Group’s share of the net result in associated companies and joint ventures is recorded in the Group’s accounts in accordance with the equity method described in IAS 28. GOVERNMENT GRANTS Grants from the government are recognized gross in the income statement and in the balance sheet. Government grants related to costs are deferred and recognized in the income statement over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate. Government grants related to projects recognized in the balance sheet are presented as deferred income and recognized as income along with depreciation of the corresponding asset. EMISSION RIGHTS SN Power Group will in some cases receive emission rights through production of environmentally friendly energy and sell them to a third party. Revenue will be recognized in line with production and emission rights will be recognized in the balance sheet as inventories at net realizable value. Net realizable value is deﬁned as sales price deducted for expected sales cost. 32 SN POWER ANNUAL REPORT 2011 OVERVIEW RESULTS SN POWER GROUP RESULTS STATKRAFT NORFUND POWER INVEST AS FOREIGN CURRENCY The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in USD, which is also the parent Company’s functional currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency based on local operations, and items included in the ﬁnancial statement of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Balance sheet items in other currencies than the functional currency are assessed at the exchange rate at the date of the balance sheet. Exchange rate effects are recognized as ﬁnancial items. Gains and losses on hedges in net investments in foreign operations, including a hedge of a monetary item that is accounted for as part of the net investment, are recognized directly in equity as long as the hedge is deemed effective. On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recognized directly in equity is transferred to the proﬁt and loss along with accumulated exchange differences on the net investment. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Generally Financial instruments are initially allocated to one of the categories of ﬁnancial instruments as described in IAS 39. The different categories relevant to the SN Power Group and the management that follow the instruments recognized in the respective categories are described below. Valuation principles for different categories of ﬁnancial instruments 1) Instruments at fair value through proﬁt or loss Derivatives and ﬁnancial instruments held for sale have to be measured at fair value in the balance sheet with corresponding change in fair value through proﬁt and loss statement. For derivatives that are hedging instruments in a hedge accounting relationship, the change in value of the effective part of the hedge, following from a change in the value of the hedged risk, is not taken to proﬁt or loss. In a fair value hedge such effects are carried against the value of the hedging object. For hedging of cash ﬂow and hedging of net investments in foreign operations such effects are taken directly to equity. Derivatives consist of both independent derivatives and embedded derivatives that are separated from the host contract and recognized at fair value as if the derivative was an independent contract. 2) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are initially recognized at fair value including transaction costs. In subsequent periods, loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, so that the effective interest rate becomes equal over the term of the instrument. 3) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value including transaction costs. In subsequent periods, ﬁnancial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method so that the effective interest rate becomes equal over the term of the instrument. Principles for designation of ﬁnancial instruments to different categories of instruments Below is a description of the guidelines applied by the SN Power Group for designation of ﬁnancial instruments to different categories of ﬁnancial instruments in cases where an instrument can qualify for recognition under more than one category. SN POWER 33 ANNUAL REPORT 2011 OVERVIEW RESULTS SN POWER GROUP RESULTS STATKRAFT NORFUND POWER INVEST AS Instruments at fair value through proﬁt or loss Derivatives must always be assessed under the category “fair value through proﬁt or loss”. Financial contracts regarding purchase or sale of energy and CO2-quotas always have to be considered as derivative ﬁnancial instruments. Physical contracts regarding purchase and sale of energy and CO2-quotas entered into as authorized by trading, or settled ﬁnancially are considered as if they where ﬁnancial instruments and have to be measured at fair value. Physical contracts regarding purchase and sale of energy and CO2quotas entered into according to authorization related to own requirements or provision for own production, are normally not covered by IAS 39 as long as the contracts do not contain written options in terms of volume ﬂexibility. Financial instruments included in hedge accounting Identiﬁcation of ﬁnancial instruments designated as a hedge instrument or a hedge object in a hedge account is based on the intention of the acquisition of the ﬁnancial instrument. If ﬁnancial instruments are acquired with the intention to obtain an economic hedge effect, a closer consideration of the possibilities to document a hedge account will be made. Presentation of derivatives in proﬁt and loss and in the balance sheet Derivatives not related to hedging are presented on separate lines in the balance sheet under assets and liabilities, respectively. Derivatives with positive and negative fair value, respectively, are presented gross in the balance sheet as long as no legal rights to set off different contracts exist, and such rights to offset actually will be applied in the current cash settlement following the contracts. In the latter case, the particular contract will be presented net in the balance sheet. In the income statement, changes in fair value of derivatives not classiﬁed as hedge accounting are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial items. Value changes in energy derivatives are presented under revenue, while value changes in ﬁnancial derivatives are presented under ﬁnancial items. INCOME TAX Tax payable for the current and prior periods is measured at the amount expected to be paid to the tax authorities in each country. The tax rates and laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax and deferred tax assets Deferred income tax is calculated based on temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts for ﬁnancial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁt will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁt will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable proﬁt will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the date of the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset within the same legal tax subject and jurisdiction. 34 SN POWER ANNUAL REPORT 2011 OVERVIEW RESULTS SN POWER GROUP RESULTS STATKRAFT NORFUND POWER INVEST AS CURRENT/NON-CURRENT An asset/liability is classiﬁed as current when it is expected to be realized or settled, is intended for sale or consumption within the Group’s normal operating cycle, is held primarily for the purpose of being traded, or is expected to be realized or settled within twelve months after the date of balance sheet. The presentation of ﬁnancial instruments in current and non-current items respectively, is made according to general guidelines for such classiﬁcation. For long-term debt, the ﬁrst year installment is classiﬁed as a short-term item. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Road and land rights Expenses for intangible assets, comprising road and land rights, are recognized at historic cost to the extent that the criteria for capitalization are satisﬁed. Development costs Development costs are capitalized only if future economic beneﬁts from the development of an intangible asset are probable, according to IAS 38. Development costs will often be capitalized when a construction project is more likely to happen than not, but before the formal investment decision has been made. TANGIBLE ASSETS Tangible assets are carried at cost, including expenses completing the asset for use, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairments. Borrowing costs for signiﬁcant investments are capitalized. Expenses accrued after the asset has been taken into use, such as maintenance costs, are taken to proﬁt or loss, while other expenses expected to generate economic beneﬁts are recognized in the balance sheet. Water rights are not depreciated if no right of reversion exists and the value is deemed to be perpetual. Time limited rights are depreciated over the license period. Water rights acquired in a separate transaction are measured initially at cost. Water rights acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value based on the estimated excess earnings of the acquired power plant. The excess earnings are the difference between the after-tax operating cash ﬂow and the required cost of invested capital on all other assets used in order to generate those cash ﬂows. These contributory assets include property, plant and equipment, other identiﬁable intangible assets and net working capital for the power plant. The allowance made for the cost of such capital is based on the value of such assets and a required rate of return reﬂecting the risks of the particular assets. Depreciation is made on a straight line basis over the useful life of the asset. Useful life is assessed on an individual basis and there might be variations within the group based on given local conditions or license period. The normal useful lives for different groups of assets are presented in the table below: SN POWER 35 ANNUAL REPORT 2011 OVERVIEW RESULTS SN POWER GROUP RESULTS STATKRAFT NORFUND POWER INVEST AS LAND ETERNAL WATER RIGHTS LICENSE PERIOD PLANTS AND MACHINERY Rock-ﬁll dams, concrete dams 75 Tunnel systems 75 Rock rooms/chambers 75 Mechanical machine installations 40 Remaining technical machine parts 15 Generator 40 Transformer 40 Switchgear (high-voltage) 35 Control gear 15 Electro technical auxiliary gear 15 System control centre 15 Telecommunication circuit 10 Administration building 50 Power plant 75 Other buildings related to operation 50 Buildings: Technical installations 30 Buildings: Teleand automatics 10-20 FIXTURES AND FITTINGS, VEHICLES, OTHER EQUIPMENT Ofﬁceand computer equipment 3 Furniture and ﬁxtures 5 Means of transport 10 Each part of a ﬁxed asset that is signiﬁcant to the total cost of the item will be depreciated separately. Residual value is taken into account when calculating the annual depreciation. Land is not subject to depreciation. Periodic maintenance is capitalized with depreciation over the time period until the next maintenance is expected to be carried out. Estimated useful life, depreciation method and remaining value are reviewed annually. When assets are sold or disposed of, the capitalized value is derecognized and any loss or gain is taken to proﬁt or loss. If new components are capitalized, the components that were replaced are removed and any remaining recognized value is recorded as a loss. LEASES A lease is classiﬁed as a ﬁnancial lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. With ﬁnancial lease agreements, the asset is recognized in the balance sheet and depreciated. A lease is classiﬁed as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the leasing period. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Tangible and intangible assets are assessed for impairment at each reporting period and always when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. When impairment is considered, the assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separate identiﬁable cash generating units. Impairment is calculated as the difference between the assets’ carrying value and the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the highest of the assets’ net selling price and the value in use for the company. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂow is discounted to the present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market 36 SN POWER ANNUAL REPORT 2011 OVERVIEW RESULTS SN POWER GROUP RESULTS STATKRAFT NORFUND POWER INVEST AS assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset. When it is assumed that the asset’s value is lower than its carrying value, the asset is written down to recoverable amount. The impairment amount is recognized in the income statement in the expense categories consistent with the type of the impaired asset. Previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there have been changes in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The reversed amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in proﬁt or loss. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is recognized in the income statement. INVENTORIES/SPARE PARTS Spare parts purchased for use in power station operation are classiﬁed as current assets and valued in the balance sheet at the lower of weighted average historical cost and fair value. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include bank deposits, other short-term liquid investments and bank overdrafts. Cash and cash equivalents are recognized at current values. Restricted deposits are included in cash and cash equivalents. EQUITY Proposed dividend is classiﬁed as equity. Dividends are reclassiﬁed to short term liabilities when approved by the General Assembly. PROVISIONS, CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or self-imposed) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the obligation has to be settled and that a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. Provisions are recognized with best estimate of the expenses required to settle the existing obligation at the balance sheet date. If signiﬁcant, the time value of money is taken into account when calculating the size of the provision. Contingent assets and liabilities are not recorded in the ﬁnancial statements. PENSIONS Deﬁned beneﬁt plans A deﬁned beneﬁt plan is a pension plan that deﬁnes an amount of pension that an employee will receive upon retirement, normally set as a share of the employee’s salary. The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans is the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the balance sheet date is determined by discounting the SN POWER 37 ANNUAL REPORT 2011 OVERVIEW RESULTS SN POWER GROUP RESULTS STATKRAFT NORFUND POWER INVEST AS estimated future cash outﬂow using a risk free interest rate. The obligation is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the linear accrual method. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in comprehensive income. Changes in the deﬁned beneﬁt obligations due to changes in pension plans are taken directly through income statement over the vesting period. Net pension assets for over-funded plans are recognized at fair value and classiﬁed as long term assets. Net pension obligations for under-funded plans and non-funded plans covered by operations are classiﬁed as long term provisions. Net pension costs for the period are included in salary and personnel costs and consist of the sum of pension earned in the period, interest costs on the estimated obligation and estimated return on the pension’s fund. Deﬁned contribution plans A deﬁned contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays ﬁxed contributions into a separate entity without further obligations after the contribution has been made. Expenses related to deﬁned contribution plans are classiﬁed as salary and personnel costs. CASH FLOW STATEMENT The cash ﬂow statement is prepared using the indirect method. This means presenting, on the basis of proﬁt before tax, cash ﬂow from operating, investing and ﬁnancing activities. Dividend paid to shareholders and non controlling interest is presented under ﬁnancing activities. Note I 2011 SN Power Group carried out business combinations in Brasil and Zambia. The Group also increased 02 its owner share in the Norvind wind park in Chile against consideration in shares in the Trayenko project (Chile), and disposed a wind project in Brazil. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ENERGIAS DO PARANÁ LTDA (BRASIL) SN Power Group acquired with effect from May 25 all the shares in Enerpar (Energias do Paraná Ltda), a company registered in the State of Paraná in Brazil. The company’s business consists of managing the power purchase agreements maturing in 2025 of approximately 140 MW, and at the time of aquisition there were no employees in the company. The purchase price for the business consists of cash payment on MBRL 120 (MUSD 76). Book value of company assets at the acquisition date is considered to represent fair value, and no goodwill has been identiﬁed. LUNSEMFWA HYDRO POWER COMPANY LTD (ZAMBIA) SN Power Group’s sub-group, Agua Imara, aquired with effect from 1 April 51% of the shares in Lunsemfwa Hydro Power Company Ltd in Zambia. The company have an installed capacity on 46,5 MW, distributed between the power stations Mulungushi (28,5 MW) and Lunsemfwa (18 MW), in addition to a 50% share in Muchinga Power Company Ltd with potential for development of additional 120 MW. The purchase price is MUSD 47, of which MUSD 36 is settled in cash and MUSD 10 is paid through a private placing. Excess values have been indentiﬁed on existing power plants and water rights in addition to goodwill. 38 SN POWER ANNUAL REPORT 2011 OVERVIEW RESULTS SN POWER GROUP RESULTS STATKRAFT NORFUND POWER INVEST AS NORVIND (CHILE) As a part of the planned termination of the development projects in Chile (Trayenko SA), an agreement was entered into between SN Power Group and the non-controlling shareholder in Norvind SA, Inversiones Totoral (ITSA) where the main features were that SN Power Group should receive ITSA’s 20% share in Norvind with consideration in 80% share in Trayenko.

SN Power’s core business are in regions that are, or have been political and ﬁnancial unstable and the company has a risk management framework in place, including policy and risk appetite, structure, methodology, skills, MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK OG LIQUIDITY knowledge, culture and tools/system support. This framework is applied to projects in all life cycles, both RISK to new developments, projects under construction and acquisitions as well as for operating entities. SN Power evaluate equity insurance against political risk and hedging of net investments against currency ﬂuctuations on a case to case basis. MARKET RISK Market risk is deﬁned as risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂow of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market prices. SN Power is mainly exposed to market risk on ﬁnancial instruments related to currency, interest rate and energy prices. Currency risk SN Power Group’s presentation currency is US dollars (USD), and the functional currency of each subsidiary is determined from an evaluation of the primary economic environment of each company. The functional currency of each country are: – USD: Peru, Chile, Panama, Norway, Nepal, Zambia and Singapore – BRL: Brazil – INR: India – PHP: Philippines SN Power Group is exposed to currency risk from transactions mainly from investments in and dividends from subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures. Companies with USD as functional currency are in many cases exposed to currency risk from local currency since a portion of the operating costs will typically be denominated in local currency. Currency risk related to the balance sheet will materialize when group companies with different functional currencies are converted to USD, like Brazil, India and the Philippines. SN Power Group makes use of currency swaps and forward contracts to hedge part of the currency exposure related to the investments in subsidiaries and afﬁliated companies, in addition to signiﬁcant cash ﬂows in foreign currency. Guidelines for the management and monitoring of foreign exchange exposure is regulated by the Group Finance Policy owned by the Treasury Department, and the entity with foreign currency risk is responsible for compliance. The following table shows the sensitivity of ﬁnancial instruments to a reasonable possible change in material currencies for the Group (consolidated companies), with all other variables held constant: INCREASE/ DECREASE EFFECT ON PROFIT BEFORE CURRENCY RISK CURRENCY IN CURRENCY RATE TAX (TUSD) 2010 NOK +10% 4 662 NOK -10% -4 662 2011 NOK +10% 3 007 NOK -10% -3 007 2011 ZMK +10% 256 ZMK -10% -256 SN POWER 41 ANNUAL REPORT 2011 OVERVIEW RESULTS SN POWER GROUP RESULTS STATKRAFT NORFUND POWER INVEST AS Signiﬁcant currency changes in associated companies will also have consequences on the income statement through application of the equity method for such investments. Interest rate risk SN Power Group is exposed to interest rate risk through ﬁnancing in different consolidated, associated companies and joint ventures, in addition to indirect exposure through interest rates as input in valuations. Interest rate exposure related to the subsidiaries, associated companies and joint venture’s debt ﬁnancing is secured through interest rate swaps for a signiﬁcant portion of the loans. SN Power’s ambition for the Group’s interest risk is to minimize interest costs, reduce ﬂuctuations in these, and limit changes in the value of the Group’s net debt. The Group’s total debt exposed to ﬂoating interest rates, exclusive associates and joint ventures, amounts to MUSD 234. The following table shows the sensitivity of ﬁnancial instruments to a reasonable possible change in interest rate for the Group (consolidated companies), with all other variables held constant: INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURE INCREASE/DECREASE IN INTEREST RATE EFFECT ON PROFIT BEFORE TAX (TUSD) 2010 +1% 727 -1% -727 2011 +1% 2 924 -1% -2 924 Energy price risk SN Power’s exposure to changes in energy prices on ﬁnancial instruments is mainly limited to the valuation of energy contracts in Brazil, where an essential factor will be the Group’s expectations regarding future price development in the Brazilian market. Price curves are developed in cooperation between market analyses department in Norway, local analysts and consultants, and calculations are updated quarterly. The following table shows the effect on net proﬁt before tax of change in Brazilian energy prices, given that all other variables are held constant. ENERGY PRICE RISK INCREASE/DECREASE IN ENERGY PRICE EFFECT ON NET PROFIT BEFORE TAX (TUSD) 2010 +10% -10% 2011 +10% 46 978 -10% -46 978 CREDIT RISK Credit risk is deﬁned as the risk of a party to a ﬁnancial instrument inﬂicting a ﬁnancial loss on SN Power Group by not fulﬁlling its obligation.

On the other hand, customers are few and large and we operate in emerging markets where counterparty risk might be assessed to be higher. Handling of potential credit risk on receivables is primarily made through credit checks , establishment of bank guarantees and parent company guarantees in addition to ongoing monitoring of counterparts. To mitigate credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents, SN Power have a ﬁnance policy that regulates the maximum exposure per counterpart. In addition, a large proportion of cash deposits are placed in Statkraft’s cash pool system. Aging of account receivables is presented below, provision for losses on receivables are made.

According to the agreement, MBRL 120 of the purcase price was trasferred to seller as a loan awaiting closing, and remaining purchase price on MBRL 586 will be paid EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE immediately after closing. The remaining payment in BRL was hedged against USD by entering into an currency swap according to SN Power policy for currency exposure, but the hedge does not qualify for hedge accounting and resulted in a loss recognized in Proﬁt and loss statement on MUSD 44 in 2011. The loss is presented under the accounting line Gains and losses on derivatives, and the loan to seller is presented under Current Receivables in the Balance sheet.

All entities in India have INR as functional currency and there has been a signiﬁcant weakening against USD in 2011, resulting in a negative translation difference on MUSD 19. Development of Dugar Hydroelectric license started in 2011. In the Philippines 2011 was a very good year mainly due to high revenues on ancillary services. The companies showed a proﬁt share on MUSD 135 and declared MUSD 98 in dividends during the year. Refurbishment of Ambuklao is completed and refurbishment of Binga is planned to ﬁnish during 2013 (SN Aboitiz Power Benguet Inc), and these projects explain the additional investments in 2011. Loss on hedges in 2011 is related to interestand currency derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting. In Panama, Fountain Intertrade Corporation (FIC) continued the development of Bajo Frio project and construction started in November 2011. FIC did also enter into interestand currency derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting. Joint venture companies in Chile experienced signiﬁcant challenges in 2011. The La Higuera intake tunnel collapsed in August and effectively stopped all production from this plant. Committments to deliver energy on power sales agreements combined with delayed start-up on both plants and a very dry year, resulted in a negative proﬁt share on MUSD 50 in 2011. La Higuera is currently in arbitration with contractor, and if the outcome is successful it is expected to see signiﬁcant positive effects in future income statements. The companies have also entered into interest derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting in order to convert ﬂoating-rate debt to ﬁxed.

The background is that local government plan to use the water at the two plants for drinking water, and power production must therefore cease. No write-downs have been made in the ﬁnancial statements as of 31 December 2011 since it is expected that the local government will postpone the termination. Carrying amount for the above mentioned plants as of 31 December 2012 is calculated to MUSD 10. A provision for dismantling (TUSD 568) is made for La Oroya and Pachachaca hydropower plants. In 2011, it has been calculated additional deferred tax of MUSD 18,5 related to excess values on water rights from the aquisition of Electroandes in 2007 (SN Power Peru). This is an adjustment of previously reported deferred tax.

The power 14 plant will have an installed capacity of 168 MW and an expected average annual production of 834 GWh. The investment frame is MUSD 402 with remaining MUSD 247 as of December 2011. SN Power is committed to contribute MUSD 152 in equity of which everything has been injected as planned. Statkraft NorCONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS fund Power Invest AS has granted a parent company guarantee for completion of MUSD 130. AND OPERATIONAL LEASES SN Power have commitments related to completion of power plants under construction which is presented as associated companies and joint ventures in the ﬁnancial statements. The total investment frame for the projects (100%) is MUSD 1 142, of which remaining investments are estimated to MUSD 221. SN Power is committed to inject maximum MUSD 10 in equity to ﬁnance remaining investment in associated companies and joint ventures. The projects are located in India, Chile and Panama. A tunnel collapse in august in the La Higuera project (Chile) lead to production stop in the project. Delayed start-up together with the tunnel collapse and committment to sell energy under power sales agreements in a very dry year with high prices, gave rise to signiﬁcant losses in 2011. The loss implied a liquidity need for La Higuera, and the owners chose to cover this by granting the company shareholder loans. Best estimate for remaining liquidity shortfall by year-end is MUSD 38 on SN Power share. On La Conﬂuencia project (Chile) delayed start-up on the Portillo branch from poor rock quality, in addition to committment to sell energy under power sales agreements in a year with high power prices also lead to signiﬁcant losses in 2011. The loss implied a liquidity need for La Conﬂuencia, and the owners chose to cover this by granting the company shareholder loans. Best estimate for remaining liquidity shortfall by year-end is MUSD 13 on SN Power share.

The fair value of interest rate swaps and currency swaps is determined by discounting expected future cash ﬂows to present values using observed market interest rates and exchange rates, while the valuation of forward exchange contracts is based on the observed exchange rates, of which forward exchange rates are derived. Estimated present values are tested for reasonableness against calculations made by the counterparties in the contracts (mark-to-market). The fair value of energy derivatives are determined at quoted market prices when available, and if market prices are not available prices are calculated on the short, medium and long term with different input variables in separate models. The fair value of other energy derivatives are calculated by discounting expected future cash ﬂows. Market price curve is determined based on in-house models in cases where one does not have market closing prices and these are updated continuously with major parameters such as inﬂation and interest rates. Market interest rate curve is assumed for discounting derivatives. Market interest rate curve calculated based on the published swap rates from major ﬁnancial institutions and credit spreads are added to the market yield curve in cases where credit risk is relevant. Fair value measurements can be classiﬁed by using a fair value hierarchy that reﬂects the signiﬁcance of the inputs used in the preparation of the measurements. 54 SN POWER ANNUAL REPORT 2011 OVERVIEW RESULTS SN POWER GROUP RESULTS STATKRAFT NORFUND POWER INVEST AS The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1: Non-adjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Other than the quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly as prices, or indirectly derived from prices. Level 3: Data for the asset or liability is not based on observable market data. Fair value hierarchy and fair value changes in ﬁnancial derivatives is presented below, while for the remaining ﬁnancial instruments are discussed in the text above. Further analysis of market risk is discussed in note 3.

All contracts qualify for hedge accounting of future cash ﬂows, and changes in fair value are recorded against equity until the payment is settled. Other hedging instruments that does not meet hedge accounting requirements are recorded at fair value over proﬁt and loss statement. Previously SN Power Group hedged net investments, but these have been phased out in 2011 in line with group policy on currency exposure. Per 31 December a total of MUSD 37 of the groups hedging instruments qualify for hedge accounting.

Provision for claims (TUSD 2 568) is related to tax claims, custom claims, claims from regulators and restructuring cost in SN Power Peru. New provisions in 2011 derives mainly from changes related to the requirements from regulatory authorities in SN Power Peru and a customs claim in Lunsemfwa Hydro Power Company. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The tax authorities in Peru promoted in 2008 a claim related to disagreement in upward adjustment of tax base from an internal reorganisation in Cahua (SN Power Peru) in 1997. The claim amounts to MPEN 28 (MUSD 10) plus interests. SN Power Peru discharged the claim and appealed the tax authorities interpretation of the legislation. In addition the company received a claim from former employees regarding supplementary payment of salary for MUSD 2,4 in the years 1981-2008. The claim has been rejected and one awaits further discussions in the legal system. In Chile, the joint venture company La Higuera has a conﬂict with the contractor and is currently in arbitration. The claim is related to delayed completion of the La Higuera plant and compensation for operating loss as a result of this, and it is expected to ﬁnish the arbitration process in 2013. A positive outcome will signiﬁcally impact future results, as the compensation is for operating losses as a result of the delay. On La Higuera a section of the intake tunnel collapsed in 2011. This lead to production stop, and together 60 SN POWER ANNUAL REPORT 2011 OVERVIEW RESULTS SN POWER GROUP RESULTS STATKRAFT NORFUND POWER INVEST AS with a comittment to deliver energy on a power sales agreement and very high power prices in the market, lead to additional operating losses in 2011. The company is insured for business interruption and a process has been initiated towards the insurance company. In Chile, the joint venture company La Conﬂuencia has a disagreement with contractor regarding variation orders on the construction contract for the plant. Negotiations are ongoing. In the Philippines the joint venture company Magat has an ongoing dispute with two provinces regarding allocation of real estate tax on MUSD 9 between these. Negotiations are ongoing and if an agreement is not reached, legal steps will be initiated. Joint venture company Benguet do also have a number of claims ongoing related to reimbursement of VAT, and awaits a conclusion from the tax authorities. The amount is approximately MUSD 15. Benguet did also suffer loss from the impact of typhoon Pepeng, and raised a claim against the insurance company on MUSD 4.

Figures in USD 1000 Note SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 1 The ﬁnancial statements have been presented in compliance with regulation regarding simpliﬁed IFRS dated 21 January 2008. The ﬁnancial statements consist of the statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, cash ﬂow statement and notes to the accounts. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The ﬁnancial statement gives a true and fair view of assets and liabilities, ﬁnancial position and result. CLASSIFICATION Assets and liabilities related to the normal operating cycle are classiﬁed as current assets and current liabilities. Receivables and liabilities not related to the normal operating cycle are classiﬁed as current if they are of a short-term nature, normally due within one year. Shares and other investments not intended for continued use or ownership are classiﬁed as current assets. Other assets are classiﬁed as ﬁxed assets and other liabilities as long term liabilities. REVENUE RECOGNITION Sales of services are recorded as income when delivered. Other operating revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the company and the revenue can be reliably measured. FOREIGN CURRENCY Functional currency for the company is USD. Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported in the income statement under the line items ﬁnancial income or ﬁnancial expenses. The company makes use of currency swaps and forward contracts to hedge part of the currency exposure related to investments in subsidiaries and associated companies in the SN Power group, and hedges are made against functional currency (USD). The currency contracts are valued at fair value based on the spot element of the contracts and recorded as hedging instruments if they qualify for hedge accounting according to IFRS. The ﬂuctuation in value due to changes in exchange rates is recorded directly against the hedged object, or over proﬁt and loss statement if the instrument does not qualify for hedge accounting. INVESTMENTS Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the cost method. The investments are recorded at the acquisition price of the shares. When it is assumed that the asset value is lower than its carrying value, the asset is written down to recoverable amount. Previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there have been changes in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Dividends from subsidiaries are recognized when earned. If an appropriation exceeds the proportion of retained proﬁt after acquisition, the excess amount represents a repayment of invested capital, and the appropriation is deducted from the value of the investment in the balance sheet. TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Tangible ﬁxed assets and intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs. Tangible ﬁxed assets and intangible assets with limited useful lives are depreciated over the expected useful life. Tangible ﬁxed assets and intangible assets are written down if the balance sheet 68 SN POWER ANNUAL REPORT 2011 OVERVIEW RESULTS SN POWER GROUP RESULTS STATKRAFT NORFUND POWER INVEST AS value exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of net sales value and the present value of future cash ﬂows expected to be generated. Write-downs are reversed if the basis for the write-down is no longer present. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs related to project development are capitalised only if future economic beneﬁts from the development of an intangible asset is probable, and if the costs can be invoiced down to the project company. Development costs will often be capitalised when a construction project is more probable than not, but no formal investment decision has yet been made. LEASING Leasing agreements are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial or operational based on the actual content of the agreement. Agreements transferring substantially all the ﬁnancial rights and obligations related to the leased object to Statkraft Norfund Power Invest AS are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial. Other lease agreements are classiﬁed as operational and the annual leasing fee is charged to expense as a leasing expense. TRADE RECEIVABLES Trade receivables are measured at realizable value. Provisions are made for bad debts. INCOME TAXES The tax charge is calculated from the proﬁt (loss) before tax and comprises current taxes and the change in deferred taxes. On basis of an interpretation from Department of Finance, the taxes are calculated on basis of NOK as functional currency and not USD as in the ﬁnancial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in accordance with the liability method without discounting and provided for all differences between the carrying amount in the balance sheet and the tax base of assets and liabilities, and for unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is expected that the beneﬁt can be utilized through sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts from expected future earnings. PENSION COST Pension liabilities related to deﬁned beneﬁt plans are measured at the net present value of future pension beneﬁts earned at the balance sheet date and calculated on the basis of assumptions for, among others, the discount rate, expected future wage growth and pension adjustments. Plan assets are measured at fair value. Net pension liabilities related to under-funded plans are recorded as provisions, while the net assets of over-funded plans are recorded in ﬁnancial ﬁxed assets. Net pension expense, which is gross pension expense less the expected return on plan assets adjusted for past service cost and the effects of changes in estimates, are included in salary and personnel costs. Changes in pension liabilities due to amendments in pension plans are included in net pension expense over the vesting period or immediately if the beneﬁts are immediately vested. Changes in pension liabilities and plan assets, due to changes in and deviations from the calculation assumptions are recorded in equity. In the case of pension plans that are deﬁned as contribution plans for accounting purposes the premiums are charged to pension expenses for the period. CASH FLOW STATEMENT The cash ﬂow statement is prepared using the indirect method. Cash and cash equivalents include cash, bank deposits and other monetary instruments with a maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase.
