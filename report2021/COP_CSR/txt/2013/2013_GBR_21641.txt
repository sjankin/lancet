We are seeking to develop deeper technical expertise in-house in the critical disciplines of health, safety, engineering and operations. As part of this we have focused on bringing in expertise from other high-hazard environments with 29% of external hires into our safety and operational risk (S&OR) function in 2012 bringing experience of working in these industries. We are also strengthening capability and consolidating our competence management programme. Our approach is being tested in a number of job categories – such as offshore installation managers and well site leaders. Results, checks and balances We place strong emphasis on checks and balances to make sure our operations are running as they should. Internal and external performance reporting is part of this. Sites carry out selfverification, supported by deployed S&OR professionals. Results are reviewed by operational line management and the central S&OR team and are used to facilitate targeted guidance and support to operating locations, as needed.
