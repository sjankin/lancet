Energy, water usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our sites have risen as a result of our growth and increases in overall production volumes. Our goal is to grow our business while reducing our resource intensity. In 2012, we have further improved, with reductions of 3% in GHG emissions per $EBIT, 4% in energy use per $EBIT, and 10% in waste generation per $EBIT. We also recorded notable reductions in emissions to air and wastewater discharges. 16 Syngenta CR performance 2012 CR performance Environment continued Increased production volumes in 2012 resulted Energy efficiency in a total energy consumption of 9,336 TJ, a 7% increase from 2011 in absolute terms.

Our St. Gabriel site in the US, which is our highest energy user, increased its energy consumption by 10% due to a significant increase in production. Our site at Huddersfield, our largest in the UK, managed to limit increased energy use to 3% despite a 9% increase in production in 2012. Site energy-saving initiatives are tailored to local needs. These include investment in more energy efficient equipment such as coolers that shut down when the outside temperature drops and lighting that turns off when office space is unoccupied. Initiatives also include process improvements in production such as the use of new highly efficient farm equipment and the optimization of climate control parameters at greenhouses. 19 of our sites have their own energy reduction targets and energy management plans in place, representing about 40% of total energy consumption.
