Allowance for impairment losses and other provisions Individually assessed watch assets represent loans with some minor indicators of deterioration in credit quality not yet resulting in the impairment of the loan. Such indicators may include minor breaches of loan covenants, and/or some factors leading to the deterioration of the financial position of the borrower, which are not yet affecting the ability of the borrower to repay the amounts in due course. Watch list loans are subject to stricter monitoring of financial position, collateral and other enhanced credit risk management tools in comparison with unimpaired assets. The Group classifies corporate loans as non-performing and accordingly impaired if there is a default on payment of the principal or accrued interest for 30 days or more. The movements in allowance for impairment losses on interest bearing assets were as follows: 100 1 Letter from the Chairman of 2 Analysis of financial 3 Corporate 4 Social 5 Consolidated the Board of Directors statements of the bank governance Responsibility financial statements Loans and advances to banks and other Loans to customers Investments Total financial institutions available-for-sale (KZT million) (KZT million) (KZT million) (Note 17) (Note 18) (KZT million) 31 December 2008 299 289,328 — 289,627 Additional provision recognized on discontinued operations — 707 — 707 (Recovery of provision)/additional provision recognized (350) 192,756 — 192,406 Write-off of assets — (171) — (171) Foreign exchange differences 73 22,928 — 23,001 31 December 2009 22 505,548 — 4,946 Discontinued operations — (3,050) — (3,050) Additional provision recognized 115 95,422 18 95,555 Write-off of assets — (23,123) — (23,123) Foreign exchange differences (1) (2,347) — (2,348) 31 December 2010 136 572,450 18 572,604 Additional provision recognized 25 65,944 126 66,095 Write-off of assets — (10,279) — (10,279) Recovery of previously written-off loans — 29,879 42 29,921 Foreign exchange differences (1) 114 — 113 31 December 2011 160 658,108 186 658,454 101 1 Letter from the Chairman of 2 Analysis of financial 3 Corporate 4 Social 5 Consolidated the Board of Directors statements of the bank governance Responsibility financial statements As at 31 December 2011, the Group has identified certain corporate customer loans, where under the contractual terms of the loan agreements there are no cash flows to the Group in the next few years. These loans are considered impaired by management. In accordance with IAS 39, interest should continue to be accrued on impaired loans, even where there are doubts in relation to its collection. The accrued interest income on these loans for the year ended 31 December 2011 amounted to KZT 42,172 million (2010: KZT 54,398 million). Management has established an allowance for loan losses against this interest. While there is currently evidence of impairment, the Group continues to progress work out strategies on these loans. The Group regularly evaluates probability of cash flows and introduces respective changes to the list of these corporate loans.

ALMC controls these types of risks by means of weekly liquidity gap analysis and taking appropriate decisions to reduce liquidity risk. Current liquidity is managed by the Treasury Department through the deals in the money markets, with placement of available funds in liquid securities in line with instructions of ALMC. The Group maintains the compliance to regulatory requirements, including term liquidity ratios and foreign exchange liquidity. The Group considers these requirements to be strict, and, as such, this measure guarantees maintaining appropriate liquidity level.

Board of Directors statements of the bank governance Responsibility financial statements Based on prior experience, the Group considers it highly unlikely that all customer accounts seek repayment on maturity. Historically the majority of such deposits are rolled over. The Group is aware of the importance of maintaining the stability of these deposits. In order to achieve this it is essential that the Group ensures depositor confidence in the Group's liquidity, by continuing to position itself as the depositor of choice in local markets and a leading financial institution in both the Republic of Kazakhstan and abroad. A further analysis of the liquidity is presented in the following tables in accordance with IFRS 7. The amounts disclosed in these tables do not correspond to the amounts recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position as the presentation below includes a maturity analysis for financial liabilities, which indicates the total remaining contractual payments, including interest payments, which are not recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position under the effective interest rate method. 189 1 Letter from the Chairman of 2 Analysis of financial 3 Corporate 4 Social 5 Consolidated the Board of Directors statements of the bank governance Responsibility financial statements Up to 1 month 1 month to 3 months 3 months to 1 year 1 year to 5 ears Over 5 years Maturity 31 December undefined 2011 Financial liabilities: (KZT million) (KZT million) (KZT million) (KZT million) (KZT million) (KZT million) (KZT million) Loans and advances from banks and other financial institutions 35,019 576 17,202 39,182 — — 91,979 Customer accounts 79,605 144,029 411,958 238,866 105,117 — 979,575 Debt securities issued 234 26,124 10,351 160,381 118,048 — 315,138 Other borrowed funds — — 1,512 20,711 3,765 — 25,988 Subordinated debt — — — 71,647 57,510 6,744 135,901 Total interest bearing financial liabilities 114,858 170,729 441,023 530,787 284,440 6,744 1,548,581 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 5,511 — 730 22,673 866 7,991 37,771 Customer accounts 471,264 — — — — — 471,264 Accrued interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities 29,301 70,296 148,675 52,337 — 11,372 311,981 Other financial liabilities 4,356 56 83 — — — 4,495 Contingent liabilities and other credit commitments 7,511 2,718 23,889 27,305 12,076 676 74,175 Total financial liabilities 610,091 225,477 536,157 712,278 356,844 7,420 2,448,267 190 1 Letter from the Chairman of 2 Analysis of financial 3 Corporate 4 Social 5 Consolidated the Board of Directors statements of the bank governance Responsibility financial statements Maturity 31 December Up to 1 month 1 month to 3 months 3 months to 1 year 1 year 5 years Over 5 years undefined 2010 г.

financial 3 Corporate 4 Social 5 Consolidated the Board of Directors statements of the bank governance Responsibility financial statements Currency risk sensitivity analysis The Group estimates the possible effect of a 10% fluctuation in foreign currency rates on the consolidated income statement and consolidated equity based on the sensitivity analysis of the internally prepared open currency position report, which includes derivative financial instruments. The analysis is based on the calculation of the impact of possible fluctuations in US dollar, Euro and Russian Ruble currency rates on the consolidated income statements and consolidated equity. This is due to the fact that as at 31 December 2011 these were the main currencies in which the Group had open positions. A 10% fluctuation is determined as a “reasonably possible change in the risk variable” by the management of the Group. All other parameters were assumed to be constant. Negative and positive amounts in the table reflect the potential probable effect on the consolidated income statement of such fluctuations. 31 December 2011 (KZT million) KZT/USD KZT/EUR KZT/RUB +10% –10% +10% –10% +10% –10% Impact on profit or loss before tax 6,738 (6,738) 3,643 (3,643) 3,235 (3,235) Impact on equity — — — — — — 31 December 2011 (KZT million) KZT/USD KZT/EUR KZT/RUB +10% –10% +10% –10% +10% –10% Impact on profit or loss before tax 4,761 (4,571) 3,428 (3,428) 2,750 (2,750) Impact on equity — — — — — — 31 December 2011 (KZT million) KZT/USD KZT/EUR KZT/RUB +10% –10% +10% –10% +10% –10% Impact on profit or loss 149 (200) 3,104 (3,104) 2,925 (2,925) Impact on equity — — — — — — 200 1 Letter from the Chairman of 2 Analysis of financial 3 Corporate 4 Social 5 Consolidated the Board of Directors statements of the bank governance Responsibility financial statements Limitations of sensitivity analysis Operational Risk The above tables demonstrate the effect of a change in a The Group is exposed to operational risk – the risk of inkey risk factor while all other things held constant.
