The study showed that there is a significant risk of fire at 10% of all agricultural establishments. For this reason, thermography of electrical panels is provided under Tryg policies to uncover any potentially serious defects that might cause severe and very costly damage. Every year, fires in electrical panels cause devastating fires at agricultural establishments. This results in declining revenues and a lot of extra work until normal operations can be resumed. With thermography, the systems are measured when active to identify the peak loads. Thermography shows differences in temperature and thus pinpoints major fire hazards. It typically costs DKK 2-3,000 to repair the defects identified by means of thermography. We also ask our agricultural customers to install firetrace in their harvesters. This technology can be used to prevent fire in, for example, the engine compartment of combine or forage harvesters. Installation and equipment cost DKK 10-15,000, and it is a requirement for new large harvesters and is recommended for existing harvesters. We are sure that this is a worthwhile investment for our customers, as it will enable them to repair their harvesters quickly and bring in the harvest.

With the Tryg House Check, customers are given advice and instructions on what they can do to prevent damage in future, and, if requested, a specific quote for the work required. Leif and Tove Rasmussen from Dyssegård accepted the offer of the Tryg House Check. The family was hit twice by cloudbursts in 2011 and had to undergo extensive renovation work, which was expensive for Tryg and difficult for Leif and Tove. An anti-flooding valve at the floor drain and a water tank connected to the gutter are some of the measures implemented by the family to prevent future damage. ‘We really want to avoid any more damage. We are the ones who suffer, and it is such a hassle sorting everything out, especially with water damage,’ Tove and Leif say. The specialist who performed the House Check inspection was satisfied with the family’s preventive measures.

The cloudburst flooded many basements and destroyed millions of kroner’s worth of electronics. Thanks to an innovative idea, our customers can now install a sensor which makes the lift in a building stop before it reaches the water in the basement. The 2011 cloudburst led us to start reflecting on how we could prevent and minimise damage to, for example, electronics. Together with one of our small subsuppliers, we have developed a solution: a sensor which stops lifts if there is water in the basement and switches electrical panels off automatically if water is leaking into the basement. A modest investment of DKK 7,500 which will save our customers a lot of trouble if a new cloudburst strikes. One of Tryg’s corporate customers, AP Pension, suffered several million kroner’s worth of damage as a result of the cloudburst. The cost of repairing its lifts alone was significant. Although the damage is covered by insurance, it causes great inconvenience to a business of this size to have to go through a claims procedure. AP Pension has now been one of the first to install sensors in its basements.

Corporate Social Responsibility | Annual report 2012 | Tryg A/S | 61 Claims prevention in Norway In 2012, Tryg focused on claims prevention and implemented a range of different measures to prevent and limit the claims that may occur. This benefits customers and provides peace of mind, while also serving the interests of the company and our investors. In 2012, Tryg organised Security Days in cooperation with the University of Trondheim (NTMU), Norway. The seminar in Trondheim was a pilot project which will inform the development of tailored claims prevention seminars, which may in future be extended to Tryg’s departments in Bergen and Oslo. The objective was to strengthen our customers’ competencies and inspire them to implement health, environmental and safety concerns in their day-to-day operations. Providing our customers with knowledge within areas of specific importance to them will both help to reduce claims and increase customer value. However, it also strengthens our role as a peace-of-mind provider and should be viewed in the context of Tryg’s strong focus on corporate social responsibility.

Dividend per share is calculated as the total dividend proposed by the Supervisory Board after the end of the financial year divided by the number of shares at the end of the year (61,316,103 shares). The dividend is not paid until approved by the shareholders at the annual general meeting. In the financial statements of Tryg Forsikring A/S’s Norwegian branch, it has included contingency fund provisions in the amount of DKK 2,394m (DKK 2,430m in 2011). In the financial statements of Tryg Forsikring A/S’s Swedish branch, it has included contingency fund provisions in the amount of DKK 160m (DKK 144m in 2011). In Tryg Forsikring A/S, these provisions, due to their nature as additional provisions, are included in equity (retained earnings), net of deferred tax. Tryg Forsikring A/S’s possible payment of dividend to Tryg A/S is influenced by this amount. The dividend payment is also affected by a contingency fund provision of DKK 670m, which is included in equity in Tryg Forsikring A/S. Tryg Garantiforsikring A/S has a similar contingency fund provision amounting to DKK 139m, which is also included in the company’s equity. The contingency fund provisions can be used to cover losses in connection with the settlement of insurance provisions or otherwise for the benefit of the insured.

The areas of underwriting and Risk management at Tryg is organised on the basis of three lines of defence: reinsurance, provisions, investment risk as well as operational risk and security are administered by similar sub-committees. To support risk The first line of defence is the business managers, who manage and management in the organisation, Tryg has established a structure control all significant risks associated with their own activities. This where each business area is supported by a risk manager responsible takes place on an operational level and involves establishing business for risk identification, risk control, event registration, contingency plans procedures, contingency plans and control descriptions and ensuring and compliance. that risks are hedged as appropriate. Effective risk management involves identifying, assessing and quantifying The second line of defence is the risk management function, which enrisk in all significant areas. As an insurance company, Tryg is able to utilise sures a consistent risk management approach across business areas. statistical experience as a basis for identifying and quantifying most risks.

In addition to the ORSA, a capital plan is prepared to demonstrate lation of the company’s capital requirements. that the company’s capital base can support the selected business plan over a three to five-year period taking into account the dividend policy, In order to be able to monitor the organisation’s risk management work also when the business plan is subjected to a number of negative stress closely, the Supervisory Board has appointed a special Risk Committee scenarios.

At 31 December 2012, the share option plan comprised 551,275 share options (800,834 share options at 31 December 2011). Each share option entitles the holder to acquire one existing share with a nominal value of DKK 25 in Tryg A/S. The share option plan entitles the holders to buy 0.9% of the share capital in Tryg A/S if all share options are exercised. In 2012, the fair value of share options recognised in the consolidated income statement amounted to DKK 7m (DKK 13m in 2011). At 31 December 2012, a total amount of DKK 76m was recognised for share option programmes issued in 2006-2011. Fair values at the time of allocation are based on the Black & Scholes option pricing formula. The Group Executive Management includes retired managers with a total of 27,465 units with a value of DKK 2.2m at the time of allocation. Risk-takers are included under ‘Other senior employees’. The following assumptions were applied in calculating the market value of outstanding share options at the time of allocation: The expected volatility is based on the average volatility of Tryg shares. The expected term is 4 years, corresponding to the average exercise period of 3 to 5 years. The risk-free interest rate is based on a bullet loan with the same term as the expected term of the options at the time of allocation. The calculation is based on the strike price as set out in the option agreement and the average share price at the time of allocation. The dividend payout ratio is not included in the calculation as the strike price is reduced by dividends paid in order to prevent option holders from being placed at a disadvantage in connection with the company’s dividend payments. The assumptions for calculating the market value at the end of term are based on the same principles as for the market value at the time of allocation.

The insurance activities were incorporated into the Tryg Group’s business structure in 2009 and are reported under Sweden. In 2010, the companies, excluding Modern Re S.A., were merged into Tryg Forsikring A/S as Moderna Forsäkringar, a branch of Tryg Forsikring A/S. Modern Re S.A. was discontinued in 2011. Assumptions for impairment test: The value-in-use method is used. The cash flows appearing from the latest budgets approved by management for the next 5 financial years are used when calculating the value in use of the total Swedish activities acquired. The cash flows in the latest budget period have been extrapolated for financial years after the budget periods (terminal period) and adjusted for expected growth rates determined on the basis of expectations for the general economic growth. The required return is based on an assessment of the risk profile of the tested business activities. Higher return require­ ments or lower growth would entail a lower value of the activities, whereas lower return requirements or higher growth expectations would entail a higher value. The impairment test shows a calculated equity of approximately DKK 1.8bn relative to a recognised equity of DKK 0.8bn and did not indicate any impairment. Assumed Required annual growth return 2012 > 5 years before tax Moderna 2.0% 12.4% 2011 Moderna 2.0% 12.7% Trademarks and customer relations The impairment test performed for trademarks and customer relations did not indicate any impairment. Software and assets under construction In 2010, Tryg launched an IT project ‘Tryg Transition’, the aim of which was to design new IT processes and achieve efficiency improvements at Tryg. In 2012, management chose to change the direction of the project and instead focus on improving the efficiency of the existing processes. Based on this, Tryg Transition is impaired, including the related pilot project in Finland. A total impairment of DKK 123m has been made for Tryg Transition. The part relating to the pilot project in Finland is recognised under discontinued business. All other impairment is recognised under insurance operating costs. The impairment test compares the carrying amount with the estimated present value of future cash flows.

Under the terms of the agreement, the Group’s Swedish branch has undertaken, along with the other businesses in the collaboration, to pay the pensions of the individual employees in accordance with the applicable rules. The FTP plan is primarily a defined-benefit plan in terms of the future pension benefits. FPK is unable to provide sufficient information for the Group to use defined-benefit accounting. For this reason, the Group has accounted for the plan as if it were a defined-contribution plan in accordance with IAS 19.30. This year’s premium paid to FPK amounted to DKK 15m, which is about 3% of the annual premium in FPK (2011). FPK writes in its interim report for 2012 that it had a collective consolidation ratio of 104 at 30 June 2012 (consolidation ratio 134 at 30 June 2011). The collective consolidation ratio is defined as the market value of the plan assets relative to the total collective pension obligations.
