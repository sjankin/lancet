Building Futures · 2012 Sustainability Report 19 Education for future generations La Trobe Award In 2012, there were 302 active La Trobe Award participants, of which 63 also completed their studies at the end of 2012. The decrease in active members is due to the phasing out of the old program and the introduction of a new structure in 2013. A new La Trobe Award was designed with defined activity streams, including University Leadership, Community Engagement and Sustainability. In 2013, the emphasis will be on recruiting new and current students to the new La Trobe Award, to increase overall participation. Each student will engage in volunteering as part of their award and may include what they have achieved in their local community. Our International Student Services team has a coordinator responsible for developing community engagement opportunities, including volunteer work that counts towards the La Trobe Award and provides work Students, Mildura Campus experience, as well as a great way to meet people, both local and international.

The La Trobe Institute for Social and Environmental Sustainability provided seminars and seed grants to foster multidisciplinary research, and encouraged research collaboration by distributing research resources and running events for over 100 subscribed researchers. In 2012, 287 people were affiliated with the Institute, some via membership of affiliated centres, 202 were subscribed to the mail distribution lists and 63 were active members.

Building Futures · 2012 Sustainability Report 23 Research for future generations Case study Emission reduction tyre pump project The emission reduction tyre pump project brought together an industry partner (Airtec) with researchers from La Trobe University’s School of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, under a grant provided by the La Trobe Institute for Social and Environmental Sustainability. If a vehicle has under‑inflated tyres, more friction results between the tyres and the road. More friction means more fuel is consumed and more carbon emissions produced. Pumping up tyres to the correct pressure saves wear and tear, fuel, money and carbon emissions. This project placed a digital tyre pressure Inside AgriBio, the Centre for BioScience station in a car park of the University’s Melbourne Campus. The station enabled drivers to check their tyre pressure, Through the Greener Government Buildings Collaboration across disciplines, between record the value, select and apply a program’s Learning and Research Working faculties, and with industry, government target pressure, and inflate or deflate Group, all areas of the University are being and other organisations will be boosted to achieve this pressure.
