United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress Covering Calendar Year 2012 11th April 2013 To our Stakeholders: I am pleased to confirm that once again this year AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption. Our Code of Business Conduct and Policy on Human Rights, both of which are available on our website, set out our commitments to act ethically and uphold the ten UNGC principles in all of our business activities. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication, primarily the AMG website www.amg-nv.com. Sincerely yours, Dr. Heinz C. Schimmelbusch Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer 20130411 Communication on Progress 1 HUMAN RIGHTS  Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group explicitly supports the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our commitment in this area began in 2009 with the publication of our Code of Business Conduct and was augmented in 2011 with the publication of our Policy on Human Rights. Both of these documents can be found in the Corporate Governance section of the AMG website, and the Human Rights Policy is shown below: 20130411 Communication on Progress 2 The commitments made in these publications are monitored by a network of Compliance Officers under the oversight of the VP and General Counsel to the company, and continually by senior management across the subsidiary companies. Training is provided to support this group. In 2012 there were no reported incidents of breaches of the AMG Code of Business Conduct, and in particular none related to human rights abuses.  Principle 2 Make sure Businesses are not complicit in human rights abuses The aim of the presence of an AMG business unit in a community is to strengthen and be part of the community, fostering sound relationships and avoiding conflicts. We respect the dignity and rights of our employees, their families and the communities in which we operate and others who might be affected by our operations and actively involving ourselves and supporting those communities. AMG sustains an expanding network of Code of Business Conduct Compliance Officers based in the countries and major sites where AMG companies are operating. Additionally, AMG has had a Whistle blowing policy in force since 2009 allowing employees to come forward on a confidential basis to report issues. The Whistleblowing policy can be accessed through the Governance section of the AMG website. In 2012 no reports of incidents have been filed through the Whistle blowing policy mechanism. LABOR  Principle 3 Businesses should uphold freedom of association & effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining AMG respects the freedom of its individual employees to join, or choose not to join, legally authorized association or organizations. AMG continues to use the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicator LA4 (Percentage of Employees Covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements) to monitor this principle. In our Annual Report covering Calendar Year 2012 we report: “AMG respects the freedom of its individual employees and their rights to join, or to choose not to join, unions. Across the combined Divisions, including corporate staff, 1979 AMG employees (65%) were covered by collective bargaining agreements. For AMD, 78% of employees are covered by such arrangements, for GK, 77%, and for ESD, which includes a higher proportion of professional salaried staff, 35% were in collective bargaining units. There were no strikes or lockouts reported at any of AMG’s facilities in 2012.” Additionally, we utilize indicator HR5 (Operations Identified in which the right to exercise freedom of association or collective bargaining may be at significant risk, and actions taken to support these rights). For calendar year 2012 we reported: “Each AMG site is assessed during site visits and internal audits to identify if there is the possibility of freedom of association or collective bargaining being put at risk as a result of political or business 20130411 Communication on Progress 3 factors. In 2012, it was found that no sites were at risk, with the exception of China, where the formation of unions remains severely restricted.”  Principle 4 The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor All AMG employees work for the company as a result of need or want. Nobody is forced to work for AMG and we prohibit the use of any forced labor, including slavery, servitude, or prison labor. This is reflected in the widespread presence of unionized labor across AMG. Currently most of the locations and environments AMG facilities are present in are stable and advanced democracies, assisting in ensuring human rights abuses of this type are not occurring.  Principle 5 The effective abolition of child labor As stated in our Human Rights Policy, AMG does not employ children and strongly rejects the use of child labor. AMG does actively support the creation of educational programs for young people including apprenticeships combined with formal education, particularly in the areas of science and engineering. In our annual report we utilize the Global Reporting Initiative indicator HR6 “Operations identified as having significant risk for incidents of child labor, and measure taken to contribute to the elimination of child labor”. In its most recent annual report AMG reported that it has reviewed 33 of its operating sites across the world to ensure that they are not at risk for employing child labor or exposing young workers to hazards. It was found that no sites posed a risk at this time. AMG is at the root of the supply chain for several of its products and is proud to be able to supply metals such as Tantalum and Tin, commodities historically fraught with human rights abuses, from mining operations with strong ethical practices and not utilizing child labor.  Principle 6 Eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation AMG’s Code of Business Conduct states that the Company views as unacceptable any form of harassment or unfair or unlawful discrimination based on race, age, gender, color, sexual orientation, disability or national origin, whether by employees, temporary employees, managers, customers, vendors or AMG companies’ visitors. As a result of the international nature of our business, there is significant racial and national origin diversity in the company. At year‐end 2012, the Advanced Materials Division (AMD) had a workforce of 1,537, the Engineering Systems Division (ESD) had 931 and Graphit Kropfmühl (GK) had 542 employees. For those facilities reporting here, including corporate staff (42), the total AMG workforce was 3,050. Geographically, these were located in Asia (271), Europe (1,804), North America (536) and South America (439). A further 291 directly supervised contract workers were employed at AMG sites. AMG assesses the diversity of its workforce in terms of gender and age. Although the multinational, and therefore multicultural, nature of the business means that ethnic diversity is significant, but because of the difficulty in defining minority employees in such an environment, the Company does not collect data on this aspect. Of the total employees, 16% are female; 21% are under 30 years of age, 52% between 30 and 50, and 27% over 50. The Management and 20130411 Communication on Progress 4 Supervisory Boards are currently all male, and all members are over 50 years of age. However, AMG is working to improve the diversity of its Boards. On page 39 of our annual report we note: “GENDER DIVERSITY The Supervisory Board recognizes the importance of a diverse composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board in terms of gender. The Supervisory Board is pleased that Mrs. Ute Wolf is willing to become one of its members, so the first woman to be part of the Company’s Supervisory Board. New Dutch legislation that entered into effect on January 1, 2013, requires the Company to pursue a policy of having at least 30% of the seats on the Supervisory Board and the Management Board be held by men and at least 30% of the seats be held by women. The Company will take this allocation of seats into account in connection with the following actions: (1) the appointment or nomination for the appointment of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board and (2) drafting the criteria for the size and composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board. At this moment, the Company does not fully comply with article 2:166 Dutch Civil Code, since, in the event the General Meeting of Shareholders will resolve to appoint Mrs. Ute Wolf and Professor Steve H. Hanke on May 3, 2013, only 12.5% of the Supervisory Board seats will be held by women. The Supervisory Board will continue to look for suitable female candidates for the Management Board and for the Supervisory Board; however, given the particular industries in which the Company is operating, suitable candidates with different gender are difficult to identify and select.” ENVIRONMENT  Principle 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges All AMG facilities have a strong awareness and knowledge of their environmental impact and the company utilizes the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 guidelines to measure and report environmental impacts in a number of areas including raw material use, energy consumption, greenhouse gas generation, water use and discharge and waste generation and disposal. These are reported annually to our stakeholders in the Company annual report. Many of AMG’s activities focus on technologies to address fossil fuel efficiencies and reduce greenhouse gas generation, where we believe a precautionary approach is vital given the potential adverse effects. The relevant section from the Annual Report to Shareholders showing how AMG measures its environmental impact is reproduced at the end of this Communication on Progress (COP).  Principle 8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Several of the larger AMG manufacturing facilities either have ISO 14001 environmental management 20130411 Communication on Progress 5 system certification in place. Formalized management systems are seen as a key tool to maintaining focus on environmental responsibility. Additionally AMG has invested in projects including hydroelectric generation, solar generation and heat recovery systems. It is also promoting energy management initiatives to improve efficiencies. AMG has also been a key player in the disassembly of the US and Russian nuclear arsenals under international treaties through the design of plants in the USA to convert weapons grade nuclear materials into materials for peaceful nuclear fuel generating applications with associated social and environmental benefits to society as a whole. The relevant section from the Annual Report to Shareholders showing how AMG measures its environmental impact is reproduced at the end of this Communication on Progress (COP).  Principle 9 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies AMG’s businesses continue to focus on environmentally friendly technologies. We have expanded our supply chain for lightweight aluminum and titanium alloying materials through the integration of AMG Aluminum, further strengthening our commitment to these technologies. We have also invested heavily in our plant in Cambridge, Ohio that produces the steel strengthening alloy ferrovanadium from byproducts of the oil refining and power generation industries, eliminating landfill. This technology reduces energy in the manufacturing process and by strengthening steel, significantly reduces the tonnages required in end user applications. AMG is also actively supporting the automotive industry as it moves to more fuel efficient turbo charged, low displacement engines, through applications of materials such as gamma TiAl and heat treatment of fast moving, high temperature parts. Similar applications have been seen in next generation aviation jet engines which contribute to the fuel efficiency of next generation aircraft. AMG continues to believe that nuclear power is required as part of the short and medium term solution to anthropogenic CO2 emissions and continue to supply products and engineering expertise to support this sector. ANTI CORRUPTION  Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. In 2009 AMG introduced (and published) its Code of Business Conduct to all of its staff which sets out guiding principles in its ethics and business conduct as adopted and approved by the Company’s Management Board and Supervisory Board. The Code of Business Conduct discusses in detail the ethical conduct and business practices which AMG expects from all employees, covering area’s like conflicts of interest, anti‐bribery, insider dealing, policies on corporate entertainment and acceptance of gifts, and the integrity of our record keeping and reporting. Specific training programs for staff, using web based training, and compliance officers, via face to face training, was carried out in 2012 in these areas. 20130411 Communication on Progress 6 ATTACHMENT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT SECTION FROM ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS 20130411 Communication on Progress 7 Sustainable Development Name Location Country Division ALD FNAG Hanau Germany ESD ALD Hanau Hanau Germany ESD ALD IMP Berlin Germany ESD ALD Japan Shinjuku-ku Japan ESD ALD Singapore Singapore Singapore ESD ALD TT Mexico 3 Ramos Arizpe Mexico ESD ALD TT USA 3 Michigan USA ESD ALD UK Guildford UK ESD ALD USA Connecticut USA ESD ALD Vacuheat Limbach Germany ESD Alpoco Minworth UK AMD Alpoco 3 Anglesey UK AMD AMG Aluminum Henderson 3 Kentucky USA AMD AMG Aluminum Wenatchee3 Washington USA AMD AMG Aluminum Office Pennsylvania USA AMD AMG Headquarters Amsterdam Netherlands AMD AMG USA Headquarters Pennsylvania USA AMD AMG Vanadium 3 Ohio USA AMD Bogala Graphite Lanka3 Colombo Sri Lanka GK CIF Mining2 Nazareno Brazil AMD Edelgraphit3 Bonn Germany GK GfE 3 Nürnberg Germany AMD GfE Fremat Brand-Erbisdorf Germany AMD Graphit Kropfmühl 2 Kropfmühl Germany GK Graphit Tyn Tyn Czech Republic GK LSM Brazil 3 São João del Rei Brazil AMD LSM China Jiaxing China AMD LSM UK Rotherham UK AMD PCDL Lucette France AMD Qingdao Graphite Qingdao China GK RW Silicium2 Pocking Germany GK SICA 3 Chauny France AMD TIV Grenoble France ESD 1.

This increase is attributed to the This increase is primarily related to the remediation projects, inclusion of cooling water used by the North American Aluminum partially offset by ongoing and increasing recycling efforts. Of alloy facilities in this report for the first time. these materials 73% (13,835 metric tons) were non-hazardous, Although most of AMD’s water is used for cooling purposes with the remaining 5,087 metric tons disposed to licensed and therefore produces clean water discharges, some of the hazardous waste landfills. wet chemical processes generate aqueous waste streams. The waste produced by ESD is much different in composition, For the five production sites reporting industrial process and much smaller in volume. Just 153 metric tons were water disposal, the major constituents were metals (1,083 disposed to landfill in 2012, composed mainly of general waste, kg), fluoride (1,693 kg), sulfate (1,056 metric tons) and total contaminated oils and metals that could not readily be recycled. suspended solids (15 metric tons). Additionally, the 5.6 million The total amount disposed by this Division was comparable to cubic meters of water discharged to surface water from 2011 (138 metric tons). the mine site in Brazil contains suspended solids, although accurate data is not yet available. GK disposed of 7,978 metric tons of waste in 2012, of which just 19.4 metric tons were hazardous waste. The mine site in Sri Lanka and the silicon metal manufacturing site in Germany together generated 80% of this waste.
