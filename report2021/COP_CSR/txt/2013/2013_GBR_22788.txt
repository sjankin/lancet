Resourcing Mobility Our Vision 2015 business strategy drives our Development Engagement people strategy, both of which can be summed up as ‘growth’. As part of our Vision 2015 strategy, These four focus areas are at different levels of our business priorities for 2013 are mobility, maturity and implementation in the business. strategic resourcing, high value engineering centres and shared services, closely aligning Resourcing with our people priorities. Prior to 2012 our human resources (HR) team, working closely with operational management, prepared for the huge growth in recruitment we knew would be needed. This meant preparing the resourcing teams, as well as widening the channels for recruitment, both locally and globally. This preparation resulted in a successful recruitment exercise which attracted over 10,000* people into AMEC during 2012, up 25 per cent on 2011. Recruiting the right numbers of people, with the right skills, able to deliver projects globally for our customers is an ongoing process. *includes agency, JV and directly-employed workers Table 7: Recruitment by division and type, excluding agency and joint ventures (JVs) Natural Power & Environmental & Centre 2012 Resources Process Infrastructure total Directly, by AMEC recruiters 2,551 474 1,594 165 4,784 Using external recruitment agencies 261 68 42 88 459 Referral from existing employees 412 23 199 4 638 Alumni programmes 142 6 0 0 148 Total 3,366 571 1,835 257 6,029 *excludes agency and JV workers Table 8: Strategic recruitment Natural Power & Environmental & Centre 2012 Resources Process Infrastructure total Graduates 198 48 25 4 275 Trainees 79 7 1 3 90 Interns 107 14 35 0 156 Total 384 69 61 7 521 One of the real success stories, over and above the During 2012 a total of 521 people were sheer numbers, is the amount of recruitment from strategically recruited, up nearly 11 per cent on ‘in house’ sources.
