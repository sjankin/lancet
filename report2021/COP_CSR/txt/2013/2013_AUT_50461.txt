In the annual reports on the last five years, the aspects of the Kapsch Spirit that form the basis for our sustained growth were individually incorporated and visualized in various ways. The respective themes of the annual reports on fiscal years (FY) 20072012 were therefore “Responsibility”, “Customer Focus”, “Performance”, “Innovation” and “Future”. The launching point for the creative design of this year’s report is the recognition that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The continual integration of our corporate vision into our daily business is a key factor behind the success of Kapsch TrafficCom in becoming a global technology group that stands for both innovation and tradition. In the end, however, we owe our success to the unique way in which our employees carry out their work. In this annual report, we have prepared numerous internal and external facts and data as infographics intended to express how we connect our corporate vision to related developments in the business world and society as a whole. However, we also want to use this opportunity to take stock of what we have achieved over the past years. After all, our goal is not to predict the future but to actively shape it. FY 2007/08 FY 2008/09 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 FY 2011/12 3 Responsibility. For us, taking responsibility means being entirely aware of the consequences of our decisions and orienting our actions around the interests of our business partners, our shareholders, our owners and our employees. With this attitude, we develop products and solutions that will benefit society and the environment for many years to come.

Photo: Christian Müller/APA/picturedesk.com Georg Kapsch, Chief Executive Officer Dear shareholders, This annual report of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group represents the end of a cycle in many respects. In each of the preceding reports since our initial public offering, we have presented one aspect of the Kapsch spirit. The current report for the fiscal year 2012/13 combines the individual aspects and illuminates them with background information. At the same time, the past fiscal year was for us a transition period between the conclusion of existing implementation projects and the start of new projects, but it also marked a transition from a corporate structure that we have literally outgrown in recent years to a new organization that sustains and supports our strategy for the coming years and the planned further growth. We have to completely grow into this new organization now. We face a new challenge here in handling the complexity that has resulted from the global growth of recent years and that will increase further as our business continues to expand. The Kapsch TrafficCom Group achieved significant progress during this fiscal year in both existing and new projects. As of October 2012, we have also implemented our new organizational structure. Parallel to these developments and continued investments in the future, project delays nevertheless led to lower revenues alongside high expenditures. As a result, the earnings figures for this reporting year lie significantly below our target. Although we still assumed at the start of the fiscal year that the situation concerning our large projects would improve quickly, we discovered that while some of the open issues could be eliminated, the continued delays in our project in South Africa negatively impacted our revenue and earnings in the second half of the year as well. The significant improvement of the earnings situation that set in during the third and, in particular, the fourth quarter is all the more pleasing. 6 | Letter from the Chief Executive Officer Letter from the Chief Executive Officer Revenue and earnings. The revenue in the fiscal year 2012/13 was EUR 488.9 million, which is 11 % below the previous year’s value of EUR 549.9 million. This decline reflects, on one hand, the fact that our major implementation projects in Poland and South Africa were already completed but the new projects were of smaller overall volume and only began contributing revenue as of the second half of the year. On the other hand, the operation revenues in Poland and South Africa were still significantly below expectations since the completed system in South Africa did not go into operation by the end of the fiscal year and the revenues earned in Poland reached the expected levels only as of the third quarter. The number of on-board units sold also remained below that of the previous year since no initial deliveries or subsequent deliveries for new systems took place. These issues also affected the earnings of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group and led to a negative operating result (EBIT) in the first two quarters of the year. In the third quarter, the continued delays in the South African project forced us to update the contract calculation. This resulted again in negative earnings. Only in the fourth quarter did the improved system operation in Poland together with progress in the project in Belarus enable a significant increase in revenue, making the quarterly earnings more than satisfactory at EUR 24.9 million. For the entire year, the EBIT was EUR 15.3 million, following EUR 42.2 million in the previous year. This puts the EBIT margin at 3.1 %, considerably below the previous year’s value of 7.7 %. The reporting year was also characterized by preparations for new projects, in other words by already incurred expenses that are not yet offset by corresponding revenues or income contributions. The implementation of our new organizational structure also meant investments that, although an essential measure for the future and our continued growth, were still associated with initial expenses. In this context, the lower revenues aggravated the cost coverage. Existing projects and markets. The regular operation of the nationwide toll collection systems in the Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland continued to yield stable revenue contributions during the fiscal year. In Poland, the final acceptance inspection took place at the end of the previous fiscal year for the nationwide toll collection system that we built in record time and then completed in stages. The satisfaction of the customer can also be seen in the fact that we have already been contracted to expand the system by more than 600 km. In the first half of the fiscal year 2012/13, some open issues of system operation still required clarification, but we achieved satisfactory operation revenue as of the third quarter. Since then, the continued earnings improvement has contributed significantly to increasing the margins. In South Africa, major decisions were made during the reporting period concerning the commissioning of the already completed toll collection system in the Gauteng province. The private lawsuit against the road operator, which resulted in multiple postponements of the system start since April 2012, has now been dismissed, and the toll introduction process is continuing. For several months, we have only been awaiting the announcement of the starting date by the government. We hope that this final step will take place soon. The delays in this project not only resulted in the absence of expected revenues, they were also associated with additionally incurred costs and standby costs for Kapsch TrafficCom. In addition, the related contract volume was reduced by roughly 10 % in the third quarter of 2012/13. The updating of our contract calculation negatively impacted the earnings contribution in this quarter. In Belarus, the major project we received in February 2012 began in the fiscal year 2012/13. This project involves the construction of a nationwide electronic toll collection system and subsequent operation for 20 years. The progress in the first phase, which will go into operation in July 2013, supported the clear revenue and earnings improvement in the fourth quarter. Letter from the Chief Executive Officer | 7 New projects and markets. We were able to continue our international market expansion during the reporting period. Developments in the North American market, which we entered only recently, were especially positive. In the U.S.A., Kapsch TrafficCom was chosen for the first time at the end of July as a supplier for a complete system in this highly competitive market. We are currently implementing a managed lane system on two highways in northern Texas that encompasses a toll system, an intelligent transportation system and a network communication system. It will be one of the most modern transportation systems in North America. Only one month later, we received another order for an incident detection system for a tunnel in Houston. In March, we were contracted for the construction of a truck parking system in Michigan. We feel that these market successes confirm our strategy and prove that our investments in past years were correct. They also show that our competence in complete intelligent transportation system (ITS) solutions is recognized even outside the area of toll collection systems. In Mexico, we strengthened our market presence and laid the groundwork for future growth by acquiring a 33 % stake in the system integration provider SIMEX. In Brazil, a growth market for the ITS industry, we received our first order for the delivery of on-board units. In Australia, we received a contract at the end of August for a toll collection system in Sydney. In addition, the road operator Transurban once again extended our contract for the delivery of on-board units. In Russia, we withdrew from the United Toll Systems joint venture for strategic reasons – and at a profit – since it was focused primarily on road operation. We will continue to concentrate in Russia on toll projects, such as the expected invitation to tender for a national toll collection system, and other ITS projects. Financial position. As already mentioned, we are not satisfied with the results of the fiscal year 2012/13, and the first half year was disappointing. However, a proper evaluation requires a longer-term perspective since the project business Kapsch TrafficCom engages in is constantly subject to earnings volatility. A comparison between individual quarters is only possible on a limited basis. After an exceptionally positive start to the previous fiscal year 2011/12, which resulted from specific project conditions, we entered a weak phase as of the second half of 2011/12 that continued until the third quarter of 2012/13 for a total of five quarters. At the same time, the balance sheet of Kapsch TrafficCom paints an extremely solid picture since the first quarter of the reporting year. The conclusion of the system implementation in Poland and the associated payment of the last milestone from implementation of the system led to noticeable improvements compared with the balance sheet date of 31 March 2012. Despite the weak profit situation, the equity ratio was 42.4 % at the end of the fiscal year 2012/13. After being able to report a net cash position in the third quarter, the net debt on 31 March 2013 was still 46 % below the previous year’s value despite the financing of the project in Belarus. The net working capital and the capital employed are also far from the previous year’s level despite the rise in the fourth quarter. The cash and cash equivalents increased over the fiscal year from EUR 44.9 million to EUR 79.0 million. The free cash flow, which was still negative one year ago, amounted to EUR 48.3 million at the end of the reporting year. This confirms that Kapsch TrafficCom has the necessary financial potential for the planned growth. We are therefore continuing our investments in the future despite the weak results of the fiscal year 2012/13. Making massive cuts due to the current situation would mean not having the necessary structures and capacities for the projects – some of them large – that are expected in the future. Dividend. In consideration of the current situation, we have also decided to deviate from our usual dividend policy of paying out roughly one-third of the annual profit and are recommending a dividend of EUR 0.40 per 8 | Letter from the Chief Executive Officer Letter from the Chief Executive Officer share, a 54 % payout, for the fiscal year 2012/13 to the annual shareholders’ meeting. Although the annual result speaks against this recommendation, we view it as appropriate from a longer-term perspective. Both the financial strength of the company and the project outlook attest to this view. Six years as a public company – a look back. Since the initial public offering in 2007, we have successfully followed a clear growth strategy. There have been fluctuations in connection with our project business, but the Kapsch TrafficCom Group has grown to new dimensions over the years in many respects. Just a few months ago, we had the honor of being recognized for this growth with an award. As part of an in-depth strategy process in 2012, we looked into the future of our markets and of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group. On this basis, we developed our company strategy up to the year 2016 and defined specific strategy paths. Looking forward. In the coming years, we expect the various ITS market segments to merge. Up to now, there has been a differentiation between toll collection systems, traffic management systems, applications for traffic safety, urban access, parking and other individual areas. In the future, these individual systems will increasingly develop in the direction of “connected vehicles in cooperative systems”. Kapsch TrafficCom has the potential, on one hand, to grow still further in its core business of electronic toll collection – even regionally – and, on the other, to increasingly offer other ITS applications. In the year 2012, we reorganized the Kapsch TrafficCom Group to capitalize on this potential. Since October, the entire group now shares a globally uniform organizational structure with coordinated standards, processes and interfaces. This shall improve our efficiency, which in turn supports continued growth. Additional growth prospects shall also arise through the development of complete ITS solutions. The convergence of the ITS market is already evident in the inquiries and orders we have received recently in the U.S.A. Outlook. With our ITS strategy and the new company structure, we consider ourselves well positioned. The strong balance sheet structure of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group shows that we also have sufficient financial potential for upcoming projects both small and large – even running in parallel. The fiscal year 2013/14 will be marked by a continuation of our existing projects. In particular, the further developments in South Africa will influence the revenue and earnings situation. In addition, an invitation to tender has already begun in Slovenia. Additional tenders are expected in Belgium and the U.S.A. Extensive toll collection systems are under discussion in Bulgaria, Russia and the surrounding countries as well as in Germany. Naturally, we are following these discussions with great interest. In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which are especially important to a company during a transitional phase such as we experienced during the reporting period. I also thank my colleagues on the executive board, Erwin Toplak and André Laux, as well as the supervisory board of Kapsch TrafficCom AG for their insights, advice and continuing discussions. My thanks go out to our customers and our investors for the lasting trust they have placed in our efforts. I hope you will continue to accompany us on our growth course.

Initially run as the toll collection division of Kapsch AG, Kapsch TrafficCom AG was created by means of a demerger from Kapsch AG in 2002. The Kapsch Group is an Austrian, family-owned technology group in existence since 1892. About Us 1991 1999 2000 2002 2005 Founding as toll Acquisition of Acquisition of Demerger of Kapsch Founding of collection division of toll collection Combitech Traffic TrafficCom AG Kapsch Telematic Kapsch AG division of Bosch Systems AB, from Kapsch AG Services GmbH Telecom, Germany Sweden Until 1999, the division acted solely as a system integrator, but selected acquisitions, including those of the toll collection division of Bosch Telecom, Germany (1999), and Combitech Traffic Systems AB, Sweden (2000), provided access to its own technology portfolio. In 2005, with the founding of Kapsch Telematic Services GmbH and the acquisition of DPS Automation S.A., Argentina (2006), a specialist in toll clearance processes in the back office, we entered the toll system operation business. Since then, we have covered the entire value creation chain of our customers as a one-stop shop – from components and subsystems to their integration and operation. 2007 2008 2009 2010 2012 Initial public offering Acquisition of assets Purchase of minority Acquisition of Purchase of minority of TechnoCom, stake in Q-Free, Mark IV IVHS in stake in SIMEX, U.S.A. Norway North America and Mexico of majority stake in TMT, South Africa In June 2007, the initial public offering was made to support the global expansion and the further growth of the business. In 2008, we successfully entered the North American market by acquiring the assets of the U.S. TechnoCom Corp., a pioneer of the newly introduced 5.9 GHz technology in the U.S.A. This was later supported by the acquisition of the Mark IV IVHS businesses in the United States, Canada and Mexico in 2010 and the purchase of a minority stake in the Mexican system integrator SIMEX in 2012. In 2009, we purchased a 20.47 % stake (now 19.76 %) in the Norwegian competitor Q-Free ASA. In 2010, we acquired a 51.43 % stake (now 56.81 %) in the South African TMT Services and Supplies (Proprietary) Limited. Until today, we have established subsidiaries and representative offices in 33 countries around the globe for an increased global market presence.

Market drivers. We have identified the following five factors, which are described in more detail in the Management Report, as the main drivers for the market we address: n Funding for infrastructure projects n Reducing congestion and further environmental pollution caused by road traffic n Increasing traffic safety and security n Enhancing vehicle and fleet productivity n Increased convenience of travelers 14 | About Us Customer segments. We have developed our own understanding and our own view of the ITS market in order to define and develop our market positioning. From this perspective, we have divided the ITS market into four customer segments and have identified the corresponding primary addressees. About Us Operator/authority-oriented ITS Vehicle-oriented ITS Governments, regional authorities, Connected Car makers and their suppliers concessionaires vehicles in cooperative User-oriented ITS systems Industry-oriented ITS Information service providers Industry and insurance companies Operator/authority-oriented ITS encompasses both ETC and ATMS as well as applications for urban access. The addressees are governments and regional authorities or organizations, such as concessionaires, that develop transport policies using ITS to ensure the availability and quality of the infrastructure in a way that improves safety, performance, security and environmental protection. Vehicle-oriented ITS aims at in-car telematics such as remote diagnostics or driver assistance systems (AVIS). They are intended mainly to enhance vehicle productivity, particularly that of commercial vehicles (CVO), as well as traffic safety and security. Addressees are mainly car makers and their suppliers. This field also includes systems for real-time interaction between vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle; V2V) as well as between vehicles and infrastructure (vehicle-to-infrastructure; V2I), which we believe will be increasingly based on 5.9 GHz technology. User-oriented ITS focuses mainly on convenience and efficiency for travelers. The customer in the car receives information to aid in orientation during the journey, thereby increasing traffic safety. Example applications for advanced vehicle information systems (AVIS) include transmitting traffic-oriented vehicle information to travelers before or during the trip as well as navigation services. Addressees are information service providers such as wireless network operators, radio broadcasters and vendors of portable navigation devices. The 5.9 GHz technology as a communication platform will enable a variety of future applications involving “connected vehicles”. Industry-oriented ITS encompasses commercial applications designed to reduce the costs or maximize the revenue of vehicle fleet operators, including public transportation companies (PVTMS). Examples include systems for fleet management and for collecting information on the logistics of large-scale vehicle operators. Among the addressees are insurance companies, who see pay-as-you-drive car insurance as a promising way to attract new customers by offering fair insurance rates and ITS-based value-added mobility services. Convergence of the ITS market. We expect that these product and customer segments will become increasingly interconnected and will finally converge over time. The technical boundaries and organizational requirements are being identified and standardized within research projects. The driving forces in the expected convergence are governments and the automotive industry. Market positioning. Our current focus aims at the operator/authority-oriented segment of the ITS market. Our goal is to become a leading provider of solutions and technologies in the future field of “connected vehicles in cooperative systems”. We intend to offer solutions at both the infrastructure and vehicle levels, supplying the information and communication technologies as well as designing, building and operating select applications. Our future focus will therefore also aim at vehicle-oriented and user-oriented ITS. We will also monitor the ongoing developments in industry-oriented ITS. About Us | 15 Our Offering.

We presented to our readers various key components that are responsible for the performance of our transportation solutions. For example, our on-board units ensure smooth communication with the infrastructure components. Kapsch TrafficCom has now delivered roughly 80 million of these units around the world, making an important contribution to the high performance of road transportation. 23 The Kapsch TrafficCom Shares. Stock Markets in Fiscal Year 2012/13. International stock markets. The global economic uncertainties in 2012 also affected the activity on the international stock markets, leading to high volatility. Despite the rekindling of the sovereign debt crisis at midyear, the key share indexes consistently finished the year higher than their 2011 closing values. The European share index DJ Euro Stoxx 50 was able to increase by roughly 13 %, the German index DAX added 30 % and the Japanese Nikkei 225 rose over the course of the year by 23 %. The Dow Jones Industrial also finished 2012 at 6 % above the previous year’s value despite the decline in the fourth quarter associated with the feared “fiscal cliff”. In the first quarter of the year 2013, the Japanese and U.S. indexes were able to continue their upward trends, while the European stock markets suffered under the renewed concerns of the euro crisis and moved sideways. Overall, all international stock markets nevertheless exhibited upward movement during the reporting period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013, even if with relatively low trading volume. Vienna Stock Exchange. The leading index of the Vienna Stock Exchange, ATX, developed similarly to the German DAX index in 2012, finishing the year roughly 27 % above the close of the previous year. The market capitalization of the Vienna Stock Exchange on 31 December 2012 was about EUR 80 billion, surpassing the weak value of the previous year’s close of roughly EUR 66 billion. In the first three months of the year 2013, the ATX lost 2 % in value, closing the first quarter at 2,352.01 points. Kapsch TrafficCom Shares in Fiscal Year 2012/13. The shares of Kapsch TrafficCom AG have been listed since 26 June 2007 on the Vienna Stock Exchange in the prime market. They are included in the ATX Prime Index and since 2009 also in the Austrian sustainability index, VÖNIX. In addition, Kapsch TrafficCom was included in the index “ATX Global Players”, which has been tracked by the Vienna Stock Exchange since 13 May 2013. This index encompasses those – initially 15 – companies that play an important role on the global market. As a member of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), Kapsch TrafficCom is committed to corporate social responsibility and sustainable development. The share capital is EUR 13.0 million and is divided among 13 million no par value shares. During the reporting period, the share price exhibited a clear decline. From EUR 63.50 at the end of the previous fiscal year on 31 March 2012, the price fell – despite a recovery phase at the turn of the calendar year – by nearly 42 % to EUR 37.02 on 31 March 2013. As such, the price of Kapsch TrafficCom shares followed a course in the fiscal year 2012/13 that was contrary to that of the general international developments. Observing the share price development since the initial public offering in the year 2007, a large fluctuation range can be seen over the six years. Starting from the offer price of EUR 32, the price initially fell heavily to reach an all-time low on 7 November 2008 of EUR 12.65. After enormous growth in the second half of 2010, it reached its highest value to date of EUR 72.00 on 7 and 30 December 2010. This was followed by a downward price correction in 2011 and another rise at the start of 2012. Beginning from this high level, the developments in the reporting period lagged significantly behind the general trend. Since the IPO, the shares of Kapsch TrafficCom AG nevertheless show a gain of roughly 16 %, while the ATX lost more than 50 % in value during the same time period. The European index DJ Euro Stoxx 50 also declined by 41 % during this time period. 24 | The Kapsch TrafficCom Shares Development of Kapsch TrafficCom shares and ATX Prime Index from 26 June 2007 to 31 March 2013 Kapsch TrafficCom shares ATX Prime Index 200 150 The Kapsch 100 50 TrafficCom Shares 26 June 2007 1 31 March 2008 31 March 2009 31 March 2010 31 March 2011 31 March 2012 31 March 2013 1 Offer price and opening value for ATX Prime Index on 26 June 2007, each indexed to 100 Based on a closing price of EUR 37.02 per share as of 31 March 2013, Kapsch TrafficCom’s market capitalization was EUR 481.3 million (31 March 2012: EUR 825.5 million). The average daily turnover of the Kapsch TrafficCom shares on the Vienna Stock Exchange was approximately EUR 1.22 million, up by about 17 % compared to the previous year’s value of EUR 1.04 million (double count).

Kapsch TrafficCom follows a dividend policy based on long-term considerations. Accordingly, the executive board recommends a distribution of dividends in a long-term average that would reflect a payout ratio of approximately one-third of group annual profits. For the fiscal year 2012/13, the executive board will make a proposal to the shareholders’ meeting on 12 September 2013 calling for the approval of a dividend of EUR 0.40 per share (2011/12: EUR 0.90 per share). This is a deviation from the average payout and reflects a payout ratio of approximately 54 % in relation to the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the company (2011/12: approximately 57 %). In general, Kapsch TrafficCom views itself as a dividend-bearing company, and this is reflected in a continuous absolute payout ratio in compliance with the long-term dividend policy, insofar as company developments permit this. Shareholder Structure. As of 31 March 2013, approximately 33.9 % of the shares were in free float. As at the close of the previous year, the remaining approximately 61.9 % continued to be held by KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH.

Through consistent innovation management, we make our contribution to making the future of transportation truly impressive. Although many of our products, such as our incident detection system, are invisible to users, the result is something they can definitely observe: greater safety on the road and smoothly flowing traffic. 29 The View Ahead. Vision. Our vision: Always one step ahead. Our company philosophy – always being one step ahead – motivates us on a daily basis to new accomplishments in technology and business. Kapsch TrafficCom is currently placing its focus within the market of ­intelligent transportation systems (ITS) on technologies, systems and applications for electronic toll collection (ETC). Our goal, today as in the future, is to help road users around the world reach their destinations quickly, efficiently and with low environmental impact. Always innovative. Always striving for excellence. Always looking to the future. Always close to its customers. Always aware of its responsibilities. Kapsch is always looking to the future. At Kapsch TrafficCom, we always strive to think and act with vision and an eye toward success. With innovative solutions, we shape the technologies of the future for drivers, road operators and commercial service providers around the world. As a player in the ITS market, we are dedicated to consistently creating value for a better future – while always looking forward. In addition to electronic toll collection systems, our portfolio will increasingly expand to include applications for urban access and parking, road safety enforcement, commercial vehicle operations, electronic vehicle registration, traffic management and V2X cooperative systems. Kapsch is always innovative. Kapsch TrafficCom develops innovative and intelligent components, solutions and services for use around the world. Our pioneering offerings protect the environment and minimize risk. We cover the entire value creation chain of our customers with our comprehensive end-to-end solutions – from components and subsystems through their integration to operation – as a one-stop shop. With our holistic and flexible solutions, we are always one step ahead. Kapsch is always striving for excellence. The ITS solutions from Kapsch TrafficCom offer outstanding performance and system reliability as well as high profitability. For example, the average toll transaction rate of the nationwide electronic truck toll collection system in Austria during 2012 was roughly 99.8 %. This figure documents the number of successful toll transactions in relation to all potential transactions. As an indicator of the accuracy and reliability of a toll collection system, a high toll transaction rate ensures high toll revenues. We continuously optimize our processes to further lower the costs for production, installation, operation and maintenance. Our employees consistently create value for our partners and customers as they ceaselessly strive for technological and business excellence. 30 | The View Ahead Kapsch is always aware of its responsibilities. The mature transportation solutions from Kapsch TrafficCom increase road safety, improve traffic flow, support the timely detection of unusual incidents, reduce traffic jams, regulate access to cities and reduce CO2 emissions. Our systems make a sustainable contribution to a future worth living in. They lower environmental impact, make use of natural resources and increase public safety. Kapsch is always close to its customers. Kapsch TrafficCom is right where you need us: with branch offices around the globe, we are always close to our customers. In our subsidiaries and representative offices in 33 countries on all continents and with over 500 development engineers at eight research and development centers, we work around the clock on the solutions of tomorrow. Mission. Our mission. We make traffic flow. Better traffic control. Our toll collection systems around the world intelligently guide traffic. They increase road safety and reduce traffic obstructions. At the same time, they enable usage-based charging of tolls via pre-paid or post-paid models. The View Ahead Higher quality of life in cities. Urban road user charging, limited access zones, low emission zones and dynamic parking prevent traffic jams and unnecessary driving. They also reduce noise pollution. In urban transportation areas, Kapsch TrafficCom supports road user charging as well as urban access and parking. Greater safety and environmental protection. Incident detection systems that promptly and intelligently identify events, video-based traffic sensors and multi-functional telematics platforms improve road safety. They help utilize existing infrastructure more efficiently and lower environmental impact. Our on-board units have impressively low energy consumption. Compared with typical products of this type, we produce half as much CO2 in the production and packaging process. In this way, we improve safety and environmental protection. Values. Creating and honoring values. Values are an important part of the Kapsch corporate culture. In our work, we identify values that will shape the future and we actively contribute to enabling socially responsible progress within our society. The employees, managers and executives of Kapsch TrafficCom live and work according to these values: n Responsibility. We act in the interests of the company, take initiative and accept the consequences of our actions. n Respect. We work together on the basis of mutual respect. n Performance. Everyone contributes to the achievement of our goals with his or her own personal dedication and success. n Discipline. Following rules makes it possible for us to work together in accordance with our values. n Transparency. We handle information openly to make our decision-making process clear. n Freedom. Individual freedom of action amplifies our personal willingness to contribute. n Family. We all pull together and support each other. n Dynamic. A constant readiness to accept change allows us to achieve our goals. The View Ahead | 31 Strategy 2016. We are 4-Path Strategy We will become Provider of primarily 1. Exploit the growth potential of the ETC market Provider of electronic toll electronic toll collection collection and select other 2. Enter new regional markets (ETC) intelligent transportation 3. Enter new ITS segments systems (ITS) 4. Prepare for the convergence of the ITS market We are pursuing a long-term expansion strategy. Our strategic goals include a clear, continued increase in revenue while maintaining a double-digit EBIT margin. Over the long term, we intend to generate three-fourths of our business via recurring revenues in order to reduce our exposure to the cash flow volatility arising from our project business. Furthermore, we will significantly increase the share of select ITS applications other than toll collection systems. In this way, we are preparing Kapsch TrafficCom Group for the convergence of the ITS market that we expect over the next five to ten years – applications, platforms and technologies will presumably become increasingly interconnected and converge over time. We believe that the future belongs to “connected vehicles in cooperative systems” which are systems for real-time vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) interaction. To lay a foundation for this, we continue to strive for global quality and innovation leadership. 4-path strategy. These goals are underpinned by four paths that will show us the way in the upcoming years. The key strategic implication lies in a continuation of our growth course and a preparation for the expected convergence of the ITS market. ETC is and will remain the core business, but we need and want to increasingly develop into a provider of both ETC and select other ITS solutions. Firstly, we intend to participate in the expected strong growth of the ETC market. There are a number of interesting possibilities around the world for the supply and operation of toll collection systems. We want to leverage the strong position of Kapsch TrafficCom to further expand our market share. We shall accomplish this, on one hand, by obtaining as many nationwide projects as possible and, on the other, by continually improving our systems to maintain our technological advantage. The organization must also be appropriately structured in the future for handling multiple major projects in parallel and for executing small projects in a costefficient manner. Secondly, we will enter new regional markets. Kapsch TrafficCom is already active around the globe, but there are markets in which we are barely or not at all represented. In addition to the major operation projects in Europe, we see particular potential in South America and Southeast Asia. We also view the U.S.A. as among these markets, and we are already one step ahead there after the acquisition of Mark IV IVHS in 2010. We will also offer smaller systems for emerging markets where traditional manual tolling is often still the preferred method of toll collection but where ETC systems will also eventually be introduced over the long term. 32 | The View Ahead Thirdly, we want to enter into select other segments of the ITS market – including with an eye toward convergence. To this end, we have developed a thoroughly forward-looking portfolio that generates maximum synergies both for us, such as through the use of existing distribution channels, technologies and project organization, and for our customers, especially in the transition from today’s conventional ITS systems to future-oriented ITS applications. We consider ourselves well-prepared for this goal with the 5.9 GHz technology that we have developed in the U.S.A., which meets the technological prerequisites for many of the ITS systems that we will be addressing. Fourthly, we will prepare ourselves for the convergence of the ITS market in order to secure our longterm growth. In regard to the future topic of “connected vehicles in cooperative systems”, we will participate in research projects and standardization efforts. We will also open up contacts with the automotive industry as a new target group. New, efficient organizational structure. The strong growth of recent years and its planned continuation required an adaptation of our structures. The new organizational structure also contributes to increased efficiency. Additional growth prospects have also arisen through the expansion of our fields of business and markets. The View Ahead The organizational structure implemented globally as of 1 October 2012, should bring more responsibility to the three sales regions in the future thanks to an increased regional orientation in order that we can act in more distributed fashion as our size increases. The new structure also creates space for additional ITS segments. Investments in our employees. In order to implement these changes, it is essential that our employees are able to anticipate not only future technologies but also the future business models of our customers. From our perspective, it will be increasingly important in the future to enter the market with adapted business models as well as new financing models as this is the only way to secure an advantage and make oneself harder to imitate. For this reason, we will invest carefully in the training and further education of our employees and allow them to continue participating in the success of Kapsch TrafficCom – which is their own success, after all. We aspire to quality and innovation. In our strategy to 2016, we have set ourselves the goal of global quality and innovation leadership. Consistently creating and securing a competitive advantage for our customers without sacrificing our own responsibility for the environment is a firm aspect of our identity as a company. By focusing on the needs of our customers, we win and keep their trust. Optimal service contributes to long-lasting partnerships with satisfied customers. We are committed to a constant and thorough process of innovation. Research and development are a high priority for us with respect to achieving our strategic goals. The knowledge of entirely new technologies based on national and international standards and how to employ them forms the foundation for successful business development and opens the way into new markets. Successful research and development is also the essential foundation for the continued improvement of existing products and systems. The View Ahead | 33 Sustainability. Central aspects of sustainability such as resource conservation, innovation, equal opportunities and fairness form the basis for our business success in line with the core purpose and international orientation of our company. A correspondingly high commitment to sustainable development and the necessary initiatives and measures can be observed throughout our company. Always one step ahead. This is not only the company philosophy of Kapsch TrafficCom, it is also our long-term aspiration with regard to sustainable company management. Our scope of activity. Alongside statutory requirements and internal guidelines, the code of conduct of the Kapsch Group defines binding principles for ethically, morally and legally correct behavior that apply to all corporate units – and therefore all employees of Kapsch TrafficCom. The code of conduct can be found on our website www.kapsch.net. Our fields of activity. Kapsch TrafficCom is pursuing a long-term expansion strategy. The sustainability goals and measures are an integral part of this strategy and serve to secure the continued success of the company. The fields of activity described below have been established as priorities in consideration of the needs of the most important interest groups, such as customers, employees and the public: n Protecting the environment, conserving resources and actively protecting the climate n Securing our innovative strength n Product responsibility and quality assurance n Ens uring our competitiveness and profitability n Integrity and compliance How we protect the environment and conserve resources. Initiatives for reducing resource consumption are under way in all company units. Our subsidiary Kapsch Components was able to reduce its annual electricity consumption by roughly 40 % in fiscal year 2010/11 by optimizing its ventilation, air-conditioning and lighting systems – this corresponds to a savings of roughly 175 tons of CO2 per year. This successful initiative garnered an award from the Ministry of the Environment as part of the “klima:aktiv program”. Another example is the new on-board units, which can not only be tailored to the specific customer requirements but also consume less energy. The CO2 emissions resulting from production and packaging are half those of typical products of this type. In addition, we strive for environmental awareness within our own administrative and production buildings. The building complex Euro Plaza G, which is used by multiple units of Kapsch TrafficCom, was designed for energy efficiency and was recognized in 2011 as the first office building in Vienna to receive the gold certificate of the Austrian Association for Sustainable Real Estate Management (Österreichische Gesellschaft für Nachhaltige Immobilienwirtschaft; ÖGNI). How we ensure innovative solutions. The innovative solutions from Kapsch TrafficCom make valuable contributions to climate protection. They allow road users to reach their destinations quickly, efficiently and with low environmental impact. For example, environmental zones – a fully automated system from Kapsch TrafficCom – allow situational regulation of city traffic depending on traffic volume or particulate matter conditions. The road users are directly informed of the consequences of their driving behavior on the environment. 34 | The View Ahead How we guarantee quality. The processes of our quality management system are based on ÖNORM EN ISO 9001:2000 and satisfy even more stringent quality requirements. We have also implemented an integrated quality management system and general guidelines for environmental protection, general safety and workplace safety. Kapsch TrafficCom AG and its subsidiary Kapsch Components GmbH & Co KG are certified in environmental management according to ISO 14001. Additional certifications are in planning. How we combat corruption. As part of the corporate governance, all business units over which Kapsch TrafficCom AG has primary influence are analyzed with regard to their corruption risks and the employees of the first and second management levels are trained in anti-corruption policy and anti-corruption processes. The code of conduct also provides explicit instructions to guide the behavior of all employees. How we act with social responsibility. In accordance with our company values, we also accept social responsibility that extends beyond our direct scope of operation. For many years, we have supported social projects such as the Cliniclowns and the St. Anna Children’s Hospital. The regional subsidiaries of Kapsch TrafficCom are also committed to supporting local projects in their areas. Our commitment to transparency. During past years, effective structures and clear areas of responsibility have been established for the most important areas of activity. All such agendas are coordinated by a sustainability The View Ahead officer and reported to the executive board. Comprehensive documentation in the form of a sustainability report took place for the first time for the fiscal year 2010/11. An update is planned for the fiscal year 2012/13. The sustainability reporting of Kapsch TrafficCom is based on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative. The report also serves as a progress report for the United Nations Global Compact, which defines ten principles for protecting human rights and labor standards as well as environmental protection and fighting corruption. Since June 2009, Kapsch TrafficCom AG has been represented in the VÖNIX, an Austrian sustainability index that lists the shares of companies that are leaders in social and environmental responsibility. Focusing on the view ahead. Kapsch TrafficCom understands sustainability as a continuous process and has been working for years to systematize the associated agendas. This approach will be continued in the future. The next milestone will be the publication of the updated sustainability report for 2012/13, which is planned for later this year. The View Ahead | 35 Future. The future can only be influenced by those who actively work to shape it. This is why Kapsch has been working on the future of mobility for many years. We do this by continuously analyzing trends, evaluating new technologies and optimizing our existing portfolio. We are supported in the development of forward-looking products and solutions by the years of experience and creative drive of our employees.

Kapsch TrafficCom AG on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of 31 March 2013. 1 Economic climate 1.1 General economic situation Global economy In the reporting year 2012/13, the growth of the world economy was primarily shaped by the still unresolved debt crisis in Europe: As a consequence, the eurozone slipped into a recession, with a decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) of 0.6 %. However, growth-dampening effects on the global economy came not only from the eurozone: The strong fiscal consolidation – underway throughout the OECD – is estimated to have subtracted some 1 to 1.5 percentage points from OECD-wide growth in 2012. Taking this into account, the economy of the OECD area expanded by 1.4 % in 2012, compared to 1.8 % in 2011. Additionally, the traditional growth drivers of the global economy – the Emerging Markets – saw unexpectedly sharp slowdowns in their economic performance in the reporting year, which was due, in part, to weaker export growth as well as to the restrictive course of their economic policies in the years before. All in all, global economic growth slowed to 3.2 % in 2012 from 3.9 % in 2011. U.S.A. In the United States, GDP growth slowed markedly in the fourth quarter of 2012, as global uncertainty increased and restrictive government spending dampened economic activity. The economic dynamic weakened, with GDP falling to a year-on-year rate of 1.6 % in Q4 2012, compared to 2.6 % in Q3. For the reporting year as a whole, GDP increased by 2.2 %. Some impetus came from gross fixed-capital formation, which accelerated in the reporting year, while private consumption, traditionally one of the main drivers of the economy in the U.S.A., lost steam. Looking ahead, U.S. economic growth is expected to drop to approximately 2 % in 2013 and concerns remain, especially regarding the fiscal situation: Like the eurozone, the United States needs to restore fiscal sustainability. As the White House and Congress could not reach a compromise on the federal budget, “sequestration” came into force at the beginning of March 2013, with automatic expenditure cuts totaling 1.2 trillion U.S. dollars over the next ten years, which will have a dampening effect on U.S. economic development. Japan In Japan, the recovery of the economy stalled in the second half of 2012, after strong growth in the first six months supported by reconstruction spending in response to the earthquake in March 2011. In 2012 as a whole, the economy expanded by 1.6 %. As reconstruction expenditures wane further and planned tax hikes dampen private consumption, the OECD expects that GDP growth will slow to 0.7 % in 2013. Furthermore, Japan’s fiscal situation remains critical: The budget deficit reached a level of about 10 % of GDP in 2012, and government debt rose to around 214 % of total economic output. At the beginning of April 2013, the Bank of Japan announced a massive monetary-easing program which aims to double the monetary base by the end of 2014. The bank’s primary intention is to stimulate the economy which has been struggling with deflation for years and has grown only modestly in this time. 48 | Management Report Emerging Markets The reporting year witnessed a further slowdown in economic development in a number of emerging markets, although they regained some ground in the last quarter of the year 2012. Forward-looking indicators suggest that this growth momentum is spilling over into 2013. Given the substantial share of the world economy now accounted for by emerging economies, they will drive growth on a global level again. To take China, real GDP increased by 7.9 % in Q4 2012 compared with the corresponding period in 2011, and an estimated GDP growth rate of 8.2 % is expected for 2013, buoyed by the rise in domestic demand toward the end of 2012. Turning to India and Brazil, their economic performance remained subdued in 2012, with growth rates of 4.5 % (India) and 1 % (Brazil). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects growth in these two emerging markets to be back on track in 2013 with rates of 5.9 % and 3.5 %. The short-term outlook for the region “Emerging Markets and Developing Economies” indicates a rise in GDP of 5.5 % in 2013. Europe Just like in the previous year, the course of the European economy in 2012 was influenced primarily by the economic and sovereign-debt crisis. As a result of the persistently difficult situation in the Southern periphery, the aggregate GDP of the EU-27 decreased by 0.3 %. It is worth mentioning, though, that the core of the European Union was not spared the repercussions of the crisis either. France and Great Britain, for instance, saw their economies stagnate in 2012. Even the German growth engine started to sputter towards the end of the year. Experts believe this to be the bottom of the latest recession phase. Economic performance of the EU-27 is forecast to pick up in 2013, albeit only very slowly (+0.1 %). It is nonetheless essential that austerity measures continue to be implemented throughout Europe. As far as the eurozone is concerned, concerted efforts to fight the economic crisis in the Southern member states were once again at the top of the agenda. The situation in Greece proved particularly difficult, seeing as the economy of the country has been stuck in a downward spiral for five years. Meanwhile, Spain also made the headlines due to its struggling banking sector, as did Italy after the reformist government led by Mario Monti had been voted out of office. Both countries faced a deep recession in 2012, just like Portugal. The only PIIGS state that seems to have overcome its severe problems is Ireland: Two consecutive years of GDP growth indicate that the economic turnaround has succeeded, not least owing to the EU rescue package. At the same time, though, Cyprus caused a new wave of uncertainty on the financial markets. Overall, the economic prospects for the eurozone remain subdued. Having decreased by about 0.5 % in Q4 2012, aggregate Management Report GDP is not expected to expand in the first months of 2013 either. Only for the second half of the year do experts forecast a moderate recovery in the economy. The economic slowdown in the eurozone has also had repercussions for the states in Central and South Eastern Europe. Even though GDP growth in the region as a whole was more pronounced than in Western Europe, economic performance on a national level varied markedly in 2012. In Hungary, for instance, the on-going crisis led to a GDP decrease of 1.7 %. The Slovenian economy also contracted as a result of massive problems in its banking sector (-2 %), and the future 28th EU member Croatia struggled noticeably as well (-1.8 %). In contrast, comparatively robust growth rates were reported for Russia, Poland and the Baltic states. Looking ahead, experts predict that economic activity in the region will expand only slightly faster in 2013, as both export and domestic demand are to remain fairly weak. The year after that, however, is most likely to witness stronger growth again. Austria. In 2012, Austria saw a deceleration in economic performance: GDP growth decreased from 2.7 % in the previous year to 0.8 %. The second half of 2012, in particular, was marked by a loss of momentum due to weaker stimuli from abroad. Management Report | 49 The latest forecasts suggest, however, that the bottom was reached at the end of the year. With several leading indicators now looking up, the Austrian economy is set to return to a growth path in 2013, albeit a flat one. Experts predict a GDP increase of about 1 %, driven first and foremost by growing business confidence. Most notably, the manufacturing industry expects order intake to pick up again. 1.2 Development of the market for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) To allow for easier comparisons, the Kapsch TrafficCom Group makes use of the internationally prevailing terms for the intelligent transportation systems (ITS) market. These are systems in which information and communication technologies are employed to support and optimize road transportation, including infrastructure, vehicles, users and industry. Market segmentation. The study “Intelligent Transportation Systems – A global strategic business report” from Global Industry Analysts, October 2012, describes the ITS market as a diversifying market with widely differing application and product segments. The market comprises the following product segments: n Electronic toll collection (ETC) enables drivers to pay toll fees without stopping at toll stations. n Advanced traffic management systems (ATMS) monitor traffic, optimize signal timing and regulate the flow of traffic. n Other intelligent transportation systems (OTH ITS) comprise in particular: – Commercial vehicle operations (CVO) encompass systems for operating commercial vehicles in order to enhance freight carrier productivity and safety. – Public vehicle transportation management systems (PVTMS) facilitate management of both local and long-distance public transportation. – Advanced vehicle information systems (AVIS) transmit traffic-related vehicle information to travelers before or during the trip or provide navigation services. Market volume and growth. According to Global Industry Analysts (October 2012), the volume of the ITS market amounted to USD 14.2 billion in 2012 and is expected to continue growing. The largest product segment in 2012 was ATMS, accounting for almost 36 % (USD 5.2 billion). Based on a worldwide volume of about USD 3.5 billion, ETC had an ITS market share of about 25 %. The largest geographic region for ITS in 2012 was the U.S.A. at 40 % (ETC: 42 %), followed by Europe at 30 % (ETC: 27 %). The ITS market is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 8.7 % between 2009 and 2018 to reach USD 22.8 billion in 2018, of which ETC will account for USD 6.8 billion equaling a share of 30 % and thereby exhibiting the fastest growth of all product segments at an average annual rate of 11.8 %. Market situation and market drivers Funding for infrastructure projects. The worldwide increase in road traffic requires additional financing to construct new and maintain existing roads. Toll collection offers a constant source of income and thus helps governments to provide the necessary funding for infrastructure projects. Efficient toll collection systems, especially electronic ones, offer a significant, constant and sustainable source of additional funds for governments, public authorities and concessionaires that can be used for the expansion and maintenance of road infrastructure. The demand for the construction of new roads is largely generated by the worldwide increase in road traffic. Especially in Asia, an increased demand for electronic toll lanes is expected for the replacement and expansion of toll collection systems previously based on more traditional (manual) systems. Aside from general economic aspects, the worldwide increase in road traffic is probably the most important driver for the ITS market. According to analyses by the EU (European Union 2010, “Energy and Transport in Figures”), commercial traffic increased by 2.3 % per year and by 33.7 % in total between 1995 and 2008. Commercial road traffic increased by 2.9 % per year and by 45.7 % in total. While the recent economic crisis triggered a fall in the volume of goods transport, this has already been largely compensated for by the subsequent upswing. Despite political pressure, goods transports could not be shifted significantly from road to rail or ship. 50 | Management Report In 2005, the trans-European road network (TEN-V) had a total length of 84,700 km and comprised one-fourth of the primary street network but carried 40 % of the total commercial traffic. It is predicted that TEN-V will be expanded by 4,800 km per year up to 2020, of which 3,500 km will consist of existing roads. Major investments will be required in the new EU member states and along the corridor routes to these countries. In the white paper “European transport policy for 2010”, the European Union estimated that investments of EUR 600 billion will be required by 2020. The long-term forecasts for traffic growth remain high. In addition to the construction of new roads, the high financing requirements for the preservation of the road infrastructure are another factor driving the ITS market. The high funding requirements in the U.S.A. (Standard & Poor’s research estimates an annual demand of USD 92 billion for the preservation of highways and bridges and a further USD 125.6 billion for their improvement up to 2020) are leading to new business models and private concessionaire models. Reducing congestion and further environmental pollution caused by road traffic. Efforts to reduce environmental pollution due to road traffic have become a market driver for the introduction of toll collection systems. Such systems e ­ ncourage reduced or modified vehicle usage, thereby lowering emissions and pollution levels. Electronic toll collection systems, in ­particular for multi-lane free-flow traffic, have proven their ability to decrease environmental pollution and carbon dioxide ­emissions by reducing congestion at toll plazas without interfering with the traffic flow. In large conurbations and capital cities, in particular, there is a growing need for electronic systems to control and reduce traffic. Toll collection is largely perceived as an effective solution for reducing high levels of congestion, particularly in metropolitan areas, as mandatory payments for road usage encourage carpooling or the use of public transportation. Systems for city charging and enforcing low-emission environmental zones are deployed by cities to reduce traffic congestion and environmental pollution. Due to the politically sensitive nature of this topic, this portion of the business has developed more slowly than originally expected. Traffic safety devices to monitor compliance with traffic regulations are another field of ITS applications in cities. Examples include systems to monitor traffic violations at junctions (e.g. running red lights) as well as systems to detect speeding. The market potential of these applications is growing rapidly in cities as well as interurban areas. For municipal authorities, they often pave the way for larger and more extensive ITS solutions, such as city charging. Increasing traffic safety and security. Advanced traffic management systems lower accident rates while also helping increase the probability of surviving accidents. The addressees include governments and regional authorities as well as other organizations, such as concessionaires, that are engaged in developing transport policies utilizing ITS in order to ensure the availability and quality of traffic infrastructure in a way that improves safety, performance, security and environmental Management Report protection. Enhancing vehicle and fleet productivity. Vehicle-oriented intelligent transportation systems are aimed at in-car telematics such as remote diagnostics or advanced driver assistance systems. Their purpose is mainly to enhance vehicle productivity, particularly that of commercial vehicles (commercial vehicle operations), as well as traffic safety and security. This field includes systems for the real-time interaction between vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle; V2V) as well as between vehicles and infrastructure (vehicle-to-infrastructure; V2I), which Kapsch TrafficCom believes will increasingly be based on 5.9 GHz technology. Industry-oriented intelligent transportation systems are commercial applications designed to reduce the costs or maximize the revenue of vehicle fleet operators, including public transportation companies (public vehicle transportation management systems). Examples include systems for fleet management and for collecting information on the logistics of large-scale vehicle operators. Addressees are also insurance companies, who see pay-as-you-drive car insurance as a promising way to attract new customers by offering fair insurance rates and ITS-based value-added mobility services. Management Report | 51 Increased comfort expectations of travelers. User-oriented intelligent transportation systems are focused mainly on convenience and efficiency for travelers. The customer in the car receives information to aid in orientation, thereby increasing traffic safety. Example applications for advanced vehicle information systems include transmitting traffic-related vehicle information to travelers before or during the trip as well as navigation services. As a communication platform, the 5.9 GHz technology will enable a variety of future applications involving connected vehicles. Technology Depending on the requirements of the specific application, systems are introduced for toll collection which are based on microwave technology (dedicated short-range communication; DSRC), satellite navigation (global navigation satellite system; GNSS), or automatic number plate recognition (ANPR). While in Europe the standardized technology is based on 5.8 GHz according to the Comité Européen de Normalisation (CEN) standard, toll systems in North America are based on proprietary protocols in the 915 MHz band. It is expected that a new communication protocol standard based on 5.9 GHz will gradually replace the existing technology in the U.S.A. over the coming years. In addition to the toll application, the communication standard 5.9 GHz WAVE (Wireless Access in the Vehicular Environment) is intended for real-time vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, abbreviated as V2X, for applications that increase traffic safety as well as additional ITS solutions for traffic information, traffic management and entertainment. Convergence on the ITS market A common thread among all these forces driving the market is a convergence on the ITS market expected by Kapsch TrafficCom over the next five to ten years. The company is convinced that applications, platforms and technologies will become increasingly interconnected and converge over time. In the view of Kapsch TrafficCom, the future lies in “connected vehicles in cooperative systems”, which are V2X cooperative systems for real-time vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. 52 | Management Report 2 Economic situation of the group 2.1 Business development The revenues of Kapsch TrafficCom Group reached EUR 488.9 million in fiscal year 2012/13, down by 11.1 % compared to the previous fiscal year. 70.0 % of the revenues were achieved in the segment Services, System Extensions, Components Sales (SEC) that accounts for the recurring part of the business. The segment Road Solution Projects (RSP) that encompasses the project business showed significantly lower revenues (down by 26.2 %) than in the previous year as ongoing and new projects did not generate comparable revenues and also fall short of the volume of the Polish implementation project that was realized last fiscal year. In addition to the two large existing projects in South Africa and Belarus, which significantly impacted fiscal year 2012/13, the following additional projects were acquired: n On 30 July 2012, the U.S. subsidiary Kapsch TrafficCom IVHS was selected to design, build and integrate a “managed lane” system (MLS) for both the North Tarrant Express (NTE) and LBJ Express projects in Dallas and Tarrant Counties in North Texas. The project scope encompasses delivery of a toll collection system (TCS), an intelligent transportation system (ITS) and a network communication system (NCS), creating a fully integrated MLS. The agreement covers more than thirty miles of “managed lanes” – specifically used, administered and tolled lanes for structuring the traffic according to different requirements and demands – with 65 toll lanes and 33 toll zones. The total contract value for the implementation of the system amounts to approximately USD 79 million (about EUR 64 million). The first phase of the system should start operation in November 2013. n On 10 August 2012, Kapsch TrafficCom got the first, albeit small, order for the delivery of on-board units in the strategically important market of Brazil. Brazil is among the fastest growing markets in the ITS industry. n On 28 August 2012, Kapsch TrafficCom Australia Pty. Ltd. was contracted by Interlink Roads to supply a new electronic tolling system to support capacity enhancement upgrades to the M5 South West Motorway in Sydney. The total contract value for the implementation of the system is approximately AUD 10 million (about EUR 8.5 million). The new tolling system will comprise replacement of roadside equipment plus a new back office system that will incorporate enhanced image processing capability to provide higher levels of accuracy and automation on image based transactions. n On 11 March 2013, Kapsch TrafficCom was selected by the infrastructure development company HNTB and the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) to deliver a truck parking system at five sites along the I-94 corridor in Michigan. The Kapsch solution consists of a 5.9 GHz dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) in-vehicle unit and roadside equipment with customized application software that provide drivers with real-time truck parking availability information Management Report from MDOT facilities and private truck stops. This system is the first truck parking system to be deployed in North America utilizing 5.9 GHz – the chosen technology for the U.S. DOT connected vehicle safety pilot program. The system will be fully delivered by December 2013. The contract has a rather low volume but a high strategic significance for implementation of the strategy of Kapsch TrafficCom Group. Major changes and events at a corporate level during fiscal year 2012/13 include the following: n On 4 May 2012, the founding of Kapsch TrafficCom do Brazil, São Paulo, Brazil, took place. n On 6 July 2012, Kapsch TrafficCom PTE. LTD., Singapore, was founded. n On 31 July 2012, Kapsch TrafficCom acquired an interest of 33 % in SIMEX, Integración de Sistemas, S.A.P.I. de C.V., Mexico, during an issue of new shares. n On 9 November 2012, Kapsch TrafficCom Russia, Moscow, Russia, sold its share of 33 % in the joint venture LLC United Toll Systems, Moscow, Russia. n On 29 March 2013, Kapsch TrafficCom acquired an interest of 20 % in GLONASS tolling systems OOO, Moscow, Russia. Management Report | 53 2.2 Earnings situation The revenues of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group reached EUR 488.9 million in fiscal year 2012/13, down by 11.1 % compared to the previous fiscal year (EUR 549.9 million). The segment Services, System Extensions, Components Sales (SEC) exhibited a growth in revenue, while the segment Road Solution Projects (RSP) showed significantly lower revenues than in the same period of the previous year. The operating result (EBIT) of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group was at EUR 15.3 million and therefore 63.9 % lower than the previous year (EUR 42.2 million). The EBIT margin amounted to 3.1 % (previous year: 7.7 %). Revenues and operating result (EBIT) by segment In the segment Road Solution Projects (RSP), revenues were reduced by 44.2 % to EUR 128.3 million (previous year: EUR 229.9 million). The most significant factor for the decline in a year-on-year comparison was the completion of the implementation of the nationwide electronic truck toll collection system in Poland during the previous year. The project for the implementation of an electronic toll collection system in the South African province of Gauteng made no comparable contribution since it is already in the finalization phase and the originally expected revenues cannot be earned in full until the commissioning takes place. The new projects in Belarus, France, Australia and the U.S.A. as well as the extensions in Poland were also unable to compensate for this fall in revenue during fiscal year 2012/13. The EBIT of the segment RSP was at EUR -51.7 million (previous year: EUR 4.1 million). As a result of the decreased revenues in comparison with the previous year, it was not possible to cover the regular costs associated with this segment, the continued expenditures for entry into new markets such as the U.S.A., Russia, Hungary, Slovenia and Singapore as well as the upfront costs for ongoing and upcoming tenders. Moreover, the project for the implementation of an electronic toll collection system in the South African province of Gauteng additionally weighed down the results. The reasons for this lie in the delay of the commissioning as a result of political discussions, the lower revenues than initially expected prior to the commissioning and additionally incurred costs and standby costs. In the segment Services, System Extensions and Components Sales (SEC), revenues increased by 11.1 % to EUR 342.3 million (previous year: EUR 308.1 million). The operation project in Poland, which began in July 2011 and was therefore only relevant for nine months of the previous year, supplied a significant revenue contribution. The technical and commercial operation of the nationwide system in the Czech Republic and the technical operation including maintenance of the nationwide systems in Austria and Switzerland continued to provide stable revenue contributions. In contrast, the delayed start of the project in the South African province of Gauteng resulted on the one hand in revenues for the upkeep of the operational readiness that are lower compared to the ordinary revenues and on the other hand this led to the absence of the expected deliveries of on-board units. The number of on-board units sold amounted to 9.3 million units (previous year: 11.2 million units). The lower volumes were associated with the delayed commissioning of the project in Gauteng, South Africa, and the initial deliveries for the nationwide electronic toll collection system in Poland that took place in the previous year. The increased units sold in North America had a positive effect. The EBIT of the segment SEC was at EUR 66.1 million (previous year: EUR 37.3 million), the EBIT margin was therefore at 19.3 % (previous year: 12.1 %). The main factors for the increase in a year-on-year comparison were the stable EBIT contributions from the technical and commercial operation of the nationwide truck toll collection system in the Czech Republic, the technical operation, including maintenance, of the nationwide truck toll collection system in Austria and the first full year of earnings from the technical and commercial operation project in Poland. The competitive pricing within the framework of the contract extension with the E-ZPass Group, which has now led to globally typical margins in the U.S.A. as well, plus the lower contribution for the upkeep of the operational readiness and the absence of the profit contribution connected with the lack of on-board unit deliveries for the system operation in Gauteng, South Africa, burdened the EBIT of the segment. 54 | Management Report In the segment Others (OTH), revenues rose by 52.4 % to EUR 18.3 million (previous year: EUR 12.0 million). This increase resulted largely from the production and deliveries for the GSM-R project of Kapsch CarrierCom. The segment OTH contributed 3.7 % to total revenues in fiscal year 2012/13 (previous year: 2.2 %). The EBIT of the segment OTH was at EUR 0.9 million (previous year: EUR 0.8 million), the EBIT margin was therefore at 5.1 % (previous year: 6.5 %).

The revenue decrease of EUR 52.5 million (-15.4 %) can be attributed largely to the completion of the implementation of the nationwide electronic truck toll collection system in Poland during the previous year. The ongoing implementation project in Belarus could not offset this. Revenues in the rest of the world region decreased by EUR 24.9 million (-22.2 %). The major factor here was the absence of deliveries of on-board units for the project in South Africa compared to the previous year. In the American region, revenues increased by EUR 11.2 million (17.6 %), mainly due to the project award for the implementation of a “managed lane” system in Texas. Revenues in Austria rose by EUR 5.3 million (16.1 %) mainly attributable to the increase in the segment OTH.

Compared to the previous year, the share of costs for materials and other production services in relation to revenues increased slightly from 52.2 % to 52.7 %. The staff costs increased by EUR 9.8 million to EUR 131.6 million (previous year: EUR 121.7 million). Compared to the previous year, the average number of employees grew by 211 persons from 2,585 to 2,796. The staff cost ratio (staff costs in relation to total revenues) rose from 22.1 % to 26.9 %. This is due on the one hand to the staff requirements connected with the technical and commercial operation projects in Poland, the setup of the subsidiary in Belarus, the implementation of the project in Texas and the standby requirements in the South African project in Gauteng. On the other hand, it also results from the consistent implementation of the growth strategy that was decided last fiscal year and which required anticipative personnel developments. Management Report | 55 Amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment decreased by EUR 0.7 million to EUR 17.7 million (previous year: EUR 18.4 million), resulting primarily from the decreased scheduled amortization of intangible assets from company acquisitions. Other operating expenses increased by EUR 4.8 million to EUR 87.8 million (previous year: EUR 83.0 million). This increase occurred primarily in exchange rate losses that were largely realized in rental expenses and IT expenses. In contrast, legal and consulting fees as well as marketing and advertising expenses decreased. The financial result improved by EUR 7.2 million to EUR 1.3 million (previous year: EUR -5.9 million). The increase in finance income can be attributed primarily to the sale of the minority shares in the joint venture LLC “United Toll Systems”, Russia, as well as the sale of securities. The exchange rate gains, the majority of which were not yet realized, lay below those of the previous year. The finance costs stayed nearly on the same level as previous year. Within the exchange rate losses, the realized losses were reduced whereas the unrealized ones increased slightly. The result from joint ventures and associates was EUR 0.3 million (previous year: EUR 0.0 million) and resulted mainly from the investment in SIMEX, Mexico. The profit before income taxes decreased by EUR 19.4 million to EUR 16.9 million (previous year: EUR 36.3 million). Lower income taxes and higher finance income were able to partly compensate for the lower operating result (EBIT). The profit for the period decreased by EUR 10.7 million to EUR 16.7 million (previous year: EUR 27.5 million), the earnings per share were at EUR 0.74 (previous year: EUR 1.62). 2.3 Assets and liabilities The balance sheet total increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 567.2 million as of 31 March 2013 (31 March 2012: EUR 557.7 million). The total equity decreased by EUR 15.6 million to EUR 240.7 million (31 March 2012: EUR 256.2 million). The equity ratio of Kapsch TrafficCom Group decreased slightly from 45.9 % on 31 March 2012 to 42.4 % on 31 March 2013. In total assets, the most significant changes involved the current assets which rose from EUR 389.6 million in the previous year to EUR 403.1 million at the balance sheet date. Thanks to the increase of cash and cash equivalents as well as inventories, it was possible to compensate for the decrease of trade receivables and other current assets. Non-current assets decreased by EUR 4.0 million to EUR 164.1 million (31 March 2012: EUR 168.1 million). Other financial assets and investments went down from EUR 51.2 million to EUR 38.1 million mainly due to the development of the shares in the Norwegian Q-Free ASA. On the liabilities side, the non-current liabilities rose by EUR 24.1 million to EUR 137.9 million (31 March 2012: EUR 113.8 million) due to the financing of the implementation of the nationwide electronic truck toll collection system in Belarus. The current liabilities increased by EUR 1.1 million to EUR 188.7 million (31 March 2012: EUR 187.6 million). The major change within this position occurred in the current financial liabilities that decreased from EUR 53.2 million to EUR 19.7 million mainly due to the return of the credit for the Polish project. However, this was more than compensated for by the rise in trade payables, current provisions and current tax payables. 56 | Management Report In total, these balance sheet changes led to a clear improvement in the following figures: n The free cash flow increased from EUR -49.7 million in the previous year to EUR 48.3 million in fiscal year 2012/13. n The net debt significantly decreased from EUR -74.4 million in the previous year to EUR -40.5 million on 31 March 2013 despite the payable at term corporate bond amounting to EUR 75.0 million and the utilization of the financial liability for the nationwide electronic truck toll collection system in Belarus. 2.4 Financial position Net cash flow from operating activities was at EUR 67.2 million (previous year: EUR -37.8 million). This was mainly attributable to the decrease in trade receivables and other current assets, the increase in trade payables and other current payables and the increase in current provisions, whereas the lower operating result (EBIT) and the increase in inventories weighed down the net cash flow from operating activities. The net cash flow from investing activities in fiscal year 2012/13 was at EUR -10.0 million (previous year: EUR -16.7 million) and was largely determined by the expansion of production facilities, ongoing replacement investments and the acquisition of a share in SIMEX, Mexico. This was compensated partly by the sale of the minority shares in the joint venture LLC “United Toll Systems”, Russia, as well as the sale of securities and proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The net cash flow from financing activities was -22.5 million (previous year: EUR 57.6 million), and it was negative due to the drawdown of current financial liabilities mainly from project financing as well as the payment of dividends totaling EUR 19.1 million. This could not be set off by the increase in non-current financial liabilities. The net cash flow from financing activities had a positive effect on the net debt. Cash and cash equivalents increased to EUR 79.0 million as of 31 March 2013 (31 March 2012: EUR 44.9 million). Management Report Management Report | 57 2.5 Non-financial performance indicators Reliability and accuracy of installed systems. The toll transaction rate is a figure for assessing the accuracy and reliability of a toll collection system. It indicates the number of successful transactions in relation to all potential toll transactions of vehicles equipped with a functioning on-board unit. A high toll transaction rate translates to high toll income. The average toll transaction rate of the existing truck toll collection system in Austria was at approximately 99.8 % in 2012, again reaching the high level of 2011. During the same period, the average transaction rate of the nationwide electronic toll collection system in the Czech Republic was approximately 99.6 %, up by 0.1 % from 99.5 % in the previous year. The calculation of the average transaction rate is based on methods agreed upon with the respective customer, meaning that comparisons between the average transaction rates achieved in different projects are only possible on a limited basis. Staff. The average number of employees in the Kapsch TrafficCom Group in fiscal year 2012/13 was 2,796, which is 8.2 % higher than the average of 2,585 in fiscal year 2011/12. As of 31 March 2013, the group had a workforce of 3,013 (2,821 salaried and 192 non-salaried employees), of which more than half were located outside of Europe (roughly 1,200 employees in South Africa). Training and education. Kapsch TrafficCom places great importance on the continued training and education of its employees. This involves not only promoting professional education but also providing seminars and workshops for developing personal and teamwork skills. In addition, training sessions tailored to the particular needs of employees are offered within the framework of the Kapsch Academy. A job rotation program promotes the international exchange of staff between the various locations, and select employees are prepared for their future tasks in a management trainee program. Pension fund. Kapsch TrafficCom makes contributions to an external pension fund for employees of group companies in Austria under a defined contribution scheme. The amounts of the payments are based on the individual employee’s income and the operating profit margin of the company. Profit participation. Kapsch TrafficCom is aware of the employees’ contribution to its success and acknowledges this through a profit participation plan. The Kapsch TrafficCom Group rewards the commitment of its employees by distributing to them up to 5 % of the group profit before income taxes. Country-specific upper limits have been established to ensure that the distribution reflects local purchasing power. Every employee receives a share, which is independent of the person’s salary or wage and limited to EUR 1,500 per employee. Advancement of women. Kapsch TrafficCom is committed to promoting the advancement of women in the workplace. Women are supported through a flexible working hours scheme that is designed to help combine professional and private life. In addition, Kapsch TrafficCom cooperates with schools, universities and colleges in order to increase the proportion of women employed, among other goals. The company also promotes women in the workforce through participation in specific programs such as “FIT Frauen in die Technik” or “FemTech”. A committee for non-discrimination has been established within the Kapsch TrafficCom Group. Quality. Kapsch TrafficCom AG defines its processes in an integrated management system for health and safety, security, environment and quality (HSSEQ). Valid certifications are held for quality management pursuant to ISO 9001 (since 2002), for occupational health and safety pursuant to OHSAS 18001 and for environmental management pursuant to ISO 14001 (since 2005). Kapsch TrafficCom has implemented the necessary measures in its internal processes and monitors them continuously. The certificate pursuant to ISO 27001 ensures the necessary information security management. The certificate pursuant to ISO 20000 for service management in connection with technical operations guarantees a high service quality in this area. Environment. In the future, the group will strive to fulfill its responsibilities toward environmental protection even more extensively, particularly through the efficient and responsible use of natural resources. 58 | Management Report Corporate social responsibility Kapsch TrafficCom understands the challenge of long-term and responsible business activities and is dedicated to sustainability on an economic, environmental and social level. Regularly published sustainability reports will demonstrate the progress on a group level and the continuing establishment of predefined objectives. Living up to its socio-political responsibility, the entire Kapsch Group – organized by Kapsch AG – further supports a number of contemporary art and cultural institutions and projects and even initiates its own projects in this field. Extensive social measures as well as select educational initiatives complement this approach, which the company considers to be an obligation both inside and outside the group. Music. A major component of this commitment consists of sponsoring activities related to the Vienna Concert Hall (Wiener Konzerthaus), a cultural institution with an excellent reputation even far beyond Austria’s borders. The Kapsch Group has been the main sponsor of the Vienna Concert Hall since 1992. The “Wien Modern” festival – one of the world’s best known festivals of contemporary music – has been supported by Kapsch since its launch in 1989. Visual arts. Promoting lesser-known artists is of particular concern to the Kapsch Group. In particular, young Austrian and international artists are assisted by sponsorship campaigns. One example is the photo calendar that the Kapsch Group has supported since 1994. The calendar is presented annually in late autumn at a private exhibition. Educational institutions. As a company that is driven by technology and innovation, Kapsch TrafficCom is constantly interested in establishing contacts as early as possible with the best engineering talent. Since 2005, the Kapsch Group has supported the work of INiTS Universitäres Gründerservice Wien GmbH, which aims to support and guide young entrepreneurs in the implementation of ideas relating to well defined business concepts. Social activities. Kapsch TrafficCom takes pride in supporting select social projects at home and abroad. One example of the numerous projects is ICEP, the Institute for Cooperation in Development Projects, whose activities help improve the circumstances of people in developing countries. By directly promoting migration and integration, Kapsch TrafficCom contributes to social justice, the positive development of society and long-term safety and security. Management Report Management Report | 59 2.6 Risk management Risk management has been positioned as a separate function within the finance department of Kapsch TrafficCom AG, focusing on project risk management and enterprise risk management (ERM). Project risk management analyzes beginning in the bid phase of customer projects in institutionalized processes all relevant opportunities and risks pertaining to the group’s projects, thereby providing the basis for the timely planning and implementation of risk-mitigating activities. The enterprise risk management (ERM) analyzes not only the risks of key customer projects but also strategic, technological, organizational, financial, legal and IT risks, and reports them to the executive board and the audit committee of the supervisory board on a semi-annual basis. The goal of the ERM approach is early identification, analysis and control of all risks which might influence strategic and operational objectives of the company. The primary objective in this context is not to avoid risks but to deal with risks in a controlled and deliberate manner and to recognize and realize opportunities as they arise over time in order to make a valuable contribution to the management of the company. The material risks faced by the Kapsch TrafficCom Group and the respective risk management measures are briefly explained below. Industry-specific risks Volatility of new orders. A major portion of the revenues of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group is generated in the segment Road Solution Projects (RSP). In this segment, the group regularly participates in tenders for the implementation and operation of large electronic toll collection systems as well as for the collection of tolls on specific road sections. On the one hand, there is a risk that tenders in which the group participates or plans to participate could be delayed or withdrawn, for instance as a result of political changes, appeals or legal actions by unsuccessful bidders. On the other hand, a risk exists that Kapsch TrafficCom may not win its bids for new projects due to technological, financial, formal or other reasons. Recurring revenues from the technical and commercial operation of systems also depend on the successful participation in tenders for systems. In the past, the revenues of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group have been heavily influenced by the realization of implementation projects in the given fiscal year. In particular, significantly higher revenues were recorded in 2003 (implementation of a nationwide electronic truck toll collection system in Austria), 2006/07 (implementation of a nationwide electronic truck toll collection system in the Czech Republic) and 2010/11 (implementation of an electronic toll collection system in the South African province of Gauteng). In fiscal year 2011/12, sizeable revenues were generated from the implementation of a nationwide electronic truck toll collection system in Poland and in fiscal year 2012/13 from the implementation of a nationwide electronic truck toll collection system in Belarus. The strategy of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group is aimed, among other things, at reducing this volatility of revenues through increased geographic diversification and increased diversification of the customer base and product portfolio as well as sustained growth in the share of technical and commercial system operation in total revenues in the interest of strengthening the segment Services, System Extensions, Components Sales (SEC). Risks of project execution. In connection with the installation of systems, Kapsch TrafficCom Group is usually contractually obligated to provide performance guarantees. Since electronic toll collection systems and other intelligent transportation systems are frequently sophisticated and technologically complex systems that must be implemented within a short timeframe, system and product defects or missed deadlines may occur due to the limited time available. Unexpected project modifications, lack of qualified personnel, quality defects, unexpected technical problems as well as performance problems 60 | Management Report of suppliers or consortium members may also have a negative impact on project schedules. The failure to meet guaranteed performance levels or deadlines in some cases results in penalties and/or compensation for damages, sometimes also compensation for lost toll revenues. Significant deadline overruns also frequently trigger contractual clauses that enable clients to terminate contracts prematurely. A significant delay in a project, failure to achieve guaranteed performance levels or failure to implement a project in time would also reduce the chances of success in future tenders for systems. There is also the risk that Kapsch TrafficCom Group cannot execute projects in line within the set cost budgets. Kapsch TrafficCom Group employs risk management methods and project risk management procedures based on IPMA (International Project Management Association) standards in order to guard against risks associated with projects. Long-term contracts with public authorities. In many cases, the system contracts are awarded by public agencies. Framework agreements and service contracts in connection with toll collection projects may include terms and conditions that are not negotiable in a tender process and that may be disadvantageous to the Kapsch TrafficCom Group. Some long-term contracts include challenging requirements with regard to the performance of the implemented systems, components and processes. These requirements can, if they are not achieved, result in significant penalties, damages or even contract termination. On the other hand, some contracts include substantial bonus payments for over-fulfillment of performance requirements. In the case of longterm contracts, the margins earned can also differ from the original estimates due to changes in costs. Liabilities arising from contracts concluded by the Kapsch TrafficCom Group may include liabilities regarding customers’ loss of profit, product liabilities and other liabilities. While the group aims to include appropriate limitations to its liability in contracts, it is still impossible to guarantee that all contracts contain sufficient limitations to the group’s liability or that these limitations can be enforced under applicable law. Strategic risks Capacity for innovation. The strong market position of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group is, to a large extent, based on its ability to develop state-of-the-art, efficient and reliable systems, components and products. Kapsch TrafficCom is committed to a permanent and integrated innovation process. In order to maintain its already strong position in technology, the Kapsch TrafficCom Group invests a considerable portion of its revenues in research and development activities. However, if the group does not succeed in developing new systems, components and products, this can be detrimental to its competitive position. Since its capacity for innovation is based largely on technology, internal know-how and intellectual property, the global increase in product piracy and reverse engineering may have negative effects on the group. In addition, any failures in Management Report protecting these technologies may have a negative impact on the group’s competitive position. Moreover, it is possible that systems, components, products or services could infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. The Kapsch TrafficCom Group places great importance on the protection of technologies and the company’s internal know-how, e.g. through patents and non-disclosure agreements with other parties. Acquisition and integration of companies as a part of the group’s growth. One of the strategic objectives of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group is to grow internationally both by organic means and through select acquisitions and joint ventures. In the implementation of this strategy, the group has acquired and integrated companies around the world. However, a number of challenges remain in connection with this growth strategy in order to realize the desired synergies and objectives. Management Report | 61 Country risk. The strong expansion of business activities in Eastern Europe and non-European countries has exposed the Kapsch TrafficCom Group to heightened political risks. Significant and unforeseeable political changes can exert a major influence on the ability to implement or operate ITS projects in these countries and can also affect the availability and accessibility of funds. There may also be interference with the property rights of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group or complications regarding business practices and activities. Financial risks Foreign exchange risk. The Kapsch TrafficCom Group maintains branches, offices and subsidiaries in a number of countries outside the eurozone. A considerable portion of revenues and costs are denominated in the currencies of the respective foreign companies rather than in euros. Although the group aims to hedge the net currency position of the individual contracts as necessary, currency fluctuations may result in exchange rate losses that may influence the consolidated financial statements (transaction risk). In addition, risks arise from the conversion of the separate financial statements of international companies into the group currency, the euro (translation risk). Fluctuations in exchange rates may also result in a change in the competitive position of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group. Interest rate risk. Within the framework of project financing, the group regularly agrees to variable interest rates that are tied to market interest rates (Euribor, Pribor etc.). This exposes the Kapsch TrafficCom Group to interest rate risks. The group utilizes appropriate financial instruments to hedge against interest rate risks when these risks are significant. Liquidity risk. Sufficient financial resources must be available to ensure that the Kapsch TrafficCom Group can meet its payment liabilities at any time. Medium and long-term financing must be available in order to carry out large-scale projects (such as implementing a nationwide toll collection system under delayed payment terms from the client) and for acquiring other companies. Additionally, implementing large-scale projects often requires the provision of significant bank guarantees to secure bid obligations (bid bonds) or to secure possible warranty claims (performance bonds). In financing agreements, the Kapsch TrafficCom Group is subject to the customary restrictions in terms of its business policy, e.g. when drawing additional loans, using assets as collateral or providing guarantees for third parties. The availability of financing and bank guarantees depends on market conditions as well as the net assets and financial position of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group and the results of operations. A lack of liquid assets (even if the group is otherwise solvent), of financing or of bank guarantees can have an extremely adverse impact on the net assets and financial position of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group and the results of operations. Liquidity risk is managed by ongoing, company-wide financial and cash planning. Potential liquidity shortages can thus be identified and mitigated. Credit risk. The Kapsch TrafficCom Group is exposed to the risk of non-payment by customers. The credit ratings of new and existing customers are checked on a regular basis. Many of the key customers of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group are public authorities, especially in connection with implementing and/or operating nationwide or regional toll collection systems. There is also a risk that the counterparties (including financial institutions assumed to have good credit ratings) of both original and derivative financial instruments cannot meet their payment obligations when due. A payment default or the recognition of impairment charges to receivables can be extremely detrimental to the net assets and financial position of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group and the results of operations. 62 | Management Report Personnel risks The success of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group depends heavily on key personnel with many years of experience in the industry. Moreover, the group’s ability to recruit qualified staff, integrate them into the company and retain them over the long-term is crucial. The loss of key personnel and difficulties in the recruitment of personnel may adversely affect the success of the group. Kapsch TrafficCom Group has implemented a number of measures to counteract personnel risks, such as incentive schemes and employee development opportunities. Legal risks A variety of regulations and legal requirements must be observed in connection with participating in public tenders, implementing infrastructure for ITS solutions (such as toll stations) and the operation of toll collection systems. Identifying and adhering to applicable legal regulations and requirements can result in considerable administrative and technical expense. The failure to meet regulations or official requirements can lead to severe penalties and can also reduce the possibility of (successfully) taking part in tenders or continuing with the given business activity. With the expansion into new regions and new ITS business areas, the risk of patent infringement or the violation of property rights increases. Kapsch TrafficCom has implemented active intellectual property (IP) management as a separate function. In order to avoid legal actions and court proceedings, the Kapsch TrafficCom Group monitors potential intellectual property rights infringements continuously as well as prior to entry into new markets or regions. IT risks As a technology group, the Kapsch TrafficCom Group is exposed to typical IT risks relating to security, confidentiality and the availability of data. For this reason, Kapsch TrafficCom AG has implemented an IT risk management system designed according to the corporate risk and IT security application method (CRISAM) and has been certified pursuant to ISO 27001 (information security management). The Kapsch TrafficCom Group is also certified according to ISO 20000 “IT service management” (similar to ITIL) for the operation of toll collection systems. Opportunities The ERM approach of Kapsch TrafficCom AG is not only concerned with risks; it also includes the periodic identification, assessment and management of opportunities. Significant opportunities for the Kapsch TrafficCom Group result from Management Report increased financing needs for infrastructure projects, relief for public budgets, global traffic growth, legislation to reduce the environmental impact of transportation, enhanced vehicle and fleet operations productivity and the increasing comfort and convenience expectations of travelers. In addition, many market opportunities arise from the geographic diversification as well as the increasing diversification of the customer base and product portfolio. Summary assessment of the risk situation From the current perspective, no risks have been identified that could endanger the continued operations of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group. Increasing geographic expansion, the diversification of the product and solution portfolio (strengthening of the ITS business) and an increased share of recurring revenues (further growth in the segment Services, System Extensions, Components Sales) are planned to further reduce the concentration of risks in the future. Management Report | 63 2.7 Internal Control System (ICS) in regard to the finance process Kapsch TrafficCom AG began analyzing and documenting its existing internal processes for financial reporting on an ongoing basis in fiscal year 2009/10. The results obtained so far have been presented at the quarterly meetings of the audit committee for assessment and discussion. The internal audit department ensures by audits of the subsidiaries of Kapsch TrafficCom AG that a reliable and functioning control system is implemented. The Group IFRS Accounting Manual represents the cornerstone for financial accounting and reporting throughout the whole Kapsch Group. The manual is published and regularly updated by the Kapsch Group and contains the essential financial and reporting procedures based on the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Groupwide guidelines, work instructions and process descriptions represent another important pillar of the internal control system. The central elements of the ICS process include regular verification of compliance with the principle of dual control and the segregation of duties as well as defined actions for monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of operating activities, the reliability of financial reporting and the compliance with relevant legal regulations. The ICS guidelines of Kapsch TrafficCom AG follow the basic structure of the internationally recognized standards for internal control systems (COSO – Internal Control Framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission). The accounting for all group transactions is handled by a variety of software solutions. In a number of countries, the accounting has been outsourced to locally-based tax accountants due to the size of the subsidiaries. Companies submit reporting packages to the head office on a quarterly basis which contain all accounting data pertaining to the statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet and cash flow statement. The data is then transferred into the central consolidation system (Hyperion Financial Management). This financial information is verified on a groupwide basis by the central Kapsch TrafficCom controlling department and subsequently forms the basis for the quarterly reports issued by the Kapsch TrafficCom Group in accordance with IFRS. The supervisory board is kept informed of business developments by the executive board during regular meetings by way of consolidated presentations consisting of segment reporting, earnings development analyses with comparisons of current figures to figures from the budget and the previous period, forecasts, group financial statements and developments in the number of employees and order inflow as well as select financial figures. In keeping with the decentralized structure of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group, local management is responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the internal control system. The managing directors of the individual subsidiaries are responsible for establishing and designing internal control and risk management processes that meet the needs of the given company in view of accounting procedures, as well as for ensuring compliance with the groupwide rules and guidelines in this respect. In order to assist the local management of the subsidiaries, the function of an ICS manager was established within the finance department of Kapsch TrafficCom AG. The duty of this function is to standardize and continously improve the ICS within the Kapsch TafficCom Group, to monitor the compliance and effectiveness of the controls and the improvement of found weaknesses and to report periodically to the audit committee of the supervisory board. 64 | Management Report 2.8 Research and development The Kapsch TrafficCom Group has an international network of research and development centers in Vienna and Klagenfurt (Austria), Jönköping (Sweden), Bologna (Italy), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Toronto (Canada), Kingston (U.S.A.) and Capetown (South Africa). As of 31 March 2013, the Kapsch TrafficCom Group employed more than 500 (previous year: more than 400) engineers in its research and development activities. Research and development (R&D) have high priority for the Kapsch TrafficCom Group in pursuing its strategic goals. The knowledge of entirely new technologies based on national and international standards and the ability to implement these form the foundation for successful business developments and also enable the entry into new markets. The current focus lies on the regions of North and South America, Russia, Australia and South-East Asia. In the last fiscal year, the main focus of R&D was on the optimization and use of a new high-performance roadside infrastructure platform that integrates all major sensor systems into a single, common software platform. The aim was to use this platform in all international customer projects, to generate a high reusability of its basic components and ensure a low maintenance effort. This platform was already delivered to Portugal, the United States, Belarus and South Africa. Another focus was on the continuous reusability and quality of centralized components, which were used for the first time in this form in Belarus. Major R&D activities included the prototyping of future ITS solutions. Worth mentioning is the participation in standardization activities for the European ITS-G5 and the U.S. WAVE technology regarding V2X communication (vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicleto-infrastructure). Furthermore, pilot and demonstration projects were successfully carried out in the telematics test field and at the ITS world congress 2012 in Vienna in addition to the first 5.9 GHz commercial vehicle system pilot in den U.S.A. and a 5.9 GHz parking and electronic toll collection pilot in Singapore. The new developed ITS vehicle platform enables vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure-communication that delivers static and dynamic vehicle data such as size, weight, type of use, speed, direction and GPS coordinates. The research in the field of vehicle registration and vehicle classification led to the development of new video and sensor technologies with outstanding performance. The main initiatives in the component business involved developing less expensive, energy-saving and reduced-size generations of on-board units based on DSRC, GNSS and 5.9 GHz technology. Management Report Important organizational initiatives to reduce the costs and delivery times included further process changes, product and quality improvements on the subsystems in all R&D fields as well as the implementation of integrated development environments to cover the entire product life cycle (application life cycle management). Successful R&D efforts are the foundation for sustained improvements in existing products and solutions as well as the continuous reduction of production, installation, operating and maintenance costs, all of which are essential for maintaining a technological and competitive advantage. Research costs are recognized as expenses. The same applies to development costs, unless the IFRS criteria for classification as intangible assets are met. Since the statement of comprehensive income is structured by expense type, the research and development costs are reported under various income statement items, in particular under the cost of materials and other production services, staff costs and other operating expenses. In fiscal year 2012/13, the Kapsch TrafficCom Group invested approximately EUR 59.2 million in research and development (previous year: EUR 53.3 million), representing approximately 12 % (previous year: approximately 10 %) of total revenues.

In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. Consolidated Financial Statements | 73 Accounting policies. The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below: 1 Basis of preparation Pursuant to Section 245a Austrian Commercial Code (UGB), the consolidated financial statements as of 31 March 2013 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as well as the Interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) as adopted by the European Union (EU). The consolidated financial statements as of 31 March 2013 are prepared under the historical cost convention, with the exception of availablefor-sale securities and derivative financial instruments, which are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions which influence the amount and presentation of assets and liabilities reported at the balance sheet date and income and expenses recorded during the reporting period. Although these estimates are made by the management board to the best of their knowledge and are based on current transactions, actual figures may differ from these estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity as well as areas where assumptions and estimates are material to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 24. For ease of presentation, amounts have been rounded and, unless indicated otherwise, are presented in thousand euros (TEUR). However, calculations are done using exact amounts, including the digits not shown, which may lead to rounding differences. a) New and amended standards and interpretations that have been adopted by the EU and applied for the first time in the fiscal year 2012/13 There are no new or amended standards and interpretations that are effective for the first time for the fiscal year 2012/13 that would be expected to have a material impact on the group. b) Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective and that have not been early adopted by the group IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’, was amended in June 2011. The impact on the group will be as follows: to eliminate the corridor approach currently applied by the group and recognize all actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income as they occur; to immediately recognize all past-service costs; and to replace interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability (asset). In accordance with IAS 19R, entities have to apply this standard to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The group will apply IAS 19R in the next fiscal year 2013/14. Had the group applied IAS 19R already in fiscal year 2012/13, the operating result would have been increased by TEUR 139 and the total comprehensive income for the period would have been reduced by TEUR 3,979. The provisions at the balance sheet date as of 31 March 2013 would have been higher by TEUR 5,313. IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009, October 2010 and December 2011. It replaces the parts of IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured at fair value and those measured at amortized cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification depends on the entity´s business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. 74 | Consolidated Financial Statements the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity´s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the statement of comprehensive income, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The group will adopt IFRS 9 no later than the accounting period starting on 1 April 2015. Furthermore, the group will analyze the additional phase of IFRS 9 as soon as it is adopted by the IASB. IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’, builds on existing principles and introduces a single consolidation model for all entities; this model focuses on the subsidiary’s control by the parent company. Furthermore, the standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess. The group will apply IFRS 10 no later than the accounting period beginning on 1 April 2014. At present, the group does not expect IFRS 10 to have significant impacts on the assets and liabilities, the financial position and operating results of the group as well as on the group’s presentation. IFRS 11, ‘Joint Arrangements’, changes the definition of joint ventures. In accordance with IFRS 11, a joint arrangement is defined as an agreement which gives two or more parties joint control of this arrangement. Joint control means the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement and exists only when decisions about the relevant activities that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Each party to the joint arrangement has to account for its rights and obligations from a joint arrangement. The standard focuses on the sharing of the rights and obligations of the joint arrangement rather than on its legal form. According to IFRS 11 there are only two types of joint agreements: (i) joint operations and (ii) joint ventures. The previously applicable proportionate consolidation method will no longer be permitted for joint ventures. The parties to a joint venture have to account for the joint venture by using the equity method. IFRS 11 was adopted by European Commission Regulation dated 11 December 2012 and has to be applied for the first time retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. The group will apply IFRS 11 in the fiscal year beginning on 1 April 2014. At present, the group does not expect IFRS 11 to have significant impacts on the assets and liabilities, the financial position and operating results of the group as well as on the group’s presentation. IFRS 12, ‘Disclosure of Interests in other Entities’, summarizes the revised disclosures with regard to IAS 27 and IFRS 10, IAS 31 and IFRS 11 and IAS 28 in one standard. The group will apply IFRS 12 in the accounting period beginning on 1 April 2014. At present, the group does not expect IFRS 12 to have significant impacts on the assets and liabilities, the financial position and operating results of the group as well as on the group’s presentation. IFRS 13, ‘Fair Value Measurement’, aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a definition of fair value and information on the disclosures to be made. The requirements, which are largely aligned between IFRS and US GAAP, do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRSs or US GAAP. The group will apply IFRS 13 in the accounting period beginning after 1 April 2013. At present, the group does not expect IFRS 13 to have significant impacts on the assets and liabilities, the financial position and operating results of the group as well as on the group’s presentation. IAS 32, ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation‘, complements the principles for setting off financial assets and financial liabilities. Setting of financial assets and financial liabilities will still only be possible if an entity currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts; it intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability Consolidated simultaneously. Changes of this standard complement and clarify the application guidance with regard to the terms ‘present times’ and ‘simultaneousness’. The group will apply IAS 32R in the fiscal year beginning on 1 April 2014. At present, the group does not expect IAS 32R to have material impacts on the assets and liabilities, the financial position and operating results of Financial Statements the group as well as the group’s presentation. The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. Consolidated Financial Statements | 75 IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, will provide for additional disclosures with regard to the offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities in the future. The group applies IFRS 7R retrospectively in the fiscal year beginning on 1 April 2013. At present, the group does not expect IFRS 7R to have material impacts on the assets and liabilities, the financial position and operating results of the group as well as the group’s presentation. IAS 1, ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, the changes aim at clarifying the presentation of the increasing number of items under other operating income. In the future, it will only be differentiated between items of other operating income that may be reclassified to the profit for the period and items that will never be reclassified. The changes do not deal with the contents of other operating income. The change was adopted on 5 June 2012 by the EU and will be applied by the group in the fiscal year beginning on 1 April 2013. IAS 27, ‘Separate Financial Statements’, will in the future only include requirements for separate financial statements in accordance with IFRS and be applied by the group in the fiscal year beginning on 1 April 2014. At present, the group does not expect IAS 27 to have material impacts on the assets and liabilities, the financial position and operating results of the group as well as the group’s presentation. IAS 28, ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’, extends the compulsory application of the equity method to joint ventures. The change will be applied in the fiscal year beginning on 1 April 2014. At present, the group does not expect IAS 28 to have material impacts on the assets and liabilities, the financial position and operating results of the group as well as the group’s presentation. IFRS 1, ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ (Revised), contains exemptions in the event of severe hyperinflation and eliminates fixed dates for first-time adopters. EU entities have to apply the new requirements for the first time in the fiscal year beginning on or after 1 January 2013. This change does not affect the group, since the group already prepares the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. IFRIC 20, ‘Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine’, treats the question relating to the recognition and measurement of waste removal costs incurred in surface mining activities. In accordance with the interpretation, entities have to derecognize capitalized stripping assets through revenue reserves in the opening balance, if applicable, provided that these assets cannot be associated to an identifiable part of mining asset. IFRIC 20 applies to annual periods on or after 1 January 2013 and does not affect the group. There are no other standards or interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the group. The consolidated financial statements were prepared by the management board on the undersigned date and released for publication. The entity financial statements of the parent company, which have been included in the consolidated financial statements after transition to the applicable accounting standards, have not yet been approved by the supervisory board on the undersigned date. The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. 76 | Consolidated Financial Statements 2 Consolidation a) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated (full consolidation) from the date on which control is transferred to the group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Inter-company transactions, balances as well as unrealized gains and losses on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group. b) Transactions with non-controlling interests The group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the group. For purchases of non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals of non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. When the group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognized in the profit for the period. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This means that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified from equity to the profit for the period. c) Joint ventures Joint ventures are entities where two or more ventures are bound by a contractual arrangement and this contractual arrangement establishes joint control. The group accounts for joint ventures using the equity method. d) Associates Associates are entities in which the group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanied by a shareholding of between 20 % and 50 % of the voting rights. Associates are accounted for using the equity method. From the date of acquisition, the group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognized in reserves. Goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in the investment in associates, net of any impairment losses. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the group does not recognize further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Consolidated If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the profit for the period where appropriate. Significant unrealized gains from transactions between the group and associates are eliminated to the extent of the group’s Financial Statements interest in the associates. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. Consolidated Financial Statements | 77 3 Business combinations The group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations as at the acquisition date. The acquisition date relates to the date of transfer of control to the group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The consideration transferred for the acquisition is the fair values of the assets transferred, the equity interests issued by the group and the liabilities incurred or assumed as at the acquisition date. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in full as incurred. In accordance with IFRS 3, any assets acquired and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) assumed in a business combination are measured at their full fair values, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interests. Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill if they are separable from the entity or result from statutory, contractual or other legal rights. No new restructuring provisions may be recognized within the scope of the purchase price allocation. Any remaining positive differences, which compensate the seller with market opportunities that cannot be identified any closer and with development potential, are capitalized as goodwill in the respective cash generating unit (CGU). Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the group is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is measured in accordance with IAS 39 and a resulting profit or loss recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Any contingent consideration included in the financial statements resulting from business combinations prior to the application of IFRS 3 (2008) is still treated in accordance with the requirements under IFRS 3 (2004). Any hidden reserves and liabilities uncovered are carried forward in line with the corresponding assets and liabilities. The determination of the fair values requires certain estimates and assumptions, in particular of the acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, of the liabilities assumed as well as of the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. The group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s net assets. The group measures the goodwill at the acquisition date as: n The fair value of the consideration transferred – if necessary plus n The value recognized of all recognized non-controlling interests over the acquiree – plus n The fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree if the combination is achieved in stages – less n The net amount (in general of the fair values) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the excess is negative, a gain on a bargain purchase is recognized directly in the profit for the period. The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. 78 | Consolidated Financial Statements 4 Foreign currency translation Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro, which is Kapsch TrafficCom Group’s presentation currency. a) Translation of financial statements in foreign currencies In accordance with IAS 21, financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which are included in the consolidated financial statements are translated as follows: The statement of comprehensive income of foreign entities (except for foreign entities from hyper-inflationary countries) that have a functional currency different from the Euro are translated into the group’s presentation currency at average exchange rates of the fiscal year, balance sheets at the prevailing mean exchange rate at the balance sheet date. The reference rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and Deutsche Bundesbank, which are accessible via Österreichische Nationalbank’s website, serve as the basis for the translation. Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment subsidiaries are recognized in shareholders’ equity under “Currency translation differences”. When a foreign entity is sold, such exchange differences are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as part of the gain or loss on disposal of shares in associates. Goodwill and fair value write-ups arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the respective foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The main exchange rates used during the fiscal year are shown below: Average exchange rate Exchange rate at the closing date EUR 2012/13 2011/12 2012/13 2011/12 AUD 1.251 1.319 1.231 1.284 CAD 1.296 1.371 1.302 1.331 CZK 25.277 24.722 25.740 24.730 PLN 4.168 4.174 4.180 4.152 SEK 8.612 9.002 8.355 8.846 USD 1.292 1.388 1.281 1.336 ZAR 10.946 10.210 11.820 10.232 In the fiscal year 2011/12, Kapsch Telematic Services IOOO, Minsk, the Republic of Belarus, was founded. As of the balance sheet date of 31 March 2013 the Republic of Belarus is still classified as a hyperinflationary economy. The group analyzed if IAS 29 (Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies) had to be applied to the subsidiary. Since the Euro is the functional currency and not the Belorussian Ruble (BYR), the classification of the Republic of Belarus as hyperinflationary economy has no impact on accounting for the Belorussian subsidiary and thus also does not affect the present consolidated financial statements. IAS 29 will not be applied. b) Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the presentation currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the Consolidated transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Nonmonetary items in the balance sheet are translated at historical exchange rates; non-monetary items which were recognized at their Financial Statements lower net realizable value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of measurement. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to cash and cash equivalents and borrowings are presented in the statement of comprehensive income within finance income or cost. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the statement of comprehensive income in other operating income or other operating expenses. The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. Consolidated Financial Statements | 79 5 Financial instruments and risk management Primary financial instruments presented in the balance sheet include ‘cash and cash equivalents’, ‘securities’, ‘financial assets and investments’, ‘receivables and payables’ and ‘loans’. For the accounting policies applicable to these items, refer to the explanation of the respective balance sheet item. The group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, particularly foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. The group’s risk management focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the group’s financial performance. The group does not employ hedge accounting as envisaged by IAS 39. a) Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk arising from fluctuations in the currency of financial instruments. In particular, foreign exchange risk exists where business transactions are made or could arise in the normal course of business in a currency other than the group’s functional currency (referred to as foreign currency below). The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the Czech crown, Polish zloty, South-African rand and the US dollar. Due to the terms of agreement in Euro no foreign exchange risk arises with regard to the Belorussian Ruble. Customer orders are mainly invoiced in the local currencies of the group companies. Only in cases in which the group expects to be exposed to significant foreign exchange risk, major orders denominated in foreign currencies are hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts. If the exchange rate of the stated currencies (resulting from current and non-current receivables and payables) as of 31 March 2013 (31 March 2012) had changed by the percentage rate (‘volatility’) stated below, the profits before tax, provided all other variables had remained unchanged, would have been higher or lower, respectively, by the following amounts. Currency Volatility Impact on the result for the period and on equity in TEUR 2012/13 2011/12 AUD 10 % 364 496 CAD 10 % 1,987 2,054 CZK 10 % 337 3,332 EUR 10 % -3,436 -2,556 PLN 10 % 933 10,043 SEK 10 % 533 2,623 USD 10 % 3,192 3,570 ZAR 10 % 2,506 3,782 The effects for the Polish zloty in the fiscal year 2011/12 result from the implementation of the toll collection system project in Poland. b) Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk arising from fluctuations in the value of financial instruments, other balance sheet items (e.g. receivables and payables) and/or cash flows due to fluctuations in the market interest rates. For fixed-interest balance sheet items, the risk comprises the present value risk. In case the market interest rate for the financial instrument fluctuates, either a profit or a loss may result if the financial instrument is sold prior to maturity. The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. 80 | Consolidated Financial Statements For variable-interest balance sheet items, the risk relates to the cash flow. With variable-interest financial instruments, adjustments in the interest rates may result from changes in the market interest rates. Such changes would entail changes in interest payments. Variable-interest (both short-term and long-term) financial liabilities account for approximately one third of financial interest balance sheet items. If the market interest rate had been 100 basis points higher (lower) as of 31 March 2013, this, as in the prior year, would not have had a material impact on the result of the group. At the balance sheet date, no financial derivatives were used to hedge the interest rate risk. c) Credit risk As part of the group’s risk management policy, the group only engages in business relationships with third parties recognized as creditworthy and implements policies to ensure that the group sells to customers with appropriate credit histories. In addition, the group monitors its receivables balances on an ongoing basis in order to limit its exposure to bad debts. Certain of the group’s policies limit the amount of its credit exposure to any financial institution, depending on the rating of the institution. There is usually a credit risk in the implementation phase of large toll collection projects. With the exception of the toll collection projects in the Czech Republic, South Africa, Poland and the Republic of Belarus (see Note 18), there is no concentration of credit risk relating to trade receivables, since the group generally has a large number of customers worldwide. Based on the group’s experiences, the default risk for trade receivables can be considered low. The maximum credit risk is similar to book values: All amounts in TEUR 2012/13 2011/12 Other non-current financial assets and investments 38,085 51,229 Other non-current assets 942 3,420 Trade receivables and other current assets 253,177 287,590 Cash and cash equivalents 79,022 44,929 371,226 387,168 d) Liquidity risk Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the group and aggregated on group level. The management monitors the rolling forecasts of the group liquidity reserves to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs and also to secure adequate scope of unutilized credit lines at any time so that the group will neither exceed the credit lines nor injure the credit agreements. e) Equity price risk The group is exposed to equity securities price risk resulting from a material investment, since a Norwegian investment held (Q-Free ASA), the net equity of which is subject to changes in exchange rates, is classified as available for sale in the consolidated balance sheet. The investment Q-Free ASA is dealt on the Stock Exchange. The table below summarizes the impact of increases/decreases of the equity index of Q-Free ASA on the other comprehensive income for the period net of tax. The analysis is based on the assumption that the equity index increases/decreases by 10 % with all other variables held constant.

The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. Consolidated Financial Statements | 81 6 Capital management Capital management is carried out in line with value-driven and sustainable corporate governance on the basis of the profit and loss accounts of the individual business segments. Accounting ratios and other economic criteria as well as the noncurrent development of the group are also monitored and taken into account with regard to corporate governance. A crucial ratio for the capital structure is the gearing ratio calculated as ratio of net debt to equity. Net debt (net assets) comprises current and non-current borrowings less cash on hand, bank balances and current securities. The Kapsch Group’s capital management strategy aims amongst others to ensure that the group companies’ capital resources comply with local requirements. Furthermore, the group focuses on maintaining the gearing ratio on an annual average within a range from 25 % to 35 % in order to be still able to borrow at reasonable cost. The group also continuously monitors if all covenants comply with credit agreements. The highly volatile project business may, nonetheless, be responsible that under certain circumstances the gearing ratio strategy and/or the required covenants may not be complied with. In the reporting year, all external capital requirements resulting from the project financing of the nationwide truck toll collection systems in the Republic of Belarus and Poland were fulfilled. The objective of this measure is to safeguard the ability to continue as a long-term going concern in order to show to shareholders and other stakeholders that their requirements can be fulfilled in a qualitative and sustainable way and that returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders can be provided. Other essential objectives of the group’s capital management include the financing of the envisaged growth path and the maintenance of an optimal capital structure. All amounts in TEUR 2012/13 2011/12 Non-current financial liabilities 104,372 74,256 Current financial liabilities 19,658 53,249 Total financial liabilities 124,030 127,505 Cash on hand and at banks 79,022 44,929 Current securities 4,505 8,213 Net assets /Net debt -40,503 -74,363 Equity 240,682 256,247 Net gearing 17 % 29 % 7 Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. A qualifying asset is an asset (inventories, manufacturing plants, toll collection projects, power generation facilities, intangible assets and investment in properties) that necessarily takes a substantial period of time (with regard to the group at least 12 months) to get ready for its intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization. In the fiscal year 2012/13 under review, the group did not meet the requirements of a qualifying asset for any capitalized asset; therefore, no borrowing costs were capitalized. For the toll collection system project in the Republic of Belarus, which fulfills the criteria of IAS 23, borrowing costs were considered in the project calculation. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. 82 | Consolidated Financial Statements 8 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets in accordance with the group policies: The useful lives range between 3 to 26 years for plants and buildings on leasehold land, 4 to 20 years for technical equipment and machinery and 3 to 10 years for other equipment, factory and office equipment. The assets’ useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The difference between the proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment and carrying amount is recognized as profit or loss in the result from operating activities. 9 Intangible assets a) Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the group’s interest in net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in acquiree at the acquisition date. If the acquisition costs are less than the net assets of the acquired subsidiary valued at fair value, the difference is recognized directly in the statement of comprehensive income. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. As a rule, the group carries out the annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter. In addition, the group carries out impairment tests during the year if a triggering event occurs that the asset may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the cash generating units, or groups of cash generating units, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination and reported the goodwill. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated in that way represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. If an impairment requirement is identified, goodwill will be reduced immediately by the amount of the impairment. The value in use of a cash generating unit corresponds to the present value, calculated using the discount cash flow method, of the future cash flows which the entity will receive from the cash generating unit. In order to determine the value in use, the expected future cash flows plus taxes based on the post-tax discount rate that reflects the current market expectations with regard to the interest effect and the specific risks of the cash generating units, are written down to their present values. In doing so, the current planning covering a period of four years (detailed forecast period) and approved by management is used as the basis with subsequent transition to perpetuity. The growth rates according to the detailed forecast period are based on historical growth data, on external studies on the future medium-term market development. Consolidated The fair value less selling cost is determined using an appropriate valuation model which is based on the medium-term planning of the respective cash generating unit. The valuation is made in line with the discounted cash flow calculations and Financial Statements verified through suitable multiples, if available. Write-ups on goodwill are not made. The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. Consolidated Financial Statements | 83 b) Concessions and rights Computer software, trademarks and similar rights are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred for acquisition and amortized over their estimated useful lives of 4 to 30 years. Acquired customer agreements (toll contracts, maintenance agreements) are amortized over the estimated useful lives that generally range between 2 and 10 years. c) Research and development costs Research expenditures are recognized as an expense. Costs incurred on development projects (relating to the design and testing of new or improved products) are recognized as intangible assets when the following criteria are fulfilled: a) it is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale; b) management intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; c) there is an ability to use or sell the intangible asset; d) it can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits; e) adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset are available; and f) the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be reliably measured. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognized as an expense. Development costs previously recognized as an expense are not recognized as an asset in subsequent periods. Capitalized development costs are recorded as intangible assets and amortized from the point at which the asset is ready for use on a straight-line basis over its useful life, not exceeding three years. Development assets are tested for impairment annually in accordance with IAS 36. 10 Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life – for example, goodwill or intangible assets not ready for use – are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset should be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. Assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount are recognized as income or expense in the result from operating activities. Gains are not classified as revenue. The residual carrying values and useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted as necessary. The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. 84 | Consolidated Financial Statements 11 Financial assets a) Securities Financial assets recognized under non-current assets and other short-term financial assets include available-for-sale securities and financial assets at fair value through profit and loss. Available-for-sale securities and financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses arising from the changes in fair value of available-for-sale securities are recognized in equity under a separate item; unrealized gains and losses arising from the changes in fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are recognized immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. The difference arising on the sale of financial assets between the proceeds and the carrying amounts is taken through profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. Additionally, the amount recognized in equity is taken through profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. All acquisitions and sales are recognized at the respective date of the transaction, transaction costs are included in acquisition costs (except for financial assets at fair value taken through profit and loss). At each balance sheet date, the group assesses whether there is objective evidence of impairment of each significant individual financial asset or group of financial assets. If such evidence exists, the group accounts for that impairment and the amounts previously recognized in equity are removed from equity and recognized through profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. The amount of the impairment is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows. If, in subsequent periods, the fair value of the impaired financial instrument increases and that increase can be directly related to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized through profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income, the group reverses the impairment loss. In the case of debt instruments (for available-for-sale financial instruments), the reversal is recognized in the profit for the period in the statement of comprehensive income; in the case of equity instruments, it is recognized directly in equity. b) Other Investments Other available-for-sale investments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are carried at cost less impairment. At each balance sheet date, the group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. If, in a subsequent period, the reason for the impairment is no longer valid, no reversal of the impairment is recognized. c) Derivative financial instruments For accounting purposes, derivative financial instruments are treated as standalone derivates (i.e. as independent transactions and not as hedging transactions) and thus classify as held-for-trading financial instruments and are valued at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value corresponds to the value which the relevant entity would receive or have to pay upon liquidation of the deal on the balance sheet date. Positive market values at the balance sheet date are recognized under financial assets and negative market values under other liabilities. Consolidated Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized immediately in the statement of comprehensive income within other income or expense or in financial result, depending on the derivative financial instrument’s purpose. The group does not employ hedge accounting as envisaged by IAS 39. Financial Statements The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. Consolidated Financial Statements | 85 12 Leases a) Finance leases – Accounting for agreements from the lessee’s perspective Leasing agreements by which the group as lessee has substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the use of an asset are accounted for as finance leases. The respective assets are capitalized under non-current assets at the net present value of minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset, whichever is lower, and are depreciated over their expected useful lives or shorter lease term, if applicable. A liability with regard to finance leases is recognized in the same amount. The difference between the minimum lease payments and the accrued net present value is recognized as deferred interest expense. The interest component is spread over the agreed term of the lease using the effective interest rate method. b) Operating leases – Accounting for agreements from the lessee’s perspective Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 13 Government grants Government grants with regard to purchased non-current assets (technical equipment) are deferred and taken through profit or loss over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. Government grants are recognized at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the group will comply with all attached conditions and the grant will be received. Other government grants received as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred are immediately taken through profit or loss. 14 Inventories Inventories are stated at cost or, if lower, the net realizable value. Cost is determined using the moving average price method. Production cost includes all directly attributable expenses and fixed and variable overheads (based on normal operating capacity) incurred in connection with the production. It excludes, however, borrowing costs as they cannot be allocated to a qualifying asset. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable selling expenses. 15 Construction contracts The group accounts for construction contracts in accordance with IAS 11. When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the contract will be profitable, contract revenue is recognized over the period of the contract. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognized as an expense immediately. The construction progress is represented by the ratio of costs incurred by the balance sheet date and the estimated total costs for the respective project. The carrying amount results from comparing the total of accumulated costs incurred by the balance sheet date plus the profit calculated according to the percentage of completion method (prorated) or loss (in full) on the respective construction contract to the invoiced amounts. The balance is recognized either under current assets (amounts due from customers for contract work) or under current liabilities (amounts due to customers for contract work). The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. 86 | Consolidated Financial Statements 16 Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for bad debts. An allowance for bad debts is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the allowance is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related to an event occurring after the impairment was initially recognized, the reversal of the previously recognized impairment loss is recognized through profit or loss. 17 Cash and cash equivalents For the presentation of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held at call and other cash at banks. Overdrafts are recognized in the balance sheet under current financial liabilities. 18 Provisions Provisions are set up when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation to third parties as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. If such a reliable estimate is not possible, no provisions are set up. Provisions are measured based on the estimated settlement amount. The settlement amount is the best possible estimate of an expense on the basis of which a current obligation might be settled at the balance sheet date or transferred to a third party. This estimate takes into account future cost increases that are foreseeable and likely to occur on the balance sheet date. Provisions for warranties and liabilities for construction flaws, serial and systems problems mainly serve as coverage for obligations for free repairs and replacement deliveries, in accordance with the general sales and delivery conditions or due to individual agreements, and are measured using rates based on past experience regarding direct labor and material costs incurred, overheads, replacement deliveries or rebates. A provision is recognized for the best estimate of the costs of defects to be rectified under the warranty for products sold before the balance sheet date. Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized if the expected benefit to be derived from the contract is less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the amount from the fulfillment of the contract or any compensation payments in case of nonperformance, whichever is lower. The recognition of impairment losses on assets dedicated to that “onerous” contract is, however, established prior to the recognition of the provisions for onerous contracts. 19 Employee benefits The group provides various post-employment benefits to employees and other long-term benefits either based on individual Consolidated agreements or in accordance with local labor law provisions. For the calculation of liabilities arising from pension obligations and termination benefits in accordance with IAS 19, the Financial Statements projected unit credit method is used. According to this method, post-employment costs for employee benefits are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in such a way that scheduled costs are spread over the employees’ years of service on the basis of an expert opinion by a qualified actuary, who completely re-measures the schemes annually. The obligations for The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. Consolidated Financial Statements | 87 pension payments are calculated as the present value of future benefits using interest rates of government bonds whose term roughly equals the term of the liability. Actuarial gains and losses exceeding the corridor (= up to 10 % of benefit obligation or 10 % of plan assets, if any, at beginning of period) are charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the average remaining service period of the active staff entitled to the employee benefits. The group applies IAS 19R in the fiscal year beginning on 1 April 2013. Future actuarial adjustments are recognized through other comprehensive income. Contributions paid by the group under a defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the statement of comprehensive income under staff costs in the period in which they occur. For the calculation of liabilities arising from obligations for anniversary bonuses in accordance with IAS 19, the projected unit credit method is used. Anniversary bonuses are special lump-sum payments stipulated in the Collective Agreement and dependent on compensation and years of service. Eligibility is determined by a certain number of service years. The calculation of liabilities arising from obligations for anniversary bonuses is performed in the same way as the calculation for liabilities arising from termination benefits, however, without taking the corridor method into consideration. 20 Current and deferred income tax The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is generally recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Only taxes that relate to items recognized under equity are recognized under other comprehensive income. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws applicable at the balance sheet date in the countries where the subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Deferred income tax assets / liabilities are provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred income tax assets/liabilities arise from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither IFRS profit or loss nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred income tax assets/liabilities are determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. Temporary differences mainly arise in connection with depreciation (amortization) periods of non-current assets, provisions for pension benefits, other post-employment benefits, differences regarding the measurement of receivables and payables and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred income tax assets/liabilities are provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. 88 | Consolidated Financial Statements Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity. 21 Liabilities Liabilities are recognized at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured at the current rate at the balance sheet date. Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized cost; borrowing costs are charged to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they are incurred. 22 Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities occur for two reasons. For one, they comprise possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed by uncertain future events that are at least partly beyond an entity’s control. For another, they comprise present obligations that fail to meet general or special recognition standards (i.e. the amount of settlement of an obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability or an outflow of resources to settle the obligations is not deemed probable). The group discloses contingent liabilities unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote and a liability does not have to be recognized pursuant to IFRS. 23 Revenue recognition In accordance with IAS 18, revenue is recognized in at fair value the statement of comprehensive income upon delivery and once the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to the customer, net of discounts and eliminated sales within the group. Sales of services are recognized in the reporting period in which the services are rendered, by reference to completion of the specific transaction assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided. Revenue for construction contracts (mainly toll collection projects) is recognized in accordance with the percentage-ofcompletion method provided the conditions under IAS 11 are met. Other revenue is recognized by the group as follows: n Revenue from expenses recharged is recognized on the basis of the accumulated amounts in accordance with the respective agreements. n Interest income is recognized on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method. n Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established. Consolidated Financial Statements The consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of 31 March 2013 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and with section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) have been translated into English. In case of different interpretations the German original is valid. Consolidated Financial Statements | 89 24 Material accounting estimates and assumptions with regard to accounting policies The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future development. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, rarely equal the related actual results. In particular, estimates and assumptions regarding revenue recognition have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next fiscal year. The group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its construction contracts. Use of the percentageof-completion method requires the group to estimate the expected profit mark-up for the construction contract. Sensitivity analyses on assumptions made by management indicate that no material effect is to be expected if the actual final results should deviate by 10 % from estimates. The analysis of assumptions made in the past as well as of actual profit mark-ups showed that the estimates had been reliable up to now. Further areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements include capitalized goodwill, inventories, deferred income tax assets/liabilities, liabilities from post-employment benefits to employees and provisions for warranties, project risks and losses from pending transactions. Sensitivity analyses of the assumptions made by management in connection with inventories, deferred taxes and provisions indicate that no material effect will arise if the actual final outcomes were to differ by 10 % from the estimates made. Sensitivities for the acquired goodwill (break-even interest rate) are detailed in Note 13. The sensitivities for obligations for post-employment benefits and anniversary bonus obligations are detailed in Note 23 and 26. 25 Segment information Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decisionmaker.

Fair value-hierarchies and determination of fair value: Financial assets and liabilities have to be classified in one of the three following fair value-hierarchies according to IFRS 7.27 A Level 1. There are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. In the group, the investment in Q-Free ASA, Trondheim, Norway as well as listed equity instruments are attributed to Level 1. Level 2. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques based on observable direct or indirect market data. This category comprises available-for-sale securities, such as government and other bonds, which are quoted, however not regularly traded on a stock market. Level 3. Financial instruments are included in level 3 if the valuation information is not based on observable market data.

Consolidated Financial Statements | 105 Deferred taxes due to tax loss carry-forwards and other temporary differences deductible in the future are recognized only to the extent of their potential realization. In these consolidated financial statements, tax loss carry-forwards amounting to TEUR 20,104 (2011/12: TEUR 15,154) have not been recognized because it was uncertain whether there would be sufficient taxable profits available against which to offset them. These tax loss carry-forwards origin from foreign subsidiaries with the predominant part not expiring before 2030. All other deferred tax assets have been recognized in the respective group companies as future deductible items. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset, taking maturities into account, when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity.

We conducted our audit in accordance with laws and regulations applicable in Austria and Austrian Standards on Auditing as well as in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). Those standards require that we comply with professional guidelines and that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance of whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor ’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the group’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our audit opinion. 118 | Auditor’s Report Opinion Our audit did not give rise to any objections. In our opinion, which is based on the results of our audit, the consolidated financial statements comply with legal requirements and give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group as of 31 March 2013 and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the fiscal year from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU. Comments on the Management Report for the group. Pursuant to statutory provisions, the management report for the group is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as to whether the other disclosures are not misleading with respect to the Company’s position. The auditor’s report also has to contain a statement as to whether the management report for the group is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and whether the disclosures pursuant to Section 243a UGB are appropriate. In our opinion, the management report for the group is consistent with the consolidated financial statements. The disclosures pursuant to Section 243a UGB are appropriate.
