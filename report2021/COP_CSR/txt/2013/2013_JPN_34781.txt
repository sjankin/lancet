We have implemented measures to minimize the impacts of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, steadily constructing profit structures that are resilient to external changes.

However, we admit that there Policy for Fiscal 2013 were also internal issues, such as our vulnerability to foreign exchange. We have already taken steps to address this issue. Also, performance in the Industrial Automation (IA) Business, which is sensitive to capital investment trends, was lower than expected. Complete the GLOBE STAGE!

Finally, to further reinforce this quantitative focus, from fiscal 2013, we have established the new position of Chief Financial Officer (CFO). We anticipate the CFO, by serving as the “brain” of the financial side of operations, will be a driving force in boosting both the quality and speed of decisions related to portfolio management. 24 Omron Corporation Integrated Report 2013 25 We are boldy addressing social issues on a global basis to make Omron a social must.

Currently, we have defined 170 “core positions”, and we are actively working to discover and promote human resources to fill these positions. In particular, we are working to fill overseas management positions locally. Elsewise, we are still faced with diversity issues, such as the promotion of women. However, we are taking steps to address these issues by establishing specialized teams. In regard to corporate culture, in fiscal 2012 we inaugurated The OMRON Global Awards (TOGA). This award program was designed to reward employees for acting on the spirit we have held since our founding and embarking on bold undertakings to meet ambitious goals they themselves have declared. The program was also designed to cultivate a corporate culture that encourages employees to take on new challenges without fear of failure. In this competition, more than 20,000 entries, representing over half of our staff worldwide, formed teams that stepped across national and organizational Omron Handball Team wins Japan women’s league for the boundaries. Then, on “Founder’s Day” in May 2013, awards were presented to the top 16th time and for the 2nd consecutive year (March 14, 2013) 13 teams. We intend to continue this initiative into the future. What matters most is to In closing, I would like to share with you something that is of exceptional importance to myself. This is the Omron Principles. Currently, roughly two-thirds of the employees that advance Omron’s international operations are non-Japanese. As such, a diverse range of values exist within the Company. For this reason, the Omron Principles play an important role as the binding force that unites all employees throughout the Group. The spirit embodied by these principles and our corporate motto guide us as we work to overcome Sales base in Singapore cultural and language barriers and form a tightly knit team in which all members hold high ambitions.

Publication of Integrated Report 2013 Omron conducts management from a long-term perspective in its quest to work for the benefit of the global society through its business. Integrated thinking has always been a core element of this perspective. As one aspect of this, we are actively disclosing information and conducting investor relations activities to practice “relationship-building with shareholders,” which is one of Omron’s management commitments. For this reason, we made the switch to integrated reporting in 2012, and this report is thus our second integrated report. Integrated Report 2013 has been constructed to provide the Company’s stakeholders with concrete and easy-to-understand information regarding Omron’s management. I feel confident that this report will prove to be a viable tool for the shareholders and other investors that provide the Company with stable funding over the long term. Financial Section Several organizations, including the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), are providing frameworks and other guidelines for integrated reporting. While following such guidelines, we went creative and sought our way of helping readers better understand Omron’s management. Further, in July 2012, the Corporate Reporting Lab was established by a corporate accounting office of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan. This lab conducts studies on corporate governance and communication between companies and investors from a variety of perspectives, and results of these studies are released in both Japanese and English. As a member of the lab’s Planning Committee, I took this lab’s findings into mind when constructing this integrated report. INQUIRIES Omron has just begun undertaking the new challenge of publishing integrated reports. I would like to ask for your continued support and understanding as we continue to evolve our integrated reporting efforts going forward.
