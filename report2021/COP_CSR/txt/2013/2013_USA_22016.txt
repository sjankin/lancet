The occupational injury and illness rate is determined by multiplying the total number of injury and illness incidents by 200,000 hours and dividing this by the total number of hours worked, i.e. an incident rate of 1.00 would be equivalent to 1 incident per 200,000 hours worked. 2013 A LLERG A N SUS TAINABIL IT Y PERF ORMANCE REPORT 3 Introduction 2012 proved to be another successful year for Allergan’s sustainability program. Allergan’s specific performance against the 2012 goals is described following the strategic goals section. Allergan has rapidly grown again in the past year through the acquisition of three companies and through internal “organic” growth. Growth through acquisition included SkinMedica, MAP Pharmaceuticals and Exemplar. These acquisitions will be factored into the performance data and summaries during the next reporting season in 2013 and captured in the 2014 annual sustainability report. The impact of these new companies on Allergan’s performance is being assessed. Allergan has also included additional sustainability reporting parameters in this report in an effort to increase the transparency of Allergan’s performance. Reporting includes economic, governance and social parameters as well as environmental health and safety parameters. Tactical approaches to meeting the desired goals are included. Allergan positions and policies on current sustainability issues are presented. These include climate change, pharmaceuticals in the environment, water curtailment, packaging management, biodiversity, bioethics, energy independence, life cycle and carbon footprint approaches, green chemistry, ethnic, age and gender diversity, governance and ethics, supply chain enhancements, strategy to improve access to drugs, cost burden and health outcomes, recognizing excellence, and community support. A GRI in accordance with G3 statement and index are included along with third-party verification statements. Allergan has continued its work with the United Nations Global Compact and will commence work with the Clinton Global Initiative in 2013.

As an industry leader, Allergan prides itself on recognising the impact its products and services have outside its immediate control. Allergan has already contacted almost 200 of its top suppliers to encourage them to take part in Ecodesk’s open data initiative and plans to extend this through further supplier phases to gain full knowledge of supply chain impacts. “Allergan is one of our most proactive clients and is clearly committed to implementing a transparent supply chain strategy as part of its wider sustainability initiatives,” commented Nick Murry, Chief Sustainability Ofﬁcer at Ecodesk. “It is showing leadership in the pharmaceuticals sector through the use of open data to exploit efﬁciencies at every point in the supply chain.” Account Manager Begum Kurkcu commented: “Allergan has been a pleasure to work with, as the company understands the full range of beneﬁts that can be obtained through the use of the Enterprise Programme initiative.

It is also expected with the major expansions and construction completed at all facilities that the water consumption will be more efficiently managed. Reclaimed water has been used at the Irvine location for many years for irrigation purposes. On a per sales basis, water consumption continues to decline. Water consumption normalized to facility area demonstrates the effectiveness of Allergan’s water conservation programs.

When Allergan acquired Inamed, now known as Allergan Medical, xylene emissions associated with implant manufacturing operations added another emission source to the Allergan inventory. Allergan is currently in compliance with all regulatory requirements regarding air emissions at its locations worldwide. Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) Emissions Trend Allergan has negligible nitrogen oxide emissions from its facilities. These emissions are associated with fuel combustion regarding boiler operations primarily. The nitrogen oxide emissions are unregulated at most of the locations due to the low levels of these emissions. Sulfur Oxide (SOx) Emissions Trend Allergan has negligible sulfur oxide emissions from its facilities. These emissions are associated with fuel combustion for its steam boiler operations primarily. The sulfur oxide emissions are unregulated at most of the locations due to the low levels of these emissions. Ozone Depleting Compound Mercurial Preservative (ODC) Use Consumption Allergan has eliminated 99% of the usage of ozone depleting Thimerosal, Phenylmercuric Acetate and Phenylmercuric compounds (ODC) at its facilities.

In 2012, we achieved an incident rate of 0.71 incidents per 100 employees. This is Allergan’s lowest incident rate on record. We also reduced the number of more severe incidents as measured by the number of incidents requiring days away from work or restricted time down to 0.46 incidents per 100 employees. We did not incur any Allergan employee or contractor employee related fatalities or significant injuries in 2012. Slips/Trips/Falls, Sprains/Strains from lifting/bending, and being struck on/by objects were the three most frequent injury classifications in 2012. We have implemented several programs to proactively identify workplace hazards and reduce employee incidents. These prevention programs include: • Increasing employee awareness around workplace hazards and incidents. For example, one Allergan location identifies the location of incidents using signage. At another location, the incident investigation process includes a joint review of the incident area by the injured employee, area supervisor, area manager, environmental, health and safety and site senior management. • Conducting detailed environmental, health and safety risk assessment of existing work-areas, as well as changes in processes or equipment. • Sharing lessons learned from near-miss incidents across the organization. • Implementation of a Behavior focused improvement process.                                                                       2013 A LLERG A N SUS TAINABIL IT Y PERF ORMANCE REPORT 23 Risk Assessment – Identify, Prioritize, and Correct Proactively indentifying workplace environmental, health, and safety risks is a critical part of ensuring we provide a safe workplace for our employees, and reduce our environmental risks. Allergan’s risk assessment process, facilitated by a web based tool, is completed by environmental, health and safety professional in consultation with engineers, management, and work area employees. The risk assessment process begins with an identification of all tasks associated with a work activity, process, or the operation of equipment. After task identification, the EHS risks for each task are identified and evaluated based on frequency, likelihood of occurrence, and severity. Corrective actions are identified, and implemented to reduce the risk medium and high risks. For example at one Allergan location we completed 173 EHS risk assessments in 2012. Implementation of various corrective actions has reduced these risks by 50%.
