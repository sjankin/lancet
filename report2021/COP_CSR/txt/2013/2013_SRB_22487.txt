In 2012, our efforts were directed at three main areas: re-deÔ¨Åning and aligning our Bank‚Äôs corporate values that stemmed from the Group‚Äôs corporate values in order to embrace them at all business levels; ensure that all management structures recognize Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija as a Bank with a crystallized vision of its role in the society and its responsibilities; promote the corporate volunteering programs in order to enhance employee commitment to our goal of sustainable integration into the local community while combating all forms of exclusion. These efforts had a tangible effect on how we operate internally, how we run our business activities and how we communicate with our clients, stakeholders and partners. Our main achievements: internal campaign on corporate values that produced a publication on our corporate values in the form of a booklet to all employees, training to all key talent managers on advanced leadership skills that incorporated the importance of CSR and the Corporate Volunteering Award received for the Best Partnership in the Local Community with our corporate partner METRO Cash & Carry Serbia for the community project for children with developmental challenges called Magic Breakfast. The ten principles within the framework of human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and anticorruption serve as our guidelines but also as an inspiring reminder that we as a Bank have only started with their integration into our business practice. How to grow sustainably is possibly the biggest challenge all businesses are facing nowadays but acknowledging the fact that it is a process and not a single action, we at Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija are committed and enthusiastic in Ô¨Ånding our best path to success. The examples presented in this report are all concrete illustrations of our accomplishments in this area in 2012.

Promoting these values within the Bank encourages all employees to follow a strict business ethics while being responsible in communication and information sharing with our clients therefore strengthening our primary vocation: to serve our clients in a way that will help them to fulÔ¨Åll their life plans and projects. Sustainable development within CAS therefore helps to promote sustainable development among our clients as well as broader in society. This vision is reÔ¨Çected in our by-line ‚Äúthe bank of common sense‚Äù and in the fact that sustainability is Ô¨Årmly embedded in our mission, purpose and values. On a business level, acting as a responsible, ethical and professional bank means making sure that we have the means to fulÔ¨Åll our role in Ô¨Ånancing the real economy while staying loyal to our clients. Every employee strives to assist our clients achieve their success by taking care of their interests and at the same time protecting those of the Bank. On a social and environmental level, our set two priority objectives have not changed: combating all forms of exclusion and developing a more responsible and resources aware business environment. Our priority objectives are translated into an action plan for 2013: 1. By empowering our employees to live our corporate values, strengthen the Bank‚Äôs responsibility culture 2. Gradually incorporate sustainable development into business process and measure its impact whenever possible 3. Raise awareness regarding the vulnerable and minority groups of children by implementing philanthropy initiatives that include volunteers in every region where we operate The emerging sustainable responsibility culture is based on a strong commitment, constructive dialogue with the regulators and a concept of compliance that goes well beyond the minimum legal and regulatory requirements, but also training employees in CSR and encouraging their engagement in sustainable development initiatives. In Retail Banking by implementing our corporate values we are putting CSR considerations at the very heart of our approach to clients: welcoming, listening to and providing advice to our clients, supporting them in their projects, and especially in agribusiness, offering special products. By using ‚ÄòBlue Words‚Äô across the Bank, we make sure the same standard of communication is used across departments, branch ofÔ¨Åces and regions. It also means directing our energy at speciÔ¨Åc actions that will beneÔ¨Åt our clients by creating socially responsible products that ease the burden of the prolonged Ô¨Ånancial crisis. 12 PRINCIPLES GOVERNING CSR EFFORTS WITHIN CA SRBIJA Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija supports the United Nations Global Compact by being an active member of Global Compact UN in Serbia.

Employees are the key of the CAS success, therefore careful consideration is required during Recruitment and Selection process, Training, Career Development, Performance Management, Administration and Payroll. The main goal is to create long term satisÔ¨Åed and motivated employees with required knowledge and skills. These employees should be able to focus on clients as well as to represent the Bank in the best way possible. Optimization of all HR process is orderly done every year. The number of employees in CAS is optimized over the years as well. Total number of employees in 2012 was 932, with approximately 1,76 time more female employees than males. 15 Speaking in percentages 64% of employees are females and 36% are males on 31/12/2012. 16 Employees gender ratio in comparison with the type of Labor Contract is given in the following table on 31/12/2012: Average work experience in Bank for 2012 was 11 years, for women average work experience was 11 years and for men 11 years as well Majority of employees are the ones with 6 to 10 years of work experience, and the second largest group are the ones at the beginning of their careers. So we can say that our Bank is open for fresh ideas of young people that are willing to grow with us. 428 employees are classiÔ¨Åed in the group of 6 -10 years of service, that is shown below: 17 Next chart shows years of service according to gender on 31/12/2012: In 2011 average age of employees was 36 years, and it was the same for both genders. In 2011 average age of employees was 36 years for both genders. 18 The majority of employees within the Bank is between 30 and 39 years old, with 347 women and 220 men in this category. It is important to point out that the reason for the large numbers of maternity leaves is the fact that in 2012 there were 429 women under 40 years old. Women who went on maternity leaves were replaced with employees with a temporary based contracts, until they returned from maternity leaves. Next chart shows make-up of employees age according to gender on 31/12/2012: 19 Allocation: branch network vs. supportive and managerial functions on 31/12/2012: 69% of all employees are located in Front OfÔ¨Åce (Branch Network Treasury, Corporate&Agriculture, Retail-Head OfÔ¨Åce without Marketing) and 31% in Back OfÔ¨Åce (Management, Risk & Permanent Control F&O, HR, General Secretary, Compliance, Marketing) Educational structure breakdown: The level of education of our employees is high, with 52% of population with University degree that is the same percentage as in 2011.

Voluntary outgoing Ô¨Çow of permanent staff according to gender: Voluntary turnover in 2012 was 2,79% and in 2011 it was 4,06. 21 TRAINING PROGRAMMES Staff development for each business line is carefully planned and guided through different training programmes. Internal trainings are dominant and the ratio of internal vs external trainings in 2012 was on average 75% to 25%. The beneÔ¨Åt of internal trainings is that they are designed to be focused on speciÔ¨Åc needs and as a combination of interactive and theoretical approach. 90% of internal trainings have a follow-up tests to ensure that the level of clarity and understanding is achieved through this process. This kind of approach provides a good return on investment in the training area. The CAS training Center in Sara Pazova which can accommodate some 50 participants at a time is a perfect venue for both internal and external tailor-made trainings. The ratio of Internal vs. external trainings is 67% vs 33% in 2012 and it will continue to follow similar trend in 2013 as well. VALUING TALENTS AND CAREER MANAGEMENT IN CAS The career management process which incorporates identiÔ¨Åcation of high-potential managers, assessment of managerial performance and preparations for the long-term succession planning was initiated in 2011 and is now an ongoing process. So far, almost 60 managers were assessed. For high-potential managers individual development plans were designed including international programmes and conferences. Individual programmes are tailor-made to suit particular needs of every manager for developing certain skills to bring them to the next level. 22 HEALTH CARE Cr√©dit Agricole Serbija Bank health policy provides responsible health care through the prevention of health risks. Therefor, Bank has provided in 2012, at its own expense, free medical examination for division managers, sector managers and department managers as well as for the employees over 40 years old. The rest of the employees had special discounts on medical services. Health care cooperation is done with health Medical Institution Dr. Ristiƒá and it is part of the Bank procedure rules since 2009. At Dr. Ristiƒá employees that are earlier mentioned can do free check ups for the most common stress related diseases. ‚ÄúFIRST CHANCE‚Äú FOLLOW-UP The National Employment Agency working programme called ‚ÄûFirst Chance‚Äú that Ô¨Årst started in 2010, with lasting period of 2 years, was canceled in 2012. Nevertheless students that started working in the Bank trough this programme during 2010 and 2011 have continued with their second year of work as it was planned within ‚ÄûFirst Chance‚Äú. The Ô¨Årst generation that started in 2010 had 11 participants. Among eleven of them, nine continued working in the Bank during 2012. In percentage 82% of the participants continued working in the Bank after they Ô¨Ånished with ‚ÄûFirst Chance‚Äú programme. The 2011 participants have yet to Ô¨Ånish their programme so that the Bank can offer them extension of cooperation. 23 RELATIONS WITH CLIENTS AND SUPPLIERS CORPORATE VIEW Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija provides strong Ô¨Ånancial support to top corporate clients both domestic and international tWell organized network consisting of 80 branches, 3 specialized corporate centers, in all major Serbian cities, are specially designed to satisfy all of our corporate clients‚Äô needs and demands.

KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE GROUP AND SHARING CORE VALUES The year started off with an Internal Communications campaign within Marketing and Communications with the aim of sharing knowledge, values and mission of the Cr√©dit Agricole Group. The campain is planned to last two years while in the Ô¨Årst one completing two phases and in 2013 the third phase concerning real implementation of corporate values. The Ô¨Årst phase that included knowledge sharing about the Group Ô¨Ånished with an interactive quiz for all employees and the winners, who proved to know the most about the Group, got very nice prizes. The second phase consisted of re-deÔ¨Åning internal corporate values and building awareness about them. The most important part was ensuring that all employees shared the same understanding of the values. The workshops 35 conducted by all line managers with their teams had an aim to listen to the team inputs and suggestions on how to best ‚Äòlive our values‚Äô in day-to-day work. This part of the campaign had an aim to build values and stimulate behavior change by internalizing the values among all employees. The third part of the corporate culture campaign is planned for 2013 with an aim to Ô¨Ånd Corporate Values Champions among the employees and celebrate desired behaviours. COMMERCIAL TOOL As of April 2012 all employees could follow the internal campaign Commercial Tool on the intranet that had an aim to familiarize the network with the tool, make it attractive to use and highlight the usefulness and beneÔ¨Åts of its various aspects. All employees could follow the phases of the project and they had a chance to hear opinions of trainers and also employees in branch ofÔ¨Åces regarding the new application. The project was very successfully implemented in Cr√©dit Agricole in Morocco, Poland and Ukraine. The reason for its implementation in Serbia is that Commercial Tool in a very efÔ¨Åcient way accomplishes several aims: Increase in sales efÔ¨Åciency ‚Äì this aim will be achieved by better preparation of meetings with clients, better selection of clients who will be offered a certain product and more transparent success records of the held meetings. Apart from that, permanent daily monitoring of the salespeople‚Äôs results, as well as permanent trainings in combination with all the other possibilities this tool provides, allow achieving this aim. Client relationships improvement and enhancement of the level of their satisfaction with the services of the Bank by systematic research of the client needs and their systematic recordings we will create a list of commercial events for each client and therefore will be in a position to offer them ‚Äúthe right product at the right time‚Äù! Decrease in the number of clients who decide to cease using the services of the Bank ‚Äì by preventing commercial events that could result in client dissatisfaction, systematic following of the number of achieved contacts with each client, we will signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çuence the level of client satisfaction and therefore the number of those clients who decide to use services of some other bank. COMMERCIAL CONTACT CENTRE In June, the project Commercial Contact Centre was successfully launched. It belongs to a group of projects very important for the Bank since it contributes to the improvement of quality communication with the clients. The aim for introducing the Contact Centre is twofold: on one hand qualitatively higher level of service and communication with clients, which encompasses timely gethering of accurate and precise information; while on the other hand achieving time savings for colleagues in the branch ofÔ¨Åces and allow them to provide more dedicated contacts to the clients in order to achieve more efÔ¨Åcient sales results. By the implementation of the Contact Centre our clients experience a service of different quality: apart from professional and efÔ¨Åcient approach which is the feature of a Contact Centre, our clients receive true care regarding satisfying their needs. We provide to our clients adequate information by phone in a timely manner, in line with the predeÔ¨Åned time frames while their requests, questions, and opinions are recorded and analysed in order to give a higher quality care of their needs and therefore initiate further activites towards business improvement. The project implements IVR (Interactive Voice Response), which provides quick and precise information to clients regarding their account balance, cashÔ¨Çow, exchange rate information and even blocking the cards if necessary. Naturally, the clients have an opportunity to have a live contact with the agent of Contact Centre and obtain information regarding products, campaigns and also support in connection with using e-banking or other services provided by the Bank. 36 An interesting fact to highlight is that the applications used by the agents in Contact Centre are integrated with Commercial Tool application which means that the agents are able to Ô¨Ånd out the clients‚Äô plans and to insert that data in this application. In this way, the Contact Centre will be in the function of sales support. By implementation of Contact Centre we expect that our colleagues in the branch ofÔ¨Åces experience signiÔ¨Åcant savings in time which will be then available for face to face communication with the clients and better meeting their needs in sales. Celebrations of Success In line with the new corporate values, there were quite a few celebrations in Retail business line regarding the best employees who already ‚Äòlived‚Äô all our values. After receiving the award for the most successful branch ofÔ¨Åce, we talked to our colleague, Branch Manager Vera Pesic on her views about the success of the branch, team work and important milestones. AWARD FOR THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BRANCH OFFICE BOR 5IFSFQSFTFOUBUJWFPGUIFXJOOJOHCSBODIPGmDF#PSXBTUIF#SBODI.BOBHFS7FSB1F√ùJƒ∞XIPSFDFJWFEBDVQGPS the great success of her team. Although the cup represents a symbolic award it is a great acknowledgment that the team that worked on reaching the targets achieved what it wanted and reached their success line. In order for a branch ofÔ¨Åce to achieve good results it certainly is important that the employees work as a team. How did you organise your team so that it performed so well? For good and successful work of a branch ofÔ¨Åce team work is essential. To accomplish this, every employee, team member has to give their maximum contribution. The team consists of humans and in team work happens that there is saturation, ups and downs. Team leader has to be available to compensate for the possible deÔ¨Åciencies. It is very important to know all the team members well. Our branch ofÔ¨Åce operates approximately 10 years. There were no employee Ô¨Çuctuations so the team is stable and rather well synchronised. To have the team working at a functional level the distribution of the tasks has to be precise, clear and well-balanced. It is very important that the leader‚Äôs relationship towards team members is equal. .T7FSB1F√ùJƒ∞BUIFSEFTLJO#SBODI0GmDF#PS 37 How motivating was the aim for you personally as a leader of your team? The success of every team member I experience as my own personal success and the succes of our branch ofÔ¨Åce. More successful employees will certainly contribute to the more successful work and performance of the branch ofÔ¨Åce. My motivation as a team leader is to run and manage a very successful branch ofÔ¨Åce and the team members who work there. Is there anything you would like to share with the colleagues regarding similar campaigns or actions in the future? One has to step into action immediately and without delay. Team work and persistance are very important in accomplishing a goal. The road to success is not always easy. It can be difÔ¨Åcult and full of obstacles. However, if there is motivation, wish, persistance and good relationships in the branch ofÔ¨Åce team, sooner or later the goal will be reached. When you reach your goal once, it becomes almost unacceptable not to reach it again. That is a source of new motivation when it comes to reaching goals in the future. Winning team of Branch OfÔ¨Åce Bor RESPONSIBLE AND STRUCTURED APPROACH TO CLIENTS In 2012 the Retail development continues to be based on the Client in focus concept which includes the early recognition of the clients‚Äô wishes and needs. Client in focus is realised through: t establishing the CRM Department t implementation of the tools for managing the sales force t continuous monitoring of client satisfaction t designing the product and service range in line with the client needs. ESTABLISHING THE CRM DEPARTMENT CRM Department is part of the Bank‚Äôs strategic orientation in which the operational level implements the mission of the Bank in the areas of marketing, sales, and products and services. That at its core encompasses the networking 38 strategy of the Bank with the technology, processes and employees in a unique and integrated approach to client. Accordingly, CRM Department is focused on creating customer loyalty, standardization and control of the relationship with the client, and managing customer information. The basic postulates of the CRM concept in the Bank are based on: t marketing oriented towards the client the entire business of the Bank is directed towards satisfying client needs better and faster t a proactive approach to clients through the creation of commercial events that signal to the sales force that the client is in a speciÔ¨Åc stage or point from which the sale may arise. Commercial events generated from the analysis of CRM Department and the available information the Bank holds about a client t one to one marketing which includes the development of personalized offers to each client based on the analysis of the identiÔ¨Åed needs. Personalized offer includes products with features tailored to the client: the type of product, product maturity, the currency of the product, the method of securing the loan and so on t interactive communication the recording of the history of the relationship with the client, we are able to track the genesis of the relationship and any subsequent communication is pre-designed, and therefore more efÔ¨Åcient and leads to further sales t multi-channel communication communication with the client through the channel that suits them the best, or is consistent with the purpose of communication. Current possibilities of communication are conducted through the branches, Contact Centre, SMS, e-mail and e-banking. SigniÔ¨Åcant results of the Department are expected to be achieved in 2013 through: t identifying and retaining the best clients in order to increase productivity and commercial visibility t a better understanding of clients and a speciÔ¨Åc access to clients, tailored to their speciÔ¨Åc needs t greater consistency between the expectations of clients that are very different, personalized offers and communication channels that are expected to further support expansion IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMERCIAL TOOLS FOR SALES FORCE MANAGEMENT The management of sales force and the management of sales processes is a challenge for any organization. The development and use of information technology, and improving management processes also led to advances in the management of sales processes that then contributed to better organization and planning, and ultimately lead to increased client satisfaction. 2012 was dedicated to the implementation of tools for managing sales force, which was the result of long-term operation and synergy of business and information technology. As the main objectives of the project were deÔ¨Åned: t Sales promotion thanks to a simple and transparent planning of sales time. Using the Agenda for the planning of their activities, the sellers are able to prepare for every sales meeting, and enter into the system all information about the held meeting to be used in future sales. t Proactive Sales early identiÔ¨Åcation of client needs and initiating the meeting, while all is supported by all the available information about the client, collected in the early stages of cooperation with the client in the system. Based on the analysis of information the conclusions are drawn about the probability of sales incidents due to a life stage in which the client is or based on the products the client uses. t Automated monitoring of sales activities through custom reporting adjusted to the positions in the branches, and organizational levels. Reports are used for improving the work of individual sellers, and organizational units (branches, regions, network) 39 Developing long-term client relations let us with identifying needs based on the information in the system, the preparation for the meeting, where the seller is able to prepare for the meeting and thus prepare the bid in accordance with the potential of the particular client (product, maturity, currency, etc.). Personal contacts and proactive approach initiated by the seller, are the key to greater customer satisfaction. Last year was dedicated to the implementation of the software, and the training of employees in branch ofÔ¨Åces, which were different for different positions of employees. In 2013 signiÔ¨Åcant effects are expected in the following areas: t The development of stable and proactive relationship with the client by: timproving relations and monitoring of clients‚Äô needs t improving the quality of sales t increasing customer satisfaction t Increase of sales opportunities and multi-sales o the assumption is that more contacts would lead to higher sales o easing the burden of non-sales activities for the sales force and thus better focus on sales o the sales force is able to plan their time through the alarms that signal to the advisers all the key moments in the life cycle of the client MEASURING CLIENT SATISFACTION Client satisfaction is an indicator of how well the Bank‚Äôs products and services meet client expectations. In the banking sector, client satisfaction is related to the experience in the use of banking products and services, and represents a strict predictor of client retention, creating loyalty and re-use of products and services. Well-planned and executed client satisfaction survey for the Bank has the following beneÔ¨Åts: t Identify the needs of clients t Lowered costs due to: o communication with the targeted segment o tailor-made products and services per client o harmonized prices with the abilities of the client segment t Work organization and organisational structures are directed towards the client ‚Äì this is a prerequisite for faster and more efÔ¨Åcient delivery of services and products to clients t Indicates areas with room for improvement and thus reduces the client dissatisfaction In 2012, the Bank continued with the tradition of the survey of client satisfaction. The circumstances in which the Bank operates, as well as the difÔ¨Åcult economic situation, were reÔ¨Çected in the survey results. Although the overall customer satisfaction index remained the same, the sensitivity rating regarding the price of products and services became more pronounced. Traditionally, the best were rated the Cooperation with the branches, as well as with their Relationship Managers. Clients have expressed their intention to continue and expand their cooperation with the Bank, but also to recommend the Bank to their friends. The Bank will prepare an Action Plan for the areas in which the survey indicated that there is room for improvement to even better meet the needs of its clients. 40 PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DEVELOPMENT FOR PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS The development of socially responsible products in times of crisis: ReÔ¨Ånancing loans with longer repayment period as compared to the previous year, helping clients to relax their monthly credit obligations in the period of economic stagnation. Insurance products that insure the loans -JCFSUF JTBVOJRVFQSPEVDUUIBUHJWFTDMJFOUTUIFPQQPSUVOJUZUPTBWFJO&VSPTBOEMPBOJOEPNFTUJDDVSSFODZ  that is Dinars and therefore avoid the risk of the Ô¨Çuctuation of the exchange rate Credit Card intended for ‚Äúsmall‚Äù purchases, interest free for clients In collaboration with partners car dealers, CAS prepared a CAR Loan with 0% interest rates to stimulate the purchase of new cars, which are also the most economical and which do not pollute the environement as much as used cars. Developing products for investing in the future: Package account for students, which gives the possibility of full operational banking practices of our students, and the gradual introduction of banking products and services In addition to the package account, in collaboration with partners CAS allowed all students who use our account to enjoy the numerous discounts on various products and services carefully selected to meet their speciÔ¨Åc needs. Discounts are valid for CAS partners with the purchase payment card that is part of the package. Savings account designed for children with very attractive interest rates offers parents the opportunity to start saving for the future and investing in the future of their children. Since this savings plan has smaller monthly payments ‚ÄúKids savings‚Äú gives the full Ô¨Çexibility and planning opportunities for parents. Developing products for raising environmental awareness of our clients: In cooperation with the Government of Republic of Serbia, Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija was among the Ô¨Årst banks that launched the loan for improving the energy efÔ¨Åciency of households, with extremly favorable Ô¨Ånancing conditions. In the coming year that will be full of challenges, CAS will continue its mission of commitment to client needs, and social and environmental responsibility. For this reason we will continue to develop products and services fully adapted to the demands of the market, economic and social situation in the region, and to continually expand the mission of green banking. 41 Small Business Enterprises Number of SBE Managers 45 Head of SBE Business Line Head of SBE Head of SBE Head of SBE Credit Commercial Business Support Department Department Department The market situation in the past few years was highly disadvantageous to the segment of SBE clients. When the Ô¨Ånancial crisis hit hard, among the Ô¨Årst to suffer were small business enterprises by shrinking their businesses, letting off people or closing down their entire businesses. High risk was associated with this segment of clients. However, in Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija it was decided to give special attention to this segment of clients because although struggling, they still offer a buffer zone between the big companies and state owned companies and provide jobs for a signiÔ¨Åcant number of people and their families. Recognizing SBE clients‚Äô needs in a difÔ¨Åcult market environment Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija has doubled the production towards the segment of Small and Micro SBE clients. Listening to clients and recognizing their real needs, SBE Sector has offered RSD loans for liquidity with the best conditions at the market. The range of products was tailor-made for SBE in a struggling market situation and resulted in much higher client satisfaction with the products than the previous year. Also, the products that enhance business and are free of charge are highly appreciated and they are developed in the segment of card business. CAS COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING CHILDREN‚ÄôS RIGHTS 42 CAS CHILDREN‚ÄôS PARTNER Article 2 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that: ‚ÄòAll the rights in the Convention apply to children without discrimination.‚Äô Addressing inequalities and valuing diversity Children have a right to environments where they do not experience discrimination. To achieve this, inclusion is essential. We at Cr√©dit Agricole believe that inclusion is a process of identifying, understanding, and breaking down the barriers to participation and belonging. That is why our projects are mainly aimed at raising awareness of the public regarding these issues. Children are individuals. We at Cr√©dit Agricole believe that to enable them to construct the multiple aspects of their identities and to be proud of themselves, children must be supported from an early age. They must also be able to admire and respect the uniqueness of others. By supporting children‚Äôs rights in the early years, we can do something to make society a better place for future generations to live and work, with each individual being valued for who they are and who they want to be. We at Cr√©dit Agricole decided to continue and broaden our cooperation with schools for children with disabilities and special educational needs. As of 2012, there are 32 schools we cooperate with throughout Serbia. Article 27 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that: ‚ÄòChildren have the right to a standard of living that helps them develop fully.‚Äô Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija has chosen to stay committed to supporting children‚Äôs rights. Fighting various kinds of exclusion, especially in a difÔ¨Åcult Ô¨Ånancial environment, we have realised that it is more than ever important to integrate children and their rights into our core commitments. In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations has proclaimed that childhood is entitled to special care and assistance. We strongly believe that every child has the right to a childhood that is not burdened with hunger, poverty and exclusion. There are more than 5000 children in those 32 schools we cooperate with who solely depend on the state care and we are aware that in a situation when resources are scarce, every little bit can help a great deal. Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija is a bank fully dedicated to helping children with special needs and children in socially vulnerable situations by organising projects that are inclusive, educational and socially relevant because in the long run, they strive towards problem-solving. All our projects for children are long-term ones and there are several components that we especially value: tpartnerships with business and NGO sectors tstronger ties to the local communities by connecting with the social services centres in city administrations tbuilding very good relationships with the network of schools for children with special needs around the country tencouraging the employees to participate in projects as volunteers teducating the employees and the citizens about children with special needs tbuilding strong corporate culture and culture of tolerance, respect and dignity within the Bank. 43 CREDITS TO OUR PARTNERS IN 2012 Highly valued and respected business partner in Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija‚Äôs projects: METRO CASH & CARRY Magic Breakfast Christmas Shoebox Invalulable in logistics and volunteer support in Magic Breakfast FOOD BANK SERBIA and Christmas Shoebox projects EfÔ¨Åcient and professional support in inviting socially vulnerable CITY DEPARTMENT OF THE SOCIAL children, children with single parents, children in foster homes, WELFARE BELGRADE children in safe houses etc. to the event: Christmas Shoebox in Belgrade Support in inviting socially vulnerable children to enjoy: RED CROSS NOVI SAD Christmas Shoebox in Novi Sad Support in inviting children from Safe Houses and children with CITY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL single parents to enjoy: PROTECTION NI≈† $ISJTUNBT4IPFCPYJO/J√ù For giving the big conference hall that can seat 2000 people for SAVA CENTAR BELGRADE the Christmas play for 1400 children and their parents to enjoy free of charge For giving the premises free of charge to use for the theatre play NOVI SAD FAIR ‚Äì NOVOSADSKI SAJAM and Christmas presents for 200 children and their parents to enjoy Suport in creativity ‚Äì interactive, educational, tailor made theaBALKAN NOVI POKRET ‚Äì THEATRE tre play featuring Good Fairy Dobrila, (Bank‚Äôs Good Fairy featurBELGRADE ing in every project with children) in each of Christmas Shoebox SCHOOLS FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS BENEFICIARIES OF THE HUMANITARIAN ACTION MAGIC BREAKFAST HELD TWICE A YEAR Belgrade region O≈† Heroj Pinki ‚Äì Baƒçka Palanka 0√Ä#P√ùLP#VIB O≈† 6.

This year‚Äôs action covers more than 2000 children in Serbia. In the name of the children who receive CAS Christmas Shoeboxes, thank you for your support, assistance and participation. Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija and the company METRO Cash & Carry Srbija, in cooperation with the Secretariat for Social Welfare of the City Administration of the City of Belgrade and NGO Food Bank have organised a charity event Christmas Shoebox, so that children from socially vulnerable families and children without parental care could feel the joy of the holidays and got their Christmas presents together with our message that they are not forgotten or invisible. CHRISTMAS SHOEBOX NOVI SAD Part of colleagues from Novi Sad instead of a Christmas Shoebox opted for sweet Christmas package On Thursday, 13th December 2012 in a conference hall of Novosadski sajam for the second time there was organized Christmas Shoebox event for children that suffer from cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy.

We will write this one together: take on the most beautiful role and be a Good Fairy Dobrila in the lives of children who need help.‚Äù This year‚Äôs traditional charity event Christmas Shoebox started in November 2012 when all employees of the Bank were invited to Ô¨Åll up empty shoeboxes with sweets and toys and wrap them nicely for the children who were forgotten by the Santa Claus. Annually we try to have more photographs of colleagues who bring in their Christmas Shoeboxes but it is really not an easy task.

In this way, CA Leasing Srbija accompanied a social mission of Cr√©dit Agricole Bank that is active in advocating children‚Äôs rights. Recognising the need of the organisation maliVElikiLjudi for a vehicle and a wish of CA Leasing Srbija to get more involved in CSR projects, Cr√©dit Agricole Bank was the intermediary that connected the two organisations. We asked Mr Marko Ignjatovic, Director CA Leasing Srbija how this human gesture came to life? CA Leasing Srbija is a young company that so far did not have the chance to more actively research the needs of the local community. Colleagues from Cr√©dit Agricole Bank helped us here since they have long-standing relationships with NGOs that are advocating children‚Äôs rights or Ô¨Åghting poverty. As soon as we found out that maliVElikiLjudi have a need for a vehicle we have provided a car of a make ≈†koda Roomster which is completely ready for the roads that lead to children‚Äôs homes. 57 Marko Ignjatoviƒá, Director CA Leasing Srbija and Marija Petroviƒá Vujinoviƒá, Vice President of NGO maliVElikiLjudi 3B√ùLP5PNB√ùFWJƒ∞ )FBEPG.BSLFUJOH$PNNVOJDBUJPOT$S√èEJU HSJDPMF#BOLBEEFE Since the day Cr√©dit Agricole Bank operates at this market it is active in the projects of corporate social responsibility.

Cr√©dit Agricole Bank is making an effort whenever it can and recognises the need to help different organisations and institutions as well as individuals. DONATION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF FOOD BANK Our partner in projects for socially and developmentally vulnerable children is Food Bank. In order to show our support to this humanitarian organisation we are Ô¨Ånancing part of their administrative costs on an annual basis. It is very important for us to contribute to the organisations we believe in because that is the basis for long and sustainable development and growth while solving problems of hunger and poverty. Having trustworthy partners in projects is the prerequisite of reaching more people and children who really need our help.

CR√âDIT AGRICOLE HELPED TREASURE HUNT RALLY At the premises of the Home for children and youth without parental care ‚ÄúDrinka Pavloviƒá‚Äù in Belgrade on 24th May 2012 the donations collected for the Treasure Hunt Rally were given to the Home.

Rally was organized as a sign of French-Serbian friendship and for the beneÔ¨Åciary, Home for children and youth Drinka Pavlovic, Belgrade. EMPLOYEE INITIATIVE VOLOUNTEERING PROGRAMMES Volunteering initiative among employees was the most popularised by the CSR projects Magic Breakfast and Christmas Shoebox. In Magic Breakfast employees took an active part by animating the professional buyers at METRO Cash & Carry and explained the aim of the charity event. The better they explained, the higher the sales of prepared packages went. In Christmas Shoebox there was a different kind of volunteering ‚Äì it included time and some Ô¨Ånancial efforts. The employees needed to buy items for children who are not used to getting presents for Christmas because getting food was a struggle enough. They then placed the items into a shoebox, wrapped it up and brought it to the Bank. 60 All the collected shoeboxes were shipped to the Centre for Social Protection to be distributed to the most socially vulnerable children. Corporate Volunteering Award Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija received an award for Magic Breakfast The Corporate Volunteering Awards winners Corporate Volunteering Awards for 2012 were given on Thursday 27th September at the award giving ceremony in O.U.R. Bar in Belgrade. The award giving ceremony is organized for the second time by Business Leaders Forum Serbia and SMart kolektiv in cooperation with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and Institute for Sustainable Communities (ISC). The awards are given with the aim to recognize and promote companies which apart from investing Ô¨Ånancially also invest the time and skills of their employees into the development of the local community. The jury composed of representatives of government institutions, companies, NGOs and international organisations decided to give the awards to the winning companies: In the category The Most Successful Partnership in the Local Community, that awards best partnerships between companies and NGOs for the volunteering programs, the winners are Credit Agricole Srbija and Metro Cash & Carry for the program ‚ÄúMagic Breakfast‚Äù, which is done in partnership with the Food Bank and aims to draw attention to the necessity of inclusion of the children with special needs into the society. 61 Left to right: Veronika Puncheva, President of the Board of Directors of METRO Cash & Carry, Jelena Popoviƒá, Head of Corporate Communications METRO, Radmila Ivetiƒá, President of the Food Bank, Baldomero Valverde, $&0$SFEJU HSJDPMF4SCJKB #SBOB-J√ùJƒ∞ *OUFSOBM$PNNVOJDBUJPOTBOE$43.BOBHFSBOE4POKB*WBOJ√ùFWJƒ∞ Coordinator for Donors, Food Bank ‚ÄûCompanies that were given awards today successfully show that advanced business practices can at the same time contribute to the solution of the problems in the society as well.

The Award Giving Ceremony for Corporate Volunteering Awards had a charity character as well ‚Äì managers of the company members of Business Leaders Forum together with the bartenders of O.U.R. bar prepared refreshments for all present and the donations collected for drinks are donated to the Shelter for adults and seniors in Belgrade, on 1st October, International Seniors‚Äô Day. Adopt a School Credit Agricole Srbija has been recognized as a bank that advocates and promotes children‚Äôs rights. In line with this commitment there was a new employee engagement project initiated under the name Adopt a School. The idea is simple ‚Äì every employee was offered an opportunity to decide how much money they would like to donate from their monthly salary ‚Äì RSD 50, 100, 150 (equivalent of 0.5 Euro cents to 1.5 Euro) or some other sum and that would be deducted from their monthly salaries until July 2013. The project started in October 2012 and the Bank matched the employees‚Äô donation with a sum to cover New Year celebration at the adopted school for children with special needs ‚ÄòDusan Dugalic‚Äô in Belgrade. In this school as in other schools for children with special needs, 80% of children belong to the socially most vulnerable category because their parents are Ô¨Ånancially unstable. Credit Agricole Srbija employees adopted all 92 children from the school and they receive school meals twice a week thanks to this donation. The meal plan was agreed with the nutritionist from the school and the local bakery famous for its high quality products. 62 The added value nobody could predict when starting this project was that even those children who due to their disabilities were reluctant to chew and therefore on liquid food all this time, started chewing sandwiches with grilled vegetables seeing that their friends are doing the same. They found them ‚Äòfancy‚Äô and very delicious and they stayed motivated to do what other children in a school did ‚Äì enjoyed their meals. In this way, the employees of Cr√©dit Agrciole Srbija are hoping to help spreading healthy eating habits among school children and goodwill. To show the appreciation of this humanitarian gesture towards children, every employee will receive a special, personalised Letter of Thanks to serve as a reminder that our little personal donations can help children not go hungry in schools. BELhospice 2012: 4th Humanitarian Football Tournament The charitable football tournament raised over 9,000 Euros for the care of terminally ill cancer patients. The winner of the tournament is the company Metro Cash & Carry. BELhospice organized the fourth charitable football tournament at the courts of the Sports Centre Kovilovo on 23rd June. The tournament is traditionally organised annually and this year the tournament raised more than 9,000 Euros for palliative care of cancer patients. Credit Agricole team: Svetozar Krstiƒá, Milan Pena, Stevan Brkiƒá, Vladimir Milanoviƒá, Miroslav Javorina, Lazar Milanoviƒá, Srƒëan Todoroviƒá The Golden sponsor of the event was Actavis.

The tournament was also supported by the donations by: Coca Cola HBC, Nelt, Association of football referees of Belgrade, Galant company and a long standing host of the tournament, Sports Center Kovilovo. The Ô¨Årst strike at the tournament belonged to the famous commentator Ivan Zeljkoviƒá who also commented on all the matches and took care that the tournament went without a glitch and in fair play. Our matches scored as follows: Metro C&C Cr√©dit Agricole 1-0, KPMG-Cr√©dit Agricole 3-3, Pharmanova-Cr√©dit Agricole 2-0.

First Cup for Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija ‚Äì Francophonie 2012 ‚Äì our Bank Football Team with the team of Societe Generale 64 This year our Bank Football Team won the Cup by winning over all the contestants they had matches with. In competition of 9 teams our football team managed to climb the ladder of success by winning all the opponents except for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, last year‚Äôs winner, with whom they played tie. This year our Bank Football Team had an afternoon slot of matches in the second group, so they could play the matches scheduled for regular Banking League and in full capacity come to the afternoon matches to play the Francophonie tournament. The semi Ô¨Ånals were tense because the Embassy of Bulgaria fought tirelessly not to lose from Cr√©dit Agricole, but in the end they lost the match from the immaculately played penalties of our team. Our Bank Football Team during a moment of rest before the match with Societe Generale The Ô¨Ånal match was played against the team of Societe Generale and according to the Team Captain Miodrag Topaloviƒá, routinely won by 4:1 and won the Ô¨Årst place and the Cup of Francophonie 2012.

We have initiated this charity action with a wish to repeat it annually because our collected clothes are delivered to homes for children and adults with special needs. Apart from the fact that our clothes bring smiles to the faces of those who live in homes, we also know that with just a little bit of good will we did something nice for those in need. Jelena Lazoviƒá and Srƒëan Todoroviƒá Biljana Vidakoviƒá 66 The response from the colleagues was excellent ‚Äì in Novi Sad up until mid-week there were 28 big bags of clothes collected, while in Belgrade around 20, whereas some colleagues decided to take their clothes directly to the nearest METRO. Mina Pavloviƒá Vladimir Maloviƒá Vesna ƒêuranoviƒá /BUB√ùB,SJ√ùBOPW Colleagues mainly did not want to be photographed, but when we explained that in order to promote this action and draw attention to the fact that this too is a part of volunteering, they agreed. In order to bring clean, packed clothes it is necessary to allocate a couple of hours to decide what ‚Äôgoes‚Äô and what ‚Äôstays‚Äô in our closets. 67 Branka Podunavac Bojana Steviƒá Nela Vujkov Prentoviƒá Marija Iliƒá Mirjana Stanisavljeviƒá Just a small part of collected clothes 68 All colleagues will be notiÔ¨Åed when the handover of clothes will be in the homes for children and in case there are volunteers from Cr√©dit Agricole to join us and spend a couple of hours with the children we would be glad to record that event as well.

ECOLOGY: SWIFT & CAS Cooperation on Recycling Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija and Cooperative for Collecting Secondary Raw Materials and Their Recycling SWIFT1 ( Sustainable Waste-management Initiative For healthier Tomorrow ) started the realisation of their cooperation deÔ¨Åned in the agreement on solving the problem of commercial and packaging waste within the Bank in 2011. The project proved to be successful and it was broadened to encompass more branch ofÔ¨Åces in Belgrade and in 69 Novi Sad. The data about collected waste paper is made available to all employees. 11.009 kg waste paper collected from Head OfÔ¨Åces and Branch ofÔ¨Åces in Belgrade and Novi Sad Although SWIFT 1 is not the only organisation that is in this type of recycling business, the reason Cr√©dit Agricole Srbija has chosen this institution is the fact that they employ Roma population.This contributes to the solution of the poverty problem and at the same time adds to social integration of the marginalised and especially vulnerable population. The project is under the auspices of the UN World Health Organisation and has full support of our Bank. New Year‚Äôs Parties for Employees‚Äô Children One of the tasks of Internal Communications is to organise a New Year‚Äôs parties for employee‚Äôs children. Since CAS is actively supporting children‚Äôs rights, we are supporting our employees‚Äô children‚Äôs rights to have great New Year celebrations. December is traditionally a month dedicated to children, festivities and fun and this year we organised four New Year‚Äôs parties for the employee‚Äôs children in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Nis and Kragujevac. The theatre play which ends with Santa Claus giving out presents is the most awaited event among the children and a chance for parents to socialise with each other in a relaxed and festive setting. This year, we also had a ‚Äôreal‚Äô clown who greeted the little ones giving out chocolates and sweets before the play with Good Fairy Dobrila and Little Red Riding Hood started. As we did last year, all the employees-parents were asked if they agreed that in case they, or their colleagues did not collect the sweet package for their child, the package would be collected by the Food Bank and given to charity. All the parents agreed, so for the second year, no sweet package is ‚Äôhomeless‚Äô. 2 H BOLD HEAD LIGHT Cr√©dit Agricole 2012 CSR report
