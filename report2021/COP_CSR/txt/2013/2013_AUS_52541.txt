En Masse’s Support for the UN Global Compact At the end of 2010 and within its first year of operations, En Masse proudly became a signatory to the UN Global Compact. En Masse is a wellbeing company. We provide mental health, Equal Opportunity, Human Rights and behaviour change programs to businesses, government and schools. Our activities since our 20112COP have included: • Developing and delivering workplace training programs that help people to develop and apply practical skills towards respecting, protecting and promoting anti-­‐discrimination practices; • Providing training in Equal Opportunity that is based upon a behaviour change model that is sustainable; • Assisting people in workplaces to interact with other people in a way that optimises mental health outcomes; • Teaching people practical ways to stand up for their rights at work, as well as protect other people’s rights; • Teaching managers and leaders how to spot the behavioural warning signs in their teams and take proactive measures to reduce the risks that people in their teams may have their rights abused; • Building a pro bono online anti-­‐bullying program for schools; • Building competency across numerous organisations in responding responsibly to mental health and other individual crises; and • Rolled out a vicarious trauma reduction program for the Australian Government; • Provided pro bono advice and over 100 hour of individual coaching to numerous non-­‐profit organisations, NGO and social enterprise community leaders. On a day to day basis, En Masse encourages all people with whom our organisation comes into contact to behave in a way that respects human rights: through their everyday interactions, by becoming self-­‐aware and more concerned about the impacts that their behaviours have on other individuals and their communities, and by looking after their own mental wellbeing. 2 We are pleased to present this, our second Communication on Progress under the United Nations Global Compact, and look forward to the many exciting opportunities that we have identified to make further progress towards the UNGC’s 10 Principles during the next year of our signatory status. Mark Dean Managing Director 13 December 2013 3 2. En Masse’s Progress in Supporting the UNGC’s 10 Principles 2.1 Human Rights • Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; • Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses En Masse has demonstrated its commitment to human rights through its business activities in the following ways: 1. We have embedded human rights education principles into our core business activities. Through workshops and online training programs, we teach people, including our business and government clients how to take active responsibility for respecting and promoting human rights at work; 2. Contributing to the human rights education of people working within government. In 2013, En masse has continued its work as a provider of workplace training services to Federal Australian and Victorian Government clients and through this avenue, we are actively engaged in programs that assist government executives to understand and discharge responsibly their roles to respect, protect and promote human rights through their workplaces policies, leadership practices and decision making processes that have the capacity to impact on human rights; 3. En Masse has developed an online human rights training eLearning module for people predominantly in workplaces which is also now being explored by secondary schools for use by legal studies classrooms. The En Masse Human Rights Launch Pad teaches students about the historical and social contexts in which human rights are founded, as well as modern context in terms of international human rights laws. It covers the main international instruments such as the UDHR ICCPR, the ICESCR as well as a number of the conventions dealing with specific human rights abuses and vulnerable group. In 2013, we provided this program license fee free to the Victorian Government through its VPSCIIN initiative; 4. En Masse has developed a number of unique online training programs that deal with specific areas of vulnerability based on human rights education principles. These programs deal with reducing incidences of harassment and bulling in the workplace and have been rolled out across a number of service industry organisations; 5. En Masse has built and rolled out numerous face-­‐to-­‐face workplace mental wellness programs. Each of these workshops is based upon building practical skills that enable people 4 to prevent mental health problems from occurring or escalating, as well as providing early intervention strategies to reduce risks where mental health problems are present. During 2013, En Masse became the mental health partner to Bupa Australia – this has provided us with an opportunity to help thousands of people in Australia to improve their mental health through a suite of face to face and online programs; 6. All of En Masse’s programs, whether delivered online or through face-­‐to-­‐face workshops, embed assessment processes that test the effectiveness of our programs in terms of increased skills and awareness. Each of our programs to date has delivered very pleasing results that have led to ongoing uptake by our clients by way of demand for additional products and services that target the building of respectful workplace cultures and reducing the risks associated with bullying, sexual harassment and other forms of discrimination, while improving mental health outcomes. 5 2.2 Labour • Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; • Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; • Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labour; and • Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. En Masse is a small and relatively new organisation that focuses on the provision of professional services and related online training and awareness raising products. Therefore we are fortunate not to have to face many of the labour related human rights issues that many organisations face by virtue of the nature of their labour force as well as their operations. However, in relation to upholding the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, En Masse is particularly active in promoting this principle within the business and government community. Each of our corporate training programs that deals with workplace behaviours (these represent around 70% of our source of revenue) refers to equal opportunity and anti-­‐discrimination as a central guiding principle that enables among other things, increased productivity in workplaces, better mental health outcomes among all stakeholders, and decreased legal and operational risks. En Masse also embraces non-­‐discriminatory hiring practices and offers flexible work arrangements to suit parents and carers. Our small workforce in Australia comprises employees and contractors who come from a variety of minority groups based on ethnicity, sexuality, non-­‐ English speaking first language and Aboriginality. More than 60% of our permanent and contract workforce (including shareholder directors) are female. 6 2.3 Environment • Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; • Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and • Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. En Masse and its employees are committed to the protection of our environment. Our policy is to reduce En Masse’s environmental footprint in the following key areas: • Reduce our consumption of resources, such as paper, plastic, electricity and water. • Find more sustainable sources for all our consumables. • Reduce waste and recycle paper, plastic, glass, metal and toner cartridges. • Reduce travel through telephone and video-­‐conferencing. • Promote sustainable procurement. • Encourage use of public transport Our commitment to sustainability is embraced and driven by senior management, and we have a dedicated green office coordinator to ensure progress is being made. En Masse also augmented in 2013 a Sustainable Procurement Policy, the aim of which is to take into account the environmental, ethical and social credentials of our suppliers. This has resulted in us changing over 20% of our suppliers. En Masse has a relatively small carbon footprint, but with a strong commitment to sustainability we have undertaken the following measures to reduce the environmental impact of operations and services provided: • Office now using only Energy Star appliances; • Use of Skype video conferencing for interstate and international client meetings wherever possible to reduce the requirement for air travel; • Introduction of electronic filing systems to reduce the need for paper files; • Implementation of in-­‐house office paper recycling systems; • Office waste (including eWaste) and recycling systems in place; • The purchasing of recycled paper products (including printing paper, paper towels etc.); 7 • Use of environmentally friendly cleaning products; • A preference to work with Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified printers; • Staff encouraged to bring their own lunches and use non disposable coffee cups (free Keep Cups provided to staff); • We encourage staff to ride to work and car pool; • Minimise use of air-­‐conditioning • Key reason for choosing new office location was proximity to public transport (train and tram within 100 meters); • Staff are encouraged to turn off equipment when not in use; • Surplus office supplies and IT hardware are donated to charity 2.4 Anti-­‐Corruption • Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. En Masse is committed through its internal and external activities to ensuring that wherever En Masse and its people operate, we reduce the risks of corruption, extortion and bribery. Our principle methods for ensuing this are: A. Training programs that are ran regularly to ensure that our people understand the 10 principles including with respect to Anti-­‐Corruption; and B.
