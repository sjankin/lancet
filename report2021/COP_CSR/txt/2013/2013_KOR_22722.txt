It wouldn‚Äôt be necessary to list all the epithets that describe KB as you already know them well. I feel As many people know, ‚ÄúRockStar Zone‚Äù is a new branch channel designed to attract young very comfortable with KB. I think this feeling of comfortableness comes from KB‚Äôs organizational customers who are crucial for our future growth and to create a young and dynamic culture. I find culture. Compared to other industries, the financial industry is unique in that sustainable growth is it rewarding to hear from young customers that KB is getting younger and appealing to them as unthinkable without the understanding of customers and relationships with them. a new image and such comments strengthen my resolve to provide them with better services. In this regard, I believe KB already has core competencies in both services at customer contact KF Financial Group, from what I experienced for the past three years, is an organization full of points and customer-centric business process. I think one of the preconditions for being a passion and the spirit of challenge towards its goals. All the employees care for the company and sustainable business is being a virtuous company. Whenever I hear news about a company‚Äôs Oh Yoon Dong, Park Kyung Wook, the company has the philosophy that gives priority to talented manpower. I firmly believe that their CEO of Hanlim Architecture social contribution activities, the first thing that comes to mind is that whether the activities will be manager of KB Kookmin common goal of ‚Äúgrowing into a global financial group leading the Asian financial industry‚Äù will be Group effective or whether the company is really serious about it. Bank‚Äôs Yonsei University ‚ÄúRockStar Zone‚Äù achieved no matter what. I look forward to your support and guidance for KB Financial Group. KB, in this regard, seems to be serious about helping low-income individuals and other disadvantaged people. I hope that KB continues to contribute to developing the Korean financial industry further and win the trust of all stakeholders. 14 15 Business Partner External Expert What is Win-Win? Sustainability Management Must be Incorporated into Corporate Strategy One of the social topics of increasing attention is mutual growth. Whereas everyone agrees that our society should pursue mutual growth, in reality it is difficult to achieve mutual growth I think KB Financial Group carries out a high level of sustainability activities commensurate with satisfying both large companies and SMEs or both people who have powers and people who its reputation as the leading financial institution in Korea. The Group is already in the industry don‚Äôt at the same time. Although a variety of solutions to achieve mutual growth are presented, I leadership position in many aspects, as indicated by its inclusion as a component in the think the real solution would be found easily in a sense. Sung Shin Planning has supplied outdoor Dow Johns Sustainability Asia Pacific Index for three consecutive years. In my opinion, more signboards, indoor signs and POP displays to KB for 20 years and I have never seen one of my fundamental approach to KB Financial Group‚Äôs social responsibility lies not only in curtailing its Lee Dong Jin, employees losing sleep over unreasonable demand or unfair contract terms in their dealings with Kim Dong Soo, carbon footprint or engaging directly in social contribution activities but also in seeking ways CEO of Sung Shin Planning Co.

Many studies conducted in recent years provide channels work for business partners. Nowadays it seems as if our employees were KB‚Äôs honorary statistical proof that companies showing good sustainability performance also produce good ambassadors. I kindly ask for your continued support for mutual growth of KB Financial Group financial results. KB Financial Group will be able to boost its reputation as well as become a and Sung Shin Planning. more attractive company to investors when it pays more attention to sustainability and aligns sustainability with its key strategies. 01 )LQDQFHWKDW3XWV3HRSOH We want to make a better world where everyone can enjoy happiness EHIRUH$Q\WKLQJ(OVH As a leader in Korea‚Äôs financial industry, KB Financial Group strives to increase customer satisfaction through differentiated customer relations management.

Stepping into the branch, I was surprised to find the interior quite different from other banks. Music was playing and there were a laptop computer, a tablet PC and even the latest mobile phone on the table. I even wondered if they could handle all of the usual banking transactions. Since then, I‚Äôve been going to the branch to use the seminar room there, instead of spending money to have a study meeting at a coffee shop, and I stop by the branch occasionally just to drink coffee.
