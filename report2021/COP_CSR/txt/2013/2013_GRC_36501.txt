By 2030 two thirds of the world’s inhabitants will be living in towns and cities. Development at this unprecedented scale entails a number of major challenges for the entire construction industry. In Greece 61.4% of the population live in urban environments. In 2030 this rate of urban population is estimated to reach 69%. The built environment will therefore be at the center of many social and environmental challenges, ranging from health and quality of life to climate change, energy efficiency of buildings, waste management and resource consumption. These issues are core to our business. We work towards designing more eco-efficient and cost-effective products and solutions and ensuring sustainable sourcing for our operations. 1 Sustainable Construction and cities p.22 2 Sustainable Supply Chain p.24 “Smart Park” the first hybrid Retail Park, in Greece.

HydromediaTM is a concrete of very high permeability and as so, it absorbs rainwater and facilitates its natural drainage. The surface remains practically dry and the wastewater drainage and network does not become overloaded. The soil breathes and maintains a normal level of humidity. In an urban environment damp ground soil retains its load bearing capacity, but when it dries out it can present a hazard for buildings. HydromediaTM therefore ensures cost reduction for flood control facilities as well as better use of land. It is a great solution for parking spaces, pedestrian alleys, pavements or for landscaping. Among its other benefits, it offers a durable floor with very low cost of maintenance and high aesthetics as it comes in a variety of colors.

We have developed many initiatives in the recent years related to this practice, which we call Industrial Ecology. This is helping us eliminate waste and reduce the overall environmental footprint of our operations. The goal shared with the Lafarge Group within sustainability ambitions 2020 is to make a net positive contribution to society and nature through improvement in the key areas of climate, water, air, raw materials and energy.
