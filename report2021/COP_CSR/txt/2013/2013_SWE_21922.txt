The telecom sector has been the dominant client sector for Cybercom for many years, but has declined relative to the other sectors as IT-based communication solutions become a major part of any business activity.

CYBERCOM · SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 · PAGE 7 Governance and manage­ment of CSR work Cybercom’s sustainability work is led ultimately by the company’s executive team and is governed primarily by the company’s codes of conduct for employees and suppliers. requirements and expectations regarding our sustainability work. This includes minimising environmental impact. Furthermore, the code should address the dilemmas that Cybercom encounters in its daily activities. It is very important for employees and partners to know where Cybercom stands on issues such as workers’ rights, and desired behaviour in terms of ethics and morality in business. In 2012, the executive team decided to develop Employee Standards and Leadership Profile, frameworks for employees and managers that reflect the company’s vision and values as the sustainable IT company. These standards will be rolled out in 2013 and provide instruments for governing the company’s sustainability work going forward.

Each year, all the employees in the company are invited to apply, and three are selected. They are given in-depth training in Cybercom’s CSR work and also visit Cybercom’s community engagement projects. Ambassadors play a key role in implementing and explaining Cybercom’s CSR work to colleagues, clients and other stakeholders. This implementation work includes the CSR ambassadors recounting Cybercom’s CSR work internally, including via our intranet and newsletters, as well as externally when Cybercom is invited to give talks about our CSR work. Ambassadors give lectures, blog in Cybercom’s newsroom on the Web and address the key CSR issues for internal and external discussion. During the year, the focus of the CSR ambassadors has been the question of how Cybercom can spread the commitment to sustainability issues throughout the organisation and at the same time capture ideas from around the offices. The result is that in 2013 Cybercom will propose that all office managers take responsibility for, channel and measure the sustainability work in the organisation. The objective of this is to better utilise and implement sustainability initiatives throughout the organisation. Salla Heinänen, CSR ambassador, in Rwanda.
