The merger of Nichimen Corporation and Nissho Iwai Corporation created Sojitz, and began with restructuring through extensive asset compression and write-offs. The two companies had different internal systems and corporate cultures, but all employees worked in concert as we repurchased and cancelled preferred shares to enhance total equity and improved results. As a result, in 2008 all of the credit rating agencies gave us an investment-grade rating. Following the financial crisis of 2008 we continued to review assets, which included optimizing inventory, and strengthened our risk management system while enhancing our financial foundation. Thus Sojitz overcame difficulties and generated growth because of the efforts of its employees and the deep understanding and support of its stakeholders, for which we are grateful. We will accelerate reforms and continually move forward to generate new growth. Strengthening earnings capacity is a key theme for Sojitz in generating the next phase of growth. The aim of Medium-term Management Plan 2014 – Change for Challenge, which culminates in the year ending March 31, 2015, is to raise asset quality through asset replacement and further enhance our financial foundation to transform Sojitz into a strong company that can take on even greater challenges. During the year ended March 31, 2013, the first year of the plan, we achieved steady results in asset replacement, but major changes in the external operating environment require us to further accelerate our reforms. We devoted ourselves to resolving problems over the past 10 years. With those problems out of the way, we can now devote ourselves to significant growth over the next 10 years. We will generate new growth by implementing numerous reforms and acquiring prime assets. I intend to lead Sojitz as it evolves and takes on new challenges. Sojitz will continually move forward to increase its corporate value. We are counting on the goodwill of our stakeholders as we do so.

Sojitz Corporation Annual Report 2013 11 Financial Highlights（IFRSs*） Financial problems and slower growth in China brought on by the recession in Europe were factors depressing the prices and demand for many of the products Sojitz handles. As a result, gross profit decreased year on year. However, Sojitz had profit for the year compared with loss in the previous fiscal year due to the reversal of deferred tax assets. Total equity increased ¥52.6 billion from a year earlier because of earnings, the weaker yen and higher stock prices. In addition, Sojitz undertook various initiatives to maintain financial soundness, such as asset replacement and reduction of interest-bearing debt, with outcomes including net DER of 1.7 times. Annual dividends per share totaled ¥3.00, and the consolidated payout ratio was 27.9%. * Sojitz has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as of the annual securities report for the year ended March 31, 2013.

As independent officers, all of our outside directors and outside corporate auditors are expected to defend the interests of shareholders, which will make our management framework even more transparent. We have also broadened our management outlook by appointing our first female corporate auditor. I expect her to be an important role model for our female employees, and to bring a breath of fresh air to management. My most important duty is supervising business execution, and I intend to emphasize compatibility with emerging trends and societal needs. Now that Sojitz has steadily moved forward with asset replacement and substantially improved its finances, society is asking us if we are capable of growth over the medium and long term. We must structure a sound earnings foundation while continuing to make strategic moves for the future. I intend to make sure we stay on this course in our business execution. The 21st century is the century of emerging countries. Looking around the world, meeting demand for resources in emerging countries, upgrading their infrastructure, and enhancing the level of their environmental and energy technologies have become even more important. Consequently, the areas in which Sojitz needs to demonstrate its value are expanding, including solving social issues and contributing to the next generation.

Our goal of generating growth in emerging quality is improving. Despite sharp decreases in countries requires us to hold a certain amount of resource prices and other major changes in the emerging country currency, but until now negative assumptions underlying new investments and loans, foreign currency translation adjustments have been we have positive expectations for our investment substantial. We need to smooth this volatility by further and loan plan because of the timely revisions we raising the sophistication with which business divisions have made. manage their level of foreign currency holdings while Sojitz will continue to intensify its initiatives to raise increasing total equity by generating earnings.

In addition, a (As of March 31) Total equity attributable to owners of the Company (left scale) consistent accounting standard will expedite the Net DER (right scale) establishment of joint ventures and the due diligence Sojitz Corporation Annual Report 2013 93 A Message from CFO Yoshio Mogi We will steadily promote reforms to increase asset quality and enhance total equity to be a company that can grow continuously over the next 50 and 100 years. Under Medium-term Management Plan 2014, we aim to enhance corporate value by increasing profitability without changing the scale of assets and by building total equity to ensure the strength needed for aggressive initiatives. In other words, the key to achieving our plan will be raising asset quality through asset replacement. During the year ended March 31, 2013, the first year of Medium-term Management Plan 2014, changes in our operating environment such as slower growth in China and a sharp drop in energy and mineral resource prices resulted in a downward revision of our initial earnings plan. Total equity attributable to owners of the Company improved substantially, backed by earnings, the recovery in stock prices and the weaker yen. Asset replacement progressed successfully as we compressed assets and recovered capital according to plan and recognized lower charges to income than initially expected. However, new investments and loans were slightly behind schedule on a cash basis because of the influence of the changing external operating environment. We set ROA of 2% or higher as a financial target when we formulated Mediumterm Management Plan 2014. We are not quite there yet, which makes the acquisition of quality assets an even more important issue going forward. Our outlook for the fund procurement environment is positive because we have enhanced the soundness of our finances. Given the Senior Managing Executive Officer, CFO Senior Management of Finance & Accounting, recent weakening of the yen, we will energetically procure Risk Management, Corporate Accounting, Finance, funds in both foreign currencies and yen to accelerate Forex & Securities investments and loans. Moreover, risk factors are Yoshio Mogi becoming more diverse. For example, we are dispatching more people to investees because the number of business investment projects for new investments and loans is increasing. We therefore need to concentrate further on cultivating human resources. Replacing assets to enhance portfolio quality and cultivating human resources to transform ourselves into an even stronger company will enable us to make our businesses larger and more appealing, which will attract more quality employees. Sojitz will continue to grow over the next 50 and 100 years if we can create this virtuous cycle. Our role is to move this process forward, even if only a step or two. Sojitz will steadily transform itself to increase corporate value in the future. 94 Sojitz Corporation Annual Report 2013 The Sojitz Group’s Management Strategy Business Strategies Management Foundation Corporate Social Organization Financial Section Responsibility Financial Summary For the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009 Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2011 2010 2009 2013 2012 2011 (Japanese (Japanese (Japanese 2013 (IFRSs) (IFRSs) (IFRSs) GAAP) GAAP) GAAP) (IFRSs) Operating Results: Net sales (Total trading transactions) (Note 2) ........... ¥3,934,456 ¥4,321,734 — ¥4,014,640 ¥3,844,418 ¥5,166,183 $41,855,914 Revenue ................................. 1,747,750 2,006,649 — — — — 18,593,085 Gross profit............................. 187,245 217,066 — 192,725 178,203 235,618 1,991,968 Profit before tax ...................... 28,052 58,457 — 39,312 18,895 37,071 298,425 Profit for the year (Attributable to owners of the Company)*..................... 13,448 (1,040) — 15,982 8,794 19,001 143,063 Core earnings (Note 3) ............ 38,395 65,812 — 41,891 14,424 48,347 408,457 Net cash provided by operating activities ............... 55,124 88,723 — 67,863 107,223 103,729 586,425 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities ................

Material carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to cash-generating unit groups were as follows: Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2011 (Transition Date) 2012 2013 2013 Chemicals Parent company’s chemical business ............................................... 7,460 7,460 7,460 79,361 Consumer Lifestyle Business Domestic subsidiaries’ food sales business ...................................... 8,090 8,090 8,090 86,063 The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit groups to which significant goodwill has been allocated was calculated based on its use value founded on the five-year forecast that was approved by management. The five-year forecast of cash flows is based on budgets reflecting past performances. In addition, the main assumption used to determine such forecast was the growth rate of total gross profits through such terms, such growth rate being consistent with the forecasts of nominal GDP growth rate or the like of the countries in which such cash-generating unit groups are situated. The discount rates before tax and ultimate growth rates which were used in calculating the use value of the cash-generating unit groups to which significant goodwill has been allocated for the years ended on the Transition Date, March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013, respectively, were as follows: (a) Discount rate before tax 2011 (Transition Date) 2012 2013 Chemicals Parent company’s chemical business ..................................................................... 8.7% 8.7% 8.7% Consumer Lifestyle Business The domestic subsidiaries’ food sales business ..................................................... 7.9% 6.8% 6.8% (b) Ultimate growth rate In regards to cash flows for the terms beyond the five-year forecast period that was approved by management, the use value is calculated with a growth rate of 0% for each such term. With respect to goodwill that has been allocated to cash-generating unit groups, the recoverable amount of such goodwill sufficiently exceeds its carrying amount. Thus, even if major assumptions are changed to a reasonable extent, it is expected that the probability of such recoverable amount becoming less than the carrying amount is unlikely.

The fair values are of amounts that the Group calculated using as reference the amounts based on an independent appraiser’s appraisals and the “real estate appraisal standards” of the country in which the investment properties are located. These appraisals are calculated based on either the public offering price, a sales comparison approach or discount cash flow approach. Upon an acquisition from a third party or at the time of the most recent appraisal, if there is no significant fluctuation in the index, which is believed to reflect a certain appraised value (market or assessed price) or appropriate market value, the fair value is adjusted using such appraised value or index.

Such indices are periodically reported to and monitored by management. * Net DER = (interest bearing liabilities cash and cash equivalents) ÷ own equity (own equity = total equity amount less non-controlling interests) ** Risk assets ratio = risk asset (such asset amount calculated based on assessment of such risk in correspondence to the size of such risk) ÷ own equity Net DERs and risk assets ratios as of the Transition Date, March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013, respectively, were as follows. 2011 (Transition Date) 2012 2013 Net DER ................................................................................. 2.0 times 2.0 times 1.7 times Risk assets ratio ...................................................................... 1.0 times 1.0 times 0.9 times 136 Sojitz Corporation Annual Report 2013 The Sojitz Group’s Management Strategy Business Strategies Management Foundation Corporate Social Organization Financial Section Responsibility (2) Number of authorized shares, issued shares and shares of treasury stocks Shares 2012 2013 Authorized: ordinary shares ......................................................................................... 2,500,000,000 2,500,000,000 Issued: ordinary shares Balance at beginning of year ...................................................................................... 1,251,499,501 1,251,499,501 Increase or decrease for the year ............................................................................... — — Balance at end of year ............................................................................................... 1,251,499,501 1,251,499,501 Treasury stock: ordinary shares Balance at beginning of year ...................................................................................... 352,882 411,427 Increase or decrease for the year ............................................................................... 58,545 6,225 Balance at end of year ............................................................................................... 411,427 417,652 In addition to the above, the Group owns shares in Fuji Nihon Seito Corporation, one of its associates.

The plan is a defined benefits plan, however, in regards to unamortized past services obligations, such plan does not provide for the contribution rate of or the proportionate share of contributions owed by each employer. As such the amounts of pension assets which correspond to the contributions made by such subsidiaries cannot be reasonably calculated. Thus, with respect to such subsidiaries, a method in which the necessary contributions made to such pension fund are accounted for as retirement benefits expenses is applied. In addition, one of the Company’s subsidiaries, Nissho Electronics Corporation, participates in the “Tokyo Electric Industry Employee’s Pension Fund Organization”, which is also a multi-employer plan (multi-employer funds-type established by an association of multiple companies joined together under certain conditions). Such plan is a defined benefits plan, however, as it comprises multiple companies, the amount of pension assets which correspond to the contributions made by Nissho Electronics Corporation cannot be reasonably calculated. Thus, with respect to Nissho Electronics Corporation, a method, in which the necessary contributions made to such pension fund are accounted for as retirement benefits expenses, is applied.

With respect to deficits calculated under pension actuarial revaluation, measures such as increasing the rate of special contributions to be made and the like are being taken as needed. Unamortized past service obligations are accounted for as liabilities. Please note that the above-stated “Share of contributions by the Group in the plan as a whole” does not match the actual share of its obligation. (b) Recognized expenses with respect to multi-employer plans The total amounts of recognized expenses with respect to multi-employer plans each being accounted for as a defined contribution plan for the years ended March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013 were 909 million yen and 505 million yen (U.S.$5,372 thousand), respectively. (2) Employee benefits expenses The total amounts of employee benefits expenses recognized as expenses for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 were 94,764 million yen and 93,939 million yen (U.S.$999,351 thousand), respectively. Employee benefits expenses were included in “Cost of sales” and “Selling, general and administration expenses” under the Consolidated Statements of Profit or Loss.

The Company and some of such subsidiaries recognized tax losses carried forward and deferred tax assets for the tax losses carried forward only to the extent there was a strong possibility that they can be used against future taxable income within rational estimate periods, since they could recognize taxable income each period if there was not non-ordinary factors. The taxable income was calculated based on estimation for increase and decrease of the temporally differences and was approved by the Company’s management. As of March 31, 2013, the Group recognized deferred tax assets of 13,765 million yen (U.S.$146,436 thousand) for the tax losses carried forward. 2) Contents of changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities Contents of changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities were as follows.

Because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of such temporary differences, and there is a probability that such temporary differences will not be reversed within the foreseeable future, the Group did not recognize deferred tax liabilities with respect to such temporary differences.

Sojitz Corporation Annual Report 2013 147 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 2) Reconciliation of applicable tax rate in Japan Reconciliations between the applicable tax rate in Japan and the Group’s average effective tax rate are shown in the following chart. 2012 2013 Applicable tax rate in Japan................................................................................................................. 41.0% 38.0% (Reconciliation) Effects based on assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets .................................................. 43.5% 7.3% Effects associated with consolidated elimination of dividend income ................................................... 19.5% 1.7% Effects from profit (loss) on investment under the equity method .........................................................

In Japan, following the promulgation on December 2, 2011 of the “Act for Partial Revision of the Income Tax Act, etc., for the Purpose of Creating a Taxation System Responding to Changes in Economic and Social Structures” (Act No. 114 of 2011) and the “Act on Special Measures for Securing Financial Resources Necessary to Implement Measures for Reconstruction following the Great East Japan Earthquake” (Act no. 117 of 2011), and effective from fiscal years beginning on and after April 1, 2012, the corporate tax rates were amended. Accordingly, the applicable income tax rate used to calculate the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will be reduced from 40.69% to 38.01% for temporary differences or the like expected to be reversed some time between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2015, and to 35.64% for temporary differences expected to be reversed from April 1, 2015. 31 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (1) Classes of financial instruments The breakdown of financial instruments per each class was as follows.

Such businesses are inherently exposed to various risks. The Group defines and classifies risks per each risk item and manages each of them in accordance with its nature. (3) Credit risk management The Group assumes credit risk by extending credit to many domestic and foreign customers through a variety of commercial transactions. The Group mitigates such credit risk by objectively assigning credit ratings to the customers to which it extends credit based on the Company’s credit rating system. The Group also controls credit risk by setting rating-based credit limits on a customerby-customer basis and enforcing the credit limits thus set. The Group employs other safeguards (e.g., collaterals and guarantees) as warranted by the customer’s creditworthiness. Additionally, the Group has a system for assessing receivables, in which customers are extracted based on a certain criteria, then assessed for their creditworthiness. With respect to such selected customers, the Group also checks for existence of any receivables, protection measures or the like. Through the above, the Group endeavors to more rigorously ascertain credit risk and calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts for each account receivables. Please note that the Group does not carry any excessive credit risk with respect to any specified customer. In regards to derivative transactions, the Group only deals with financial institutions with high credit ratings, as assigned by internationally-acknowledged rating agencies, so as to minimize the credit risks. The Group also periodically reviews the credit ratings of counterparties to such derivative transactions and re-evaluates credit limits so as to minimize credit risks based on non-performance by such counterparties. 1) Maximum exposure to credit risk Other than guaranteed obligations, the Group’s maximum exposure with respect to credit risks without taking into account any collaterals held or other credit enhancements is the carrying amount of financial instruments less impairment losses under the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. On the other hand, the Group’s maximum exposures to credit risks concerning guaranteed obligations as of the Transition Date, March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013 were 40,395 million yen, 37,971 million yen and 30,118 million yen (U.S.$320,404 thousand), respectively. 2) Financial assets that are past the due date The analysis of aging of trade and other receivables that were past the due date but not impaired as of the end of the year was as follows. The amounts below include amounts expected to be collected through acquisition of security, insurance coverage or the like. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2011 (Transition Date) 2012 2013 2013 Within three months or less past due date ......................................... 16,809 17,350 15,378 163,595 Between three and six months past due date .................................... 649 2,124 919 9,776 Between six months and one year past due date ............................... 743 1,720 624 6,638 Over one year past due date ............................................................. 8,112 5,475 4,378 46,574 Total .......................................................................................... 26,315 26,670 21,299 226,585 3) Financial assets of which impairment has occurred The Group establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts for each major customer by reviewing, among other matters, such customer’s financial conditions and credit ratings, status of collection of receivables with respect to such customer, amendments to payment conditions, industry trends and state of affairs of the country/region in which such customer was situated. Trade and other receivables that were individually determined to be impaired as of the end of the year were as follows. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2011 (Transition Date) 2012 2013 2013 Trade and other receivables .............................................................. 78,847 72,915 63,515 675,691 Allowance for doubtful accounts ........................................................

Instead, the Group accounts for such impairment loss under the allowance for doubtful accounts. Changes in allowance for doubtful accounts were as follows. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2012 2013 2013 Balance at beginning of year ..................................................................................... 59,311 51,895 552,074 Increase for the year .................................................................................................. 3,939 2,086 22,191 Decrease for the year (incurred and charged against the provision) .............................

Accordingly, in the event of a disruption to the financial system or financial/capital markets, or a major downgrade of the Group’s credit rating by a rating agency, the Group’s fundraising becomes constrained and consequently there is a possibility that the Group will not be able to carry out the payment on the date of payment. The Group has a long-term commitment line agreement in the amount of 100 billion yen and a multi-currency commitment line agreement in the amount of 300 million U.S. dollars for the securing of liquidity/stability of funds. The Group makes efforts to maintain good relationships with each financial institution, including each of the counterparties to the commitment line agreements. 1) Non-derivative financial liabilities The breakdown of non-derivative financial liabilities by due date was as follows. 2011 (Transition Date) Millions of yen Between one and Over Within one year five years five years Total Trade and other payables .................................................................... 520,866 15,621 548 537,035 Bonds and borrowings ........................................................................ 273,440 844,036 46,238 1,163,714 Total ............................................................................................ 794,306 859,657 46,786 1,700,750 2012 Millions of yen Between one and Over Within one year five years five years Total Trade and other payables .................................................................... 555,625 14,580 463 570,669 Bonds and borrowings ........................................................................ 314,779 786,452 61,969 1,163,201 Total ............................................................................................ 870,405 801,032 62,432 1,733,871 2013 Millions of yen Between one and Over Within one year five years five years Total Trade and other payables .................................................................... 513,979 11,895 89 525,964 Bonds and borrowings ........................................................................ 276,209 712,840 132,610 1,121,660 Total ............................................................................................ 790,189 724,735 132,700 1,647,625 2013 Thousands of U.S. dollars Between one and Over Within one year five years five years Total Trade and other payables .................................................................... 5,467,861 126,542 946 5,595,361 Bonds and borrowings ........................................................................ 2,938,393 7,583,404 1,410,744 11,932,553 Total ............................................................................................ 8,406,265 7,709,946 1,411,702 17,527,925 Other than the above, the guaranteed obligations as of the Transition Date, March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013 were 40,395 million yen, 37,971 million yen and 30,118 million yen (U.S.$320,404 thousand), respectively. 150 Sojitz Corporation Annual Report 2013 The Sojitz Group’s Management Strategy Business Strategies Management Foundation Corporate Social Organization Financial Section Responsibility 2) Derivatives The breakdown of derivatives by due date was as follows. 2011 (Transition Date) Millions of yen Between one and Over Within one year five years five years Total Currency-related derivatives Cash inflows .................................................................................... 220,581 9,473 185 230,241 Cash outflows .................................................................................

The Group’s basic policy is to minimize such market risks by matching assets and liabilities (e.g., long and short commodity exposures) and through hedge transactions, such as forward exchange transactions, commodity futures/forward transactions and interest rate swaps. Sojitz Corporation Annual Report 2013 151 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1) Exchange rate fluctuation risk 1. Content of, and policy for managing, exchange rate fluctuation risk The Group engages in import and export transactions and offshore transactions, both denominated in foreign currencies, as its principal business activity. Whereas the revenues and expenditures associated with such transactions are mainly received/paid out in foreign currencies, the Group’s consolidated reporting currency is Japanese yen. The Group is, therefore, exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the yen’s value against foreign currencies. To prevent or limit losses stemming from such risk, the Group hedges its foreign currency exposure through forward exchange transactions or the like. 2. Sensitivity analysis of exchange rate fluctuation risk In regards to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting profit before tax and other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the consolidated financial statements, that would result from 1% appreciation of yen against each of the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant. In addition, such analysis does not include the affected amounts based on translations (into Japanese yen) of financial instruments denominated in functional currency, income and expenses denominated in foreign currency and assets and liabilities of foreign operations.

(141) 5 53 Australian dollar ................................................................................................... (43) (67) (712) 2) Interest rate fluctuation risk 1. Content of, and policy for managing, interest rate fluctuation risk The Group’s finances include credit terms for trade and other receivables, purchases of investment securities, and expenditures for property, plant and equipment that are primarily funded with loans from financial institutions and bond issues, and the Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuation risks arising from financing, investments or the like. Since borrowings with floating rates are exposed to interest rate risk, the Group hedges a part of such borrowings through interest swap transactions. 2. Sensitivity analysis of interest rate fluctuation risk In regards to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amount affecting profit before tax, as reported in the consolidated financial statements, in the case that the interest rate increases by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant. Under such analysis, the amount affecting profit before tax is calculated by multiplying the net balance of the financial instruments affected by the interest rate fluctuation at the fiscal year-end by 1%. Please note that other than financial instruments with floating rates (excluding those that are considered to be financial instruments with fixed rates in substance due to interest rate swaps), the Group deals with, among others, the following financial instruments that are also affected by interest rate fluctuations: cash and cash equivalents; time deposits; trade notes and accounts receivables; and, trade notes and accounts payables. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2012 2013 2013 Profit before tax .................................................................................................... 342 523 5,563 3) Commodity price fluctuation risk 1. Content of, and policies for managing, commodity price fluctuation risk As a general trading company, the Group deals in a wide range of commodities through its various businesses. As such, the Group is exposed to commodity price risk due to price fluctuations or the like. For market-traded commodities, the Group manages exposures and controls losses by setting (long and short) position limits and stop-loss levels per each internal organizational unit. The Group also prescribes and enforces stop-loss rules (i.e., an internal organizational unit must promptly liquidate losing positions and are prohibited from initiating new trades for the remainder of the fiscal year if losses, including valuation losses, exceed the stoploss level). Even with such controls, however, there is no assurance that the Group can completely avoid commodity price risk. The Group’s management performance and/or financial conditions may be adversely affected by unanticipated market movements. With respect to commodity inventories, the Group implements measures, such as monthly monitoring by business or the like, in order to control inventory levels. 152 Sojitz Corporation Annual Report 2013 The Sojitz Group’s Management Strategy Business Strategies Management Foundation Corporate Social Organization Financial Section Responsibility 2. Sensitivity analysis of commodity price fluctuation risk In regards to derivatives related to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting profit before tax and other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the consolidated financial statements, in the case that the commodity price decreases by 1%.

Content of, and policies for managing, stock price fluctuation risk The Group has large holdings of marketable securities and, therefore, is exposed to stock price fluctuation risk. Against such risk, the Group makes efforts to understand market prices and financial conditions or the like of issuers and, especially with respect to listed stocks, the Group reviews their portfolios on a periodic basis. 2. Sensitivity analysis of stock price fluctuation risk In regards to listed stocks held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the consolidated financial statements, in the case that prices of such listed stocks decrease by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant.

(a) Trade notes and accounts receivables Per each receivable classified per certain period, the fair value was calculated based on present value of such receivable discounted by the interest rate, which took into account the period to maturity and the credit risk. (b) Other investments The fair values of listed stocks were based on the prices at the applicable exchange. The fair values of unlisted stocks were calculated using the discounted future cash flow method, price comparison method based on the prices of similar types of stocks and other valuation methods. (c) Derivative financial assets and liabilities Currency-related derivatives The fair values with respect to foreign exchange transactions, spot/forward transactions, currency option transactions and currency swap transactions were calculated based on the forward exchange rate as of the settlement date. Interest rate-related derivatives The fair values of interest rate-related derivatives were calculated based on present values of future cash flows discounted by the interest rate, which took into account the period to maturity and the credit risk. Commodity-related derivatives The fair values of commodity futures transactions were calculated based on the final prices announced at the commodities exchanges as of the fiscal year-end. The fair values of commodity forward transactions and commodity swaps were calculated based on the index prices publicly announced at the fiscal year-end. (d) Trade notes and accounts payables Per each payables classified per certain period, the fair value was calculated based on the present value of future cash flow discounted by the interest rate, which took into account the period to maturity and the credit risk. (e) Bonds and borrowings For bonds payable for which the market prices were available, the fair values thereof were calculated based on such market prices. For other bonds payable, the fair values were calculated based on the present value of the total amount in principal and interest for such bonds discounted by the interest rate, which took into account the period to maturity and the credit risk. The fair values of long-term loans payable were calculated by discounting future cash flows with a rate anticipated for a new borrowing with the same principal and interest. 2) Fair value hierarchy applied in consolidated statements of financial position In regards to financial instruments measured at fair value under the consolidated statements of financial position, the following charts present the fair value hierarchy by level, which reflects the significance of inputs made upon performing measurements.

Sojitz Corporation Annual Report 2013 157 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (8) Hedge accounting 1) Types of hedge accounting (a) Fair value hedges A fair value hedge is a hedge of exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment. The Group designates commodity futures and commodity forwards as hedging instruments to hedge the changes in fair values of firm commitments or inventories. With respect to a fair value hedge, gains or losses from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value are recognized as profit or loss, and gains or losses on hedged items attributable to hedged risks are also recognized as profit or loss. Gains or losses recognized as profit or loss relating to hedged items for the years ended March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013 were profit of 73 million yen and loss of 208 million yen (U.S.$2,212 thousand), respectively, and gains or losses recognized as profit or loss relating to hedging instruments for the years ended March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013 were loss of 73 million yen and profit of 208 million yen (U.S.$2,212 thousand), respectively. (b) Cash flow hedges Cash flow hedge is a hedge of exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a scheduled transaction that is most likely to occur. The Group designates interest rate swaps as hedging instruments to hedge the variability of cash flows relating to floating-rate borrowings and designates forward exchange transactions as hedging instruments to hedge the variability of cash flows concerning firm commitments in foreign currency. With respect to a cash flow hedge, the portions of the gains or losses on the hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income. On the Transition Date and for the years ended March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013, accumulated amounts of other comprehensive income that were expected to be reclassified to profit or loss within one year due to cash flow hedges (before tax effect adjustments) were profit of 767 million yen, loss of 829 million yen and profit of 143 million yen (U.S.$1,521 thousand), respectively.

Sojitz Group’s Management Strategy Business Strategies Management Foundation Corporate Social Organization Financial Section Responsibility (10) Transfer of financial assets The Group liquidates certain trade receivables by discounting notes or the like. However, with respect to some liquidated receivables, the Group may be obligated to make payments as recourse for non-payment by the debtor. The Group continues to recognize such liquidated receivables as they do not meet the criteria for derecognition of financial assets. The Group recognized such liquidated assets as “Trade and other receivables” in the amounts of 25,363 million yen and 26,475 million yen (U.S.$281,648 thousand) as of March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013, respectively. In addition, liabilities relating to the deposit amounts which arose upon the transfer of such assets were accounted for as “Bonds and borrowings” in the amounts of 25,363 million yen and 26,475 million yen (U.S.$281,648 thousand) as of March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013, respectively. Such liabilities are settled when payments for such liquidated assets are made, and the Group may not use such liquidated assets until such settlement occurs. Please note that due to the exceptions to the retroactive application of IFRS 1 applicable to entities adopting IFRSs for the first time, the requirements regarding derecognition of financial assets and liabilities apply to transactions occurring after the Transition Date (but not before the Transition Date). Therefore, as of the Transition Date, such liquidated assets were derecognized in accordance with Japanese GAAP. 32 LEASES (1) Finance leases 1) As lessee The Group leases a number of machinery, office equipment and other assets under arrangements which are classified as finance leases.

(3) Notes on reconciliation The explanations regarding the reconciliation chart under item (2) above are as follows. 1) Changes in fiscal year-end date Under Japanese GAAP, the Group prepared the consolidated financial statements based on the financial statements of its subsidiaries and Entities subject to Equity Method as of their fiscal year-end dates even if such fiscal year-end dates differ from that of the Company. On the other hand, under IFRSs, the financial statements of its subsidiaries and Entities subject to Equity Method are prepared with the same fiscal year-end date as that of the Company, excluding cases in which doing so is impractical. Moreover, if the fiscal year-end date of a subsidiary differs from that of the Company, significant transactions or events between the fiscal year-end date of such subsidiary and that of the Company are reflected to the consolidated financial statements. 2) Reclassification Reclassifications affected presentation of the Consolidated Statements of Profits or Loss and the Consolidated Statements of Profit or Loss and other comprehensive income but did not affect that of retained earnings. The main contents of reclassifications are as follows. • All of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities were reclassified as non-current assets and non-current liabilities. • Each of non-current assets that fell under the category of investment property as defined in IFRSs were reclassified as “Investment property”. • Since the Group has the intention and ability to refinance its borrowings from financial institutions, current portion of long-term loans was reclassified as non-current liabilities based on the amounts under commitment line agreements yet to be used. 3) Effects from transition to IFRSs (a) Scope of application of equity method Associates subject to the equity method have increased due to the application of IFRSs. When the Group determines the scope of equity method in consideration of significant influence, the Group determined the scope based on detailed requirements relating to the percentage of voting rights under Japanese GAAP. On the other hand, entities are included in the scope of equity method if the Group has significant influence in entities under IFRSs, regardless of their percentage of the voting rights. The summary of effects caused by such increase was as follows.

However, such calculation is not done under IFRSs. Furthermore, with respect to impairment of goodwill, while impairment tests were performed only if there is an indication of impairment under Japanese GAAP, such tests are performed annually under IFRSs. In addition, while negative goodwill was recognized as liability under Japanese GAAP, such liability is not recognized under IFRSs and therefore the Group reclassified the amount of such liability as of the Transition Date to retained earnings. The summary of effects caused by the above differences is as follows. Impairment losses which arose as of the Transition Date based on the differences between Japanese GAAP and IFRSs, as stated above, were mainly from the following: the cash-generating unit group which includes goodwill associated with the reorganization of business of selling condominium in lots or the like belonging to the consumer lifestyle business segment (impairment loss amount being 3,336 million yen); and, the cash-generating unit group which includes goodwill associated with the reorganization of the domestic subsidiaries’ business of selling plastics belonging to the chemicals segment (impairment loss amount being 3,445 million yen). All of such impairment losses were deducted from the carrying amount of goodwill. The recoverable amount for each such cash-generating unit group was calculated based on the applicable use value. The use value applicable to each such cashgenerating unit group was calculated by discounting future cash flows using the discount rates before tax (i.e., 11.4% for the former group and 8.7% for the latter group).
