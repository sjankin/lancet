A strong international airport with many routes and frequencies is essential to economic growth, employment and increased tourism in the region and in all of Denmark. When we encourage airlines to place more routes and activities at Copenhagen Airport, we also create more jobs at and outside the airport. We take this responsibility seriously and we find that it is a collective responsibility for both the region and the whole of Denmark. In the following sections, we describe how we endeavour to live up to our responsibility as a transport hub through targeted route development, charges adjustment, capacity development and interaction with stakeholders, while also seeking to provide the best possible services to our passengers and the airlines. 20 CPH’s responsibility as a hub / Preface / Corporate profile / CSR strategy / Financial summary / Financial highlights / Financial indicators / / Taxation / Route development / Regulation and charges / Capacity expansion / CPH’s stakeholders / / The travel experience / Environment and energy / Employees / Safety and security / Procurement / Indicator tables / / CSR accounting policies / Management’s statement / Independent auditor’s report / Glossary / / Preface / Corporate profile / CSR strategy / Financial summary / Financial highlights / Financial indicators / / Taxation / Route development / Regulation and charges / Capacity expansion / CPH’s stakeholders / / The travel experience / Environment and energy / Employees / Safety and security / Procurement / Indicator tables / / CSR accounting policies / Management’s statement / Independent auditor’s report / Glossary / In 2012, we set up a number of ‘efficiency stands’ designed to facilitate faster boarding and de-boarding of passengers.

Assuming passenger numbers will continue to grow, this makes great demands on our ability to reduce our energy consumption in our buildings as they stand today. Our target is a 20% reduction in energy use by 2020 relative to the current level. At CPH, we also intend to adopt a new energy standard for new building projects before the end of 2013, and we will increasingly integrate environmental and energy considerations in our long-term planning. Overall, this will lead to greater resource efficiency in our buildings and facilities, and this will support Copenhagen Airport’s goal of reducing its CO2 emissions from 1.4 kg per passenger in 2011 to 1.0 kg per passenger in 2020. Long-term planning To help us determine the future development of Copenhagen Airport, we started a comprehensive analysis project called Long-Term Capacity Planning (LTCP). This tool employs future growth scenarios as the basis for analysis and description of future capacity requirements. It is an extensive and complicated project, so we have involved a number of external stakeholders in the project as well as international consultants with worldwide experience in airport development. The idea is to ensure that Copenhagen Airport can develop in step with its growing passenger numbers so that we can always make the required capacity available for passengers, airlines and our other business partners. No matter which expansion strategy the analysis ends up recommending, we intend to retain the compact design of Copenhagen Airport with its flexible utilisation of the infrastructure, ensuring short walking distances for travellers and low operating costs for airlines. This will enhance Copenhagen Airport’s attractiveness as the most important Northern European hub. 30 CPH’s responsibility as a hub / Preface / Corporate profile / CSR strategy / Financial summary / Financial highlights / Financial indicators / / Taxation / Route development / Regulation and charges / Capacity expansion / CPH’s stakeholders / / The travel experience / Environment and energy / Employees / Safety and security / Procurement / Indicator tables / / CSR accounting policies / Management’s statement / Independent auditor’s report / Glossary / The expectations of rising passenger numbers place great demands on our ability to reduce energy consumption.

In 2012, we made use of our entire annual quota of 8,000 helicopter operations allowed under the environmental permit. In preparation for reassessment of this permit, we are working to modernise conditions with respect to both noise and flexibility. The current environmental permit was originally issued by the County of Roskilde in 1992 and upheld by the Danish Environmental Appeals Board in 1995.
