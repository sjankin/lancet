GlobeScan’s 2012 Global Compact Communication on Progress 2 STATEMENT OF CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR THE GLOBAL COMPACT 2012 GlobeScan, like many globally focused companies, has many ambitions. One of our core purposes has always been to apply our global polling and stakeholder engagement capabilities to give voice to people’s aspirations on a whole range of issues. However, through our observation of trends and events over our 25-year history as a company, we have come to see the achievement of a sustainable and just world for all as such an over-riding imperative and huge challenge that we have decided to put our other ambitions aside to focus exclusively on this goal, both through our company’s work and through our new GlobeScan Foundation. The outward manifestation of this new focus has been the relaunching of our company over the past year, with a broader service offering aimed at better supporting our clients’ efforts to contribute to progress towards a sustainable and just world for all. As a result, we feel even more worthy and pleased to submit this, our eighth annual Communication on Progress since our company joined the Global Compact in 2004. In addition to our client work, our major contribution to the goals of the Compact this year has been manifested in the Regeneration Roadmap, our multi-faceted initiative with our colleagues at SustainAbility, the firm, to provide a way forward for achieving sustainable development within the next generation, focusing in particular on ways the private sector can imSincerely, prove sustainability strategy, increase credibility, and deliver results at greater speed and scale.

Nearly 25 years after the Brundtland Commission released Our Common Future, and 20 years after the first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, The Regeneration Roadmap assesses progress made on the sustainable development agenda and offers a new path forward. This project is inspired by interviews with sustainable development pioneers, the Ray Anderson Memorial Interviews, conducted over the last year and will include perspectives from a new generation of innovators and entrepreneurs. The beauty and challenge of The Regeneration Roadmap lies in its design: a reflective process of progressive and participatory problem-solving whose outcomes will be substantial and valuable, but which will reveal themselves gradually. The final output of The Regeneration Roadmap, Changing Tack, offers the private sector a prescription for piloting the unfamiliar seas of sustainable development that lie ahead. For more information about The Regeneration Roadmap, please visit www.theregenerationroadmap.com The GlobeScan Foundation is dedicated to helping achieve a sustainable and just world for all. We focus on developing and applying a range of social science tools to help unlock collaboration and accelerate progress. We have chosen the theme “Letting Everyone Speak” to manifest our mission for two reasons. First, we believe everyone has the right to speak on matters that affect their lives. Second, when we let everyone speak we open up the possibility of collaboration, which we believe is essential for meeting humanity’s challenges. Over the last 25 years, GlobeScan Incorporated has done a great deal of pro bono work—for global NGOs, Complus, UN agencies, and various foundations among others. Now, with our Foundation, we are able to focus and magnify our non-commercial work in order to advance progress for all. The GlobeScan Foundation Goals: • To conduct non-commercial global polls on matters of public interest. • To give a voice to influential experts and stakeholders on important topics. • To develop and apply engagement processes that can encourage mass collaboration to solve problems.
