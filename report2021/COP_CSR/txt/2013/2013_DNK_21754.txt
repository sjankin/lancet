Strategy and Analysis This section is intended to provide a high-level, strategic view of the organization’s relationship to sustainability in order to provide context for subsequent and more detailed reporting against other sections of the Guidelines. It may draw on information provided in other parts of the report, but this section is intended to produce insight on strategic topics rather than simply summarize the contents of the report. The strategy and analysis should consist of the statement outlined in 1.1 (…). 1.1 Statement from the most senior decision-maker of the organization (e.g., CEO, Chair, or equivalent senior position) about the relevance of sustainability to the organization and its strategy. The statement should present the overall vision and strategy for the short-term, medium-term (e.g., 3-5 years), and long-term, particularly with regard to managing the key challenges associated with economic, environmental and social performance. The statement should include: • Strategic priorities and key topics for the short/medium-term with regard to sustainability, including respect for the internationally agreed standards and how they relate to long-term organizational strategy and success; • Broader trends (e.g. macroeconomic or political) affecting the organization and influencing sustainability priorities; • Key events, achievements, and failures during the reporting period; • Views on performance with respect to targets; • Outlook on the organization’s main challenges and targets for the next year and goals for the coming 3-5 years; and • Other items pertaining to the organization’s strategic approach. [GRI G3: p. 20] Over more than 30 years, LM Wind Power has grown to become the world's largest independent blade manufacturer and also providing brakes and service to the wind industry. The company has contributed significantly to an industry which is confronting the pressing global challenge of climate change while meeting growing energy demand. Profitable growth, organizational integrity and caring for people as well as for the environment remain at the core of our business approach, but we firmly believe there’s room for improvement. We need to become more sustainable. A strategic priority Our corporate strategy proposes that sustainability is a key component of achieving long term business success. It is not making us look better than we are. It’s about achieving real change which we will manage and document through measured progress on key sustainability indicators. In addition to putting sustainability formally into the business strategy and goals, 2010 offered several milestones for LM Wind Power’s sustainability efforts. Organization LM Wind Power’s sustainability organization was formally established in 2010 and rooted in the executive management of the LM Wind Power Group. A sustainability working group formed among the employees presented a clear challenge to the board we may be a green business but are we green enough? They presented a path forward which was adopted by a board -level leadership team which ensures alignment and integration with the corporate strategy. We organize our efforts within four overall areas: Safety, Environment, Technology & People. In 2011, safety was again at the top of the list of priorities with several improvements achieved. The global safety organization firmly anchored in top management, started to work and initiated several projects to structure, promote and improve safety performance across the group. We achieved our target of an overall Lost Time Accident Rate of 5 in 2011, a 50% reduction compared to 2010 and an encouragement to set even stricter targets for 2012. The numbers reflect a raised level of awareness when it comes to risk in the workplace which is also supported by the fact that more and more plants and functions have started to achieve full years without LTAs and the reporting of near misses is steadily increasing. 2011 was the first year for tracking the number of near misses with a total amount of 12000 across the group. The goal is to increase this number even further, recognizing that this is a key indicator for the level of awareness required to make real change. We will report on the progress in this Communication on Progress and in our sustainability reports. © 2011 GRI 2 Reducing the use of hazardous materials LM Wind Power has produced more than 150,800 blades in the course of more than 30 years. This corresponds to approximately 54 GW installed wind power capacity which each year effectively replaces approximately 93 million tons of CO2. We are a manufacturing company, however, which uses a number of hazardous materials in the fabrication of our high technology products. We carefully manage the challenges that come from using these materials and continuously work on replacing or reducing their use in our manufacturing facilities. In 2011, we made important progress with the implementation of a low styrene emission gelcoat, which together with improved ventilation and new features on the molds, reduce the levels of styrene emissions in our plants by up to 90%. Gelcoat is the outer layer of paint on the rotor blades which is sprayed on to the mold before application of glass and resin. The change of this vital material has been underway for some years with extensive testing of alternative chemicals to ensure the right properties while achieving significant health and safety improvements. The roll out started in 2011 with the majority of the plants onboard by end of the year and full global implementation during 2012. Reducing waste to achieve bottom line savings A couple of years ago, LM Wind Power kicked off a global waste saving program, which, since its inception, has generated around EUR 9 million EBITDA savings, 2.7 of which was achieved in 2011. The program is a perfect example of our approach to sustainability which is business focused and provides environmental benefits that go hand in hand with running a profitable enterprise. By systematically reviewing our manufacturing processes, we have significantly reduced material consumption and waste from production, resulting in more than 2 million kg less waste to landfill over the course of two years. The waste saving program now moves to the next and more advanced level with increasingly comprehensive projects required to achieve further savings. The potential is estimated to be several million Euros which we expect to realize through targeted projects with suppliers and by looking more closely into the development and design phase of our products. Energy efficiency In 2011, all manufacturing facilities went through energy audits to find more efficient and environmentally friendly ways to reduce consumption. The efforts paid off and the overall energy consumption has decreased from 2010 to 2011. Part of the explanation is also decreased levels of production in some facilities, however, as the market was challenging in most parts of the world and we continuously adapted our operations. We still believe there is more to do to become even more energy efficient in the entire life cycle of our product. And we continue to look at solutions for ventilation, heating, power consumption etc. first and foremost in our manufacturing that will contribute to reducing our impact. © 2011 GRI 3 2.

Who would share our interests in sustainability and can help drive our improvements? We have engaged directly with those who can help us make a difference in reducing our environmental impact, improve our working environment and boost our technology to make even more efficient products that help power a cleaner world. Especially our employees and our suppliers play an important role. We continuously have projects ongoing with suppliers to reduce material waste, improve working environment, reduce our energy consumption, upgrade the skills of our employees and boost our technology to make it more efficient and thereby contribute to making wind power more attractive. We will among other things engage with the investor community through our reporting and our annual Communication on Progress to the UN Global Compact and continuously on our corporate website. © 2011 GRI 9 Box 4—Determining report content 3. Report Parameters Report scope and boundary 3.5 Process for defining report content, including: • Determining materiality; • Prioritizing topics within the report; and • Identifying stakeholders the organization expects to use the report. [GRI G3: p. 21] The performance indicators have been determined through a process of systematic review of the business' current sustainability challenges and focus areas by the cross-functional team and the sustainability board. The selected indicators represent Human Rights, Social, Labor and Environmental performance and are for now solely based on the Global Reporting Initiative's suggested list of sustainability indicators. The majority of the indicators represent environmental performance. As a company operating in a green industry we see it as part of our responsibility to continuously make our products and operations more environmentally friendly. We aim to reduce our environmental impact through the entire life cycle of our products and services and that includes mapping the current impact and setting targets for our performance. This is also closely linked to the Product Responsibility indicator which is a key indicator for LM Wind Power and one we expect to be able to expand our reporting on in line with our increased integration of life cycle assessment measures in our product development. Another key area is labor. We will track our performance on indicators related to working environment for our people. This relates to physical conditions and our drive towards an improved safety culture, and how we ensure people are motivated, encourage and able to utilize their potential and enjoy going to work. Finally, we want to improve on how we work with suppliers and anti-corruption. As an international company with many interfaces to the external world, we need to have a strong position on how we deal with practices that do not comply with internationally recognized standards. We want to ensure our Code of Conduct is enforced and highlighted to our employees and external partners and have initiated a formal training program that will reach our employees in the beginning of 2012. The performance indicators with comments are attached as a separate document as we have included more than the 10 this template allows for. We expect this report will be used by our management and owners, by our employees, customers, potential investors, and any other stakeholder with an interest in our business and progress towards increased sustainability. © 2011 GRI 10 Sustainability report 2011 using the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines Data on Performance Indicator 1: EC7 Procedures for local hiring and proportion of senior management hired from the local community at locations of significant operation.

Indicator 17: PR 1 Life cycle stages in which health and safety impacts of products and services are assessed for improvement, and percentage of significant products and services subject to such procedures. Performance R&D Manufacturing & Production Use and service Storage, distribution and supply Disposal, reuse, recycling 100% of LM Wind Power’s products and services are covered by and assessed for improvements of health and safety impact in at least one life cycle stage. Comments LM Wind Power has not made a full Life Cycle Assessment of our products. However, we have various initiatives, processes and projects in place that focus on improving health and safety impacts at different parts of the product life cycle. Focus in 2011 has be to align these initiatives better across the various functions to move towards a full life cycle assessment approach within the next few years. Examples of current practices: All new materials or materials that will be used differently are subject to a mandatory HSE assessment by Global HSE where impact on the people working with the material and impact on the external environment are assessed in relation to legal requirements and cost. Our R&D function is on a constant quest for more efficient products that increase the energy production and make wind power more attractive. Our acoustics experts are working on designing low noise blades to reduce the disturbance from turbines close to residential areas. We are testing various profiles and features and are gathering new knowledge that will soon go into the blades. The Service & Logistics division is investigating various ways of transporting more blades on a truck at the same time to reduce the fuel consumption and heavy traffic caused by huge blade transports. LM Wind Power is supporting and following research into potential blade recycling solutions to be able to provide the least environmentally damaging way of disposing of the blades. As the solutions available are highly costly, this is a longer term development focus. 8 9
