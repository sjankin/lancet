The Code specifies that the Board part of the regular review of the operation of the Board of Directors, or by the Compensation of Directors’ Internal Regulations should provide for Committee during the annual compensation review. For these reasons, and due to the an annual meeting of this nature, during which the collegiate nature of the Board of Directors (set out in article 1.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code), performance of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer no formal meeting of non-executive directors without the presence of executive or internal and Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s) would be assessed directors is held, nor is it provided for in the Board of Directors’ Internal Regulations. and which would provide the opportunity for a periodic reflection on the Company’s future management.

However, the members of days before they are reviewed by the Board of Directors). the Audit Committee receive the documents and information required to perform their work with sufficient time to review them satisfactorily.

It is to be noted that to assess the Group’s direct emissions, the CO2 In 2010, a CO2 emissions evaluation model developed for the Group emissions linked to the consumption of renewable energy (green was used to provide an initial estimate of the Group’s carbon footprint electricity, biomass, etc.) is calculated based on a CO2 emission factor using the GHG Protocol methodology. This covers all of the countries equal to zero. in which the Group has industrial activities, and represents around 95% of the volumes produced by the Group. In Spain, for example, the Campo Viejo site chose to offset their CO2 emissions linked to electricity consumption and the transport of its employees by participating in a United Nations project (production of hydroelectric power in the province of Gansu in China).

Challenges and strategy The optimisation of logistics and transport Pernod Ricard’s activities produce waste at two levels: on our The logistics teams are actively involved in reducing the Group’s production sites and at the consumer level in terms of packaging environmental impacts.

On our production sites, this waste is classified as follows:  Choice of transport type  organic waste, principally arising from the transformation of The Group estimates that nearly 80% of all transport involved in agricultural raw materials; producing and distributing its products from the factory to the first customer is by sea (expressed in tonne-kilometres).
