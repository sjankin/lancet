Rui Cartaxo Chairman of the Board of Directors REN Redes Energéticas Nacionais ANNUAL REPORT 2012 5 01 MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN This was a difficult year but also an important turning point for REN. 2012 was the most difficult year for the Euro zone since the 2008 financial crisis took its toll. The split between core and peripheral countries with regard to the access and cost of funding remained highly significant for most of the year, especially during the first half. In the second half, that gap started to shrink but recession spread to virtually all the Member States of the European Union, including Germany. In Portugal, the recession caused a continuous increase in unemployment and contraction of economic activity. The most positive sign was the reorientation of demand and supply towards tradable goods and services, which resulted in the first surplus of the external balance of goods and services in decades. As a result of the recession and the financial crisis, the demand for energy displayed a further reduction in 2012 and energy consumption in Portugal is currently lower than its 2006 level. REN has a business model that is relatively robust against changes in the demand for energy, at least in the short to medium-term. However, the Company was not totally immune to the recession. The need for new power and gas transmission infrastructures displayed a significant slowdown which translated into a sizeable reduction of our investment versus 2011. REN´s good operational performance allowed for an increase of its net income in spite of the worsening cost of debt. EBITDA continued to show robust growth (+8.9%). This reflects several factors, but I would highlight REN’s good response to the efficiency challenges posed by the regulatory framework, as well as the timely and efficient manner in which several important investment projects were concluded and put into operation. Also, EBITDA reflected an increase in the average rate of return on electricity regulated assets, partly linked to the rise in interest rates. Net financial income deteriorated by €32.7 million reflecting the increasingly difficult conditions in new funding as well as the impact of the downgrading of the company’s rating on several loans. This was especially the case with the 2008 five-year bond issue which contained step-up clauses that became effective after November 2011. Among the projects completed in 2012, the LNG terminal upgrade stands out as a landmark for energy supply security. This is all the more important as it reinforces the capacity to diversify the sourcing of natural gas. In addition to being a year that demonstrated REN´s resilience to adverse macroeconomic conditions, 2012 was also the year in which REN became a private company. In May 2012, Parpública sold 40% of REN’s share capital to the State Grid Corporation of China (25%) and to the Oman Oil Corporation (15%). The Portuguese State retained 11%. 6 Chairman’s Message The success of the above transaction has provided REN with a reinforced and more diversified shareholder base. State Grid is the largest utility in the world and brings us a global perspective, as well as strong financial support and help in some additional areas of technical expertise. Oman Oil, being an international financial investor in energy companies, also adds to our global capacities and visibility. As a result, our company now stands in a better position for the next stage of its development. Our concessions in Portugal will remain our main focus and the main source of value creation for our stakeholders. But at the same time as we continue to improve our efficiency in the core concessions, we are about to start developing new sources of value creation outside Portugal. The same skills that allowed us to reach a record level of quality of service and continuity of supply in 2012 will be used to further raise the efficiency of our Portuguese operations and to start exporting some of those technical capabilities. Our company is about to enter a new and exciting phase of its life. Recognizing the limits of value creation in the domestic market, we have defined cost efficiency as an absolute priority in Portugal and the development of new business opportunities beyond the existing concessions as a way forward to find additional sources of value creation. Overall REN will continue to grow, while retaining its focus on its core competences: planning, building and operating energy transmission systems. We are aware of the important role that REN’s dividend plays in overall shareholder return. In coming years, our shareholders will continue to enjoy a steady high-yield dividend, as was clearly (re)stated during the presentation of the Strategic Plan to the market during REN’s Investor Day. People are our company’s major asset. Strong technical skills and a culture of team work form the basis for our commitment to high quality and continuity of supply to all users of our infrastructures. In 2012, we achieved zero interruption time, both in electricity and natural gas. We continued to invest in the integration of sustainability into our day-to-day activities, promoting the engagement of all stakeholders and accompanying the development of the communities where we work. We were proud to see our commitment to transparency, best practices and sustainable development, be publicly recognized both in Portugal and internationally. We will continue to actively endorse the UN Global Compact principles and encourage all our stakeholders to promote sustainable development in their activities. In relation to corporate governance, REN’s Board is committed to adopting measures that can further improve our performance, which was already recognized in 2012 amongst the top ranking companies for compliance with corporate governance recommendations. I would like to thank REN’s Audit Committee for their valuable contribution and advice. This was a difficult year but also an important turning point for REN. We are proud of what we have achieved and look forward to the upcoming challenges. I thank REN’s employees for their hard work, and our shareholders and business partners for their trust and continuous support. Rui Cartaxo Chairman of the Board of Directors 8 REN at a glance 02 REN AT A GLANCE 2.1 Corporate Framework p PROFILE The year 2012 saw the start of a new phase for the company in which the majority of equity capital, until then held by state companies, passed to the hands of private entities. This change was the result of the second stage of the REN privatization process, approved by Decree-Law No 106-B/2011 of 3rd November. Unlike the first REN privatization stage, which allowed part of the company’s capital to be placed into the regulated market, the main aims of the second stage were to strengthen the development of the company and to comply with commitments made by Portugal in the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality established between the Portuguese Government, the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank. This second stage of privatization took place through the direct sale of 40% of REN capital held by Parpública – Participações Públicas, SGPS, S.A., to two strategic investors:  5% of REN equity capital was acquired indirectly by the State Grid 2 Corporation of China; and 15% of REN equity capital was acquired directly by the Oman Oil Company. As part of the conditions formulated by the Portuguese Government requiring the presentation of a suitable strategic project for the company within the scope of the second stage of privatization, two strategic partnership agreements were signed with the new REN shareholders, with special emphasis on the agreement with State Grid Corporation of China, which acquired the status of REN Strategic Industrial Partner. These agreements, which establish a number of commitments for cooperation and relations with key entities in the world energy market, will help propel the company’s internationalization process, which is currently underway. Brief description of company business p REN’s core business consists of the management of energy transmission systems and we are present in the electricity and natural gas markets, one of the few operators in Europe with this characteristic.  lectricity – the transmission of very high voltage and the overall technical E management of the national electricity system through REN – Rede Eléctrica, S.A., a company wholly owned by REN and the public service concession holder. The concession is for a period of 50 years and started in 2007.  atural gas – the high pressure transmission and the overall technical N management of the national natural gas system. Activities range from the reception, storage and regasification of liquefied natural gas to the underground storage of gas. This business is conducted through the following companies which are part of the REN Group: REN Gasodutos, S.A., REN Atlântico – Terminal de GNL, S.A. and REN Armazenagem, S.A., respectively. These companies have been public service concession holders since 2006, and the licence is for a period of 40 years. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 9 Through REN Trading, S.A., REN manages the energy to be acquired from two electrical power producing centres, as part of energy acquisition contracts which were not subject to early termination. Since 2002, REN has also been present in the telecommunications sector through RENTELECOM – Comunicações, S.A., established with the aim of using the surplus capacity of the safety telecommunications networks which are vital to electricity and natural gas transmission. In October 2010, the Portuguese state awarded Enondas, Energia das Ondas, S.A., a company wholly owned by REN, a concession for wave energy production in a pilot area to the north of S. Pedro de Moel. The concession has been granted for a period of 45 years and includes authorization to build the infrastructures required to connect to the public power grid. Group business functions are conducted by REN Serviços, S.A. (“REN Serviços”). More specifically, this includes support functions for the concession holders and back-office. In addition to this support work, REN Serviços also operates as a commercial extension of REN, providing consultancy and/or engineering services to third parties within the energy sector. With the aim of improving the Group’s operational efficiency and to extend the object of REN Serviços and develop the important role that this company has come to play in the REN Group, a two-stage corporate and functional restructuring plan has been outlined. The first stage of this restructuring was concluded in 2011, with the constitution of REN Gás, S.A. This company is responsible for the management and coordination of activity in the natural gas sector and is now held directly by REN Serviços. In the second stage of the reorganization, a company will be formed which will have identical functions to assist the concessions in the eletricity sector. Holdings p Further to the agreement between Portugal and Spain on the forming of an Iberian electrical power market, REN has capital holdings of 35% in OMIP, SGPS, S.A. and 10% in Operador del Mercado Ibérico de Energía, Polo Español, S.A., a company operating under Spanish law and counterpart of OMIP SGPS, S.A. Through these holdings in OMIP SGPS, S.A. and Operador del Mercado Ibérico de Energía, Polo Español, S.A. – whose subsidiaries OMIP, SGMR, S.A. and OMI, Polo Español S.A support the Iberian eletricity market – REN is able to develop the energy market in the Iberian Peninsula. In addition to the abovementioned partnerships with the new shareholders, highlight also goes to other important strategic partnerships, such as those which have been developed with Red Elétrica Corporación, S.A. (a company with holdings in REN) and with Enagás, S.A., in which REN has holdings of 1%. 10 REN at a glance 2.2 GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS MEETING Pedro Canastra de Azevedo da Maia, chairman GOVERNING Duarte Vieira Pestana de Vasconcelos, vice-chairman BODIES BOARD OF DIRECTORS (Members of the governing bodies) Rui Manuel Janes Cartaxo, chairman João Caetano Faria Conceição, member Gonçalo João Figueira Morais Soares, member Guangchao Zhu, vice-chairman1 Mengrong Cheng, member Haibin Wan, member Hilal Ali Saif Al Kharusi, member Aníbal Durães dos Santos, member2 Filipe Maurício de Botton, member3 Manuel Carlos de Melo Champalimaud, member4 José Folgado Branco, member5 José Luís Fazenda Arnaut Duarte, member6 José Luís Alvim Marinho, member José Frederico Vieira Jordão, member Emílio Rui da Veiga Peixoto Vilar, member EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE Rui Manuel Janes Cartaxo, chairman João Caetano Carreira Faria Conceição, member Gonçalo João Figueira Morais Soares, member AUDIT COMMITTEE José Luís Alvim Marinho, chairman José Frederico Vieira Jordão, member Emílio Rui da Veiga Peixoto Vilar, member STATUTORY AUDITOR Deloitte & Associados, SROC, SA Carlos Luís Oliveira de Melo Loureiro, ROC, substitute COMPANY SECRETARY Pedro Jorge Cabral da Silva Nunes Mafalda Maria Pinto de Mesquita Rebelo de Sousa, substitute REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Carlos Adolfo Coelho Figueiredo Rodrigues, chairman Pedro Miguel de Sommer Carvalho, member Rui Miguel de Oliveira Horta e Costa, member GENERAL GENERAL MANAGERS Shewu Shan MANAGERS AND Maria José Menéres Duarte Pacheco Clara MANAGERS Jorge Manuel Martins Borrego Victor Manuel da Costa Antunes Machado Baptista MANAGERS Corporate structures and consultancy Internal audits, Gil Vicente Jorge Marcelino Investor relations, Ana Rosa Fonseca Pereira Fernandes de Matos Planning and Management Control, João Escobar Henriques Communication, Ana Margarida Ferreirinha da Silva Baptista Moreira Rato Business Development, Francisco Maria da Costa de Sousa de Macedo Simão Project Management, Performed by Jorge Manuel Martins Borrego Consultancy and Commercial Services, Jorge Manuel Pais Marçal Liça 1 Representing State Grid International Development Limited 2 Designated by Parpública – Participações Públicas (SGPS), S.A. on 27th March 2012 3D  esignated by EGF, Gestão e Consultoria Financeira, S.A. on 15th June 2012 4 Designated by Gestmin, SGPS, S.A. on 17th July 2012 5 Designated by Red Eléctrica Corporación, S.A. on 26th April 2012 6A  ppointed by co-optation by the Board of Directors on 22nd June 2012 ANNUAL REPORT 2012 11 Support to concessions Studies and Regulation, Pedro Manuel Amorim La Puente Furtado Operational Services, Isabel Maria Nazaré Carvalho Figueira European Energy Agenda, João Pedro da Silva Ricardo Shared services Financial Management, Nuno Miguel da Silva Alves do Rosário Accounting and Administrative Services, Gerardo Gonçalves Procurement, Alexandra Margarida Vieira Reis Legal Services, Maria Elvira Teixeira Borges Human Resources, Elsa Maria Pinto de Carvalho Domingos Information Systems, Tiago Bueri Antero de Azevedo Sustainability, Rui Manuel Vicente Martins Buldings and General Services, João Luís Navarro de Castro Correia Botelho Rede Elétrica Planning and Engineering, João Emanuel de Moura Afonso Investment, António Albino Alencoão Marques Operation, Albertino José Cerejo Meneses System Management, José Júlio Amarante dos Santos Enondas Management, João Paulo Maria Freire Cardoso Natural Gas System Planning and Management, Rui Manuel Cardoso Vicente Marmota Asset Engineering, António Ferreira Marques Investment and Operation, Luis Manuel Ferreira LNG Terminal, Paulo Fernando Pereira Mestre REN Telecom Management, Rui Manuel Macara Gabirro Franco REN Trading Management, Nelson Ferreira Cardoso 2.3 VOTING RIGHTS OF REN AS OF 31ST DECEMBER 2012 SHAREHOLDER STRUTURE 9,9% 17,0% 1,1% 5,0% 0,7% 2,0% 5,0% 15,0% 5,0% 5,8% 8,4% 25,0% STATE GRID OF CHINA EGF-GCF, S.A.

AVERAGE 5 YEARS 18 REN at a glance 2.6 2.6.1 REGULATED ELECTRICITY ASSETS Electricity business p REN SA works in two regulated areas: Global System Management (GGS) and Transmission of Electrical Power (TEE). The revenue allowed from GGS and TEE is received by applying two regulated tariffs: the tariff for the Global Use of the System (UGS) and the tariff for the Use of theTransmission Network (URT). Both tariffs are defined annually by the Energy Services Regulatory Authority (ERSE) based on energy and economic forecasts for demand, costs, revenues and investment. In 2012, a new regulation period was started and while no changes were made to the actual form of the regulation, the regulatory parameters were updated. The efficiency factor applied to operating costs for the Transmission of Electrical Power was altered to 3.5% (2013 and 2014) and the remuneration rate is now indexed to the 5 year Portuguese Republic Credit Default Swap rating. Limits, between 7.5% and 10.5%to the remuneration base rate for the 2012-2014 period were also introduced. Regulation of activities p Activity relating to the Global Use of the System is regulated by a remuneration rate applied to the assets allocated to the activity, net of depreciations, subsidies and eligible operating costs. Activity relating to the Transmission of Electrical Power is regulated by incentives: (I) incentive to efficient investment in the transmission network; (ii) incentive to efficiency in operating costs by establishing a maximum limit for these costs plus a component based on the level of company activity;(iii) incentive to maintain equipment at the end of its service life in operation; and (iv) incentive to increase the availability of the elements of the National Transmission Network (RNT). The investment incentive consists of calculating the asset base (RAB) to be remunerated and the respective rate of remuneration based on the level of efficiency achieved by the company. The value of operating costs set for the 1st year of the regulation period evolves in subsequent years in line with the variation rate of the Price Index implicit in the GDP, and with an efficiency target determined by ERSE, which for 2013 and 2014 is 3.5%. Added to this amount is the change in the OPEX due to the annual growth in the transmission network (in kilometres of lines and in the number of panels at substations), calculated with the corresponding incremental costs, also set by ERSE. The aim of the incentive to maintain equipment which has reached the end of its working life is to stimulate continuity in service of certain assets which are are at the end of their economic life but still technically viable in operational terms. For 2011, this incentive stood at EUR 8M. The aim of the incentive to increase the availability of the National Electricity Transmission Grid, which was introduced in 2009, is to promote more efficient operation and maintenance of the grid’s infrastructure and is calculated based on values that have already occurred. The electricity regulated assets base (RAB) consists of the assets net of amortizations and subsidies allocated to the activities of Electrical Power Transmission and Global Management of the System. As already mentioned, through the publication of Ministerial Order No. 14430/2010 of 15th September, the assets base to be remunerated is based on the application of the valuation ANNUAL REPORT 2012 19 mechanism of new investment in the RNT, at reference costs with effect as of 1st January 2009. Therefore, in 2012, the average RAB on which the premium rate of 11.05% was applied, was EUR 753 million, while the remaining EUR 1 177 million was remunerated at a non premium rate of 9.55%. In the activity of Global Management of the System, the principle of RAB valuation is based on historical costs. In these cases, the remuneration rate of 9.55% is applied. In 2012, the average RAB for the activity of Global Management of the System stood at EUR 43 million. Moreover, part of the assets allocated to this activity is public land used for hydro-electrical purposes, the remuneration for which is calculated through the interbank swap rate with the maturity closest to the remaining lifetime of each asset, calculated on the 1st day of each period, as published by Reuters, plus 50 base points, pursuant to Ministerial Order No. 542/2010 of 21st July, which in 2012 corresponded to a remuneration rate of 3.15% applied to a sum of EUR 306 million. The following graph shows the RAB for the different asset groups: RAB FROM 1999 TO 2012 2 500 753 2 000 561 351 130 1 298 1 324 1 500 1 273 1 172 1 245 1 220 1 034 M€ 911 775 833 706 701 696 722 1 000 500 523 507 492 476 461 445 427 409 394 361 347 333 319 306 0 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012E RAB POWER PLANT LAND RAB RATE WITHOUT PREMIUM (EXCLUDES LAND) RAB RATE WITH PREMIUM The tariffs set by ERSE also reflect tariff differences which, after two years, (to the extent they are justified and accepted by ERSE) reconcile the forecast and real values of income and costs and differences in demand. The adjustments arising from the differences are recovered or returned two years after they have occurred. This sum is remunerated at a regulated rate equal to the 1 year Euribor average seen each year, plus a spread published annually by ERSE for the year in question. At the end of 2012, the balance of differences was EUR 20 million to be recovered from tariffs. The difference in 2012 of EUR 8 million to be recovered by REN was mainly due to an underestimation of consumption by the regulator and the application of Ministerial Order No. 139/2012 of 14th May which revoked the remuneration mechanism for the provision of the power guarantee service at electrical power production plants. 20 REN at a glance 2.6.1.1 REN TRADING REN Trading is responsible for the Purchase and Sale of Electrical Power from the Commercial Agent, which consists of trading in the Iberian Electrical Power Market (MIBEL) and production from the remaining Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) through Tejo Energia and Turbogás. The revenues from the Purchase and Sale of Electrical Power are essentially obtained from the market sale of production from the remaining PPAs, applying the UGS tariff, which reflects the difference, positive or negative, between the corresponding cost within the scope of the PPA, plus the incentives to optimise the management of these contracts and the efficient management of the CO2 emission licences, plus the income from the market sale of power and system services supplied by the respective power generators. In 2012, the balance of the tariff difference account from the Purchase and Sale of Electrical Power was EUR 32 million to be recovered in the tariffs. 2.6.2 NATURAL GAS Natural gas business p The natural gas activities listed below are subject to economic regulation by ERSE. Natural gas high-pressure transmission – through REN Gasodutos Overall technical management of the SNGN – through REN Gasodutos Reception, storage and regasification of LNG – through REN Atlântico Natural gas underground storage – through REN Armazenagem Supplier switching management process – through REN Gasodutos Regulation through incentives, promoting OPEX (operating and maintenance costs) efficiency, was applied to transmission activity as well as reception, storage and regasification in the current regulation period (2010-2013). Currently, the level of eligible operating costs (cap) to calculate income has a maximum permitted value and includes a fixed part, subject to a regulatory revenue cap approach and a variable part, subject to a price cap approach, indexed to the representative variables of the size of the infrastructure and its use. The value approved for OPEX for the first year of the current regulation period, evolves in subsequent years in line with the variation rate of the Price Index implicit in GDP, and with efficiency targets established and published by ERSE for this purpose. In 2012, the efficiency target was set at 0% for transmission activity by REN Gasodutos; and at 1% for REN Atlântico activities. Regulation of activities p The revenues relating to invested capital stem from the return on fixed assets in operation, net of amortizations and subsidies (RAB), at a rate set by the Regulator at the start of every regulatory period, at a rate of 8% in 2012, plus the corresponding amortizations. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 21 Up to the end of 2012, the six monthly average RAB values for the natural gas companies had the following evolution: 1 200 1 000 800 106 EUR 600 400 200 0 2007-1Sem 2007 2008-1Sem 2008 2009-1Sem 2009 2010-1Sem 2010 2011 2012 REN ARMAZENAGEM REN ATLÂNTICO REN GASODUTOS In 2012, the RAB for all NG activities evolved positively as a result of the investment made to increase the system’s capacity. This increase especially reflects the project to expand the storage capacity of the LNG terminal, through the conclusion of the third stage and the startup of the new LNG storage tank, corresponding to an investment of approximately EUR 103 million. Tariffs are set based on estimates of quantities and the total income allowed, calculated for each activity. This income includes return on assets, recovery of the value of amortizations and established operating costs, per activity, as well as the tariff adjustments for previous years. The adjustments arising from the differences are recovered or returned two years after they have occurred. This sum is remunerated at a regulated rate equal to the 3-month Euribor average seen each year, plus a spread published annually by ERSE for the year in question. 2.7 2.7.1 INFRASTRUCTURES ELECTRICITY At the end of 2012, the RNT (National Transmission Grid) consisted of 8 533.8 km in lines and 65 transformer substations and 13 step down, switching and transition substations. 22 REN at a glance NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK 2012-12-31 2011-12-31 Var (%) Length of lines in service (km) 8 534 8 371 1.9 400 kV 2 333 2 236 4.2 220 kV 3 521 3 492 0.8 150 kV 2 680 2 643 1.4 Transformation power in service (km) 33 915 33 777 0.4 Autotransformation 13 410 13 410 0 400/220 kV 6 300 6 300 0 400/150 kV 5 990 5 990 0 220/150 kV 970 970 0 150/130 kV 150 150 0 Transformation 20 505 20 367 0.7 400/60 kV 3 230 3 060 5.3 220/60 kV 11 443 10 997 3.9 150/60 kV 5 692 6 170 -8.4 150/130 kV 140 140 0 The RNT enables power flow from production plants to the transformer substations where it is fed to the National Distribution Grid at 60 kV. The RNT also connects to the European Transmission Grid through 9 interconnection points with the Spanish Transmission Grid as well as delivering VHV directly to numerous consumers. The National Dispatch Centre in Sacavém (Loures) coordinates general operations and ensures balance in the National Electricity System. The Network Operations Centre in Vermoim (Maia) is responsible for the Monitoring and Remote Operation of all National Transmission Grid equipment. The Corporate Telecommunications Network uses this infrastructure extensively (fibre optic and hertzian beams) to provide data transmission services, control commands to network elements and the communications facilities required for operating the RNT. The interconnection with the Spanish Transmission Network was provided by one 130 kV line between Minho and Galicia, three 220 kV lines at Douro International and by five 400 kV lines, two between Minho and Galicia, one at Douro International, one at Tejo International and one between the Alentejo and Extremadura. The national stretch of a new 400 kV interconnection is now concluded between the Algarve and Andalucia. 2.7.2 NATURAL GAS REN’s natural gas infrastructures include: The National Natural Gas Transmission Network (RNTGN); The Sines Liquefied Natural Gas terminal (LNG); T  he Carriço natural gas underground storage facilities (3 caverns and 1 gas station). ANNUAL REPORT 2012 23 In 2012, the Carbogal plant delivery point in Sines came into operation. The project to automate the Bidoeira station was also concluded, resulting in anincrease in security of supply, given that this multi-junction station serves the convergence of the four main RNTGN gas pipelines. With regard to the network infrastructure, highlight goes to the start of construction work on the new Mangualde-Celorico-Guarda gas pipeline, approximately 74.5 km in length. This project is expected to come into operation at the end of 2013 and it will allow a ring connection of the high-pressure network in the central-interior area of Portugal. This will increase security of supply and includes the first section for the future third interconnection of the RNTGN with Spain. Therefore, at the end of 2012, the RNTGN consisted of the following infrastructures: 1 298 km of high-pressure gas pipelines; 62 junction stations for pipeline branching; 43 block valve stations; 5 T-branch interconnection stations; 84 gas pressure regulating and metering stations; 2 custody transfer stations. In the last five years, the transmission network has undergone the following developments: LENGHT OF GAS PIPELINES, km 1 300 1 296 1 298 1 298 1 270 1 267 1 240 1 248 1 210 1 180 1 150 1 120 1 090 1 060 1 030 1 000 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 24 REN at a glance THE NATIONAL NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION NETWORK Ø (mm) km Lot 1 Setúbal – Leiria 700 173 Leiria – Gondomar 700 164 Lot 2 Gondomar – Braga 500 50 Lot 3 Campo Maior – Leiria 700 220 Lot 4 Braga – Valença 500 74 Lot 5 Monforte – Guarda 300 184 Lot 6 Mealhada – Viseu 500 68 Lot 7 Sines – Setúbal 800 87 High-pressure branches 150-700 278 Total 1 298 As of 31st December 2012, the available capacity for commercial purposes of relevant points of the RNTGN was as follows: AVAILABLE CAPACITY FOR COMMERCIAL GWh Mm3(n) PURPOSES OF RELEVANT POINTS per day per day ENTRY Sines 213 17.9 Carriço (Withdrawal US) 86 7.2 Campo Maior (IP39) 134 11.3 Valença do Minho (IP40 ) 40 3.4 EXIT Sines 179 15.0 Carriço (Injection US) 24 2.0 Campo Maior (IP39) 70 5.9 Valença do Minho (IP40 ) 25 2.1 Outputs by GRMS (total) 707 59.4 Supervised from a state-of-the-art National Dispatch Centre, using redundant fibre-optic technology telecommunication systems, the RNTGN connects the gas pipeline stations with the Sines LNG Terminal and the Carriço underground storage facility at Carriço, in Pombal municipality. All systems are equipped with digital communication,specially with regard to the monitoring and registering of network input and output flows. This allows for the best practices to be adopted both in relation to information quality and supervision response. In May 2012, the LNG terminal expansion project (2009–2012) was concluded. The aim of this project was to increase the facility’s storage and supply capacities. Work was completed below initial budget and sooner than anticipated. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 25 After the conclusion of this project, the main specifications of the Sines LNG Terminal are as follows: Annual natural gas regasification capacity of 8 bcm;  ooring adapted for methane tankers with capacities ranging from 40 000 M to 216 000 m3; Supply capacity (maximum) of 1 350 000 m3(n)/h; Tanker truck filling station capable of handling 4 500 loads/year (0.12 bcm). Gas is stored at great depth in underground salt caverns which connect to a gas station allowing the management of gas stored by injection through natural gas compressors and withdrawal through natural gas dehydration systems for subsequent injection into the transmission network. The REN gas station also interconnects with another concession holder’s caverns. REN constructs salt caverns using a leaching station, water collection equipment and a system which rejects brine into the sea. At the end of 2012, the natural gas underground storage facilities of the REN Armazenagem concession were as follows: three operational caverns; maximum capacity: 1.66 TWh <> 142.5 Mm3(n); maximum capacities of the surface station: – injection: 110 000 m3(n)/h (31,4 GWh/day); – withdrawal: 300 000 m3(n)/h (86 GWh/day); REN Armazenagem is responsible for the operation of the surface station. 03 MANAGEMENT REPORT WE’RE GROWING TO NEW HORIZONS REN is getting ready to expand its horizons. Our future now lies in the 4 corners of the world, where we will face new challenges and new opportunities to demonstrate the efficiency of out electric network. Internationalization, driven by clearly delineated, strategic partnerships and by ever higher standards of quality, will be a vital step allowing REN to reach ever further. REN. A NETWORK IN EVOLUTION. 28 MANAGEMENT REPORT 03 MANAGEMENT REPORT 3.1 3.1.1 ENVIRONMENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT World Economy 1 The recovery of the global economy slowed further in 2012. The forecast for growth in economic activity was +3.1% (vs. +3.8% in 2011 and +5.1% in 2010). This slowdown was fuelled by the negative contribution of the European Union (EU), where several member countries are implementing policies to correct internal and external imbalances which were accumulated prior to the financial crisis and which continue to impact negatively on domestic consumption, investment and unemployment. A contraction of growth in the EU is expected of -0.3% in 2012, after positive growth of +1.5% in 2011. This performance is expected to lead to a reduction of -0.4% in the growth of advanced economies to +1.2% in 2012, despite the good performance expected in the USA (+2.1% in 2012 as against +1.8% in 2011) and in Japan (+2.0% in 2012 vs. -0.8% in 2011). Emerging economies, although affected by the slowdown in growth and consumption in advanced economies, continue to see rates of growth which are considerably above the world average. Looking at the main regions in 2012, growth of +7.7% is expected in China and +5.0% in India and Sub-Saharan Africa. Latin America is an exception, with forecast growth of only +2.9%. Euro Zone 2 p The Euro zone continues to experience a very fragile economic situation, where the economy is expected to contract by -0.4% in 2012, after seeing growth of +1.4% in 2011. This is a result of the ongoing adjustment processes underway in several member countries. The combination of cuts in spending/tax increases in 2012 is expected to lead to a contraction in private consumption (-1%), public expenditure (-0.2%), investment (-3.5%) and an increase in the rate of unemployment (to 11.3%). On the positive side, highlight goes to the increase in the contribution to growth of net exports (positive contribution of 1.3% in 2012, against 0.9% in 2011) and the reduction of the aggregate budget deficit of 4.1% of GDP in 2011 to 3.3% in 2012. Interest Rates 3,4 p During 2012, the ECB cut the reference rate from 1% to 0.75%, while the United States Federal Reserve kept the Fed Funds Target Rate between 0% and 0.25%. Moreover, the drop in the reference rate and the uncertainty about the future of the single currency led to a normalization of Euribor rates. Therefore, at 31 December 2012, Euribor rates for 3, 6 and 12 months stood at 0.187% (compared to 1.356% at the end of 2011), 0.320% (vs. 1.617%) and 0.542% (vs. 1.947%), respectively. In other words, a drop of around 120-140 base points over the end of 2011. 1 European Commission: European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012 2 European Commission: European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012 – Euro Zone 3 Reference Rates: ECB and FED (http://www.ecb.int; http://www.federalreserve.gov/) 4 Bank of Portugal: Euribor Rates ANNUAL REPORT 2012 29 Portuguese Economy 5,6 p 2012 was marked by a dramatic contraction in economic activity, a result of implementing the measures set out in the memorandum of understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF “Troika”. As a result, the conjugation of budgetary consolidation measures and restrictive credit (part of the deleveraging process in the banking sector), are expected to lead to a reduction in GDP of -3.0% in 2012. This contraction was brought about by the sharp drop in private consumption (-5.5%), public spending (-4.5%) and investment (-14.4%). On the positive side, of note was the good performance in the balance of trade: imports dropped by -6.9% and exports rose +4.1%. Looking more closely at the contributions to the variation in GDP in 2012, the main causes were the drop in domestic demand -7.2% and the rise in net exports of +4.2%. The latter, as was the case in 2011, was the only positive contribution to the Portuguese economy. Also of note was the target for the public spending deficit of 5.0%, which is expected to be met, although it was necessary to resort to extraordinary measures. Public debt continues to increase and is forecast to reach 119.1% of GDP in 2012 (as against 108.1% in 2011). 3.1.2 SECTORAL ENVIRONMENT Globally, the energy year of 2012 was marked by the economic and financial crisis which impacted on energy policies and brought changes to the world energy map. Intensification of production of oil and gas in the United States (through technologies which allow access to shale oil and gas resources), the progressive abandonment of nuclear energy (mainly in Europe and Japan, for security reasons and in the USA and Canada, as it is becoming less competitive), the expansion in the production of non-conventional gas, the ever increasing use of wind and solar power and greater focus on energy efficiency are factors which all affected global energy trends and the climate and will continue to do so in coming decades. The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its New Policies Scenario states that despite recent developments and new policies, this will only have a marginal impact on long-term trends for energy and climate. According to IEA forecasts – New Policies Scenario – world energy demand is expected to grow by more than 30% up to 2035. In the long-term, the evolution in energy related CO2 emissions points to an increase of 3.6ºC in the average temperature (above the target limit of 2ºC for average global temperature increase). In this period, the expansion of energy infrastructures indispensable to meet new needs, along with the need to replace existing obsolete capacity, will require vast investment. The IEA estimates that China, India and the Middle East will represent 60% of the increase in energy demand up to 2035. In OECD countries, the increase in energy demand will be minimal. Between 2015 and 2020, the increase in the supply of non-conventional sources in the USA, Canada and Brazil will drive production in non OPEC countries. After 2020, this scenario may change, leading to a new increase in the relative weighting of OPEC oil production which could reach a share of 50% of world production in 2035. Emerging economies are also expected to dominate the expansion of supply in the long-term. 5 Bank of Portugal: Economic Bulletin Winter 2012 6 European Commission: European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012 – Portugal 30 MANAGEMENT REPORT As far as the energy sources in use, and despite the rapid growth in renewables, the dominance of fossil fuels will continue, tending towards a reduction in weighting in the global mix from the current 81% to 75% by 2035. The good performance of natural gas points to growth in use, almost reaching the level of coal within the same time frame. The share of non-conventional gas will constitute half of the increase in world gas production in 2035, with China, the United States and Australia being the largest producers. World demand for electricity will continue to grow. The IEA forecasts that renewable technologies will constitute half of the total new installed capacity, led by hydro and wind energy. Coal will be the main fossil fuel, especially in non OECD countries, but its overall weighting will reduce from the current 40% to around 30% by 2035. In OECD countries, the share of coal production will fall and be overtaken by gas and renewables up to 2035. Globally, the percentage of renewable sources of energy in the production of electricity is expected to reach 31% by 2035. In relation to nuclear energy, after the events of Fukushima Daiichi, evolution has been revised downwards as many countries have reformulated their nuclear policies. However, production has grown in absolute terms (due to expansion in countries such as China, South Korea, India and Russia) but its share in the global energy model will fall slightly in the long-term. In this period, the IEA estimates that the electricity sector will require global investment of approximately 17 billion dollars (around half of energy investment) with 40% of this amount dedicated to transmission and distribution networks. Despite the increased use of energy, forecasts suggest that in the long-term, around 1 billion people will continue without access to electricity. However, according to the IEA, an accumulated investment of around 1 billion dollars would ensure universal access to energy by 2030. In the long-term, energy efficiency will be vital to ensure, not only supply security, but also to achieve the agreed goals to tackle climate change. In the Efficient World Scenario which predicts the removal of barriers to the implementation of economically viable energy efficiency measures, the increase in primary energy demand would fall by half by 2035. Demand and production p In 2012, electricity consumption supplied by the public network decreased to 49.1 TWh, contracting 2.9% over the previous year, (or 3.6% taking into consideration corrections relating to temperature effects and the number of working days). Despite a slowdown in the decrease trend at the end of the year, this was the second consecutive year of reduction in consumption, with an accumulated fall of 6% over the maximum figures seen in 2010. TWh Consumption Variation Corrected 2008 50.6 1.1% 1.2% 2009 49.9 -1.4% -1.8% 2010 52.2 4.6% 3.3% 2011 50.5 -3.3% -2.3% 2012 49.1 -2.9% -3.6% ANNUAL REPORT 2012 31 The maximum power requested of the network, seen in January, stood at 8 554 MW, about 850 MW below the maximum historic value recorded in 2010. In April, the Carregado fueloil plant, with 710 MW of installed power was declassified. It had been in operation since 1968. Among the new power plants, of note is the new Alqueva II plant with 254 MW, as well as an increase of about 100 MW in production under the Special Regime. Meanwhile, on 1 January 2013, the Setúbal fueloil plant, with 946 MW of installed power was also declassified. It had been in operation since 1979.

Losses stood at 641 GWh, corresponding to 1.56% of energy intake. 3.1.3 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT European Energy Policy p In 2012 highlight went to the positive contribution provided by the European Union (EU) to the energy economy and energy efficiency with the publication of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency. This Directive establishes a common framework for measures to promote energy efficiency in the European Union. The aim is to improve energy efficiency by 20 % by 2020 and to establish a roadmap for new improvements beyond 2020. It also sets out rules for the removal of obstacles in the energy market and to overcome market deficiencies. It also establishes indicative national objectives for energy efficiency up to 2020. With regard to renewable energies, of note is the Communication “Renewable energies: a decisive agent in the European energy market”. This document highlights the contribution of renewable energies to the diversification of energy supply in the EU, strengthening supply security and favoring European competitiveness. With the publication of the Communication “Making the internal energy market work”, the European Commission sets out different actions with a view to concluding the EU internal energy market before 2014, and allowing the ANNUAL REPORT 2012 33 full potential of a genuinely integrated European market to be explored. This document also identifies the need to intensify consumer protection as well as the investment needed to modernize energy infrastructures. The existence of duly interconnected, high-performance and sustainable TransEuropean networks is considered to be indispensable if the EU single market is to work at full potential and advance to a hypo-carbonic and more sustainable economy. With regard to energy infrastructures, and further to the setting up of the European Interconnection Mechanism, in June 2012, the European Council agreed the Pact for Growth and Employment, to eliminate barriers which still exist in the single market and it expressly refers to the sectors which are at the heart of the European Interconnection Mechanism: transport, energy and the Internet. The European Council also reached agreement with regard to the immediate launch of the pilot phase of obligations to finance projects. Domestic Energy Policy p In Portugal in 2012, the sector witnessed the implementation of the energy policy guidelines laid out in the Program of the XIX Constitutional Government. “In the medium-term, the aim of the government is for Portugal to have the lowest energy intensity in the European Union.” It also seeks to promote “liberalized, highly competitive energy markets, with transparent mechanisms for setting prices and stable and correctly applied regulation.” During the year, the European directives which establish common rules for internal electricity and natural gas markets were transposed. The aims of these directives are to contribute toward an increase in competition, to create effective regulation and to stimulate investment to benefit electricity and natural gas consumers. Therefore, the new principles relating to the organization and operation of the electricity sector were established (Decree-Laws 215-A/2012 and 215-B/2012) and for natural gas (Decree-Laws 230/2012 and 231/2012). During 2012, the Government reviewed the reference tariff on which the subsidised remuneration regime is based for the production of power under the special regime (cogeneration and photovoltaic). The evolution observed in the market, together with the fall in demand and the implementation of the measures in the Memoranda of Understanding agreed with the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank, led to the immediate suspension (February 2012) of allocations for power injection into the Public Electricity Supply System. In relation to security of supply s, with the goal of ensuring a suitable degree of coverage for demand in electricity and suitable management of availability at electrical power production plants under the normal regime, Ministerial Order Nº 251/2012 was published which sets out the system for attributing incentives to guarantee power made available by electrical power production plants to the National Electricity System (SEN). Legislation establishing the system to abolish regulated tariffs for the sale of electricity to end users of Normal Low Voltage (BTN) and of natural gas to end users with annual consumption of less than or equal to 10 000 m3 and the respective schedules for the gradual abolishing of regulated tariffs, was also published in 2012. In August 2012, the reviews of the Procedures Manual for the General Technical Management of the SNGN and the IGU Supply Logistics Management Manual (Directive Nº 16/2012) were also approved. 34 MANAGEMENT REPORT Liberalized Market in Portugal p Electricity From the beginning of 2012, acceleration in migration toward the market regime was observed, especially in the second half. As a result, consumption in the reference generation of customers supplied by the liberalized market stood at 26 TWh, a figure which is around 13% higher than that for 2011. In the previous year, the relative weighting of the free market was around 53% of overall consumption. The government, through Council of Minister Resolution Nº 34/2011 and Decree-Law Nº 75/2012, set out a schedule to abolish regulated tariffs for the sale of electricity, as stated in the Memorandum of Understanding signed by Portugal, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Currently, there are sixteen active trading agents. However, only eight of them have client portfolios. Natural Gas Following the process to abolish regulated sale tariffs to end users, started on 1st July 2010 for customers with annual consumption above 10 000 m3 , the government, through Decree-Law Nº 74/2012 set out a schedule to abolish regulated tariffs for the sale of natural gas, as stated in the abovementioned Memorandum of Understanding. Based on this schedule: As of 1st July 2012, regulated tariffs ceased to exist for end users with annual consumption of less than or equal to 10 000 m3 and greater than 500 m3 (corresponding roughly to the largest households and small companies). On 1st January 2013, regulated tariffs for the supply of end users were fully abolished. 3.2 3.2.1 ELECTRICITY OPERATION OF THE RNT Quality of Service p 2012 was indeed an historic milestone in the Quality of Service provided by REN, as for the first time in the company’s history, there was no record of service interruptions greater than 3 minutes. This consolidated the trend observed in previous years towards a gradual and sustained improvement in the performance of the National Transmission Grid (RNT). For this reason, the Equivalent Interruption Time (EIT),an indicator of overall performance commonly used by electrical utilities, as well as the remaining general indicators for continuity of service (ENF, SAIFI, SAIDI and SARI) established in the Quality of Service Regulations, recorded the best ever figures. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 35 EVOLUTION OF EQUIVALENT INTERRUPTION TIME – EIT Minutos 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.2 1.0 1.18 0.8 0.67 0.6 1.29 0.4 0.07 0.2 0.42 0.48 0.27 0 0.0 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 (1) INTERRUPTIONS CAUSED BY (2) INTERRUPTIONS ALL EXCEPT (1) AND (2) FORTUITOUS CAUSES, FORCE CAUSED BY INCIDENTS OF MAJEURE OR SECURITY REASONS AN EXCEPTIONAL NATURE With regard to voltage waveform quality, in general terms, the average value of disturbances was relatively low and the regulatory limits (indicative) were complied with. The overall level of electrical energy quality depends on the number of incidents recorded or with impact on the transmission grid. In 2012, the number of incidents and disturbances also reached a new historic low. There were 184 incidents (33% less than in 2011), 154 of which originated in the Very HighVoltage Network (VHV); 14 in the High Voltage Network (HV) and 16 in other grids but with an impact on the networks. Only 4 incidents (2.2% of the total) actually caused interruptions to the supply of electricity to clients, having caused 5 short-duration interruptions (between 1 second and 3 minutes) of consumption at delivery points. EVOLUTION IN THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS N.º of incidents 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 VHV NETWORK HV NETWORK NETWORKS EXTERNAL TO REN Another way of highlighting the performance of the transmission grid is through an indicator referred to as “Vulnerability”, which expresses the capability of the transmission grid to not discontinue the supply of electrical power to consumers following an incident, regardless of its origin (including incidents caused by force majeure). This indicator is a ratio of the number of supply interruptions to the number of incidents. 36 MANAGEMENT REPORT In 2012, this ratio was 0.0272, corresponding to all short interruptions. This was the best figure ever for this indicator. EVOLUTION IN THE VULNERABILITY OF THE TRANSMISSION NETWORK Rate % 10.0 8.0 6.0 4.0 2.0 0.0 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 LONG INTERRUPTIONS SHORT INTERRUPTIONS Network Behavior p During 2012, the major congestions that occurred in the RNT were associated with supply security in the Metropolitan Oporto area. They resulted from the combination of a very dry hydrological year and decisions of a commercial nature by producers. Congestion occurred at the end of February – beginning of March and was overcome by mobilizing generation through technical constraints. Moreover, major congestions occurred associated with outages of grid elements, which were then solved through the creation of generation constraints or through the introduction of topological changes into the network by the System Operator. In 2012, the domestic consumption of electricity maintained the trend towards decline already observed in 2011. This caused an excess of energy in the RNT and consequent difficulty in controlling voltage. The above mentioned difficulty was overcome by the use of measures programmed by the System Operator. Finally, also of note in 2012 was the fact that new maximums for wind energy production were once again recorded, both with regard to energy and peak production. Once again the national electricity system managed to store all this production without having to introduce reductions. Availability p The Combined Availability Rate, a regulatory indicator introduced by ERSE in 2009, reached a new historic record in 2012, with a value of 98.49%. This variable is mainly affected by long-term work, particularly relating to increases in power transmission line capacity and remodelling of equipment at substations. The figure below shows the annual evolution of this indicator since it first started to be calculated in 2008. Its progressive improvement highlights the obvious evolution in terms of coordination and planning of grid outages during the period in question. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 37 In 2012, a reduction was seen in long-term work as compared to previous years, more specifically with regard to work to increase line transmission capacity. COMBINED AVAILABILITY RATE 100% 99% 98% 97% 96% 95% 2008 2009 2010 2011 ERSE REFERENCE VALUE Performance of transmission network assets p In 2012, RNT lines registered a very good overall performance. The number of faults per 100 kilometres of circuit reached a new historic low (1.75). The graph below illustrates the performance of lines in the last 5 years, with regard to the number of faults per 100 km of circuit. EVOLUTION IN THE NUMBER OF FAULTS IN RNT LINES PER 100 km OF CIRCUIT 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 This favorable evolution is due in part to a lower incidence of atmospheric discharges impacting on the RNT, but also as a result of preventive measures implemented in recent years by the company, which have tended to reduce the aggressiveness of the environmental phenomena to which it is subject. The overall availability rate for line circuits, including terminal panels, was 98.58%, a higher figure than the one recorded in the previous year (+0.58). 38 MANAGEMENT REPORT In general, all substations recorded favorable behaviour in their service performance. The overall availability rate of transformers and autotransformers (including the respective panels) stood at 98.232%, a similar figure to that seen in 2011 (+0.01%). This indicator is affected mainly by remodelling and replacement work on HV equipment and transformers. More in-depth technical detail is available in the Quality of Service Report published annually by REN. 3.2.2 INVESTMENT IN THE RNT Projects concluded in 2012 p In 2012, the projects concluded in the National Electricity Transmission Network (RNT) contributed toward enhanced safety and reliability of system operation, to improved reception capacity, particularly from renewable sources, and to better power feeding conditions to distribution networks. In the Trás-os-Montes region, the new 220/60 kV Valpaços, substation came into operation which also improves supply to neighboring areas, especially Chaves. In the Metropolitan Oporto area, to reinforce power demand supply, two new 220 kV connections in underground circuit came into operation, between the Vermoim and Prelada substations, and another between the Valongo transition post and the Ermesinde substation. In the Lisbon region, in order to support demand supply, the second 220 kV Alto de Mira – Zambujal underground circuit came into operation, which was already built but operating in the 60 kV network. A new 220 kV underground circuit also came into operation, between the areas of Prior Velho and Alto de São João, provisionally connected at 60 kV between two facilities belonging to EDP Distribuição. In the northern coastal area and south of the Tagus, the new 400 kV connection between Marateca and Fanhões was concluded, introducing greater reliability in the 400 kV north-south axis, and also providing improved supply to the Lisbon/Setúbal Peninsula region. Five new transformers started operation, with a total power of 850 MVA. Main investments underway p The current situation of economic contraction the country finds itself in, with consequent lower consumption of electric power, the stand down of construction of new PNBEPH plants and production under the special status and the suspension of the Portuguese stretch of the Lisbon-Madrid high-speed rail connection, all led to the postponement of a number of investment projects planned in previous years. Reinforcement of the interconnection capacitybetween Portugal and Spain In order to reinforce the exchange capacities between Portugal and Spain, a new 400 kV interconnection is planned in the Minho region, connecting the future Viana do Castelo installation on the Portuguese side with those of “O Covelo”and “Boborás” on the Spanish side.

Within this figure, highlight goes to the increase over the previous year of 132 MW of wind power from farms connected to the RNT. This has been essentially due to the connection of new wind farms and the expansion and remodelling of farms already in operation. Malhanito Wind farm (60 kV connection at the REN Tavira Substation) 3.3 3.3.1 NATURAL GAS OPERATION OF RNTIAT Quality of Service p The performance of REN natural gas infrastructures in terms of continuity of service was once again excellent in 2012. No supply interruptions occurred and all the natural gas indicators were within the limits set out in the Quality of Service Regulations (QSR). However, one incident in the high-pressure transmission network took place in 2012 which should be noted. A non-intentional natural gas leak to the atmosphere, followed by ignition occurred. This event was on 23rd September but did not result in any interruption to the supply of natural gas or any damages other than to the pipeline. The indicator for the frequency of incident occurrence per year per 1 000 km of high-pressure transmission infrastructure currently stands at 0.056, based on the total exposure time of the infrastructure. Considering only the last 5 years it is 0.157. The value of the same indicator published by the European Gas Pipeline Incident Data Group (EGIG) for all TSOs participating in the scheme is 0.162 for the last 5 years. In relation to the indicators defined in art. 13 for quality of service in the Natural Gas Sector, REN Armazenagem and REN Atlântico registered the following annual figures: General quality of service indicators for Ren Armazenagem Compliance with nominations for natural gas withdrawal 100.0% Compliance with nominations for natural gas injection 99.7% Compliance with energy storage 100.0% Notes: – Compliance with nominations for natural gas withdrawal: the ratio between the number of nominations complied with and the total number of nominations; –C  ompliance with nominations for natural gas injection: the ratio between the number of nominations complied with and the total number of nominations; –C  ompliance with energy storage: determined based on the mean square error between nominated and real energy values resulting from the total requests by the users of both injection and withdrawal of gas. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 41 General quality of service indicators for Ren Atlântico Total unavailability was 35 minutes, corresponding to facility availability of 99.99%. Compliance with commercial service (nominations) 100.0% Injection of natural gas into the network (injected/requested) 99.68% Availability of facility 99.99% System Operation p In 2012, the intake of natural gas into the infrastructure operated by the RNTGN concession holder was predominantly through Campo Maior (54%), which connects with the Maghreb gas pipeline and supplies Portugal with gas mainly from Algeria. The intake from the regasification of liquefied natural gas at the REN Atlântico Sines Terminal stood at 45%. As in 2011, intake through Valença accounted for only 1% of total entries into the national system. In 2012, the 50 269 GWh (around 4.22 bcm) of natural gas transported by the RNTGN included domestic high-pressure consumption and the injection of natural gas into underground storage. The latter amounted to 857 GWh (around 0.07 bcm). There was no offtake of natural gas to Spain through the Valença do Minho interconnection. The demand for natural gas in Portugal, detailed in the following table, suffered a drop of 12.8% compared to 2011.

Therefore, with regard to the hydrological regime, the hydroelectric producibility index for 2012 stood at 0.94. In relation to PRE, wind power continues to have significant weighting, recording a growth in installed power of 1.4% over figures for the end of 2011. The combination of these factors contributed toward the considerable reduction (44.0%) in the consumption of natural gas in this sector, as can be observed in the following figure: EVOLUTION IN DEMAND FOR NG PRO 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 Due to the reduction in the demand for electricity registered in 2012, the increase in electrical power imports and the competitiveness of coal when compared to natural gas, which resulted in the low consumption of gas, especially in the ANNUAL REPORT 2012 43 months from April to May, demand in this segment recorded the following evolution during 2012: DEMAND FOR NG FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION UNDER THE ORDINARY REGIME IN 2012 3 2 1 0 JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OUC NOV DEC Operation of the Sines LNG Terminal p With regard to operations, the LNG Terminal received a total of 33 ships in 2012 (27 unloading operations, 5 cooling operations and 1 loading operation), corresponding to total unloaded energy of 23.9 TWh and regasification of 22.4 TWh to the network. In the same period, 2 568 tanker trucks were loaded (2 550 for the domestic market and 18 for export), corresponding to total energy of 777 GWh (771 GWh for the domestic market and 6 GWh for export). The company conducted seven audits, all with positive results, 3 of which were under the SEVESO directive, two relating to the verification of the integrated quality, environment, health and safety management system, one internal audit relating to the ISPS Code and one within the scope of the APS concession. A safety drill was conducted with the participation of external entities, which tested the response capacity of REN Atlântico and other bodies involved in the protection of the facility (ISPS) and Safety (PEI-SEVESO). LNG Terminal Storage 44 MANAGEMENT REPORT Operation of REN Armazenagem p In 2012, a total of 631 GWh of natural gas was withdrawn and 708 GWh was injected into REN Armazenagem caverns, with a global self consumption of around 7 GWh. With regard to the operation of the gas station, total processed natural gas was 1 653 GWh, broken down into 796 GWh of withdrawals and 857 of injection, with 9 GWh of self-consumption. At the end of the year, compared with 2011, the following balance of stocks was observed: NATURAL GAS STOCKS AT REN ARMAZENAGEM (GWh)* AT 31 AT 31 DECEMBER DECEMBER VARIATION (ENERGY) ‘11 ‘12 ‘11/‘12 1 439 1 509 5% * The Figures Indicated do not include Cushion Gas AVERAGE DAILY LEVEL OF NATURAL GAS STOCKS AT REN ARMAZENAGEM (GWh)* VARIATION (ENERGY) ‘11 ‘12 ‘11/‘12 1 377 1 429 3.8% * The figures indicated do not include cushion gas The quantities stored at the end of 2012 represent an increase of 5% compared to figures for the previous year,while the use of infrastructure, measured by the average daily physical stock over the year, registered a positive change from 2011 to 2012 of 3.8%. At 31st December 2012, the nominal capacity figures for REN Armazenagem’s three caverns in operation were as follows: INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITIES (GWh) ‘11 ‘12 Maximum capacity 1 659 1 659 Effective maximum capacity after technical restrictions 1 483 1 483 Commercially available capacity 1 403 1 403 Cushion gas 1 591 1 591 Notes: – Cushion gas: permanent volume of gas maintained in cavities in order to ensure the minimum pressure required to safeguard their structural stability; – Maximum capacity: total capacity minus the cushion gas volume; – Maximum effective capacity after technical restrictions: maximum capacity minus the volume restrictions for using the caverns due to technical constraints; – Commercially available capacity: maximum effective capacity after technical restrictions minus the capacity allocated to the SNGN technical system manager for operational reserves. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 45 3.3.2 INVESTMENT IN RNTIAT In 2012, REN continued with the implementation of the development and investment plan in the National Transmission Network, in the Underground Storage Infrastructures and in the LNG Terminals (RNTIAT). This plan, which includes development and expansion projects, internal reinforcement and revamping investment and connection to the RNDGNand customers, represented an investment in 2012 in natural gas infrastructures of EUR 45.1M, with the respective asset value under operation totalling EUR 119.5M. REN Gasodutos p As part of the connection to new clients, REN Gasodutos start-up the delivery point to Carbogal plant, in Sines. With regard to the expansion of the RNTGN, construction work was started on the Mangualde-Celorico-Guarda gas pipeline. This pipeline is expected to start operation at the end of 2013. This project was considered eligible under the EU European Energy Program for Recovery (EEPR). Also carried out in 2012 was the project to automate the Bidoeira station, as part of the revamping projects to increase security of supply. This is a multi-junction station where the four main RNTGN gas pipelines converge. Furthermore, in 2012, REN Gasodutos started the development process to upgrade the SCADA system,both for the Bucelas Dispatch Centre and the Emergency Dispatch Centre. The aim is to guaranty the quality of service statutory levels while optimizing the RNTGN command and supervision processes, updating and modernizing the respective technology. REN Armazenagem p In 2012, REN Armazenagem developed a set of investments with a view to ensuring security of supply and the availability of natural gas storage capacity level. This included:  diagnostic study on the status and conditions of the Gas Station, with a A view to the debotlenneck capacity constrainsts and implement automatic remote mode of operation, from the Bucelas Dispatch Centre. C  ontinuation of construction of cavity RENC-6, which underwent leaching operations throughout 2012. An accumulated volume of approximately 210 000 m3 was reached. The estimated final volume will be around 500 000 m3. E  nvironmental impact study and base engineering project for cavity RENC-8, as a result of the Memorandum of Understanding between REN Armazenagem and Transgás Armazenagem for the joint construction of three new cavities. These studies gave rise to the licensing process submitted to the DGEG in June 2012.  onclusion of construction work to install a Fiscal Metering System at each C of the caverns, in order to comply with regulations which require the physical and commercial balance to be ascertained with regard to gas injected into and withdrawn from caverns by the storage operators, REN Armazenagem and Transgás Armazenagem. 46 MANAGEMENT REPORT REN Atlântico p With regard to REN Atlântico, the construction work on the LNG Terminal expansion project was concluded during the first semester of 2012. As a result, the Sines LNG Terminal storage capacity increase to 390 000 m3 and natural gas supply capacity rise to 1 350 000 m3(n)/h. 3.4 3.4.1 OTHER REN TRADING – MANAGEMENT OF POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS (PPA) BUSINESSES Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) not subject to early termination in conformance with Decree-Law Nº 172/2006 of 23rd August, are managed during the period they are in effect by REN Trading, a 100% subsidiary of REN – Redes Energéticas Nacionais, SGPS. In this context, REN Trading manages the PPA with Tejo Energia through the thermal power plant in Pego (576 MW), and the PPA with Turbogás, for the thermal power plant at Tapada do Outeiro (990 MW). The company’s objective is to maximise profits by means of the market sale of energy and system services, as well as to minimise the costs of PPAs, pursuant to Order Nº 11210/2008, of the ERSE. Within the scope of managing the respective PPAs, REN Trading acquires all the energy and systems services from the Pego and Turbogás plants. In this field, in addition to the Natural Gas Consumption Management Agreement (AGC) established with GALP Gás Natural, S.A., it is also necessary to accompany the markets in fuels (coal and natural gas) and their respective indexes. During 2012, the AGC contract with GALP was renegotiated, which resulted in a significant reduction in the Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ) of Natural Gas (NG) to be consumed at the Turbogás power plant. It was agreed that from October 2012 to September 2015, the total annual ACQ value of natural gas would be reduced significantly, so as to adapt the plant’s production to real market needs in light of the current drop in the consumption of electric energy. With regard to operating in the European market for emissions licences (ETS – Emissions Trading Scheme) REN Trading continued to participate, albeit less actively than in previous years, on the Bluenext (discontinued on 5 December 2012) and ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) exchanges. REN Trading is responsible for managing the CO2 emissions licences portfolio attributed to the two abovementioned power plants and for establishing a management strategy for these environmental bonds, which consists of buying and selling emissions licences, as well as conducting swap operations of EUAs (European Unit Allowances) for CERs (Certified Emissions Reductions). In 2012, the accentuated decline in volumes and prices in this market continued, due to diverse factors. REN Trading’s activities were consequently reduced and the results of the corresponding incentives were therefore lower than in previous years. The sale of electric energy in the market is mainly carried out by means of the Iberian Electricity Market (placing daily and intra-day sales and repurchase offers on the OMIE) and the System Services market, operated by the System Manager. The company continued to actively participate in the Portuguese System Services market, with good overall results. In order to improve the results achieved by means of sales, and so as to diversify risk, REN Trading participated in diverse CESUR auctions held during 2012, with a highly positive final outcome. Through its area of Financial Products, REN Trading accompanies the most relevant market trends in the sector, with an emphasis on coal, energy and CO2 emission licences. Term hedges were conducted (in the derivatives market) ANNUAL REPORT 2012 47 and some purely financial operations were negotiated with regard to providing services to REN SGPS. As it is a regulated company, in its Order No 11210/2008 of 8th April, the Energy Services Regulatory Authority (ERSE) established a set of incentives defining methods of sharing the benefits of regulated activities between electricity consumers and the company. The final value of the incentives is derived from operations in the company’s diverse areas of activity, related with optimising the sales of energy from the power plants as well as minimising the costs of acquiring natural gas and CO2 emissions licences. Thus, the company’s operating results in 2012 correspond to the value calculated for the incentives set by ERSE, which are identified below (the I2, an incentive for the efficient contracting of natural gas consumed at the Tapada do Outeiro power plant, was eliminated in 2012): I1 – Incentive related to the efficient supply of energy from the Turbogás Power Plant in the daily market (limited to EUR 1.5 M, fully achieved in 2012). I3 – Incentive related to optimising the production of the Tejo Energia Power Plant (limited to EUR 1.5 M, fully achieved in 2012). ICO2 – Incentive for the efficient management of CO2 emission licenses (limited to EUR 2.72 M, while the figure achieved in 2012 was EUR 0.035 M). Swaps – Incentive for optimizing exchanges (swaps) of EUA for CER in the CO2 emission licenses trading market (this incentive has no ceiling, the figure achieved in 2012 was EUR 0.105 M). Thus, the total incentives obtained in 2012 amounted to EUR 3.14 M, a figure higher than that of the previous year (due to increased sales of energy from the Pego plant, resulting from a drop in coal prices in international markets along with a reduction in the price of emissions licences, which made the power plant quite competitive in the Iberian electricity market). 3.4.2 REN TELECOM The REN Group is present in the Information and Communication Technologies market through RENTELECOM, a company 100% owned by the Group and certified by APCER in accordance with the NP EN ISO 9001, NP EN ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 standards. REN TELECOM was incorporated in 2002 with the primary goal of deriving profits from the surplus capacity of the REN – Rede Eléctrica Nacional secure telecommunications network and it subsequently expanded the scope of its activity to the REN Gasodutos infrastructure when this company was integrated into the REN Group in 2007. REN TELECOM engages in a diverse range of activities, including infrastructure, managed services, projects and consultancy. In 2012, REN TELECOM consolidated and reinforced its presence in the external market, ensuring a more proactive and systematic approach to national and international markets both in terms of companies (65%) and operators (35%). This strategy contributed towards an increase in turnover of more than 10% as compared to 2011, with an emphasis on the services of space rental (15%), housing services (25%) and rentals of lines (15%). Similarly, there was an increase in turnover in the area of maintaining wind farms as compared to 2011 (8%), notwithstanding the accentuated reduction in activities in this economic sector. In 2012, REN TELECOM also accompanied the Group’s efforts towards diversification and internationalization of business, having signed an important infrastructure contract with a large international operator. Thus, RENTELECOM has proved that it has an interesting value proposition, not just at a national 48 MANAGEMENT REPORT level but also at the level of the most demanding global players, having emerged as an outstanding service provider in the area of Information and Communications Technologies. 3.4.3 ENONDAS Brief business description p ENONDAS is a company dedicated to public service which aims to support the development of energy production from ocean waves, managing a maritime area of around 320 km2 and providing it with the necessary infrastructure for the development of marine energy. ENONDAS Activities p In the second year of its existence, ENONDAS continued the projects it had begun while carrying out its development plan. In this regard, the project to prepare a geophysical profile of the Pilot Area (PA) was concluded – an exhaustive task to prepare for the other projects envisaged in the development plan, more specifically in terms of infrastructure (undersea electric cables), of fundamental importance for future promoters/customers. Based on the results of this project, the good conditions of the Pilot Area for developing renewable marine energy have been confirmed. The PA has a good quality marine bed for mooring systems and good energy potential in terms of waves. The results of this project, concluded in November 2012, as a report and geographic information system, are currently being circulated among potential customers by ENONDAS. 2012 was also the year in which the ENONDAS budget was approved by the Regulator and the overseeing authority authorised part of it for execution. After these approvals, ENONDAS began two more projects, the regulating of access and the environmental profile, which will be concluded in 2013. An important part of its activities in 2012 was dedicated to commercial marketing, so as to attract customers/promoters to the Pilot Area. The most important channels were national agencies and associations, with an emphasis on AICEP, ENERGYIN and the Sea Economy Entrepreneurial Forum. ENONDAS has contributed towards promoting a marine economy in the energy sector at various national and international events and in press articles. It has provided clarifications on its role in terms of attracting investments and developing this economic sub-sector. As part of its commercial activities and with regard to potential customers with which it is negotiating, coupled with the aspects described in the previous paragraph and its commercial strategy, ENONDAS promotes ties with companies in the marine sector in addition to the services it provides to its customers. Such entities include shipyards, industrial companies, maritime services companies, consultants and service firms. Main investments p In 2012, the geophysical profile project continued to be the main investment and was concluded this year. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 49 Future prospects p In 2013, ENONDAS will continue and finalise the projects begun in 2012, namely regulating access to the Pilot Area and the environmental profile. It will likewise continue the infrastructure project (electricity connection and undersea cable) and it is expected that the engineering phase will be at an advanced stage/ concluded by the end of 2013, with a view to commencing construction in 2014. ENONDAS will continue its marketing efforts, promoting the Pilot Area and Portuguese companies and institutes for the know-how necessary for the logistics chain of its customers. 3.4.4 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT After changes in its shareholding structure in 2012, REN strengthened the conditions that contribute towards promoting its image internationally and now has a broad range of competitive advantages that enable effective internationalization based on its core competences. Thus, in 2012 REN reviewed its strategic plan for the period 2013-2016, identifying priority areas for expansion and consolidating its international presence in 3 geographical regions, namely: South America (Brazil and other nations in Latin America), South Africa and opportunities identified in Europe, the Middle East and Asia (on a case-by-case basis in the latter region). It is important to note the creation, in September 2012, of a specific business development area, aimed at following the guidelines of the international component of the strategic plan. REN will ensure a balanced use of its resources to guarantee a correct balance between M&A opportunities – which generate immediate cash flows – and greenfields opportunities – implemented over a longer term. Owing to inherent risks and due to competitive circumstances, internationalisation will be carried out in phases and considered on a case-by-case basis, following a financially prudent attitude, ensuring suitable returns on investments. REN has carried out various business missions in these areas and has negotiated the acquisition of stakes and consultancy projects with companies and governments controlling energy infrastructure. In particular: South America: Identifying and monitoring opportunities of strategic interest in the shortterm, including consulting opportunities as well as acquisitions or greenfields opportunities. South Africa: A  cquisition for EUR 38 million of a 7.5% stake in the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric Plant (HCB) in Mozambique;  valuation as part of a consortium for the Energy Transmission Company E (STE) project in Mozambique, which aims to create the backbone of the High Voltage National Electric Energy Transmission Network, spanning approximately 2 000 km, with links to South Africa, and future projects for hydroelectric and thermoelectric production by the Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) company; Identifying opportunities, mainly for the medium/long term. Europe: Identification of potential opportunities to use REN’s technical know-how in the field of European energy. 50 MANAGEMENT REPORT Middle East and Asia:  greements for conducting consultancy projects to support planned energy A networks and overcoming the challenges of integrating renewable energies. REN seeks to ensure the group’s sustainability based on its efficient and recognised national experience as an operator of systems transmitting electricity and natural gas, with a view to: Identifying partnerships with operators of reference energy networks at an international level, which can result in agreements for operations cooperation, technical exchanges and business evaluations of common interest; E  stablishing and formalising relations with multilateral international agencies supporting the development and funding of infrastructure. 3.5 3.5.1 FINANCIAL RESULTS IN 2012 PERFORMANCE Main indicators p In the 2012 fiscal year, EBITDA increased 8.9% (+EUR 42.0M) as compared to 2011, which was essentially due to: i) a change in the remuneration formula for electricity assets, excluding land (a rate that in 2011 was calculated on the basis of the average of the daily profitability of the 10 year Treasury Bonds and in 2012 was now indexed to the average daily quotes for the 5 year CDS issued by the Portuguese Republic) and ii) an increase in the average remunerated assets base (RAB). Net financial income was -EUR 136.0M, reflecting a drop of -EUR 32.7M€ (+31.6%) as compared to 2011. However, the positive operational performance surpassed the increased financing costs, enabling the net financial income to rise to EUR 123.9M (+EUR 3.3M€; +2.7%). Capex reduced from the investment peaks witnessed in previous years (-EUR 148.4M; -42.5%) and transfers to RAB reflected the same trend (-EUR 105.9 M, -24.8%). Nonetheless, the average value of the RAB grew 6.1% as compared to 2011. Net debt increased by EUR 201.1M (+8.7%), reaching EUR 2 512M, and its average cost rose to 5.70%, i.e. 0.98% higher than in 2011.

ANNUAL REPORT 2012 51 Operational Results – EBITDA p EBITDA increased by EUR 42.0 M (+8.9%) as compared to 2011, achieving EUR 514.6 M. The following factors contributed towards this evolution: 6  .1% increase in the average RAB, as well as in the corresponding average rate of return (as a result of a review of the remuneration mechanism for electricity assets (excluding land) and a change in the asset mix, with a greater emphasis on premium assets), which enabled a rise of EUR 57.6M (+25.1%) in the return on RAB; Increase in income from the recovery of deprecitions of EUR 15.7M (+9.7%), in line with the increase in RAB; Telecommunications sales and services of EUR 5.5M, an additional EUR 0.6M as compared to 2011. However, these results were affected by a set of unfavorable factors, including: A  reduction in the remuneration of hydric lands by EUR 2.8M due to a reduction in the interbank swap rates 8;  reduction in the smoothing differences and the neutrality effect for A gas, which went from 1.8M€ in 2011 to -EUR 7.5M in 2012 according to the smoothing methodology defined; A  decline in the contribution of the interest on tariff deviation, which went from EUR 2.5M in 2011, referring to tariff deviation to be received from tariffs, to -EUR 6.5M in 2012, referring to tariff deviation to be given back to tariffs; T  he net effect of the exclusion of the OMIP from the REN consolidation perimeter of -EUR 1.3M;  reduction in Own Works of EUR 5.3M (-16.2%), accompanying the Capex A reduction and, consequently, from the fixed assets underway;  n increase in OPEX by EUR 5.0M, of which the following are worthy A of note: i) the increase in the pass-through costs: forest clearing (+EUR 2.6M) and system services and cross-border tariffs (+EUR 2.3M) and ii) the increase in personnel costs (+EUR 4.1M), which was fundamentally due to reverting to the situation prior to the contingencies imposed by the 2011 State budget law. 8 R  emuneration calculated on the basis of the interbank swap rate for the term closest to the legal depreciation horizon for the lands in question, plus 0.5%. 52 MANAGEMENT REPORT EBITDA ‘11 ‘12 Change % (Million of Euro) 1) Revenues of assets 430.2 493.1 14.6% Return on RAB 229.0 286.6 25.1% Hydro land remuneration 12.5 9.7 -22.7% Lease revenues from hydro protection zone 0.8 0.8 -7.6% Remuneration of fully depreciated assets 7.0 7.9 13.1% Smoothing differences and neutrality effect (gas) 1.8 -7.5 Recovery of depreciation (net from subsidies) 161.6 177.3 9.7% Subsidies depreciation 17.5 18.4 5.2% 2) Revenues from Opex 109.4 110.4 0.9% 3) Other revenues 28.4 7.3 -74.3% Allowed incentives (Trading) 2.5 3.1 24.3% Interest on tariff deviation 2.5 -6.5 Availability incentive 0.6 1.0 76.8% Hedging 0.4 0.4 -5.4% Telecommunications sales and services rendered 4.9 5.5 11.4% Service provision from the market operator 1.9 0.0 Gains in related companies 10.3 0.0 Other services provided 1.3 1.3 0.3% Other revenues 4.0 2.6 -36.5% 4) Own works (capitalised in Investment) 33.0 27.6 -16.2% 5) Construction revenues (ex.

GROUP’S MAIN INVESTMENTS – GAS ANNUAL REPORT 2012 57 3.5.3 FUNDING AND DEBT Notwithstanding the difficult economic scenario in 2012, REN successfully continued to consolidate the structure of its debt with a view to diversifying sources of funding, expanding its base of financing and reinforcing the amount and maturity of its credit lines. The funding operations carried out in 2012 improved the company’s liquidity position and reinforced its capacity to face future funding challenges. Within the scope of privatising the company, the new REN shareholder, State Grid International Development, committed to give REN, through the China Development Bank, a long term line of funds for an amount of EUR 1 000 million. After this commitment, the financial terms for funding of EUR 800 million were approved in 2012, the terms for the remaining EUR 200 million to be defined at a future date. Among the various funding operations carried out in 2012, highlight goes to the bond issued in the retail market is worthy of note. The following funding operations were carried out in 2012: In March, two bonds were issued, for private subscription, for a total amount of EUR 83.5 million, without guarantees, for a maturity of 3 years. In September, a bond was issued, for private subscription, for EUR 50 million, without guarantees, for a maturity of 3 years. In September, a public bond was issued, aimed at the retail market, for an amount of EUR 300 million, without guarantees, with a maturity of 4 years. In October the loan terms for an EUR 800 million loan from the China Development Bank were approved, divided into two equal tranches of EUR 400 million. The first tranche has a maturity of 8 years and is earmarked for refinancing financial debt and the second tranche, with a maturity of 12 years, is earmarked for funding investments in the electricity and gas infrastructure. In December, a bond was issued, for private subscription, for an amount of EUR 100 million, without guarantees, with a maturity of 3 years. At the end of 2012, the REN Group’s net consolidated debt was EUR 2 512.4 million, EUR 201.1 million more than in the previous year. This increase was largely due to investments and payment of tariff deviations.

This increase was due to two reasons: (i) a rise in the average debt cost in 2012, especially due to the general increase in credit spreads as a result of Portugal’s worsening economic situation and (ii) an increase in average debt during the year. The average cost of debt in 2012 was 5.70%, 98 base points more than in 2011. The policy for managing interest rates risks continued to be aimed at reducing the volatility of financial responsibilities. Making the most of a market scenario with historically low interest rates, fixed rates were covered by contracting swaps. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 59 3.6 2013 will mark the start of a new three-year regulatory period for the natural gas business. As was mentioned during the public presentation of the REN strategic PERSPECTIVES plan on Investor Day, the company is working to ensure stable and realistic regulation which promotes suitable incentives for efficiency. 2013 Despite the severe recession the country is currently experiencing, REN will continue to invest significant sums every year which will allow us to continue to provide the country with infrastructures which guarantee supply security and quality of service. The company will remain focused on its ongoing efforts to increase operating efficiency, which can be observed in the changes to the internal organization currently underway, naturally without prejudicing the standards of excellence which consumers expect and deserve. We will continue to diversify our sources of financing, seeking solutions which best fit the profile of maturity and risk which a company of such characteristics requires. With the support of shareholders, efforts for internationalization and the development of new business started in 2012, will have greater visibility in 2013 and will start to contribute, although in a more modest manner, toward company profits. This new phase which REN is going through represents a new challenge in the life of all involved and for this reason, investment in the training of people will continue to be a priority.

Based on the company’s main strategic vectors and consolidating the work carried out in the previous cycle, a new plan will be prepared in 2013 focusing on the aspects deemed to be a priority for REN’s activities in the near future to promote sustainable development. 4.1.2 STAKEHOLDERS REN periodically identifies and assesses its relevant stakeholders, in accordance with the principles of standard AA1000APS – Assurance Principle Standards – 2008. In 2011, the stakeholders’ mapping was reviewed and stakeholders were consulted to reassess issues that are materially relevant for REN. This process, which takes place cyclically every three years on average, aims to improve the integration of different aspects of sustainability in the company’s business processes. The identification and prioritisation of the main stakeholders in REN have considered the binomial effect of each group of stakeholders in REN’s decision making process versus REN’s impact on the activity and performance of the respective group. For detailed information about the most recent review process please consult: Survey of Mapping of Expectations Stakeholders Stakeholders and Response It is also important to note that REN regularly evaluates the quality perception and level of satisfaction of its clients, understood to be the users of its infrastructure or customers of the services it provides in the electricity and natural gas sectors. To this end, it conducts studies in compliance with the ANNUAL REPORT 2012 65 European Customer Satisfaction Index (ECSI) methodologies. The results of the latest study are available on REN’s website at www.ren.pt 2 4.2 4.2.1 SOCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PERFORMANCE OF HUMAN RESOURCES The 2012 activities plan sought to develop and consolidate the objectives defined for REN’s Human Resources Strategy and was based on the following pillars: R  einforcing the Corporate Culture by promoting transversal identification, development and integration activities in conformance with REN’s Mission, Values and Culture; S  ustainability by promoting an integrated model for managing human resources which aims to ensure consistency in terms of REN’s activities with regard to its personnel, promoting equity and articulation between all the policies which have been defined;  orporate development and alignment with a view to upgrading C the structure and ensuring the necessary competences for business development, internationalisation and competitiveness in the sector; P  roductivity, by consolidating management instruments and tools to promote levels of efficiency while carrying out diverse activities;  evelopment, by defining and implementing a training policy aimed at D responding to matters pertaining to corporate development and the individual development of employees. 4.2.1.1 HUMAN RESOURCES PROFILE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES p At the end of 2012, the number of REN employees remained almost unchanged as compared to 2011, as was also the case with regard to age groups and average time employed with the company.

This program aims to ensure ongoing learning and development for REN’s employees, in accordance with the transversal and specific needs of different areas and functions, in keeping with the company’s values and strategy. As an ongoing development process, REN has promoted various initiatives associated with the FORMAR Program, where it is possible to highlight the preparation of 2 annual training programs: one based on the specific needs of employees and the other aimed at the company’s strategic and transversal needs. Moreover, there are also programs offering training subsidies for seminars and conferences, which likewise contribute towards developing, upgrading and sharing know-how and competences. As a result of this investment, REN has increased the average number of hours of training per employee. In 2012, it is possible to highlight one of the transversal actions conducted — the training course entitled “Pillars for Creating Value”, in which all the company’s employees participated.

In 2012, REN clearly focused on training its medium level staff and on technical training.VIVA PROGRAM. VIVA PROGRAM p The VIVA Program, which serves to welcome and integrate employees at REN, was continued in 2012. This program is structured so as to support and facilitate the rapid and adequate integration of new employees, while also being open to existing employees. Begun in 2010, the VIVA Program has been received enthusiastically and with great satisfaction over the course of these 5 sessions. The overall appraisal has been truly positive and encouraging, since the participation and interest of new and existing employees reflect and demonstrate the importance of this initiative, likewise reinforced by the high level of overall satisfaction of the participants and the total dedication of the speakers. “For new employees, the VIVA Program is a moment to welcome them and help them integrate, while for both new and existing employees it is an opportunity to get better acquainted with the Group – what we do and how we do it – clarifying each procedure and each process. Moreover, this initiative is also a moment of social interaction, enabling employees from completely different areas to get to know each other, which would otherwise not be possible”. Vanessa Pereira (Head of Training & Development) VIVA Program 2012: Satisfaction rate: 88.8% REN TRAINEE Program p In 2012, REN continued the REN Trainee Program, which consists of professional job rotation, academic and summer internships, where interns have the opportunity to work on specific projects, creating value for different areas while enhancing their own skills. The program challenged participants to direct a film on REN’s value proposal “What’s it like to work at REN?”, which involved the participation and involvement 72 REN´S SUSTAINABILITY of many REN employees and is currently an important REN media project, circulated at universities as well as internally. “This was one of the most enriching experiences I have ever had at every level, since it enabled me to identify the area in which I felt most comfortable and allowed me to meet innumerable people in different contexts and in various offices and functions” Participant – Tiago Oliveira (REN Trainee 2011/2012) “This program allowed me to get to know and interact with colleagues from the most diverse departments in the Company and to hear their experiences. All this networking was very important.” Participant – Carina Sousa (REN Trainee 2011/2012) “What I liked most, apart from the work I was involved in, were the activities in which the interns participated, such as directing the film and the Campus Trainee workshops” Participant – João Limpo (REN Trainee 2011/2012) Relevant data for the Trainee 2012 Program: Indicators ’12 Professional internships as job rotation 9 Professional internships 3 Academic internships 11 Summer internships 16 Total 39 4.2.1.3 RECOGNISING PERFORMANCE STAR PROGRAM – PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT p This program was reinforced so as to promote a meritocracy, with a view to aligning the REN objectives, the different departments and each employee. It is important to note that this program was strengthened in 2012 so as to constitute a management tool, likewise serving to manage personnel and the compensation policy. Relevant data for the STAR 2012 Program: Indicators Av. ’11 Nº of employees covered 711 % of assessments concluded 100% Average – Final Assessments 3.64 % of awards calculated as compared 97% to the number of assessment In 2012, 100% of REN´s employees received information on their performance. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 73 MANAGING KNOWLEDGE p Lending continuity to initiatives developed in 2011, with a view to implementing an Integrated Talent Management Program, the first results of this project were presented in 2012, which made it possible to map existing talents and focus on retaining and developing human resources, aligning the company’s strategy with organisational needs and employee expectations. Around 290 employees were involved in this project, aged below 50, from the Management, Coordination, TechnicalOperational and Technical Staff Groups. 4.2.1.4 BENEFITS AND SOCIAL DIALOGUE In order to create a system of collective labor relations applicable to employees of the Group’s companies while simultaneously seeking to increase internal equality, provide greater efficiency in human resource management and adjusting practices pertaining to the organisation of labor, remuneration, social benefits and occupational health and safety to the Group’s current situation, on 23rd November 2012 REN denounced the Collective Labor Agreement (ACT) applicable exclusively to the National Electricity Network, in effect since 2000, simultaneously presenting a new ACT proposal transversal to the Group’s companies and business units. With this management decision, REN aims to ensure that the new model for collective labor relations, better suited to current realities, is transversal while ensuring a solid and sustainable relationship among all the Group’s companies and their employees. The proposal for the New Collective Labor Agreement is currently being negotiated with trade unions, while the following benefits were applicable in 2012: BENEFITS Collective Labor Individual Work Agreement (ACT) Contract (CIT) Occupational Accidents x x Insurance Personal Accident Insurance x Health Plan x x Life Insurance Pension Fund x Electricity at lower prices x In 2012, 57% of REN employees were encompassed by a collective labour agreement (ACT) and 47.5% were part of a union. 74 REN´S SUSTAINABILITY 4.2.1.5 HEALTH AND SAFETY Aware that a safe and healthy environment is a decisive factor for the satisfactionof the stakeholders, REN is committed to the effective management of occupational health and safety. The occupational health and safety management system is certified by an accredited entity and encompasses most of the group’s companies. Its main objective is to prevent the occurrence of work related accidents and illnesses involving Company employees as well as the employees of contractors and service providers collaborating with REN. Safety p REN’s safety policy encompasses all the activities which can increase REN’s resilience to the consequences of accidents or incidents which could affect the continued operations and functioning of energy transmission systems. These activities are complemented by promoting compliance with legal requirements and best practices underlying a good performance, proactive measures and continued improvements in this regard. In 2012, the number of accidents involving Company employees rose from 5 to 7 as compared to 2011, which also translated into an increase in the number of days lost.

In terms of accident rates among contractors and service providers, there were fewer non-fatal occupational accidents and days lost, due to a reduction in the number of employees. In 2012, approximately 35% of REN contractors and service providers had certified safety management systems, developed in compliance with the OHSAS 18001/NP 4397 standards. Over the course of 2012, REN conducted training actions and safety awareness initiatives involving 119 contractors and service providers. During 2012, REN participated as a guest speaker at the Seminar on Protecting Critical National Infrastructure, organised by KPMG and the Security and Defence Magazine. It was also a guest speaker at seminars on the Protection of Critical Energy Infrastructures and Cybersecurity, organised by the Europäische Akademie für Steuern, Wirtschafen & Recht and by Marcus Evans. In 2012, REN likewise published an article in this regard in the Europe Today magazine of the Europäische Akademie für Steuern, Wirtschafen & Recht, in the 08/2012 issue. 76 REN´S SUSTAINABILITY REN also participated in the 2nd CADSSE – Advanced Course for Directors of Safety in the Corporate Sector, with a talk and a visit by auditors to the Group’s facilities. Within the scope of security procedures and emergency response situations, REN regularly promotes and participates in exercises and drills with a view to testing efficacy and improving its procedures. In 2012, five drills were scheduled and conducted, simulating fire and personal accidents of electric origin: New facilities (2) – Caniçada and Tavira Drill in old facilities (3) – Pereiros, Tunes and Estói In 2013, REN aims to conduct 16 drills: New facilities (4) – Prelada, Valpaços, Zambujal and Picote Renovated facilities (2) – Ermesinde and Fernão Ferro 1st drill in old facilities (10) – Carriche, Sete Rios, Rio Maior, Trajouce, Santarém, Vila Fria, Chafariz, Oleiros, Lavos and Porto Alto Further information in this regard can be consulted on REN’s website 3. Health p All contract employees at REN are covered by a health system. Ensuring good working conditions and occupational health is a constant concern at REN. The Company conducts examinations and complementary clinical analyses in terms of occupational medicine so as to enable preventive actions with regard to employee health. In 2012 there were: 1189 diagnose support tests 653 medical acts 2156 nursing acts The absenteeism rate has been constant over recent years, standing at approximately 3%. ’09 ’10’ ’11 ’12 Absenteeism rate 2.3% 2.2% 3.1% 2.9% 3 See REN>Sustainability>Stakeholders>Human Resources>Safety. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 77 The “Saudável” program was launched in 2012, an innovative initiative designed to promote health and well-being, as well as to improve the quality of life. This program made it possible to ensure a greater commitment by employees with regard to the company, contributing towards enhancing and improving the working environment, human relations and productivity and performance. This program was highly flexible and consisted of diverse types of sessions, including workshops, individual health check-ups and activities which varied according to the work sites. Diverse and transversal themes were developed: Information Themes Campaign Check-ups Consultations Workshops Eating Well, Living Better √ √ √ √ Spring and Allergies √ √ Heart Month: Have you treated √ √ √ your heart well? Holidays and Your Skin: Do you √ √ know how to protect your skin? Back to School: Learning √ √ √ √ difficulties and study techniques Stress: Do you know how √ √ to protect yourself? Your Health in Winter: √ √ Flu and Colds Relevant data for the “Saudável” Program 2012: Nº of health campaigns – 14 Nº. of workshops – 11 Nº of participants – 420 Workshops Overall Satisfaction 14% 22% 0% 2% 62% VERY SATISFIED EXTREMELY SATISFIED NOT VERY SATISFIED SATISFIED NOT SATISFIED 78 REN´S SUSTAINABILITY Individual feedback and participants have indicated a high level of overall satisfaction: “It was a very interesting and useful initiative, with a strong interactive component. Many health problems are directly related to nutrition and this is a different way of teaching people, with a very interesting playful aspect, challenging our habits. It was unexpected. I was hooked the moment I saw the setting. I was naturally interested and motivated. The training actions were spectacular and were undeniably useful and insightful” Rui Marmota | REN Gasodutos “The way the physiotherapist showed me how to improve my posture and the way we take care of our spine was extremely important.” Sofia Pestana Carvalho| REN Serviços Since health is a growing area of concern for REN, along with its articulation with Occupational Medicine, the programme will be consolidated in 2013 with new preventive actions so as to promote healthy habits and lifestyles. 4.2.2 RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY 4.2.2.1 RELATIONSHIP WITH LAND OWNERS In 2012, REN interacted with 2 267 owners whose land was crossed by new sections of electricity transmission networks of projects underway, as apart of REN’s development and investment plans. REN also acquired 24 properties to install other electricity and natural gas infrastructure. With this expansion, the database of REN owners contained around 65,000 records at the end of 2012, which itself evidences the importance of this group of stakeholders with regard to the company, especially considering Portugal’s relatively small geographical size as compared to most European countries. It is necessary to mention that the establishment of compensation agreements to institute easements is not always easy and REN is therefore sometimes obliged, for the common good, to resort to mechanisms to unblock the impasses stipulated in legislation, especially the process of intimation, in the case of electricity lines, and of requesting the support of the public authorities to ensure the progress of work, in the case of gas pipelines. In 2012, REN was forced to use these mechanisms only 6 times for VHV electricity lines projects and twice in projects to expand the high pressure natural gas transportation network. REN always seeks to ensure the compatibility of the installation and operation of its infrastructure with the legitimate interests of other stakeholders. Further information in this regard can be consulted on the REN website at www.ren.pt4 4.2.2.2 COMMUNITY SUPPORT In 2012, REN was awarded the Best Corporate Citizen Prize in Portugal, conferred by the British magazine The New Economy. Aware of its responsibility in the area of corporate citizenship and committed to maintaining and perfecting a socially responsible and ethical management model, in 2012 REN supported a set of initiatives relevant to the community in diverse areas: social, cultural, educational, environmental and sports. 4 See REN>Sustainability>Stakeholders>Community>Land Owners and Rights of Way. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 79 Special mention can be made of REN’s support for the development of competences through the REN Prize, which every year has distinguished the best Master’s theses in engineering courses in Portuguese universities, or the support extended to The Lisbon MBA, of which REN is a founding member. Equally worthy of note is the partnership established with “The Next Big Idea”, a program to encourage entrepreneurs and promote innovative ideas, especially relevant in the context of Portuguese universities. In terms of interaction with stakeholders, the launch of a more dynamic and intuitive new corporate website was an important milestone, with a view to making information about the company and its activities available in a more attractive manner. Also within the scope of its policy of close ties with local communities where the company’s infrastructure is located, REN has sought to act as a socially responsible entity, namely in terms of preserving the environment and historical and cultural patrimony, while likewise supporting the legitimate interests of the communities in surrounding areas. This is achieved by means of support for civil society initiatives, which often depend greatly on such contributions, as well as by support and participation in conservation projects, within the scope of measures to minimise the impact on patrimony and the environment or even actions promoted by the company in the area of environmental awareness and dissemination. An example of this, amongst others, is the reforestation plan, where REN has already contributed by planting more than 400 000 trees in Portugal. In terms of support for social causes and combating inequality and the problems affecting society the most, REN’s spirit of solidarity is reflected in diverse ways. REN has established partnerships with institutions for social solidarity, while also supporting the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and volunteer activities by REN employees in initiatives developed by such institutions. Equally worthy of note in 2012 was the formalisation of REN’s volunteering policy, viewed as a corporate social responsibility project, based on three axes – education, environment and solidarity – which aims to make available the time and skills of REN employees to serve the community. Internally, REN has developed various initiatives with a view to developing its work environment, such as, for example, team reports transversal to all business areas, reports about employees’ lives outside work or actions to motivate employees. Internal communications are another essential vehicle for developing a climate of participation, functioning as a process of dialogue between the company and its employees and the employees among themselves, informing and encouraging. Further information in this regard can be consulted on the REN website at www.ren.pt5 4.2.3 INNOVATION, RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY 4.2.3.1 INITIATIVES REN – SGID Technological Partnership p REN – Redes Energéticas Nacionais and the State Grid International Development (SGID) signed a Memorandum of Understanding in July 2012 which established a technological partnership with a view to creating an R&D Centre in Portugal dedicated to energy systems. 5 See REN>Sustainability>Stakeholders>Community>Social, Scientific and Cultural Support. 80 REN´S SUSTAINABILITY This R&D Centre aims to become an international platform for know-how and a catalyst for innovative tools and solutions, applied to the planning and operation of energy transmission networks. This unit will embody a new culture of creative thought, by developing innovative strategies and methodologies, supported by the advent of new technologies and models. The projects resulting from the R&D Centre will be synchronised with the new energy paradigm, moving towards a more efficient, intelligent, safe and sustainable system. With this in mind, four R&D areas have been defined within the scope of this Centre: Simulating Energy Electric Systems; Managing Sources of Renewable Energy; Technologies for Intelligent Networks; and Energy Economy and Markets. In short, this technological partnership aims to create a “strategic triangle”, by designing a network for Innovation, encompassing reputed universities in the area of energy systems, local industry and international R&D institutions. This “geostrategic innovation” is crucial for the development of robust, inter-operable and global solutions. REN was again among the 100 companies that invested the most in R&D p As usual, based on the results of the National Scientific and Technological Potential Survey 2010 (IPCTN10) the DGEEC published the ranking of the 100 companies that contributed the most towards R&D investments in Portugal. In this publication, published on its website (www.dgeec.mec.pt) in December 2012, the REN Group was once again listed among 100 Portuguese companies that invested the most in R&D activities. To this end, the list considered the sum invested in this area by 3 of the Group’s companies: Rede Eléctrica Nacional, REN Serviços and REN Gasodutos, which in 2010 spent a total of EUR 2.2 M (without deducting subsidies; EUR 1.9 M after deducting subsidies) in R&D activities. Participation in European Projects (FP7) p REN continues to participate actively in European projects, namely within the scope of the current Seventh Framework Program (FP7). Also worthy of note in 2012 was the approval of the projects for the e-Highway2050 and EUPORIAS initiatives. E-Highway2050 (2012-2015) – European Electricity Highway System 2050 – the objective of this project is to develop the bases for a robust and modular expansion of the pan-European electricity transmission networks between 2020 and 2050, keeping in mind the three pillars of the European energy policy. REN is responsible for coordinating a Work Package (WP4). EUPORIAS (2012-2017)European Provision Of Regional Impact Assessment On A Seasonal-to decadal timescale – This project aims to explore the value of seasonal and decadal meteorological forecasts for the European economy, offering its end users access to these products and seeking, in collaboration with them, to develop methodologies to make use of such forecasts in a suitable manner in different sectors. In the case of Portugal, end users encompass fundamental sectors of the national economy, clearly exposed to meteorological factors, albeit with different ANNUAL REPORT 2012 81 levels of sensitivity. The participation of Portuguese end users can be crucial in the European context, given the broad range of the selected sectors and their transversal inter-regional nature. This is the context in which REN participates as a stakeholder. Applications to the SIFIDE program p REN once again made use of the tax incentive system for corporate R&D. This funding program enhances investments in R&D activities by attributing tax credits, which in the case of REN have been quite favorable, further fomenting investments in innovative projects in REN’s sector of activities. In 2012, the REN Group submitted 4 applications to SIFIDE, pertaining to the R&D activities that took place during the 2011 fiscal year at the following companies: REN-Rede Eléctrica Nacional, REN Gasodutos, REN Serviços and ENONDAS. The reported investment in R&D totalled EUR 1.6 M, corresponding to expenditure related to 18 different projects. ENONDAS presented its application for the first time, with the Pilot Area Development Project (Phase I). The project aims to develop a pilot area that would become an open space, along the Atlantic coast, dedicated to developing marine energies, with a special emphasis on wave energy. The Portuguese Pilot Area is located off the coast of the district of Leiria and, by means of DecreeLaw nº 5/2008, REN is responsible for managing the concession. This concession includes the preparation of infrastructure to connect to the public electricity network. This project is part of the activities to prepare a geophysical and environmental profile of the area. The project also includes the collaboration of the Hydrographic Institute and the Bio3 company, which specialises in biology studies and projects. At a national level, other projects developed internally and in partnership with academic institutions and national R&D organisations – such as the Institute for Higher Technical Studies (IST), the Institute for the Environment and Development (IDAD) of the University of Coimbra, the Institute for Computers and Systems Engineering (INESC) in Oporto, LABELEC Estudos, Desenvolvimento e Atividades Laboratoriais S.A., Faculty of Engineering of the University of Oporto (FEUP) and the Institute for Welding and Quality (ISQ) – also submitted applications. Considering the projects that were already underway in 2012 and the projects that were launched in the 3rd quarter, it has been estimated that the investment in R&D in 2012 will prove to be higher than in 2011. In 2012, the financial subsidies received for investments amounted to EUR 917 728. 4.2.3.2 INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUPS ENTSO p The implementation of the 3rd EU legislative package for the energy sector has continued to entail intense cooperation and ties between REN and European associations of transmission systems operators (ENTSO-E and ENTSO-G), namely by means of the participation of REN personnel in the most diverse activities of these two entities. 82 REN´S SUSTAINABILITY ENTSO-E (EUROPEAN NETWORK OF TRANSMISSION SYSTEM OPERATORS FOR ELECTRICITY) p With the framework of Regulation (EC) 714/2009, REN has continued to participate in the activities of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity – ENTSO-E-, namely by a constant and active presence in various committees and groups of this institution, respectively: System Development Committee, System Operations Committee, Market Committee, Research and Development Committee and Legal and Regulatory Group. In particular, REN has also pursued its collaboration to prepare European network codes in the areas of planning, operation and markets, both by commenting on ACER guidelines as well as drafting the said codes. In this context, during 2012 ENTSO-E: (1) continued bilateral debates with ACER regarding the Network Code for Requirements for Grid Connection (NC RfG); (2) submitted the Demand Connection Code (NC DCC) for final approval by ACER, REN having participated in the respective drafting team; (3) submitted the Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management Code (NC CACM) for final approval by ACER and (4) finalised the text of the Operational Security Network Code (NC OS), which will shortly be submitted for final approval by ENTSO-E. Simultaneously, work also commenced on the Operational Planning and Scheduling (NC OPS), Load Frequency Control and Reserves (NC LFCR) and Balancing (NC BAL) Network Codes. At the same time, REN disseminated the network codes among diverse national stakeholders, a pioneering step among its European peers, promoting and organising working sessions aimed at publicising and providing clarifications regarding the contents of the codes that are in the final phases of being drafted. REN also once again participated in the preparation of the new edition of ENTSOE’s Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP), identifying the projects that best contributed towards achieving the national targets defined by the European energy policy. ENTSO-G (EUROPEAN NETWORK OF TRANSMISSION SYSTEM OPERATORS FOR GAS) p The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Natural Gas – ENTSO-G – saw intense activities in 2012 through the working groups that are part of its three main business areas, viz. market, systems development and systems operation. In terms of the most important achievements it is possible to highlight: (1) formally submitting to ACER the proposal for the Capacity Allocation Mechanisms Network Code (CAM NC) and its subsequent revision in response to the Commission’s specific request; and (2) finalising the proposal for the Balancing Network Code / Balancing Compensation for Gas Transmission Networks (BAL NC), which, at the end of the year, was in a phase of prior adjustment with ACER to later be sent to the Commission. In both cases the commencement of the comitology procedure has been scheduled for the first quarter of 2013, after which the final versions of these codes will be approved and published, which must compulsorily be adopted by EU Member States. With regard to the CAM NC, REN has been participating in the process through the pilot project for allocating aggregate capacity in links between the gas systems of Portugal and Spain, which it manages jointly with the Spanish operator under the supervision of the Regulators of the two countries. This is also part of the set of initiatives that comprise an experimental roadmap launched by ACER with a view to studying the practical application of the new mechanisms in concrete cases (Roadmap for the early implementation of the Capacity Allocation Mechanisms Network Code). In the case of BAL NC, REN promoted a specific analysis applying transition mechanisms and devices to the Portuguese case in the context of the current situation and the model that will come into effect after the code is formally published, a task developed in direct articulation with the ENTSO-G team responsible for preparing the document. It can be noted that 2012 was also a year designated for preparing the next version of the ten-year plan to develop European gas networks (TYNDP), to be published in 2013, and this entailed the corresponding compilation of basic information and the development of models and forecast scenarios necessary for the purpose. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 83 CIGRÉ (Conseil International des Grands Réseaux Eléctriques) p In 2012, a REN employee was appointed as the Chairman of the C3 Studies Committee – Networks and Environment of the International Council for Large Electric Networks – CIGRÉ, while two other REN employees continued in the offices of the Director and Secretary of the Portuguese National Committee at CIGRÉ and other REN personnel continue to carry out tasks as part of the various Study Committees and Working Groups. REGIONAL ELECTRICITY INITIATIVES p In 2012, within the scope of the regional initiative of the South-West Europe (SWE) region, REN, RTE, REE and ONEE, respectively the transmission system operators (TSO) in Portugal, France, Spain and Morocco, took a decisive step towards greater transparency in the electricity markets by launching a new website (www.iesoe.eu) dedicated to publishing information about electric energy links, namely information related to the mechanisms to manage long term congestion, prices of organised markets and economic information pertaining to managing the interconnected links. By signing a Cooperation Agreement REN, RTE, REE, OMI-Polo Español, S.A. (OMIE) and EPEX Spot, S.E, began the necessary tasks to link the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL) with the European market, which will be an important step towards creating a single electricity market, expected to be concluded by 2014. The TSOs continued the tasks aimed at implementing long term mechanisms to manage congestion in links and to enable the exchange of system services between electricity systems. WORKING GROUPS OVERSEEN BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION p Within the framework of legislative proposals pertaining to lines for implementing priority European energy infrastructure, in 2012 REN actively participated in the Western Europe Electricity Working Group and Western Europe Gas Working Group, both overseen by the European Commission and aimed at the ad-hoc and informal implementation of the said legislative proposals, while identifying and selecting energy infrastructure projects of common interest. MED-TSO, MEDGRID AND FRIENDS OF THE SUPERGRID p In 2012, REN formally joined MED-TSO, the network of Mediterranean Transmission System Operators (TSO), as a founding member, having participated actively in the creation of this network, which is primarily aimed at reinforcing dialogue and cooperation between the region’s TSOs as well as supporting projects to reinforce the security and integration of the electricity systems in the Mediterranean. In 2012, REN also formalised its participation in MEDGRID, a consortium that brings together companies that generate, transmit, distribute and fund electricity infrastructure in the Mediterranean region with a view to promoting the development of links between the Northern, Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. 84 REN´S SUSTAINABILITY In 2012, REN also formalised its participation in the Friends of the Supergrid (FOSG). The FOSG is an association of companies and organisations which have a common interest in promoting and influencing the regulatory framework and policy necessary for large scale European links – the Supergrid. The FOSG seeks to promote, develop and create the Supergrid by bringing together companies from sectors which develop HVDC infrastructure and related technology, along with companies that will develop, install, hold and operate this infrastructure. REN has thus been reiterating and reinforcing its presence in diverse international forums in the electricity and natural gas sectors, participating in the definition of the policies that frame them, in technical studies and in lobbying the diverse entities promoing its activities in this area. This presence is one of the components of the company’s strategic plans for internationalisation. Further information in this regard can be consulted on the REN website at www.ren.pt6 4.3 4.3.1 ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE Minimising its environmental impact has always been a core concern at REN, both in terms of implementing new investment projects as well as with regard to its activities of operating and maintaining diverse infrastructure used to transmit electricity and to store and transport natural gas. Environmental themes mean far more to REN than just complying with legal obligations, instead they represent a long-term commitment and living in harmony with surroundings. In 2012, for the first time, REN promoted a public event in Brussels to disseminate its professional practices in the area of the environment. The aim of the workshop was to showcase some best environmental practices in planning and designing the very high voltage electricity transmission network. Called the Grid Development Plan Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA): Towards Sustainability, this initiative was held in partnership with REN’s Spanish and Belgian counterparts (REE – Red Elétrica de España and ELIA), the Belgian federal authority for health and the environment and the Spanish Ministry for Industry and took place within the scope of the even Open Days of the Regions 2012 organised by the European Commission’s DG REGIO. REN also collaborated to promote a workshop by the North Regional Coordination and Development Commission and the Institute for Higher Technical Studies (IST), which played a key role in the environmental appraisal of the PDIRT. These entities presented their point of view regarding environmental assessment processes, in order to ensure the broadest possible debate and views regarding these processes. The company’s approach in this regard can be consulted on the REN website 7. 6 See REN>Sustainability>The RDI in REN. 7 www.ren.pt/sustentabilidade/abordagem_da_ren ANNUAL REPORT 2012 85 4.3.2 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT Detailed information on Strategic Environmental Assessment8 and Project Environmental Assessment9 can be consulted on the REN website. Within the scope of its activities to expand and improve energy transmission networks REN has developed a significant set of environmental assessment processes, in the planning phase: ’11 ’12 Environmental Impact Assessment Processes 5 7 Post-Assessment Environmental Impact Processes 0 0 Environmental Impact Statements issued 6 2 Project Environmental Studies 8 5 Environmental Impact Studies 3 5 Environmental Compliance Report 1 1 of the Execution Project (RECAPE) REN was awarded the Regional Award 2012 by the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA), a reputed international organisation promoting best practices for using environmental impact assessments keeping in mind informed decision making processes within the scope of policies, programs, plans and projects, in around 120 countries worldwide. According to the IAIA, the award was due to the important contributions of the REN Group in the area of environmental impact assessment in its projects and activities, even when not required to do so by law, and its pioneering role in carrying out the strategic environmental assessment for its Investment and Development Plan for the National Electricity Transmission Network (RNT) in Portugal. Monitoring actions were also conducted in 2012 in diverse REN infrastructures including the following: Nº of projects monitored Descriptors ’11 ’12 Birdlife 5 12 Soundscape 0 7 Water Resources 6 2 Flora 8 2 8 www.ren.pt/sustentabilidade/ambiente/avaliacao_ambiental/avaliacao_ambiental_estrategica/ 9 www.ren.pt/sustentabilidade/ambiente/avaliacao_ambiental/avaliacao_de_projectos/ 86 REN´S SUSTAINABILITY In 2012, 28 REN projects were subject to environmental supervision and monitoring. 4.3.3 SOME ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS REN monitors a set of environmental indicators that reflect its performance in this area.

ANNUAL REPORT 2012 87 The use of sea water in vaporisers to regasify LNG was reduced significantly due to the reduction of market agent appointments as compared to similar periods. In 2012, a total of 771 tonnes of waste were sent to a final destination, of which only 20% were hazardous. Around 65% of the wastes were sent to waste utilisation operations and of these, more than 220 tonnes were sent for recycling. The following graph shows the breakdown of the environmental costs in 2012 according to typology. 22 592 47 800 129 334 21 940 235 634 146 614 437 920 3 244 037 CLEANING OF FORESTS COMPENSATORY MEASURES MONITORING PROTECTION BIRDLIFE OTHER COSTS WASTE MANAGEMENT QAS AUDITS AND CONSULTING MANAGING FACILITIES (WTP / WWTP / ENERGY CERTIFICATIOR 4.3.4 CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY CHALLENGES REN is among the companies that best provides information on the company’s policies and activities in the area of climate change, according to the Carbon Disclosure Project Iberia 125 Climate Change Report 2012. REN was invited to participate, for the fourth consecutive year, in the CDP’s annual questionnaire. The company had a classification of 81 points in terms of the level of information made available and following the rules of the report guidelines. The company was also classified at level C with regard to the assessment of its performance in the area of combating climate change. The CDP is a non-profit organisation that compiles information on the performance of the main global companies with regard to climate change, providing this information to a broad set of institutional investors, helping them to identify potential risks related to their investments. In terms of disseminating information, REN’s response was above the average of responses in the Iberia 125 index, having improved its previous grade by 12 points, thus enabling it to be placed in the upper half of the table and above some of its peers. In the area of preventing and controlling greenhouse gas emissions, over the course of recent years REN has been implementing an action plan to reduce its 88 REN´S SUSTAINABILITY direct emissions, namely with regard to emissions of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), a gas used as an electrical insulator (dielectric) in diverse high and very high voltage equipment. In 2012, there was a slight increase as compared to 2011, caused by sporadic leakages in some substations. The company’s efforts to reduce SF6 leakages is reflected in the evolution of the leakage rates for this gas, with results considered to be technically highly positive on an international scale.

ANNUAL REPORT 2012 89 The increase in purges of natural gas and flare burning was due to controlled actions to release and burn natural gas. The increase in emissions associated with sulphur hexaflouride corresponds to the aforesaid increase of sporadic leakages in some substations. In 2012, the number of videoconferences increased significantly, by 78% as compared to the previous year, some of them at an international level and involving more than two locations simultaneously. In addition to «videoconferences, from the end of 2011 onwards all employees have corporate collaboration software on their computers which makes it possible to exchange instant messages and hold video-calls. This is an important tool to reduce the company’s carbon footprint. ’11 ’12 Number of train journeys (Lisbon-Oporto) 780 974 Number of videoconferences 601 1 069 A REN continua a incentivar o uso de comboio em detrimento da utilização de viaturas ligeiras, em particular nas ligações Lisboa-Porto. Em 2012, o número de viagens de comboio aumentou cerca de 20% em relação a 2011. Managing CO2 emissions from plants with AECs p Within the scope of its regulated activity as a Commercial Agent, REN Trading is a company that plays an active role in the area of climate change. The management of the power plants for which it holds Energy Acquisition Contracts (EAC), viz. Tejo Energia and Turbogás, is conditioned by the rules and limitations resulting from PNALE II and hence the European Emissions Trading Scheme. In 2012, there was once again a reduction in activities as compared to the previous year. Between purchases and sales REN Trading transacted 535 000 tonnes of CO2 on the spot market and around 1.1 million tonnes on the futures market (of which 52 000 are EUA-CER swaps). Issuing Entity for Guarantees and Certificates of Origin p Decree-Law nº 23/2010 of 25 March adapted the system for cogeneration activities in Portugal establishing, among others, the rules for issuing guarantees and certificates of origin for electricity produced by means of cogeneration. This law attributed REN with the competences of the Issuing Entity for Guarantees of Cogeneration Origin (in Portuguese EEGO), namely: Implementation and management of a system of guarantees of origin for the electricity produced in high efficiency cogeneration, encompassing the registration, issue, annulment and cancellation of the respective guarantees of origin; Implementation and management of a system of compiling and registering the information pertaining to efficient cogeneration plants, but not high efficiency plants, to register, issue, annul and cancel certificates of origin; C  onducting audits, either directly or through external auditors recognised by the DGEG, and monitoring plants and equipment for cogeneration production, as well as energy measuring equipment, which enable and ensure the correct qualification of the plants and the guarantee or certification of the origin of the electricity produced; 90 REN´S SUSTAINABILITY M  aking available for public consultation, namely by means of a website, non confidential and relevant information regarding the issue of guarantees and certificates of origin. REN began its activities as the EEGO10 in October 2012, having already enrolled 28 cogeneration plants and issued 45 484 Guarantees of Origin associated with the production of electric energy by high efficiency cogeneration, each corresponding to 1 MWh. Energy Efficiency and Energy Management p REN is developing a pioneering project among European operators, which involves installing solar panels in gas stations. This project is rooted in the Environmental Performance Promotion Plans, dating from 4 years ago, in the area of transporting natural gas (regulatory instruments stipulated in the Tariff Regulations of the electricity and natural gas sectors). The project under the aegis of the Regulatory Authority (ERSE) ended and the objective of reducing CO2 emissions was achieved, a reduction of 28% of the emissions in monitored stations having been achieved in since 2011. The innovative nature of this project and the proven results achieved to reduce CO2 emissions helped the project apply to the SIFIDE Program – System of Tax Incentives for Corporate R&D. At the same time, other opportunities for optimisation were identified, this time relating to the heating control system. In order to optimise the management of the temperature, it will be necessary to carry out intraday forecasts for the evolution of the distribution consumption and, in a final stage, will even involve a weather forecast. Intensive Energy Consumption p REN has two facilities that can be classified as large and intensive consumers of energy: the gas and leaching station of REN Armazenagem and REN Atlântico’s Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminal at Sines. Within the scope of the Intensive Energy Consumption Management System (SGCIE), REN conducted a series of energy audits at these facilities, so as to identify and implement a set of measures to rationalise the consumption of energy integrated into an Energy Consumption Rationalisation Plan (PREn). 10 www.ren.pt/o_que_fazemos/eletricidade/eego/?culture=pt-PT ANNUAL REPORT 2012 91 Of these facilities it is important to note that in the case of REN Atlântico’s SGCIE, the audit identified the adoption of a minimum natural gas flow rate of 174 km3(n)/h as the most important measure to increase the Terminal’s energy efficiency. This measure was implemented whenever possible, however, during 2012 there were some conditioning factors which hindered compliance, namely:  n abrupt rise in the prices of LNG in the international market, due to an A increase in demand in the Asian market. This spike in prices resulted in LNG originally earmarked for Sines being diverted to these markets; A drop in the consumption of natural gas at a national level; In light of these conditioning factors, the LNG Terminal at Sines operated for long periods at its minimum technical level, thus not meeting the proposed energy rationalisation measure. Since the Asian crisis has been overcome, it is expected that the usage rate of the Sines Terminal will rise significantly, thus making it possible to comply with the said measure for a much higher percentage of time and significantly improving the energy efficiency of the LNG Terminal.

Despite the constant concern with protecting and promoting biodiversity, a small percentage of REN’s infrastructure is integrated into sensitive areas in the national territory: sites that are part of the Natura 2000 Network, Special Protection Zones and other protected areas, including national parks, reserves, parks and natural monuments. Occupation in % of total Sensitive Areas Area/Length occupation Stations/facilities 0.47 km2 5.4% Extension of gas 1 195.31 km 12.2 % pipelines/lines The occupation of these areas by REN infrastructure is essentially due to historical reasons (the integration of infrastructure was prior to the classification of these protected areas) as well as the need to enable or reinforce the channelling of renewable energy from production centres situated in these sensitive areas. Whenever these facilities are modified, such as changes in the paths of lines and gas pipelines, such changes are optimised so as to reduce the impact on biodiversity. Currently, the sites where the infrastructure of the National Transmission Network (RNT) is located are potentially the habitat for classified species on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation Nature (IUCN), in the following categories: ’11 ’12 1 IUCN classification Critically threatened 3 3 Threatened 4 6 Vulnerable 17 26 1 Includes the survey of the species that potentially exist in habitats affected by construction work underway for the Mangualde-Celorico-Guarda gas pipeline. 11 www.ren.pt/sustentabilidade/ambiente/biodiversidade_e_gestao_dos_ecossistemas/ ANNUAL REPORT 2012 93 Process of ensuring the compatibility of the Mangualde/Celorico/Guarda gas pipeline with the endemic Narcissus scaberulus The process of the environmental compatibility of the Mangualde-Celorico-Guarda gas pipeline encompasses, among other actions, safeguarding a plant species known as the Mondego Narcissus (Narciso-do-Mondego) (Narcissus scaberulus). The study conducted detected the existence of some clusters of this plant in the future route of the gas pipeline works, which implied the implementation of measures to minimise the impact, with a view to temporarily removing these plants from the course of the works and replacing them carefully at the same sites after the works for installing the gas pipeline were concluded. To this end, specialised biologists accompanied by representatives of the Institute for the Conservation of Nature and Forests (ICNF) collected the fruits (containing the seeds) and bulbs detected. The replanting was carried out last November at the identified sites, approved by the ICNF. The first site visits will be conducted next spring (2013) to verify whether the operation was a success. 4.3.6 FLORA AND SOIL USE As a result of its construction and maintenance activities, REN has a direct impact on flora and soil use. This impact occurs, for example, at the time when the line protection corridors associated with REN’s infrastructure (electricity lines and gas pipelines) are created or maintained. As a way of offsetting this impact, since 2007 REN has been carrying out diverse tree planting projects within the scope of building its new facilities. While constructing the Mangualde-Celorico-Guarda gas pipeline REN implemented compensatory measures that greatly exceed the affected areas and legal requirements. Holly oaks (Quercus ilex) will be planted on 6.96 hectares, in the forest perimeter of the Serra da Estrela area and an additional 5 798 holly oaks, 20 488 oaks and 2 375 ash trees will be planted in an area of more than 25 hectares. Environmental and forestry best practices will be used in this project keeping in mind its sensitive location, in a mission scheduled to extend over the next 22 years. Through its reforestation program REN has already planted more than 400 000 trees in recent years in an area of more than 500 hectares. A total of 106 287 trees were planted in 2012, in an area of approximately 127 hectares in the following infrastructure: Number Infrastructure Area (ha) of trees Lares – Paraimo line 119.6 99 656 Macedo de Cavaleiros – Valpaços line 3.9 3 225 Modification of the Vila Nova-Riba 3.7 3 084 d’Ave line to dual 150/400kV Valpaços substation 281 Valongo transition post 41 94 REN´S SUSTAINABILITY 4.3.7 BIRDLIFE Compensatory Measures p A very important area for REN is the implementation of compensatory measures, derived from the process of the Environmental Impact Assessment for new infrastructure. The measures underway and the main results can be consulted on REN’s website 12. Compatibility between REN’s infrastructure and the white stork population p For more than ten years REN has monitored the nesting patterns of the white stork population in its infrastructure, creating nesting conditions for this bird in favorable habitats and installing devices that minimise the risk of accidents with an electrical origin. More actions were implemented in 2012 as compared to the previous year, described below according to typology: ’11 ’12 Number of platforms installed 150 155 Number of anti-perching devices installed 481 975 Number of nests transferred 43 51 In 2012, there was a slight reduction in the rate of incidents involving white storks as compared to 2011. The installation of fans and platforms prevented nesting in the most dangerous sites, with a higher probability of incidents, helping ensure that an increase in nests does not result in an increase in incidents. Nº OF RATE OF BIRD NESTS INCIDENTS 2 000 0.038 0.040 1 797 1 795 1 837 1 600 1 610 0.029 0.030 0.025 1 200 0.021 0.020 800 0.010 400 0 0.000 2009 2010 2011 2012 Nº OF BIRD NESTS RATE OF INCIDENTS Note: The figure for the number of nests in 2011 was corrected from that previously reported, since the value originally cited for 2011 was an estimate. 12 www.ren.pt/sustentabilidade/ambiente/avaliacao_ambiental/medidas_compensatorias/ ANNUAL REPORT 2012 95 Use of bird anti-collision devices p Observing, studying, comparing and once again observing, studying and testing was a routine that was repeated over the two years when the Bird Anti-Collision Device Effectiveness Assessment was being conducted, developed in a partnership between REN and Quercus. Concluded in 2011, it set out from a real problem, birds dying as a result of transmission lines, which has an impact both in terms of the level of conservation of the species as well as the quality of service. The death of birds on lines has been studied in-depth on an international scale and has given rise to innumerable efforts with a view to minimising bird deaths on the part of transmission and distribution companies as well as associations dedicated to environmental conservation. By means of this study, REN was able to conclude that the Firefly Bird Flappers (FBF) devices in general were considerably more effective in reducing bird mortality in the various sections observed when the two types of devices analysed were compared, i.e. Bird Flight Diverters (BFD) and FBF. The former are the most common anti-collision devices in Portugal and are the devices used on REN lines. The latter are a newer technology already being used in other countries with very promising results, except they have been used for species of birds that very often do not exist in Portugal. This project represented a clear improvement with regard to the current state of the art with the identification of a more effective anticollision model, having a lesser visual impact and lesser sound impact, which is also capable of a 90% reduction in the collision rate of wild birds with transmission lines, thus contributing towards a greater compatibility between electricity transmission and the conservation of birdlife. The French RTE – Réseau de Transport d’Electricité has replicated the birdlife protection system created by REN REN received a request for information from RTE on its experiences protecting birdlife, due to the highly significant increase in the nesting of storks that had occurred on the line supports of REN’s French counterpart. Through this request, which emerged through the work REN developed at the CIGRÉ (www.cigre.org/), RTE wished in particular to find out what actions REN had implemented to ensure compatibility between the nesting of storks and maintaining the necessary quality of service. Based on the information provided by REN, RTE implemented a pilot project to install this type of devices. Taking advantage of the opportunity created by the 44th session of the CIGRÉ, a benchmarking meeting was held in August 2012 between the RTE and REN environmental departments where, among other matters, RTE presented the excellent results of the pilot project using dissuasion equipment, with a success rate of 90%.

Amendments to concession contracts p On 21st February 2012, the following amendments to the concession agreements in effect between the Portuguese State and the Group companies were signed, namely: i) the concession of transport activity of electricity through the National Network of Transport of Electricity signed with REN – Rede Eléctrica Nacional, S.A.; ii) the concession of transport activity of natural gas through the National Network of Natural Gas Transportation, signed with REN Gasodutos, S.A.; iii) the concession activity of reception, storage and regasification of liquefied natural gas to the terminal in Sines, signed with REN Atlântico, terminal GNL, S.A.; and iv) the concession of the activity of underground storage of natural, signed with REN Armazenagem, S.A.. These concession contracts were changed with the main purposes of: i) detailing the functions of the operators of the national networks of electricity and natural gas transportation; ii) develop arrangements for monitoring and supervising the activities of dealers by the Portuguese State and iii) specify the terms applicable to provide information by each of the dealers, adapting the respective contractual clauses to the legal provisions and regulations in force, in particular Decree-Law No. 77/2011 and n. No. 78/2011, both of 20th June. 112 consolidated ACCOUNTS 3 The main accounting policies used by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described below. The policies have been MAIN applied consistently in the periods presented. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 3.1 Bases of presentation The consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, as from the books and accounting records of the companies included in the consolidation (Note 6), maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Portugal, adjusted in the consolidation process so that the consolidated financial statements be in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union (“IAS/IFRS”), in force for the years starting on 1st January 2012. Such standards include the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), International Accounting Standards (IAS), issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee (“IASC”) and respective SIC and IFRIC interpretations, issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (“IFRIC”) and Standard Interpretation Committee (“SIC”), that have been endorsed by the European Union. The standards and interpretations are hereinafter referred generically to as IFRS. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements in the process of adopting REN’s accounting policies, with a significant impact on the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities as well as expenses and income for the reporting period. Although the estimates are based in the best experience of the Board of Directors and their best expectations in relation to current and future events and actions, the current and future results may differ from the estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas in which the assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 5. The consolidated financial statements are presented in thousand of Euros tEuros. These consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors at a meeting held on 6th March 2013. The Board of Directors understands that the consolidated financial statements fairly present the financial position of the companies included in the consolidation, the consolidated results of their operations, their consolidated comprehensive income, the consolidated changes in their equity and their consolidated cash flows in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union (“IFRS”).. Adoption of new standards, interpretations, amendments and revisions p The following standards, interpretations, amendments and revisions endorsed by the European Union are of mandatory application for the financial year ended 31st December 2012: IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” (amendment) (to be applied for years beginning on or after 1st July 2011) – This change introduced new disclosures for transactions involving transfers of financial assets, in particular in what concern to potential risks that remain with the entity that transferred financial assets. This change did not result in a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 113 The following standards, interpretations, amendments and revisions have been endorsed by the European Union with mandatory application in future economic exercises: IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” (amendment) (to be applied for years beginning on or after 1st July 2012) – This amendment introduced new requirements for comprehensive income presentation, requiring the split of profit and loss items and equity items. This change will not result in a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. IAS 19 “Post-Employment Benefits” (amendment) (to be applied for years beginning on or after 1st January 2013) – This amendment introduces the following related with defined benefits plans, namely: (i) actuarial gains and losses are recorded in reserves (eliminate the corridor method); (ii) only one interest rate is applied for the determination of the defined benefit obligation and the plan assets. The difference between the real return on plan assets and the unique interest rate is regarded as an actuarial gain/loss; (iii) expenses recorded in the profit and loss statement correspond only to the service cost and to the interest cost. From the future adoption of this amendment is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. IFRIC 20 “Stripping Cost in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine” (new) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1st January 2013) – This interpretation provides guidance on how and when to recognize certain stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine From the future adoption of this amendment is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. IAS 12 “Income Taxes” (change) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1st January 2013) – This change introduces a rebuttable presumption that investment properties ate fair value in accordance to IAS 40 are recovered entirely through sale, unless the entity has clear evidence that recovery will occur in another manner. From the future adoption of this change is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurements” (new) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1st January 2013) – This standard sets out a single IFRS framework for measuring fair value and provides comprehensive guidance on how to measure the fair value of both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. IFRS 13 applies when another IFRS requires or permits fair value measurement or disclosures about fair value measurements, thus it does not set out requirements on “when to” apply fair value measurement. From the future adoption of this standard it is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures (amendment) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1 January 2013) This change introduced a series of additional disclosures for financial instruments, namely, information regarding those subject to similar compensation agreements. From the future adoption of this change is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. IFRS 1 “First Time Adoption of IFRSs” (amendment) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1st January 2013) This change introduced the exemption for entities that are operating in a hyper inflationary economy and adopting for the first time IFRS, allowing the use of fair value as cost considered on the items of the opening financial statement under IFRS. Additionally there is a change in the reference date for transition. From the future adoption of this change is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” (new) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1st January 2014) This standard establishes the grounds for presenting consolidated financial statements, replacing on this matter the standard IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and SIC 12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. This standard introduces as well new rules for determining control and consolidation perimeter. From the future adoption of this standard it is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. 114 consolidated ACCOUNTS IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements” (new) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1st January 2014) This standard supersedes IAS 31 and SIC 13 – Jointly Controlled Entities and mainly address: (i) the definition of “jointly arrangements” empathizing the rights and obligations instead of its legal form; (ii) reduces the types of jointly agreements prevailing the following: “joint operations” and “joint ventures”; and (iii) eliminates the possibility of using the proportional consolidation model for “joint ventures”. From the future adoption of this standard it is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. IFRS 12 “Disclosure of interests in other entities” (new) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1st January 2014) This standard provides expanded disclosures requirements relating to entity’s interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements. From the future adoption of this standard it is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. IAS 27 “Separate financial statements” (amended) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1st January 2014) This amendment was introduced in the sequence of the emission of IFRS 10, and contains the recording principles and disclosures for investments in associates in the separate financial statements. From the future adoption of this change it is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. IAS 28 “Investments in associates and joint ventures” (amended) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1st January 2014) This IAS 28 was reviewed in the sequence of the issue of IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 and provides guidance on accounting for interests in associates and joint ventures in accordance with equity method. From the future adoption of this change it is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ (amended) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1st January 2014). This change clarified under what conditions rights issued can be classified as equity instruments. From the future adoption of this change it is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. The Company did not use any early adoption option of any of the above standards in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st December 2012. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 115 The following standards, interpretations, amendments and revisions, with mandatory application in future years, were not, until the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements, been endorsed by the European Union: Applicable for financial years beginning on or Standard after Resume This standard sets out requirements for the IFRS 9 Financial instruments (2010) 1-Jan-15 classification of financial assets. These improvements involve the revision Improvements to IFRS (May 2012) Several (usually 01-Jan-13) of several standards, including IAS 16 and IAS 32. Creates an exception to the retrospective application of the requirements in IAS 20 for IFRS 1 Amendment (Government loans) 1-Jan-13 application to government subsidies granted to subsidized interest rates. IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 Amendments Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 1-Jan-13 (transition guidance) 12 to clarify the rules of the transition to IFRS. Creates an exception for the preparation IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Amendments 1-Jan-14 of consolidated financial statements for (Investment Entities) investment entities. These standards and interpretations issued by the IASB were not yet endorsed by the European Union and consequently REN has not adopted them on the 31st December 2012 consolidated financial statements. 3.2 Consolidation principles The consolidation methods used by the Group are as follows: a) Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which REN has the power to govern their financial and operating policies generally associated with direct or indirect control of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are excluded from the consolidation as from the date that control ceases. The net income of the subsidiaries acquired or sold during the period is included in the consolidated financial statement from the date of acquisition or until the date it has been sold. Subsidiaries are included in the accompanying financial statements in accordance with the full consolidation method. Equity and net profit for the year corresponding to third party participation in subsidiaries are reflected separately in the consolidated statement of financial position and income statement in the caption “Non-controlling interests”. The comprehensive income is given to the company’s shareholders and to the non-controlling interests, even if that results in a negative balance of the noncontrolling interests. 116 consolidated ACCOUNTS Whenever necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries for them to be consistent with Group’s accounting policies. Transactions (including unrealized gains and losses on sales between Group companies), balances and dividends distributed between Group companies are eliminated in the consolidation process. The entities that qualify as subsidiaries are listed in Note 6. b) Investments in associates Investments in associates (companies in which the Group has significant influence but does not have control or joint control through participation in the company’s financial and operating decisions, normally where it holds between 20% to 50% of the share capital) are recorded in accordance with the equity method. In accordance with the equity method investments are recorded at cost and subsequently, adjusted by the Group’s share of the investee’s post acquisition changes in net equity (including net result) of the associated company by corresponding entry to the income statement. Additionally, dividends received are recorded as a decrease on the carrying amount of the associate, and proportional portion in the equity variations is recorded as a variation in the Groups equity. The excess of cost in relation to the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the associated company at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill and included in the value of the investment. If the difference between cost and fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is negative, it is recognised as a gain in the period. Valuations are made of investments in associates when there are facts that might suggest the participation to be impaired, being recorded an impairment losses in the income statement, if exists. When the Group’s share of the accumulated loss on an associated company exceeds the book value of the participation, the participation is recorded at zero, except where the Group has assumed commitments to cover loss of the Associate, in which case the Group recognise a liability. If subsequently, the associate reports profits, the Group records its share in the profits only after its profits share be equal to the portion of non-recognized losses. Unrealised gains and losses on transactions with associates are eliminated in proportion to the Group’s interest in the associate, by corresponding entry to the investment in the associate. Unrealised losses are also eliminated, only if the loss doesn´t result from the transferred asset being impaired. The interests in associates are detailed in Note 10. Associates with no significant influence Investments in associates (companies in which the Group does not have significant influence or control, normally where it holds less than 20%) are recorded at cost, since the companies are not listed in any stock exchange and the fair value cannot be measured with reliability. The investments in associates are assets available-for-sale in accordance with IAS 39, being presented as non-current assets when considered strategic to the Group. Associates with no significant influence are presented in Note 13. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 117 c) Goodwill Differences between the cost of acquisition of investments in subsidiaries and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of these companies as of the date of the acquisition or during a period of 12 months after that date, if positive, are recorded as goodwill (in the case of subsidiaries). If this difference is negative, they are immediately recorded in the consolidated profit and loss statement. Goodwill generated on acquisitions after 1st January 2004 (date of transition to IFRS) is not amortised, but is subject to impairment tests at least annually to verify the existence of losses. Impairment to Goodwill is based on the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit, comparing it to the recorded amount, including the Goodwill of that unit. If this amount exceeds the recoverable amount an impairment provision is recorded immediately in the consolidated financial statement, reducing the asset value and considering a cost in the consolidated income statement. The recoverable amount is determined based on the use value of the cash generating unit, being this value reached by discounting the future cash flows, considering the business risks, the temporal value as well as market conditions. 3.3 Balances and transactions in foreign currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the REN Group entities are recorded using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’), the Euro. The consolidated financial statements including these notes are presented in thousand of Euros, unless otherwise indicated, the Group’s functional currency. Foreign currency transactions are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from translation of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the year-end exchange rates are recognised as financial costs in the statement of profit and loss if relating to borrowings and in other operating income and costs in the case of all the other balances/ transactions. The foreign currency exchange rates used for the translation of the foreign currency balances are as follows: Currency ’12 ’11 US Dollar (USD) 1.32 1.29 Swiss franc (CHF) 1.21 1.22 Pound sterling (GBP) 0.82 0.84 Real Brazilian (BRL) 2.70 2.42 Japan Yen (JPY) 113.61 100.20 118 consolidated ACCOUNTS 3.4 Tangible and intangible fixed assets Tangible and intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization / depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes the cost of assets considered as of the transition date to IFRS and the acquisition or construction cost of assets acquired/constructed after that date. Acquisition or construction cost includes the purchase price of the asset and costs incurred directly to prepare the asset to start operating. Borrowing costs incurred during the construction phase are recognised as acquisition/construction costs. Financial expenses incurred during the construction period with loans obtained are recorded as a component of the acquisition/construction cost of the asset, being amortized over the useful life period of the correspondent asset. Subsequent expenditure, including renewals and major overhauls, that extend the useful life of the assets is recognised as cost of the asset, after write off of the component substituted. Current maintenance and repair costs are expensed in the year they are incurred. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated period of useful life of the assets, from the moment they are available for use in the necessary conditions to operate in accordance with management objectives. Whenever there are indications of impairment of fixed assets, impairment tests are made to estimate the recoverable amount of the asset and impairment losses, if any, are recorded. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of the net sales price of an asset and its value in use, value in use being calculated at the discounted future cash flows resulting from continued use of the asset and its sale at the end of its useful life. The useful life of the assets is reviewed at the end of each year so that the depreciation or amortization recorded is in accordance with the consumption standards of the assets. Changes in useful life are treated as changes in accounting estimates and are applied prospectively. Gains and losses on the sale of tangible and intangible fixed assets are determined by the difference between the proceeds of the sale and the book value of the asset, being recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Concession/Regulated Assets – IFRIC 12 – Service Concession Arrangements p The Group has: (i) four concessions for the operation and development of the National Transmission Network, for the global management of the national electric system, as well as utilization and development of the National Natural Gas Transport Network, of the Liquid Natural Gas terminal, the underground storage of natural gas and global management of the natural gas system and (ii) a concession to explore a pilot zone for the electricity production from ocean waves. The assets acquired / constructed by REN under these concession contracts are referred to below as assets relating to the concession. IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements was issued by the IASB in November 2006, for application in years starting on or after 1st January 2008. IFRIC 12 was endorsed by the European Union on 25th March 2009, being of mandatory application for years beginning on or after 1st January 2010. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 119 IFRIC 12 applies to public service concession contracts in which the conceding entity controls/regulates: The services to be rendered by the concessionaire (through utilization of the infrastructure), to whom and at what price; and Any residual interest over the infrastructure at the end of the contract. IFRIC 12 applies to infrastructures: constructed or acquired by the operator from third parties; already existing to which the operator is given access. Therefore, considering the above the REN Group’s concessions are covered by this IFRIC for the following reasons: i) the REN Group companies ( REN – Rede Eléctrica Nacional, S.A., REN Gasodutos, S.A., REN Armazenagem, S.A., S.A., REN Atlântico, Terminal de GNL, S.A. and Enondas, Energia das Ondas, S.A.) have a public service concession contract signed with the Portuguese State (“Conceding Entity”) for a predefined period; ii) the companies render public transport services, reception and storage of gas and transmission of electricity through utilization of gas pipelines, branches and underground tanks, in the case of gas, and lines, stations and substations in the case of electricity; iii) the conceding entity controls the services rendered and the conditions under which they are rendered, through the regulator ERSE; and iv) the assets used to render the services revert to the conceding entity at the end of the concession contracts. This interpretation establishes the general principles for the recognition and measurement of the rights and obligations under the concession contracts with the features mentioned earlier and define the following models: i) Financial asset model – when the operator has the unconditional contractual right to receive cash or other financial asset from the conceding entity, corresponding to specific or determinable amounts, the operator must record a financial asset (receivable). In this model the conceding entity has few or no discretionary power to avoid the payment, as the agreement is usually legally binding. ii) Intangible asset model – when the operator receives from the conceding entity the right to collect a tariff based on use of the structure, it must record an intangible asset. iii) Bifurcated/mixed model – this model applies when the concession includes simultaneously commitments of guaranteed remuneration by the conceding entity and commitments of remuneration dependent on the level of utilization of the concession infrastructures. Considering the nature of concession of the REN Group, as regards the legal nature of its concessions, REN decided that the best model for its situation is the intangible model due essentially to the risk of changes in the tariff regulation imposed by the regulator ERSE. In this respect and in relation to the residual value of the assets relating to the concession (in accordance with the concession contracts, REN has the right to be reimbursed at the end of the concession contract for the net book value of the conceded assets), they were also considered as part of the intangible assets. The residual value of the conceded assets was not significant up to 31st December 2012. Attending to that underlined above, concession assets (intangible assets) are valuated at its acquisition cost or production cost which include financial costs incurred during the construction period. The revaluations that were recorded in the concessions assets on the date of transition to IFRS are part of its cost. 120 consolidated ACCOUNTS For purposes of amortization of the assets relating to the concession, the REN Group follows IAS 38 – Intangible assets, that states in paragraph 98 that: “ A variety of amortization methods can be used to allocate the depreciable amount of an asset on a systematic basis over its useful life. These methods include the straight-line method and production unit method. The method used is selected based on the expected consumption model of future economic benefits included in the asset and is applied consistently from period to period, unless there is a change in the expected consumption model of these future economic benefits”. Therefore considering this, REN understands that the amortization method that best reflects the expected standard of consumption of future benefits of this asset is amortization based on the rate of amortization of the gas and electricity infrastructures approved by the regulator ERSE, as this is the basis of its annual income, that is the conceded assets are amortized based on the remuneration model underlying the Tariff Regulations. Therefore, in accordance with IFRIC 12 the right granted under the concession contract consists of the possibility of REN charging tariffs based on the costs incurred with the infrastructures. However, considering the methodology for determining REN’s tariffs, the remuneration base is determined considering each conceded asset specifically which assumes the need to componentize the right. Consequently, in the case of REN’s concessions it is considered that the right is componentized by separate parts as the various remuneration bases are established. Therefore the intangible asset is: (i) increased as the various projects relating to the concession are concluded (increase in the concession rights), being recorded based on cost; and (ii) decreased as the future economic benefits are consumed. In accordance with IFRIC 12 construction of the infrastructure by the operator is a service that it provides to the conceding entity, distinct from the operation and maintenance service and, as such, will be remunerated by it. However, in applying IFRIC 12 the REN Group assumes that there is no margin in the construction but only in the operation. This notwithstanding, construction costs and income relating to construction are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for the year, considering the requirements of IFRIC 12 in the captions “revenue from construction of concession assets” and “costs of construction of concession assets”. The REN Group makes impairment tests of the assets relating to the concessions whenever events or circumstances indicate that book value exceeds recoverable value, any difference being recorded in the statement of profit and loss. The cash generating units defined for the purpose are directly associated with each concession contract, considering that the conceded assets relating to them belong to the same cash generating unit. Land relating to the electricity producing plants is covered by the Concession Contracts entered into between REN and the Portuguese State and is remunerated based on its amortization, not being disassociated, as such from the other assets of the concession, being an integral part of a common cash generating unit. Investment grants relating to assets are recognized in the statement of profit and loss at the same rate as amortization of the assets. IAS 20 in paragraphs 24 and 25 states that: “Government grants relating to assets, including nonmonetary grants at fair value must be presented in the statement of financial position considering the grant as deferred income or deducting the grant to arrive at the book value of the asset”. Therefore given the existence of these two alternatives for the presentation of grants in the financial statements and IFRIC 12 not mentioning the treatment of investment grants received, REN maintained the grants recorded as liabilities. Considering this, and as a result of applying IFRIC 12, the REN Group classifies assets relating to the concessions in accordance with the intangible asset model, being amortized on a straight line basis as from the date in which they become available for use in accordance with the expected consumption of future benefits model, which corresponds to the regulatory period defined by ERSE and considering that at the end of the concession the Group has the right to receive the net book value of the assets. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 121 Intangible assets in progress reflect the concession’s assets still under construction, being recorded at cost less any impairment losses, being amortized as from the time the investment projects are completed or available for use. 3.5 Leases Classifying a lease as finance or an operating lease depends upon the substance of transaction rather than the form of the lease arrangement. Leases, in which REN has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, are classified as finance leases. Agreements in which an analysis of one or more of the conditions of the contract point toward a finance lease are also classified as such. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Finance lease contracts are initially recognized at the lower of the fair value of the leased assets or the present value of the minimum lease payments, determined at the inception date. The lease liability is recognized net of interest costs in the caption Borrowings. Interest costs included in the lease payments and depreciation of the leased assets are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period they refer to. Tangible fixed assets acquired under finance lease contracts, are depreciated by the lower period between the useful life period of the asset and the maturity of the lease contract, when the company don`t have a purchase option on the maturity date, or by the useful life period estimated, when the Company has the commitment to acquire the asset by the end period of the contract. In operating lease contracts, the lease payments due are recognized as expenses in the statement of profit and loss, on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 3.6 Financial assets and Liabilities Financial Assets p The Board of Directors determines the classification of financial assets at the time of initial recognition, in accordance with the purpose for which the financial assets are acquired. Financial assets may be classified under the following categories: a) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss – includes non-derivative financial assets held for short-term trading and assets designated at fair value through profit and loss at the inception date; b) loans granted and receivables – includes non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not listed in an active market; c) investments held to maturity – includes non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities, that the entity intends and has the capacity to hold until the maturity date; and d) available-for-sale financial assets – includes non-derivative financial assets designated as available-for-sale at the inception date or other financial assets not classified in any of the other financial asset categories. Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised as non-current assets unless management intends to sell them within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 122 consolidated ACCOUNTS Purchases and sales of investments in financial assets are recognized on the transaction date – the date on which REN commits itself to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Such assets are subsequently adjusted to fair value, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value being recognised in the statement of profit and loss caption “Financial costs” for the period in which they arise, which also includes interest income and dividends received. Available-for-sale assets are initially recognised at fair value including transaction costs. In subsequent periods these assets are adjusted to fair value, the changes in fair value being recognised in a fair value reserve within Equity until the investment be sold or received or until the fair value of the investment be below the acquisition cost on a longstanding perspective, situations in which the loss is recorded in the statement of profit and loss. Dividends and interest income from available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss caption financial income for the period in which the right to receive them is established. The fair value of listed investments is based on current market prices (“bid”). If the market for a financial asset is not active, REN establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent transactions, provided that they are at market prices, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis when information is available, making maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity-specific inputs. In the situations where the investments are equity instruments not valued under active market quotations, and for which it is not possible to estimate with reliability its fair value, these investments are measured at the acquisition cost deducted of impairments losses, if any, being the impairment losses recorded in the profit and loss statement of the year. Financial assets held to maturity are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Loans and receivables classified as “Trade and other receivables” in the statement of financial position, are initially recorded at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original terms of the transactions that gave rise to the receivables. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments expire or are transferred, as well as all the risks and rewards of ownership. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, bank deposits, other shortterm highly liquid investments with initial maturities of up to three months, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are presented in the “Borrowings” caption in current liabilities in the statement of financial position, and are included in the consolidated statement of cash flows, as cash and cash equivalents. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 123 Financial Liabilities p A financial instrument is classified as a financial liability when there are contractual obligations by the issuer to liquidate capital and/or interests, by the delivery of cash or other financial asset, independently on its legal form. IAS 39 establishes the classification of financial liabilities in two categories: i) financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss; ii) other financial liabilities The caption other financial liabilities includes “Borrowings” and “Trade and other payables”. Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost, the difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value being recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss over the term of the borrowings, using the effective interest method. Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless REN has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the date of the statement of financial position, in which case they are classified as non-current liabilities. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the related obligations are extinguished through payment, are cancelled or expire. Derivative financial instruments p Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value at the date of the transaction being subsequently measured at fair value. The method of recognising fair value gains or losses depends on the designation made of the derivative financial instruments. If they are designated as derivative financial instruments for trading, gains or losses resulting from fair value changes are recognized in the statement of profit and loss caption “Finance income” or “Finance costs”. If they are designated as hedging derivative financial instruments, gains or losses resulting from fair value changes depends on the nature of the hedged item, which can be a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. The fair value of derivative financial instruments corresponds to its market value. In the absence of market value, the fair value is determined by external independent entities, through valuation techniques accept in the market. Derivative financial instruments are recognized in the caption “Derivative financial instruments”, and if they have a positive or negative fair value they are recorded as financial assets or liabilities, respectively. Derivative financial instruments are classified as non-current when their remaining period to maturity exceeds twelve months and they are not expected to be realized or settled within twelve months. 124 consolidated ACCOUNTS Hedge accounting p Within the scope of the Group risk polices of interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk hedge, the Group contracts a series of financial derivative instruments, namely swaps. The criteria for applying hedge accounting are the following: Adequate documentation of the hedge; The risk to be covered is one of the risks described in IAS 39; It is expected that the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, attributable to the risk covered, are virtually offset by changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument. At the inception of the hedge operation, the Company documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, its risk management objectives and strategy for managing the risk. Additionally, the Group assess, at the inception of the hedge and as of the reporting date, if the derivative financial instruments designated as highly effective in the compensation of changes in the fair value or cash flows of the corresponding items hedged. In the fair value hedge of an asset or liability, the book value of the asset or liability, determined based on the accounting policy used, is adjusted so as to reflect the variation of its fair value attributable to the risk hedged. Variations in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recognized in the statement of profit and loss together with variations in the fair value of the assets or liabilities hedged attributable to the risk hedged. In a hedging operation of the exposure to variations of great probability in future cash flows (cash flow hedge) the effective part of the fair value variation of the hedging instrument is recognized in hedging reserves, being transferred to the statement of profit and loss in the period the item hedged affects results. The ineffective part of the hedge in recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Company revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 3.7 Borrowing costs Financial costs related to borrowings are generally recognised as expense as incurred. Borrowing costs related directly to the acquisition, construction or production of tangible and intangible assets are capitalised as part of the cost of the qualified asset (assets that need a substantial period of time to be prepared for their envisaged use). Borrowing costs are capitalised from the time of preparation of the activities to construct or develop the asset to the time the production or construction is completed or when the project is suspended. Any eventual financial income derived from a loan obtained earlier and allocable to a qualifying account, is deducted from the financial expenses that qualify for capitalisation. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 125 3.8 Government grants and others These refer to grants received for investment in intangible assets and are recognised as deferred income in the caption “Trade and other payables”. Grants received from the Portuguese State and the European Union are recognised when there is reasonable certainty that the subsidy will be received. Grants are subsequently credited to the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a systematic basis in accordance with amortization of the related assets. Operating assets delivered to REN by new producers connected to the National Transmission Network or others are also recorded as subsidies received. Operating grants are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period in which the related costs are incurred. 3.9 Impairment of assets, except goodwill Financial Assets p The Group evaluates at each reporting date, if there is evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets, have any impairment, namely from which results an adverse impact on the estimated cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, and always if it can measured reliably. For financial assets measured at amortized cost, the impairment loss to be recognized corresponds to the difference between the carrying amount and its present value on the reporting date of the new future cash flows discounted at the respective effective interest rate. In the case of financial assets classified as “held for sale”, a significant and longstanding decrease of its fair value below the acquisition cost is considered an indicator that the financial asset is impaired. If evidence of impairment on the financial asset held for sale exists, the accumulated loss is determined by the difference between the acquisition cost the actual fair value, less any impairment losses previously recorded is transferred from the fair value reserve in equity into profit and loss of the period. Impairment losses of equity instruments recorded in profit and loss are not reversible. Non-financial assets p Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicates that the amount by which the asset is recorded may not be recovered, impairment tests are undertaken in order to determine the recoverable amount of the asset, and when necessary an impairment loss recorded. An impairment loss is considered by the excess of the carrying amount of an asset when compared with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s net selling price and value in use. The net selling price is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm’s length transaction less the costs of disposal. Value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if this is not possible, for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The REN Group undertakes impairment tests for the concession assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, in which case the difference is recognized in the income 126 consolidated ACCOUNTS statement. The cash generating units were identified considering the concession agreements in place, considering that all assets belonging to these agreements are to be included in the same unit. Assets with no undefined useful life are not subject to amortization but are subject to annual impairment tests. Assets with useful life are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in the conditions indicate that the carrying amount may not be recovered. This way whenever fair value is below the carrying amount of the assets, the Group should evaluate if this situation will be permanent in which case an impairment loss should be recognized. If it is assessed that the situation is not permanent the reasons that support such judgment should be disclosed. Non-financial assets, except for Goodwill, for which impairment losses have been recognized are reviewed at the end of each period evaluating the possibility of its reversal. Reversal of impairment losses recognized in prior years is recorded in the consolidated profit and loss statement However, the reversal of an impairment loss is recognized to the extent it does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciations) had no impairment loss been recognized for that asset in prior years. The amortization and depreciation of the assets are recalculated prospectively in accordance with the recoverable amount adjusted by the impairment recognized. 3.10 Employee benefits REN grants supplementary retirement and survivor pensions (hereinafter referred to as pension plan), provides its retirees and pensioners with a medical assistance plan and grants other benefits such as long service bonuses, retirement bonus, pre-retirement bonus and death subsidy. i) REN – Rede Eléctrica Nacional, S.A. pension plan The supplementary retirement and survivor pensions granted to employees consist of a defined benefit plan, with an autonomous plan assets established, to which all the liabilities are transferred and contributions are made to cover the liabilities which are vested on each period. These liabilities assumed by the Group are annually estimated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit liability is determined by discounting future payments of the benefits using the appropriate discount rate. The liability is recognised, when applicable, deducted from the past service costs. The source used to determine the annual discount rate, was based on the high quality risk bonds (Aa risk notation from Bloomberg). The credit risk notation is attributed by four rating companies being its approach consistent with income curve model for each maturity group. The discount rate used results from the conversion of the interest rate curve in to a spot interest rate. The liability for retirement benefits recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position corresponds to the present value of the liability for the benefits as of the reporting date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with any adjustments for past service costs, if applicable. Actuarial gains and losses determined, for each plan of benefits granted, resulting from adjustments to actuarial assumptions, experience adjustments or in the benefits scheme are recorded directly in equity. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 127 ii) REN – Rede Eléctrica Nacional, S.A. health plan and other benefits The liabilities assumed relating to healthcare are not funded, being covered by a specific provision. Measurement and recognition of the liability for healthcare are the same as those for retirement supplements referred to above, except as regards assets of the plan. REN recognises all the actuarial gains and losses on all the plans directly in equity. iii) Life Insurance Contracts The Group companies provide their employees life insurance benefits. The costs are recognized during the period in which they render services to each company. This liability is covered by a specific provision. Actuarial gains and losses determined in the year are recognised directly in equity. Actuarial gains and losses for the year are recognised directly in equity. 3.11 Provisions, contingent assets and liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Group has: i) a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; ii) it is more likely than not that an outflow of internal resources will be required to settle the obligation; and iii) the amount can be reliably estimated. When one of these criteria is not fulfilled or the existence of the liability is dependent upon the occurrence (or not) a future event, REN SGPS discloses it as a contingent liability, except if the outflow of resources to settle it is considered to be remote. Restructuring provisions are recognised by the Group when there is a formal and detailed restructuring plan and that such plan has been communicated to the involved parties. In the measurement of the restructuring provision, only the expected outflows that directly result from the implementation of such plan are considered and the current activities of the Group are not considered. Provisions are measured at the present value of the estimated outflows required to settle the liability using a pre-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the discount period and the risk of the provision. Contingent assets are probable assets which probability of becoming certain depend of the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events that are not fully controlled by the Company. The probability of the inflow of the economic benefit is subject to the occurrence of such events. The Group discloses contingent assets when the influx of the corresponding economic benefit is estimated as probable. However in exceptional circumstances on which REN estimates as virtually certain the probability the revenue is recognized in the consolidated financial statements. 128 consolidated ACCOUNTS 3.12 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Inventories include materials used in internal maintenance and repair operations. Inventories are initially recorded at cost, which includes purchase cost and all the expenses relating to their acquisition. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method. Gas in the gas pipelines and gas stored in the LNG terminal and underground tanks, is property of the infrastructure users. The REN Group does not buy, sell or hold any gas inventories. 3.13 Capital and own shares Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares or options are shown net of tax, as a deduction in equity from the amount issued. Own shares acquired through contract or directly on the stock market are recognised as a deduction in equity. In accordance with Portuguese Commercial law, REN SGPS must ensure at all times that there are reserves in Equity to cover the value of treasury shares, constraining the amount of reserves available for distribution. Own shares are recorded at cost if they are acquired in a spot transaction or at estimated fair value if acquired in a deferred purchase. 3.14 Income tax REN is taxed based on the special regime for the taxation of group of companies (“RETGS”), which includes all REN group companies located in Portugal, and which REN owns directly or indirectly at least 90% of the share capital and comply with the conditions of the article 69 of the Income Tax Code. Income tax for the year includes current income tax and deferred income tax. Income tax is recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except when it relates to items recognised directly in equity. The amount of income tax payable is determined based on net profit before tax, adjusted in accordance with tax rules for the entities included in the consolidation perimeter. The taxable profit differs from the net profit determined by accounting rules, as several costs and revenues are excluded that will only be deducted or taxed in future periods, and costs and revenues that will never be reveled for tax purposes in accordance to the tax law in place. Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method based on the statement of financial position considering the temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred taxes are calculated using the tax rates in force or substantially enacted at the statement of financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 129 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be used. Deferred tax liabilities are provided for on every temporary tax difference, except those relating to: i) the initial recognition of goodwill; or ii) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in transactions that do not result from a business combination and at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. However, taxable temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries should not be recognised to the extent that: i) the parent company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; and ii) it is probable that the temporary difference will not revert in the near future. 3.15 Accruals basis Revenue and expenses are recognised in the period to which they relate, independently of the date they are received or paid, in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting. Differences between the amounts received and paid and the related income and costs are recognised as assets or liabilities, if they qualify so. 3.16 Revenue Revenue is measured by the fair value of the benefit received or that is going to be received. The revenue is deducted of the amount from devolutions, discounts and other rebates and it does not include VAT or other taxes related to the sale. The revenue from the sale of goods is recorded when all the following conditions are met: The significant risks and rewards related with the property were transferred to the buyer; The Group does not maintain any control on the goods sold; The amount of revenue can be reliably measured; It’s probable that future economic benefits related with the transaction will flow to the Group; and The expenses incurred or to be incurred with the transaction can be reliably estimated. Revenue from services of non-regulated activities is recognised, by the percentage of completion of the respective transaction or services at the reporting date, when all the following conditions are met: The amount of revenue can be reliably measured; It’s probable that future economic benefits related with the transaction will flow to the Group; The expenses incurred or to be incurred with the services can be reliably estimated; and The stage of completion of the transaction/service rendered can be reliably measured. The revenue from interests is recognised using the effective interest method, provided that it is probable that economic benefits flow to the Group and its amount can be reliably measured. 130 consolidated ACCOUNTS The revenue from dividends are recognised when it is established the right of the Group to receive the correspondent amount. Revenue from services rendered on the Group regulated activities are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in accordance with the criteria defined in IFRIC 12, described in greater detail in Note 3.4 – Tangible and intangible fixed assets, and in accordance the description of each business segments. Electricity segment Revenue recognition for concession activities is determined based on information of the electricity transmitted to distributors and the implicit services provided, considering the tariffs defined annually by the regulator, for transmission of electricity and global management of the system. The “Commercial Agent” activity, carried out by the group company REN Trading which is responsible for the management of the electricity produced under the two PPA’s (power purchase agreements) that have not been terminated (Tejo Energia and Turbogás), is remunerated through an incentive mechanism. To stimulate the “Commercial Agent” activity, in the beginning of 2008 ERSE established a mechanism to optimise management of the PPA’s, a mechanism to optimise the management of carbon emission licences, as well as the parameters to be in place for calculating the incentives established. Revenue obtained by use of these mechanisms, is the main part of the results obtained from the “Commercial Agent” activity. Revenue obtained from these activities is regulated by ERSE, the Portuguese electricity regulator. In accordance with the regulatory terms and conditions, the tariffs to be charged to final customers (domestic consumers, industry customers and others), are determined annually for each component of the system, such as: generation, transmission and distribution. REN, SA’s income relates mainly to electricity transmission and global management of the electricity system. The tariff for electricity transmission aims to recover: i) a  mortization of the concession assets classified as electricity transmission equipment; ii) a return on the average net book value of the assets relating to this activity, in accordance with the rates determined annually by the regulator; and iii) o perating costs (relating to the activity, payroll and others), less the results obtained from electricity transmission charged to third parties. The tariff for global management of the system aims to recover: i) a  mortization of the concession assets relating to global management of the system; ii) a mortization of the concession assets relating to the generating station sites; iii) a return on the average net book value of the generating station sites (land); iv) a  return on the average net book value of the assets relating to this activity, in accordance with the rates determined annually by the regulator; v) operating costs (relating to the activity, payroll and others); and vi) operating costs of the regulator; ANNUAL REPORT 2012 131 Gas segment Revenue from gas concession operations is determined based on: i) information relating to the gas units unloaded and re-gasification of gas units in the LNG terminal, ii) the gas units injected, stored and extracted in the underground tanks; and iii) the capacity used and gas units transmitted through the high pressure transmission network. The income is calculated in accordance with the tariffs determined by the regulator as of 1st of July 2007. Up to 30th June 2007, income was recognized in accordance with the transition agreements signed with Transgás the main user of the gas capacity of the gas assets owned by the REN Group. Telecommunications segment Revenue from the telecommunications segment results from services rendered by the group company RENTELECOM, through the rent of fibre optics capacity, benefiting from the excess capacity of the telecommunications equipment installed. In this area services relating to management of private voice networks are also rendered. Revenue is recognised in the period the services are rendered, based on the percentage of the stage of completion of each specific transaction, valued considering the actual services already rendered and the total services to be rendered. Tariff deviations p The Tariff Regulations for the electricity and gas business, issued by ERSE, define the formula for calculating the revenue allowed for the regulated activities and consider in the calculation formula, determination of the tariff deviations that are recovered up to the second year after the date in which they were generated, the period on which the deviations are recovered thus being defined. In this way the REN Group determines at each financial statement date, in accordance with the criteria defined by the tariff regulations published by ERSE, the deviations determined between the revenue cap defined and actual revenue. Considering the legislation and the regulatory environment in force, the tariff deviations determined by REN each year comply with a series of characteristics (measurement reliability, right of recovery, transmissibility, identification of the debtor and incidence of interest) that support their recognition as revenue and as an asset, in the year in which they are determined, as being reliably measurable and for it being virtually certain that the financial benefits relating to the transaction(s) will flow to the Company. This rationale is also valid when negative tariff deviations are determined, which are considered as liabilities and revenue deduction. Despite the IFRS not covering the recording of tariff deviations, paragraph 12 of IAS 8 and the SFAS 71 – Accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation, strengthen the position of recording asset and liability tariff deviations under conditions in which the electricity and gas regulations are established for REN. The Decree-law No. 165/2008 dated 21st August for the electricity segment and the Decree-Law 87/2011 dated 18th July for the gas segment, reinforce the exposed, establishing the applicable regime to the recognition and transmission of tariff deviations, within the scope of the Concession contracts held by the Group. 132 consolidated ACCOUNTS 3.17. Segment reporting An operational segment is a component of an entity which; a) d  evelops business activities from which can obtain revenue and incur in expenses (including revenue and expenses related with transactions and other components of the same entity); b) o  perating results are regularly reviewed by the main responsible for the operational decision making process of the entity of for the purpose of decision making regarding the recourses imputation to the segment and the evaluation of its performance; c) the financial data available is distinct. The operating segments are reported consistently with the internal model of management information made available to the main responsible for the operational decision making of the Entity. REN identified the Executive Committee as the entity responsible for the operating making decisions. The Executive Committee reviews the information prepared internally so as to assess the Group’s performance and the allocation of resources. Determination of the segments was made based on the information analysed by the Executive Committee, which did not result in new segments in relation to those previously reported. The REN Group is organized in two main business segments: Electricity and Gas and two secondary segments: telecommunications and management of the electricity derivatives market (up to 2011 only). The Electricity segment includes the transmission of very high tension electricity and overall management of the public electricity supply system and management of power purchase agreements (“PPA”) not terminated on 30th June 2007, as well as the management of the Concession pilot zone for electricity production based on sea waves. The Gas segment includes the transport of very high pressure gas and overall management of the national natural gas system, as well as operation of the LNG regasification terminal and underground storage of natural gas. The other segments (telecommunications and management of the electricity derivatives market) are also presented separately although they do not qualify for disclosure. The caption “Others” includes the operations of REN SGPS and REN Serviços. Financial information relating to income of the identified business segments is included in Note 7. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 133 3.18 Cash flow statement The cash flow statement is prepared under the direct method, being presented the collections and payments in operational activities, investment activities and financing activities. The Company classifies interests and dividends received as investment activities and interests and dividends paid as financing activities. The change noted in the caption “Other receipts/(payments) from operational activities”, is essentially due to payment of Value Added Tax (“VAT”) which rate increased from 6% up to 23% and to the payment to Amorim Energia, B.V. (see Note 22) in the amount of EUR 27 837 thousand. 3.19 Subsequent events Events that occur after the statement of financial position date that provide additional information on conditions that existed at the date of the statement of financial position (“adjusting events” or events after the statement of financial position date that lead to adjustments) are recognized in the financial statements. Events that occur after the statement of financial position date that provide information on conditions that exist after that date (“non-adjusting events” or events after the statement of financial position date that do not lead to adjustments) are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, if material. 4 Financial risk management policies are also described in a specific section for this matter in the Management report. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 4.1 POLICIES Financial risk factors The Group’s activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks: including credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk relating to interest rate and foreign exchange rate. The Group has developed and implemented a risk management programme that, together with permanent monitoring of the financial markets, aims to minimise potential adverse effects on the REN Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by the financial management department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The financial management department identifies, assesses and realises operations to minimise the financial risks, in strict cooperation with REN’s operating units. The Board of Directors defines the principles for overall risk management and policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivatives and other non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of liquidity excess. 134 consolidated ACCOUNTS i) Foreign exchange rate risk REN has limited exposure to foreign exchange rate risk. The risk of fluctuation of foreign exchange rates on the bonds totalling JPY 10,000 million Yens, is fully hedged by a cross currency swap of the same notional amount. An adverse variation of 5% in the forward foreign exchange rate of Euro/JPY, all other factors remaining constant at 31st December 2012 and 2011, would have the following impact on equity: ’12 ’11 5% -5% 5% -5% (1 126) 1 243 (1 960) 2 165 ii) Credit risk REN’s exposure to credit risk is not significant, since a substantial portion of services rendered is recognised through amounts invoiced to electricity and natural gas distributors in regulated markets. In addition, in general, contracts with clients establish guarantees, with the objective to cover the collection and default risk. The Group’s counterparty risk on bank deposits, financial applications, and contracting of derivative instruments is mitigated by the selection of top rate institutions with solid credit ratings and well known in the market. iii) Liquidity risk REN’s liquidity risk management is carried out through the dynamic and flexible management of commercial paper programs, as well as by negotiating credit limits that enable it, not only to ensure that the current treasury needs of the REN Group are met, but also provide some flexibility to enable the shocks outside its operations to be dealt with. For that effect we highlight the EUR 827 000 thousand available in commercial paper programmes and the financing line available with the China Development Bank in the amount of EUR 800,000 thousand (amount corresponding to 80% of the global commitment in the amount of EUR 1 000 000 thousand agreed following the strategic partnership with State Grid International development Ltd in the light of the second phase of the re-privatization of REN) which main terms and conditions are announced to the market in October 2012.

Since a significant part of the REN Group’s assets have a guaranteed return through the tariffs, definition of which depends in part on market rates of interest, its operating cash flows are significantly affected by changes in the market interest rates. Increases in the interest market rates, generates significant increases in cash flows and vice-versa. In terms of financial liabilities, REN is exposed to interest rate risk, mainly due to borrowings. Borrowings at variable interest rates expose REN to cash flow risk resulting from changes in interest rates. Borrowing at fixed rates exposes the REN Group to fair value risk, as a result of changes in interest rates. Risk management is performed centrally aiming to avoid volatility in financial costs, using simple derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps. In this kind of operation REN Group exchanges with banking counterparties in specific dates and with defined maturity, the difference between the fixed interest rates and the variable rates with reference to the notional amounts covered. All operations undertaken with this end can, mostly, be considered perfect interest rate hedging operations. A sensitivity analysis was made based on the REN Group’s total debt less applications in funds and cash and cash equivalents as of 31st December 2012 and 2011, with the following assumptions: Changes in market interest rates affecting interest income and costs of variable financial instruments; Changes in market interest rates affecting only results or equity in relation to fixed interest rate financial instruments if they are recognized at fair value; Changes in market interest rates affecting the fair value of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities; Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated discounting future cash flows, using market rates at the year end. Using these assumptions a 0.25% increase in market interest rates for all the currencies in which the Group has borrowings or derivative financial instruments at 31st December 2012 would result in a decrease of profit before tax of approximately EUR 1,941 thousand (EUR 2,015 thousand in 2011) and an increase in equity of, approximately, EUR 1,778 thousand (decrease of, approximately, EUR 125 thousand in 2011). The sensivity analysis is merely projected, and do not represent any present real gain or loss, neither other real variations in the net results nor in equity. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 137 v) Price risk REN’s exposure to price risk results essentially from its investment in REE and Enagás. A negative variation of 10% in the price of shares of REE and Enagás at 31st December 2012 would have an impact on equity of EUR 8,904 thousand (EUR 7,922 thousand in 2011). vi) Regulated activity risk Gains recognised by REN in each period result directly from the assumptions considered by the regulator, ERSE, in defining the regulated tariffs for the electricity and gas sectors. 4.2. Capital risk management The REN Group’s objective relating to the management of capital, which is a broader concept than the capital disclosed on he face of the statement of financial position, is to maintain an optimal capital structure, through rational use of debt. The necessity of debt increases are analysed periodically considering the Group’s financing needs and its liquidity position. REN also monitors its total capital based on the gearing ratio, which is calculated as net debt over the total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings as presented in the consolidated statement of financial position), adjusted by the amounts of cash and cash equivalents and hedge derivatives. Total capital is calculated as equity (as presented in the consolidated statement of financial position) plus net debt. 5 The estimates and assumptions with impact on REN’s consolidated financial statements are continuously evaluated, representing at each reporting date MAIN the Board of Directors best estimates, considering historical performance, past accumulated experience and expectations about future events that, under the ESTIMATES AND circumstances, are believed to be reasonable. JUDGEMENTS The intrinsic nature of these estimates may cause different impacts on financial statements from those previously estimated. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: Significant accounting estimates p 5.1. Provisions The REN Group periodically analyses the existence of possible liabilities resulting from past events that should be recognized or disclosed. 138 consolidated ACCOUNTS The subjectivity inherent to the determination of the probability and amount of the resources necessary to settle these liabilities may result in significant adjustments, due to variations in the assumptions used or because previously disclosed contingent liabilities may have to be recognised as provisions. 5.2 Actuarial assumptions Determination of the liability for retirement pensions and healthcare plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates of a demographic and financial nature, which may significantly affect the liability calculated at each reporting date. The more sensitive assumptions refer to: the discount rates used to update the liability, the estimated return on assets and the mortality tables. 5.3 Tangible and intangible assets Determination of the periods of useful life of the assets, as well as the amortization and depreciation method to be used are essential for determining the amount of amortization and depreciation to be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for each year. These two parameters are defined in accordance with Management’s best judgement for the assets and business. 5.4 Impairment The recognition of possible impairment loss may be identified by the occurrence of events, many outside the control of the REN Group, such as: future availability of financing; the cost of debt; or maintenance of the current market regulatory structure, as well as other changes of the REN Group, both internal and external. The identification of impairment indicators, the estimate of future cash flows and the determination of the fair value of assets imply a high degree of judgement by the Board of Directors, as regards the evaluation of impairment indicators, estimated cash flows, discount rates used, useful lives and residual values. In REN’s specific activities there are other factors to consider in impairment testing, since commitments to increase the network of infrastructures, changes in expected tariffs, or changes in the strategy of the shareholders of REN, which together with other factors can result in changes in the future cash flow trends and amounts. 6 The following companies were included in the consolidation perimeter as of 31st December 2012 and 2011: CONSOLIDATION PERIMETER ANNUAL REPORT 2012 139 ’12 ’11 % 0wned % 0wned Designation / address Activity Group Individual Group Individual Parent company: REN Redes Energéticas Holding company – – – – Nacionais, SGPS, S.A.

No impacts to the Groups financial statements resulted from this operation as these subsidiaries were held 100% by REN Gasodutos and therefore totally consolidated in the Group. 7 The REN Group is organised in two main business segments, Electricity and Gas and two secondary segments. The electricity segment includes the transmission SEGMENT of electricity in very high voltage, overall management of the public electricity system and management of the power purchase agreements (PPA) not REPORTING terminated at 30th June 2007 and the pilot zone for electricity production from sea waves. The gas segment includes high pressure gas transmission and overall management of the national natural gas supply system, as well as the operation of regasification at the LNG Terminal and the underground storage of natural gas. Although the activities of the LNG Terminal and underground storage can be seen as separate from the transport of gas and overall management of the national natural gas supply system, since these operations provide services to a single user, which is also the main user of the high pressure gas transport system, it was considered that it is subject to the same risks and benefits. The other segments (telecommunications and management of the electricity derivative market for 2010 and income for the nine month period ended 30th September 2011, as from when it left the consolidation perimeter) are also presented separately although they do not qualify for disclosure. During 2012 REN reviewed the segment reporting, namely the segment presentation of the statement of financial position. Management of external loans are centrally managed by REN SGPS, S.A. for which the Company choose to present the assets and liabilities separate from its eliminations that are undertaken in the consolidation process, as used by the main responsible operating decision maker.

This is an interest rate risk hedge on interest payable at variable rates on recognized financial liabilities. The risk hedged is the indexer of the variable rate to which the loan interest coupons relate. The objective of the hedge is to transform the borrowings at variable interest rates into fixed interest rates, the credit risk not being covered. The fair value of the interest rate swaps as at 31st December 2012 was -EUR 27,958 thousand (-EUR 14,880 thousand as at 31st December 2011). In addition, REN hedges its exposure to cash flow risk on its bond issue of JPY 10,000 million resulting from foreign exchange rate risk, through a cross currency swap with the main features equivalent to the debt issued. The same hedging instrument is used to hedge the fair value of the exchange rate risk of the bond issue through the forward start swap component which will only start in June 2019. The variations in the fair value of the hedging instrument are also recognized in hedging reserves. As from June 2019 the object will be to hedge exposure to JPY and the interest rate risk, transforming the operation into a fair value hedge, the changes in fair value of the debt issued resulting from the risks covered becoming recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The credit risk is not hedged. The amounts resulting from the hedging instrument are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the transaction hedged affects results for the year. The fair value of the cross currency swap at 31 December 2012 was EUR 6,853 thousand (EUR 26,696 thousand at 31st December 2011). The underlying exchange variation (borrowing) for 2012, in the amount of, approximately, EUR 11,780 thousand, was offset by a similar variation in the hedging instrument in the statement of profit and loss. The inefficient component of the fair value hedge amounted to EUR 156 thousand. The amount recorded in reserves relating to the above mentioned cash flow hedges was EUR 35,431 thousand (EUR 14,793 thousand at 31st December 2011).

The hedge was discontinued in November 2009, and as of 31st December 2012 the hedged instrument has a fair value adjustment resulting from the hedge of EUR 155 thousand. This amount is being amortized to profit and loss, in accordance with the effective interest rate method during the maturity period of the hedged instrument.

The accompanying financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors meeting of 6th March 2013. However, they are still subject to approval by the Shareholders’ Meeting under the terms of current Portuguese legislation. The Board of Directors believes that the financial statements reflect in a fair manner the Company’s financial position, the results of its operations, changes in its equity and its cash flows. 2 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Decree-Law 158/2009 of 13th July, and the conceptual ACCOUNTING framework, accounting and financial reporting standards and interpretations applicable for the year ended 31st December 2012 (generally accepted accounting FRAMEWORK FOR principles in Portugal or NCRF). THE PREPARATION The accompanying financial statements are presented in thousand of Euro. OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3 The main accounting policies used to prepare these financial statements are as follows: MAIN ACCOUNTING 3.1 POLICIES Bases of presentation The accompanying financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis from the accounting records of the Company, maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Portugal. The accompanying financial statements reflect only the Company’s separate accounts, prepared as required by law for approval by the Shareholders’ Meeting. As explained in Note 3.2 investments are stated in accordance with the equity method. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 203 In accordance with Decree Law 158/2009 of 13th July, the Company also prepared consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union (“IFRS”), for approval in separate, which reflect, as at 31st December 2012, in relation to the accompanying separate financial statements, the following differences: Total net assets (894 333) Total liabilities (965 117) Net profit for the period (2 797) Total revenue (562 094) Total equity 70 783 As at 31st December 2012, the differences between net profit and equity (separate and consolidated financial statements) results essentially from: (ii) the fact that the subsidiaries record actuarial gains and losses relating to employee benefits in accordance with the “corridor” method, this effect being appropriated by the Company in applying the equity method to value investments in subsidiaries, whether in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, actuarial gains and losses on these employee benefits are recorded directly in equity; and (ii), the fact that the investment held in OMIP SGPS in the IFRS consolidated financial statements, have been revalued in 2011, in the sequence of the loss in control, when OMIP became an associate. 3.2 Investments in subsidiaries and associates Investments in subsidiaries and associates are recorded based on the equity method, under which they are initially recorded at cost and then adjusted based on the post-acquisition changes in the Company’s share of the net assets of these companies. The Company’s results include the proportion of the results of these entities. In addition dividends received from these companies are recorded as decreases in the amount of the investments. The excess of cost in relation to the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities of each entity acquired as of the acquisition date is recognized as goodwill and is maintained in the amount of the investment. If the difference between cost and the fair value of assets and liabilities is negative, it is recognized as income for the year. A valuation of investments is made when there are indications that an asset can be impaired, any impairment losses being recognized as cost in the statement of profit and loss. When the Company’s proportion on the accumulated losses of a subsidiary or associate exceeds its book value, the investment is stated by zero, except when the Company has assumed commitments to cover the losses of the subsidiary or associate, when the additional require the recognition of a liability. If these companies subsequently report profits, the Company only starts recognising its share of those profits after its share of the profits equals the losses not recognised. Unrealized gains on transactions with subsidiaries and associates are eliminated in proportion to the Company’s interest in them, by corresponding entry to the caption investment. Unrealized losses are also eliminated but only up to the point that such loss does not result in the transferred asset being impaired. 204 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS 3.3 Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes the purchase price of the assets, costs directly attributable to their acquisition and costs incurred to prepare the assets to start operating. Current repair and maintenance costs are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the period in which they are incurred. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated period of useful life, as from the date they are ready for use. The estimated periods of useful life of tangible fixed assets are as follows: Years Transport equipment From 4 to 6 years Administrative equipment From 3 to10 years The useful life of the assets are reviewed annually. Changes in useful lifes are treated as changes in accounting estimates and are applied prospectively. Gains and losses on the sale of assets are determined by the difference between the proceeds of the sale and the book value of the asset, these being recorded in the statement of profit and loss in the year of sale. 3.4 Leases Classifying a lease as finance or an operating lease depends upon the substance of transaction rather than the form of the lease arrangement. Leases, in which REN has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, are classified as finance leases. Agreements in which an analysis of one or more of the conditions of the contract point a finance lease are also classified as such. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Finance lease contracts are initially recognised at the lower of the fair value of the leased assets or the present value of the minimum lease payments, determined at the inception date. The lease liability is recognised net of interest costs in the caption Borrowings. Interest costs included in the lease payments and depreciation of the leased assets are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period they refer to. Tangible fixed assets acquired under finance lease contracts, are depreciated by the lower period between the useful life period of the asset and the maturity of the lease contract, when the company doesn`t have a purchase option on the maturity date, or by the useful life period estimated, when the Company has the commitment to acquire the asset by the end period of the contract. In operating lease contracts, the lease payments due are recognized as expenses in the statement of profit and loss, on a straight-line basis over the lease term. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 205 3.5 Financial assets and liabilities The Company chose to apply in full IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures, in accordance with paragraph 2 of the NCRF 27. The Board of Directors decides upon the classification of financial assets at the time of their initial recognition in accordance with the purpose of their acquisition. Financial assets p Financial assets may be classified into the following categories: i) Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss – include nonderivative financial assets acquired for short-term trading and assets designated at fair value through profit and loss at the inception date; ii) loans granted and receivables – include non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not listed in active market; iii) Investments to be held to maturity – include non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities, that the entity intends and has the capacity to hold until the maturity date; and iv) A vailable-for-sale financial assets – include non-derivative financial assets designated as available-for-sale at inception date or other financial assets not classified in any of the other financial asset categories. Availablefor-sale financial assets are recognized as non-current assets unless management intends to sell them within 12 months of the statement of financial position date. Purchases and sales of investments in financial assets are recognised on the transaction date – the date on which the Company commits itself to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the statement of profit and loss. Such assets are subsequently adjusted to fair value, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value being recognized in the statement of profit and loss caption net financial costs for the period in which they arise, which also includes interest income and dividends received. Loans and receivables are classified as “Trade and other receivables” in the statement of financial position, and are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment loss. An impairment loss of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original terms of the transactions that gave rise to the receivables. Financial assets held to maturity are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Available-for-sale financial assets are initially recognized at fair value including transaction costs. In subsequent periods these assets are adjusted to fair value, the changes in fair value being recognized in a fair value reserve within Equity. Dividends and interest income from available-for-sale financial assets are recognized in the statement of profit and loss caption other financial income for the period in which the right to receive them is established. The fair value of listed investments is based on current market prices (“bid”). If the market for a financial asset is not active, the Company establishes fair value through valuation techniques. These include the use of recent transactions, provided that they are at market prices, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis when information is 206 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS available, making maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity-specific inputs. In the situations where the investments are equity instruments not valued under active market quotations, and for which it is not possible to estimate with reliability its fair value, these investments are measured at the acquisition cost deducted of impairments losses, if any, being the impairment losses recorded in the profit and loss statement of the year. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments expire or are transferred, as well as all the risks and rewards of their ownership. Impairment of financial assets p Financial assets included in the category “at cost or amortized cost” are subject to impairment tests at each financial statement date. Such financial assets are impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more happenings that occur after their initial recognition, their estimated future cash flows are affected. Impairment losses to be recognised on financial assets measured at amortized cost corresponds to the difference between the book value of the asset and its present value as of the date of reporting the new estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. Impairment losses to be recognised on financial assets measured at cost correspond to the difference between the book value of the asset and the best estimate of the fair value of the asset as of the financial statement date. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss caption “Impairment losses” in the period they are determined. If subsequently the impairment loss decreases and such decrease can be objectively related to an occurrence that happened after recognition of the loss, this must be reversed to the statement of profit and loss. The reversal must be recognised up to the amount that would have been recognised (amortized cost) if the loss had not been initially recognised. The reversal of impairment losses is recognized in the statement of profit and loss caption “Reversal of impairment losses”. In the case of financial assets classified as “held for sale”, a significant and longstanding decrease of its fair value below the acquisition cost is considered an indicator that the financial asset is impaired. If evidence of impairment on the financial asset held for sale exists, the accumulated loss is determined by the difference between the acquisition cost and the actual fair value, less any impairment losses previously recorded is transferred from the fair value reserve in equity into profit and loss of the period. Impairment losses of equity instruments recorded in profit and loss are not reversible. Financial liabilities p A financial instrument is classified as a financial liability when the issuer has a contractual obligation to liquidate capital and/or interests, by the delivery of cash or other financial asset, independently on its legal form. IAS 39 establishes the classification of financial liabilities in two categories: i) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss; and ii) Other financial liabilities. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 207 Other financial liabilities include “Borrowings” and “Trade and other payables”. Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently adjusted to amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. Loans obtained are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction incremental costs incurred. The subsequent measurement of these loans are made at amortised cost, being the difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value recognised in the in profit and loss statement over the loan maturity, using the effective interest method. Financial liabilities are classified as current, except when the Company has an unconditional right to defer the payment of the correspondent liability for, at least, 12 months after the reporting date, being this liability, in these circumstances classified as non-current. Financial liabilities are derecognized when the related obligations are settled, cancelled or expire. 3.6 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments p Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. The method for recognizing gain and loss in fair value depends upon the designation made of the derivative financial instruments. If they are trading financial derivative instruments, gains and losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss captions financial costs or income. When they are designated as hedging derivative financial instruments, the recognition of gains and losses depends on the nature of the item hedged, it being a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. The fair value of derivative financial instruments corresponds to its market value. In the absence of market value, the fair value is determined by external independent entities, through valuation techniques accept in the market. Derivative financial instruments are recognized in the caption “Derivative financial instruments”, and if they have a positive or negative fair value they are recognized as financial assets or liabilities, respectively. A derivative financial instrument is recorded as non-current if its remaining period to maturity is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realized or settled within 12 months. Hedge accounting p In hedging its interest rate and exchange rate risk the Company contracts a series of derivative financial instruments, namely swaps. The criteria for applying hedge accounting rules are: Adequate documentation of the hedge; The risk to be covered is one of the risks described in IAS 39; and It is expected that the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, attributable to the risk covered, are virtually offset by changes in fair value of the hedging instrument. 208 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS At the inception of the hedge operation, the Company documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, its risk management objectives, strategy for managing the risk and its assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging instrument to offset variations in the fair value and cash flows of the item hedged. In the fair value hedge of an asset or liability, the book value of the asset or liability, determined based on the accounting policy used, is adjusted so as to reflect the variation of its fair value attributable to the risk hedged. Variations in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recognized in the statement of profit and loss together with variations in the fair value of the assets or liabilities hedged attributable to the risk hedged. In a hedging operation of the exposure to variations of great probability in future cash flows (cash flow hedge) the effective part of the fair value variation of the hedging instrument is recognized in hedging reserves, being transferred to the statement of profit and loss in the period the item hedged affects results. The ineffective part of the hedge is recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Company revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any amount recorded as “Other reserves – hedge reserves” is only reclassified to the statement of profit and loss when the hedged position affects results. When the hedged position relates to a future transaction which is not expected to occur, any amount recorded as “Other reserves – hedge reserves” is immediately reclassified to the statement of profit and loss. 3.7 Revenue Revenue includes the fair value of the income received or receivable from services rendered, net of tax and discounts, returns and other deductions. Revenue relating to services rendered refers to charges to subsidiaries corresponding to management costs. Revenue relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates is recognized in accordance with the equity method. Interest revenue is recognized in accordance with the effective interest method provided that it is probable that economic benefits flow to the company and they can be reliably measured. The revenue from dividends is recognised as gain in the year they are assigned to the shareholders. 3.8 Critical accounting judgments and main sources of uncertainties relating to estimates When preparing the accompanying financial statements, value judgments and estimates were made using assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the amounts recorded relating to gains and losses of the period. The estimates and underlying assumptions were determined with reference to the reporting date based on the best knowledge available as of the date of approval of the financial statements, of the events and transactions in process, as well as experience of past and/or current events. However, situations can occur in subsequent periods that were not predictable as of the date of approval of the financial statements and so were not considered in the estimates. Changes in the ANNUAL REPORT 2012 209 estimates that occur after the date of the financial statements will be corrected on a prospective basis. Therefore, given the degree of uncertainty, actual results of the transactions can differ from the corresponding estimates. Significant accounting estimates p 3.8.1 Provisions Provisions are recognised when REN SGPS has: i) a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; ii) it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and iii) the amount can be reliably estimated. When one of these criteria is not fulfilled or the existence of the liability is dependent upon a future event, REN SGPS discloses it as a contingent liability, except if the outflow of resources to settle it is considered to be remote. Provisions for restructuring expenses are recognised by the Company when there is a formal and detailed restructuring plan and that such plan has been communicated to the involved parties. In the measurement of the restructuring provision, only the expected outflows that directly result from the implementation of such plan are considered and the current activities of the Company are not considered. Provisions are measured at the present value of the estimated expenditure required to settle the liability using a pre-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the discount period and the risk of the provision. 3.8.2 Fair value The fair value of listed investments is based on current market prices (“bid”). If the market for a financial asset is not active, REN SGPS establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent transactions, provided that they are at market prices, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis when information is available, making maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity-specific inputs. 3.9 Income tax Income tax for the year recognized in the statement of profit and loss includes current income tax and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are recognized in the statement of profit and loss, except when deferred tax relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is also recognized in equity. Current tax payable is computed based on the Company’s taxable profit. Taxable profit differs from the accounting profit because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. Deferred tax refers to temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the amounts for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the temporary differences revert, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted on the date of the financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized, or 210 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS temporary taxable differences that revert in the same period as the deductible temporary differences. At the end of each reporting period a revision is made of the deductible temporary differences and they are adjusted based on the expectation of their future utilization. 3.10 Foreign currency transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated to Euro, the functional currency, using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the year-end exchange rates are recognized as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss if relating to borrowings and in other operating income and costs in the case of all the other balances/ transactions. 3.11 Accrual basis of accounting The Company records income and expenses on an accruals basis, under which income and expenses are recorded in the period to which they relate, independently of when they are received or paid. Differences between the amounts received and paid and the related income and expenses are recorded as assets or liabilities. 3.12 Distribution of dividends The distribution of dividends to shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period the dividends are approved by the shareholders and up to the time of their payment. 3.13 Capital and own shares Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares or options are shown net of tax, as a deduction in equity from the amount issued. Own shares acquired through contract or directly on the stock market are recognised as a deduction in equity. In accordance with the Portuguese Commercial Company Code REN SGPS must ensure at all times that there are reserves in Equity to cover the value of own shares, limiting the amount of reserves available for distribution. Own shares are recorded at cost if they are acquired in a spot transaction or at estimated fair value if acquired in a deferred purchase. 3.14 Cash and cash equivalents The caption cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, bank deposits, other short-term highly liquid investments with initial maturities of up to three months, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown in the current liabilities “Borrowings” caption on the statement of financial position, and are included in the statement of cash flows as cash and cash equivalents. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 211 The cash flow statement is prepared under the direct method, being presented the collections and payments in operational activities, investment activities and financing activities. The Company classifies interests and dividends received as investment activities and interests and dividends paid as financing activities. The cash flow statement is prepared under the direct method, being presented the collections and payments in operational activities, investment activities and financing activities. 3.15 Financial costs on borrowings Financial costs on borrowings are recognized as costs in the period they are incurred. 3.16 Financial risk management policies Financial risk factors p REN’s activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks: including credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk relating to interest rate and foreign exchange rate among others. REN has developed and implemented a risk management program that, together with permanent monitoring of the financial markets, seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the REN`s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by the financial management department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The financial management department identifies, assesses and realises operations to minimise the financial risks. The Board of Directors defines the principles for overall risk management and policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivatives and other non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. i) Exchange rate risk REN has limited exposure to foreign exchange rate risk. The risk of fluctuation of foreign exchange rates on the bonds totalling JPY 10,000 million, is fully hedged by a cross currency swap of the same notional amount. An adverse variation of 5% in the forward foreign exchange rate of Euro/JPY, all other factors remaining constant at 31st December 2012 and 2011, would have the following impact on equity: ’12 ’11 5% -5% 5% -5% EUR /JPY (1 126) 1 243 (1 960) 2 165 212 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS ii) Credit risk REN’s exposure to credit risk is not significant, since the services rendered invoiced to group companies. REN’s counterparty risk on bank deposits, financial applications, and contracting of derivative instruments is mitigated by the selection of top rate institutions with solid credit rating. iii) Liquidity risk REN’s liquidity risk management (except for REN Atlântico) is made by the central treasury management. All the liquidity excess and needs of each group company are transferred to REN SGPS, which manages the consolidated balances with financial institutions. In order to guarantee the current treasury needs of the Group and to have the necessary dynamic and flexible to fulfil the current liquidity needs, the Company, as at 31st December 2012, has credit lines contracted and not used in the amount of EUR 71,500 thousand and 9 commercial paper programmes, with subscription guarantee, in the amount of EUR 1,170,000 thousand, being available EUR 827,000 thousand and used as at 31st December 2012, EUR 343,000 thousand. The following table shows the Company liabilities by intervals to residual contracted maturity and includes derivative financial instruments the financial liquidation of the related flows of which is made at the net amount. The amounts shown in the table are non-discounted cash flows contracted including future interests; as so, do not correspond to its carrying amounts: 31 December 2012 Less than 1 year 1 5 years Over 5 years Total Borrowings: Bank borrowings 68 469 226 769 325 644 620 882 Bond issues 951 898 815 521 87 291 1 854 710 Commercial paper programmes 253 052 93 966 347 018 Others 145 338 483 1 273 564 1 136 594 412 935 2 823 093 Derivative financial instruments 9 151 22 752 31 903 Trade and others payables 79 745 31 December 2011 Less than 1 year 1 5 years Over 5 years Total Borrowings: Bank borrowings 51 445 266 464 394 286 712 195 Bond issues 62 940 312 973 508 057 883 970 Commercial paper programmes 26 886 566 268 593 154 Others 80 110 190 141 351 1 145 815 902 343 2 189 509 Derivative financial instruments 1 553 1 060 2 613 Trade and others payables 151 080 ANNUAL REPORT 2012 213 The following table shows the derivative financial instruments, financial settlement of which is made at gross amounts: 31 December 2012 Less than 1 year 1 5 years Over 5 years Total Hedging derivative financial instruments Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap Outflows (4 169) (16 686) (87 359) (108 214) Inflows 2 385 9 541 103 525 115 452 (1 783) (7 144) 16 166 7 238 31 December 2011 Less than 1 year 1 5 years Over 5 years Total Hedging derivative financial instruments Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap Outflows (4 180) (16 686) (96 327) (117 193) Inflows 2 705 10 818 120 085 133 608 (1 475) (5 868) 23 758 16 415 iv) Interest rate risk The Company presents exposure to interest rates risk mainly on the loans and borrowings obtained. Borrowings at variable interest rates expose REN to cash flow risk resulting from changes in interest rates. Borrowing at fixed rates exposes the REN Group to fair value risk, as a result of changes in interest rates. Risk management is performed centrally aiming to avoid volatility in financial costs, using simple derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps. In this kind of operation REN exchanges with banking counterparties in specific dates and with defined maturities, the difference between the fixed interest rates and the variable rates with reference to the notional amounts covered. All operations undertaken with this end can, mostly, be considered perfect interest rate hedging operations. A sensitivity analysis was made based on REN`s total debt less applications in funds and cash and cash equivalents as at 31st December 2012 and 2011, using the following assumptions: C  hanges in market interest rates affecting interest income and costs of variable financial instruments;  hanges in market interest rates affecting only results or equity in relation C to fixed interest rate financial instruments if they are recognized at fair value;  hanges in market interest rates affecting the fair value of derivative C financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities; and  hanges in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and other C financial assets and liabilities are estimated discounting future cash flows, using market rates at the year end. 214 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS Using these assumptions, a 0.25% increase in the market interest rates for all the currencies in which the Group has borrowings or derivative financial instruments at 31st December 2012, would result in a decrease of profit before tax of, approximately, EUR 1,880 thousand (EUR 1,952 thousand in 2011) and an increase in equity of, approximately, around EUR 1,778 thousand (decrease of EUR 125 thousand in 2011). The sensivity analysis is merely projected, and do not represent any present real gain or loss, neither other real variations in the net results nor in equity. v) Price risk REN’s exposure to price risk results essentially from its investment in REE and Enagás. A negative variation of 10% in the shares price of REE and Enagás as at 31st December 2012 would have an impact on equity of EUR 8,904 thousand in equity (EUR 7,922 thousand in 2011). 3.17 Subsequent events Events that occur after the statement of financial position date that provide additional information on conditions that existed at the date of the statement of financial position (“adjusting events” or events after the statement of financial position date that lead to adjustments) are recognized in the financial statements. Events that occur after the statement of financial position date that provide information on conditions that exist after that date (“non-adjusting events” or events after the statement of financial position date that do not lead to adjustments) is disclosed in the notes to the separate financial statements, if material. 4 For the purpose of the statement of cash flow, cash and cash equivalents includes cash, bank deposits readily available (with terms not exceeding three CASH FLOW months) and treasury securities in the monetary market, net of bank overdrafts and other short-term financing equivalents. The caption cash and cash equivalents as at 31st December 2012 and 2011 is made as follows: ’12 ’11 Bank deposits repayable on demand 1 629 1 366 Tresury applications 53 300 58 800 54 929 60 166 The cash flow statement as at 31st December 2012 includes in the caption “Other receipts / (payments) relating to operating activities” the payment of EUR 27,837 thousand made in January 2012 related with the Amorim process (Note 14).

Supplementary capital contributions of EUR 4,545 thousand were also sold in the transaction. This sale generated a profit in 2011 in the amount of EUR 5,163 thousand (Note 19). The investment in the subsidiary REN Atlântico, includes a goodwill in the amount of 3,744 thousand Euros. The “Goodwill” represents the difference between the amount paid on the acquisition of the participation in subsidiaries and the fair value of the equity of REN Atlântico, S.A. under the natural gas business unbundling process. Ats at 31st December 2012 and 2011 goodwill included in the caption “Investments Equity method” was made up as follows: Interest held Date of Acquisition Entity acquisition cost % Amount ’12 ’11 REN Atlântico, Terminal de GNL, S.A. 2006 32 580 100% 28 806 3 774 3 774 ANNUAL REPORT 2012 219 Goodwill impairment test p REN made an impairment test of goodwill on 31st December 2012 and 2011 in terms of the cash generating unit to which REN Atlântico belongs. The business of REN Atlântico is subject to a concession contract and regulated tariffs so that the recoverable amount was determined based on value-in-use calculations. The cash flow projections considered the expected regulatory terms in place for the remaining term of the concession (concession for a period of 40 years beginning on 26th September 2006), which cash inflows correspond to the regulated remuneration obtained over the net book value of the corresponding regulated assets which will have a negative trend in the projections after the period ended 2014, and until the Concession maturity period. The cash flow was discounted considering the actual regulatory remuneration rate, applied over the net book value of the underlying investments, of 8% (posttax discount rate of 5.68%, 4.99% in 2011). Assumptions Cash generating unit Method Cash flows Growing factor Discount rate Operating cash flows The rate decrease REN Atlântico, DFC (Discounted projected over according of average 8% (pre-tax) Terminal de GNL, S.A. Cash Flow) the remaining rate of assets 5.68% (after tax) concession period depreciation 8 In accordance with the assumptions used no impairment losses were noted in the caption “Goodwill” INCOME TAX The Group made sensivity analysis considering a variation of 10% on the discount rate of the remunerations of the assets and no impairments were noted. The companies belonging to the REN group are taxed based on the special regime for the taxation of group of companies (“RETGS”). Consequently, estimated income tax, tax amounts withheld by third parties and corporate income tax paid in advance are recorded in the statement of financial position as accounts payable to and receivable from REN SGPS. In accordance with current legislation, tax returns are subject to review and correction by the tax authorities for a period of four years (five years for social security), except when there are tax losses, tax benefits granted or tax inspections, claims or contestations in progress, in which case the period can be extended or suspended, depending on the circumstances. Consequently, the Company’s tax returns for the years from 2009 to 2012 are still subject to review. During 2012, following the change performed in the tax legislation made in December 2011, by Law 64-B/2011, the Company is taxed in Corporate Income Tax rate of 25%, increased by: (1) Municipal surcharge up the maximum of 1.5% over the taxable profit; and (2) a State surcharge of an additional 3% of taxable profit between EUR 1,500 thousand and EUR 10,000 thousand and an additional 5% over the taxable profit in excess of EUR 10,000 thousand, which results in a maximum aggregate CIT tax rate of 31.5%. 220 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS The deferred taxes, as at 31st December 2012, were updated considering the new rates established under the Law n. 66-B/2012 of 31st December, which imply the application of a State surcharge of an additional 3% of taxable profit between EUR 1,500 thousand and EUR 7,500 thousand and an additional 5% over the taxable profit in excess of EUR 7,500 thousand. The referred taxes are applicable in the period started on 1st January 2013. Consequently, the tax rate used in the valuation of temporary taxable and deductible differences as at 31st December 2012, were calculated using the average tax rate expected in accordance with future perspective of taxable profits of the Company recoverable in the next periods.

This is the hedging of the interest rate risk on payments of interest at variable rates on recognized financial liabilities.

Identification of the Members of the Board of the General Meeting, Start and Finish Date of the Respective Terms GENERAL of Office and Suitability of Resources MEETING The following members of the Board of the General Meeting were elected for the term of office 2012-2014: Term of Date of 1st office in 2 Name Age Position appointment course Pedro Canastra de Azevedo Maia 46 Chairman 27.03.2012 2012-2014 Duarte Vieira Pestana de Vasconcelos 55 Vice-Chairman 24.10.2008 2012-2014 The annual General Meeting of 27th March 2012 resolved on ending the three-year 2010-2012 term of office3. 2012 was determined as the reference point for the start of following terms of office (2012-2014). In the performance of his duties, the Chairman of the Board of the General Meeting has the support of the Vice-Chairman of the Board, as well as of the Company Secretary, Pedro Cabral Nunes, within their legal powers. The Board of the General Meeting has at its disposal the human and logistic resources which are appropriate to its needs, taking into account the Company’s economic situation, and may benefit for such purpose from the support of the Company Secretary, the in-house legal office and from an external law firm, as well as the technical and voting counting services made available by a financial institution. I.3. Remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of the General Meeting In 2012, the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the Board of the General Meeting were paid €2 000 and €1 500 respectively, for undertaking the respective functions, as attendance fees. I.4. Indication of the Notice Period required to Block Shares to Attend the General Meeting Blocking of shares is not required. Therefore, shareholders may attend REN’s General Meetings if on the Record Date, corresponding to 00.00 hours (GMT) of the fifth day of negotiation prior to the holding of the meeting (“Record Date”), they are holders of shares entitling them to at least one vote 4. Such right of attendance and voting in the General Meeting is not prejudiced by the transfer of the shares after the Record Date nor depends on its blocking between such date and the date of the General Meeting. 2 At 31st December 2012. 3 Up to 27th March 2012, the position of Chairman of the Board of the General Meeting was undertaken by Mr. Agostinho Pereira de Miranda, who was appointed on 15th March 2010, for the 2010-2012 term of office. 4 Cf. Article 12(7) of the Articles of Association. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 261 I.5. Indication of the Rules applicable to the Blocking of Shares in the event that the General Meeting is suspended As described in I.4. above, the right of attendance and vote in the General Meeting is not dependent on the blocking of shares between the Record Date and the date of the General Meeting. I.6. Number of Shares corresponding to one Vote Following recommendations and best practices on shareholder participation in the general meetings of companies with shares admitted to trading in a regulated market, REN’s Articles of Association lay down the principle of “one share one vote” 5. I.7. Restrictions on the Exercising of the Right to Vote or Counting of Votes According to legislation, no entity, including entities which conduct business in the respective sector in Portugal or abroad, can have direct or indirect holdings greater than 25% of REN equity capital6. These limitations on the ownership of REN shares were introduced further to the transposition of community directives applicable to the electricity and natural gas sectors with regard to the legal and ownership separation between the transmission operator using those assets and the operators who conduct other activities in each of the sectors. The aim of these directives is to promote competition in the market and equal access by operators to the transmission infrastructures. Given the applicable legal regime, article 12 of the Articles of Association was amended at the annual General Meeting of 27th March 2012, so as to stipulate that the votes attached to class A shares shall not be counted if issued by any shareholder, on his behalf or as representative of another shareholder, which exceed 25% of the total votes corresponding to REN’S share capital. Considered for the purpose are the rights to vote inherent to Class A shares which, pursuant to Article 20(1) of the Securities Code, are attributable to it. This is the only provision in the REN Articles of Association that establishes that voting rights will not be counted above a certain number. I.8. Rules of the Articles of Association on the Exercising of Voting Rights, Quorum in General Meetings and emphasis of rights Owners of one or more shares on the Record Date may attend, participate in and vote at the REN General Meeting, as long as they comply with the following requirements: a) S hareholders wishing to participate in the General Meeting should express this intention in writing to the Chairman of the Board of the General Meeting and the financial intermediary, with whom they have opened the relevant individual securities account, up to the day before the Record Date.

REN’s Articles of Association do not provide for any system of detachment of rights with economic content. I.9. Existence of Rules in Articles of Association on the Exercising of Voting Rights by Correspondence REN’s shareholders may submit their votes by correspondence for each item on the agenda, by letter signed with the same signature as on their identification document, enclosing a legible photocopy of such document, if the shares are held by an individual shareholder, or duly notarized signature of the proxy, in the event that the shares are held by a legal person11.

It is also established that these votes are considered to be votes against, in the case of resolution proposals submitted after the date on which they were cast. I.10. Availability of Model for the Exercising of Voting Rights by Correspondence In order to facilitate votes by correspondence, REN provides a voting ballot on its website13 which may be used for such purpose, and upon request, may also send a voting ballot and an envelope to shareholders for the purpose of postal submission. 9 Cf.

Extracts of General Meetings Minutes Extracts General Meetings Minutes are published on the REN website www.ren.pt a maximum of five days after they have been held. I.14. Historical Acquis of General Meetings REN maintains a historic record on its website of points of order and resolutions adopted at General Meetings, as well as information on the represented share capital and voting results, for a minimum period of 3 years. I.15. Indication of the Representative(s) of the Remunerations Committee present at General Meetings At the Annual General Meeting of 2012 held on 27th March 2012, the Chairman of the Remunerations Committee, José Castel-Branco was present as representative of that committee. I.16. Intervention of the General Meeting with regard to the Remunerations and Assessment Policy in effect at the Company The REN General Meeting is responsible for the appointment of the members of the Remuneration Committee15, which is responsible for setting the remuneration and for submitting the annual declaration on the remuneration policy for members of the managing and supervisory bodies16. Moreover, this declaration will be subject to independent assessment and deliberation by the shareholders of the Annual General Meeting. The abovementioned declaration on the remuneration policy covers all company officers (within the meaning of the provision of Article 248-B(3) of the Securities Code, given that the REN Board of Directors understands that those officers correspond only to the members of the company’s Management and Supervisory Bodies. It should also be noted that, under the terms of the Portuguese Companies Code (“CSC”)17, the General Meeting has also the duty to make, on an annual basis, a general evaluation of the performance of the managing and supervisory bodies. 14 Cf. Article 12(5) of Articles of Association. 15 Cf. Article 8(2)(d) of the Articles of Association. 16 Cf. Article 26 of the Articles of Association. 17 Cf. Article 455. 264 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE I.17. and I.18. Intervention of the General Meeting in the Approval of Plans to Allocate Shares and/or Options to Purchase Shares, and in the Retirement Benefit System for members of the Management and Supervisory Bodies / Directors There are no programs or variable remuneration plans that consist of the allocation of shares, options to purchase shares or other incentive systems based on a variation of the price of shares for members of the management or supervisory bodies (or persons discharging managerial functions, within the meaning of Article 248-B(3) of the Portuguese Securities Code). Furthermore, there is no system of retirement benefits for the members of the management or supervisory bodies (or persons discharging managerial functions, within the meaning of Article 248-B(3) of the Portuguese Securities Code). I.19. Existence of Rule in Articles of Association which subjects the General Meeting every five years, to possible Limitation of Number of Votes Eligible to be Held or Exercised by a Single Shareholder Further to that mentioned in I.7. above, the obligation to submit the maintenance or elimination of such provisions of the Articles of Association to the General Meeting, at least once every 5 years, is not provided, as such provision, on one hand, of the Articles of Association arises out of a legal obligation and, on the other, does not intend to prevent the exercise of voting rights, but rather ensure the existence of a penalty system for breaching the legal limit on ownership of shares. I.20. Defensive Measures which cause Erosion to Company Assets REN has not adopted any measures aimed at preventing the success of takeover bids and/ or any defensive measures which result in a serious, automatic erosion of the Company’s assets in the event of change of control or a change in the composition of the management body. As mentioned in I.7. above, limitations on Class A share ownership which represent REN equity capital and the exercising of the respective voting rights, pursuant to Article 12 of the Articles of Association, were introduced only with a view to accommodating the legal limitations imposed by regulatory laws for the sectors of activity in which REN subsidiaries operate. I.21.Significant Agreements with Clauses for Change in Control There are no significant agreements to which REN is a party that would come into force, be amended or terminate in the event of a change in control over the Company. I.22. Agreements with the Management or Other Officers which stipulate Compensation in the event of Resignation, Unfair Dismissal or Termination of the Employment Relationship, Following a Change in Control There are no significant agreements between REN and the members of the management body or other officers (pursuant to Article 248-B(3) of the Portuguese Securities Code) that would award compensation in the event of resignation or dismissal of any member of the management and supervisory bodies, or in the event of resignation of any employee, unfair dismissal or termination of the employment relationship, following a change in control over the Company. In accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the Remuneration Committee with regard to the financial year of 2012, in the event of termination of functions of management through agreement or unfair dismissal, no compensation will be paid if the termination or dismissal is due to the unsuitable performance of the director. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 265 6.2 SECTION I – GENERAL p MANAGEMENT II.1. Corporate bodies AND SUPERVISORY REN has adopted a an Anglo-Saxon corporate governance model consisting of the following corporate bodies elected by the General Meeting18: (i) a Board of Directors, BODIES responsible for the management of the Company’s business – which delegates the day-to-day management of the Company to the Executive Committee19, and (ii) an Audit Committee and the Statutory Auditor, as supervision bodies. The Audit Committee consists exclusively of non-executive directors20. GENERAL MEETING REMUNERATIONS COMMITTEE AUDIT BOARD OF STATUTORY COMMITTEE DIRECTORS AUDITOR COMPANY SECRETARY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE The Board of Directors evaluates the model of governance adopted by the Company positively, and does not identify any constraint to its functioning, particularly with regard to the following aspects: a) A t the management level, there is a clear delimitation between the powers of the Board of Directors and those of the Executive Committee, due to the meticulous and objective delegation of powers by the Board of Directors on 27th March, 2012, as mentioned in II.3.1. above. b) Furthermore, the fact that the Chairman of the Board of Directors is also the Chief Executive Officer ensures the coherence and transparency that is essential to the Company’s management and its adequate monitoring by the remaining members of the management body. c) In terms of supervision, the Audit Committee supervises and oversees the Company’s management in an independent and autonomous manner. The dual capacity of its members, as members of both the supervisory body and the management body, renders the control process even more transparent, notably due to the special access afforded to the members of the Audit Committee to information and decision-making processes. d) T  his model has contributed to more efficient management and supervision of company business in accordance with principles of transparency and accountability to shareholders, investors and the market. 18 Cf. Article 8(2)(d) of the Articles of Association. 19 Cf. Article 8(1) of the Executive Committee Regulations. 20 Cf. Article 3(3) of the Executive Committee Regulations. 266 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE II.1.1. The Board of Directors The Board of Directors consists of a minimum of 7 and maximum of 15 members, as determined by the General Meeting that elects said members21. The Board of Directors currently has 15 members including a total of 12 non-executive members, which ensures its effective capacity to monitor and evaluate the activity of the executive members. At 31st December 2012 and on this date, the REN Board of Directors consisted of the following members, who have been appointed for the 2012-2014 term of office: Name Age Position Chairman of the Board of Directors Rui Manuel Janes Cartaxo 60 and the Executive Committee Director and Member Gonçalo Morais Soares 41 of the Executive Committee Director and Member João Caetano Carreira Faria Conceição 38 of the Executive Committee Guangchao Zhu (representing State Grid 45 Vice-Chairman International Development Limited) 22 Hilal Ali Saif Al-Kharusi 23 46 Director Aníbal Durães dos Santos (appointed by 64 Director Parpública Participações Públicas (SGPS), S.A.)

(“EGF”) to hold position in his own name, resigned on 14 June 2012. Subsequently, EGF informed REN on 15th June 2012 of its decision to appoint Filipe Maurício de Botton as a member of the REN Board of Directors to hold position in his own name. 25 José Félix Morgado, appointed by Gestmin, SGPS, S.A. (“GESTMIN”) to hold position in his own name, resigned on 03rd July 2012. Subsequently, GESTMIN informed REN on 17th July 2012 of its decision to appoint Manuel Champalimaud as a member of the REN Board of Directors to hold position in his own name. 26 The Board of Directors deliberated to co-opt José Luis Arnaut for the position of non-executive director, on 22nd June 2012, as a result of the resignation of Luís Palha da Silva, on 22nd May 2012, who did not accept the position, and as such did not take up responsibilities. 27 Took up this position on 25th May 2012. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 267 II.1.2. Executive Committee At 31st December 2012 and on this date, the Executive Committee consisted of the following three members: Name Position Chairman of the Board of Rui Manuel Janes Cartaxo Directors and the Executive Committee Gonçalo Morais Soares Member João Caetano Carreira Faria Conceição Member II.1.3. Audit Committee At 3 1st December 2012 and on this date, the Audit Committee consisted of the following three members: Name Position José Luís Alvim Marinho Chairman José Frederico Vieira Jordão Member Emílio Rui Vilar Member II.1.4. Statutory Auditor The office of permanent Statutory Auditor of the Company is carried out by the chartered accountants Deloitte & Associados, SROC, S.A., registered with the Board of Chartered Accountants under No. 43 and registered at CMVM under number 231, represented by Jorge Carlos Batalha Duarte Catulo (C.A. No. 992). The substitute Statutory Auditor of the Company is Carlos Luís Oliveira de Melo Loureiro, a Chartered Accountant registered with the Board of Chartered Accountants under No. 572. II.2. Specialist Committees with Competences in Management and Supervision The REN Board of Directors does not see as suitable to its specificities nor necessary, the “formal setting up” of specialist committees with Competences in supervision, particularly with regard to: (i) the composition of the management body, with only three executive members in a total of fifteen members; (ii) the model of corporate governance implemented, integrating an Audit Committee within the Board of Directors composed exclusively by independent members; and (iii) the company’s shareholder structure, with the presence of several shareholders with knowledge of the sector and with the vocation of strategic partners. Furthermore, it has been our position that the setting up of specialist committees is not justified, bearing in mind the supervisory activity carried out by the Audit Committee and the non-executive members of the Board of Directors. 268 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE In 2012, the Non-Executive Directors monitored issues relating to: (i) the model and principles of Company governance; (ii) the assessment of the overall performance of the Board of Directors and the analyzis of the appropriate profile to perform the functions of a REN director; as well as (iii) the assessment of the performance of the Executive Directors. Indeed, the assessment of the performance of the Executive Committee members is made by the Non-Executive Directors, in order to create an adequate internal balance and an effective performance of non-executive tasks by all members of the Board of Directors and not just by a number of directors. Likewise, Non-Executive Directors monitor the global performance of the Board of Directors and analyze the functioning of the corporate governance system. Within its responsibilities, the Remuneration Committee has also actively participated in performance assessment, particularly for purposes of setting the variable remuneration of executive directors. Moreover, REN understands that the establishment of a specialized committee with powers regarding the identification of candidates with adequate profile for the office of director does not fit with the Company’s specific characteristics, since the process of selection has been appropriately carried out, whether through election at General Meetings, or in the event of co-option by a resolution of the Board of Directors. As mentioned in II.16. above, as part of the selection process, the company shareholders – with ample knowledge of the sector – have played a vital role in identifying candidates. Moreover, during 2012, the process to select the members of REN’s Corporate Bodies was further influenced by the fact that, up to March and aware of its nature as a public company, was subject to state company regulations and also the second stage of privatization took place with the transfer of 40% of capital to two new shareholders. Therefore, although they are not “formal committees” of the Board of Directors for the purpose, the company considers that, substantially, the content of CMVM Recommendation II.5.1 – which is of the greatest importance to ensure the transparency and accountability of management with regard to the company’s shareholders – has been duly followed by REN. However, bearing in mind the position taken by the CMVM in their annual reports on quoted company governance for 2010 and 2011, the company declares, for the purposes of this report, that it does not comply with this recommendation. II.3. Sharing of Competences between Corporate Bodies, Committees and/or Departments II.3.1. Delegation of the Board of Directors on its Executive Committee On 27th March 2012, the Board of Directors delegated powers of day-to-day management of the Company to the Executive Committee, which include the following powers, to be exercised under the terms and within the limits stipulated every year in the operating budget and in the strategic plan submitted by the Executive Committee and approved by Board of Directors: a) T  o manage normal company business and conduct all matters covered by the company’s object which are not the exclusive competence of the Board of Directors; b) T o approve the disposal of assets and the investment to be made by the company and its subsidiaries, which individual or aggregate value is equal or lower than EUR 15 000 000.00 or which have already been approved within the Company’s annual budget and the corresponding value is equal to or lower than, individually or in aggregate,EUR 25 000 000; c) T  o constitute companies and acquire, pledge and dispose of holdings when it relates to companies which are a vehicle to realize specific investments with a value of not more than EUR 7 500 000 or which are already approved in the annual budget; ANNUAL REPORT 2012 269 d) T  o indicate the people to appoint to the corporate bodies of the two operators of the transmission networks and the investment vehicle companies referred to in the previous point; e) T  o implement the Company’s functional and administrative organization, its internal rules, including those governing human resources and their remuneration, as well as its internal control systems and procedures; f) T  o prepare and implement the annual budget, the business plan and medium and long-term development plans; g) T  o negotiate, sign, amend and terminate any agreements, of a sum equal to or less than €5 000 000 and short-term financing contracts (i.e. with maturity equal to or less than three years); h) To lease or let any property or parts thereof; i) T  o coordinate the activity of the companies in a control relationship with REN, being also allowed, with regard to the companies in relationships of total control, to issue binding instructions, under the terms legally permitted; j) D  eliberate to provide technical or financial support to subsidiary companies; k) R  epresent the Company actively and passively, in and out of court, by proposing and pursuing lawsuits or arbitrations, with the power to confess, to waiver and to settle, as well as to enter into arbitration agreements; l) Open, use and close bank accounts; m) Appoint attorneys with the powers deemed convenient.

The Audit Committee is the Company’s main discussion partner and the first recipient of reports from the Statutory Auditors and external auditor, representing it in relation to the Statutory Auditors and seeking to ensure that, within the company, suitable conditions are provided for them to carry out their work. The Audit Committee is responsible for regularly monitoring the activities of the external auditors and of the Statutory Auditor by analyzing their periodic reports and overseeing the audit and review processes. It also assesses any changes in procedures recommended by the external auditors or the Statutory Auditor33. Accordingly, the Audit Committee is responsible for undertaking an annual assessment of the external auditor and has the power to propose the dismissal of the external auditor to the General Meeting if there are grounds to do so. Taking into account the work carried out in 2012, the Audit Committee carried out 32 Cf. Article 6 of the Audit Committee Regulations. 33 Article 6(3)(j) of the Audit Committee Regulations. 274 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE its evaluation of the service provided to the Company by the external auditors. Consequently, the Audit Committee considers that the external auditors have provided their services in a positive way and have complied with the applicable standards and regulations, including international standards on auditing, and that they performed their activities with extreme technical accuracy. The Statutory Auditor34 is responsible for the examination and verification required for the review and legal certification of the financial statements. He is also responsible for verifying the correctness of books, accounting records and documents used as support, the accuracy of documents providing accounting information and if the accounting policies and valuation criteria adopted by REN lead to a correct evaluation of its property and results. Within its scope of powers as an external auditor, the Statutory Auditor verifies the implementation of the remuneration policies and systems, the effectiveness and functioning of the internal control mechanisms and is obliged to report any deficiencies to the Company’s Audit Committee. The Statutory Auditor also verifies the Corporate Governance Report, under the legally applicable terms. II.3.7. The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for presenting and submitting to the shareholders the principles of the remuneration policy of the corporate bodies, as well as for determining the respective remunerations35. At 31st December 2012 and on this date, the following three members, appointed at the annual General Meeting of 27th March 2012, were on the Remunerations Committee (three-year period of 2012-2014)36: NAME POSITION Carlos Adolfo Coelho Figueiredo Chairman Rodrigues Rui Horta e Costa Member Pedro de Sommer de Carvalho Member The current Remuneration Committee is comprised by members who are independent from the management. To such extent, the Remunerations Committee does not include any member of another corporate body for which it determines the respective remuneration, and its three members in office do not have any family relationship with members of such other bodies, notably spouses, relatives and kin, in a direct line, up to the 3rd degree, inclusive. 34 Cf. Article 420. 35 Cf. Article 2.6 of the Articles of Association. 36 Up to 27th March 2012, the following members were on the Remuneration Committee: José Emílio Castel-Branco, Francisco Manuel Marques Bandeira and José Alexandre de Oliveira (appointed for the 2010-2012 term of office). ANNUAL REPORT 2012 275 The members of the Remuneration Committee have relevant knowledge and experience concerning remuneration policies (cf. II.38. of CMVM Regulations No. 1/2010). During the performance of its duties, the Remunerations Committee received advice from specialized entities on remuneration matters, which do not provide or have provided, over the past three years, services to the REN Board of Directors or to any structure in its dependence (under employment or service agreements) and have no current relationship with a consultant of the Company (cf. II.39. of CMVM Regulations No. 1/2010). The Remuneration Committee held six meetings in 2012. For each meeting of the Remuneration Committee minutes were drawn up. II.4. Annual Report on the Activity of the Audit Committee The Audit Committee draws up an annual report on its supervisory activities (including references to any detected constraints), further submitting an opinion on the management report of the Board of Directors, the financial statements, as well as on the Corporate Governance Report, which are available together with the accounting documents on the REN website (www.ren.pt). II.5. and II.6. Risk Management and Internal Control Systems and Respective Responsibility of the Management and Supervisory Bodies The management and supervisory bodies of the Company have attributed growing importance to the development and improvement of the internal control and risk management systems, with a significant impact on the activities of the Group’s companies. This approach has been in line with national and international recommendations, including CMVM’s recommendations and the good governance principles contained in the Council of Ministers Resolution No. 49/2007 of 28th March. The Executive Committee and, ultimately, the Board of Directors, are responsible for creating and managing the internal control and risk management systems. Therefore, on 8th November the REN Board of Directors approved the review of the regulations on “Appreciation and Control of Transactions with Related Parties and Prevention of Conflicts of Interests” and “Procedures Applicable to the Processing of Whistleblowing Communications and the Inspection of Irregularities”. The Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Executive Committee in analyzing the integrity and efficiency of REN’s Internal Control and Risk Management Systems37. Furthermore, in its plan of activities for the financial year of 2012, the Audit Committee considered carrying out a number of steps to monitor and evaluate the functioning and adequacy of the internal control and risk management systems. It is considered that a risk management and internal control system – as implemented by REN – should meet the following objectives:  uarantee and supervise compliance with the objectives previously set G by the Board of Directors; Identify the risk factors, the consequences of the occurrence of risk and the mechanisms for dealing with and minimizing risk; Align admissible risk with Group strategy; 37 Article 6(3)(d) of the Audit Committee Regulations. 276 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Ensure that information is reliable and complete;  nsure the complete, reliable and timely preparation and reporting E of financial and accounting information, and apply an appropriate management information system; Guarantee the safeguarding of assets; Ensure prudent, appropriate valuation of assets and liabilities; Improve the quality of decisions; Promote the rational and efficient use of resources. During the 2009 financial year, on 13th May 2009, the Executive Committee passed a resolution to set up the Internal Audit Department (IAD), with the mission of supervising the creation, operation and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management control model and internal control and governance systems, through objective, independent and systematic monitoring. In operational terms, it reports to the Audit Committee, notwithstanding its hierarchical relationship with the executive management of the Company. The officer in charge of the Internal Audit Department is Gil Vicente Jorge Marcelino. Of note, among the various tasks of the Internal Audit Department are the following: Review of risk management and internal control policies in force; A  ssessment of the degree of implementation of internal control (organizational structure and governance, delegation of powers, ethics and conduct code, policies and procedures); Implementation of financial, IT, operational and management audits in the various areas of the REN Group, confirming compliance with the policies, laws and regulations (compliance services);  efinition, jointly with the various areas, of measures to correct any D weaknesses and non-compliances identified during the audits; M  onitoring the implementation of corrective measures, through follow-up reports; S  upport for high-level management in defining and/or implementing control and governance measures. All internal audits conducted by the IAD follow a plan based on risk assessment, whether corporate or by the IAD itself, the latter including an assessment of how risks are managed in terms of processes, systems and business units. The IAD’s Business Plan for 2012, approved by the Audit Committee, has defined and characterized the audits to be carried out. The Business Plan was designed to: Focus on the audits in areas of greatest risk; Assess the efficiency of the internal control systems implemented; Cover all REN Group companies; Add value to the REN Group. In implementing the various audits, particular attention was paid to the assessment of internal control systems, to compliance with established procedures, to the efficient use of resources, to the effective monitoring of processes and to the assessment and minimization of identified risks. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 277 In 2013, the audit procedures will be maintained and as far as the IAD’s future plan of activities is concerned, we highlight the following objectives: FOCUS THE AUDITS ON POSITION THE ALIGN THE INTERNAL APPLY RESOURCES TO PROCESSES/ACTIVITIES COVER ALL COMPANIES INTERNAL AUDIT AS AUDIT WITH THE THE AREAS OF GREAT WHICH ARE OF OF THE GROUP A FUNCTION CAPABLE GROUP’S STRATEGY RISK GREATEST IMPORTANCE OF ADDING VALUE TWith the main concern being the monitoring of the main aspects of REN’s activity, and in order to ensure the procedures followed are in compliance, an assessment of the main Internal Control Systems in the Group’s various companies is conducted regularly, with the following underlying principles:  trengthening and improving effectiveness and efficiency in the use S of resources; Safeguarding assets; Analyzing the information processing system;  hecking of the reliability and accuracy of financial, accounting and C other kinds of information; Preventing and detecting fraud and errors;  hecking for compliance of the Group’s operations and business with C applicable legal and regulatory provisions, as well as with general policies and Company regulations; Promoting operational effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, the mission of the Risk Management Committee, created in 2010, is to support the Board of Directors in monitoring the Group’s risks, as well as ensuring the enforcement of risk management policies common to the entire Group and the internal disclosure of best practices for Risk Management. The Risk Management Committee’s main functions are to: P  romote the identification and systematic evaluation of business risks and their impact on REN’s strategic objectives;  ategorize and prioritize the risks to be addressed, as well as the C opportunities identified; Identify and define the persons responsible for risk management; Monitor significant risks and REN’s risk profile; Approve regular risk reporting mechanisms by different businesses areas. A  pprove, or submit to the Executive Committee, recommendations for prevention, mitigation, sharing or transfer of material risks. In 2012, the Risk Management Committee conducted its activity, continuing to support the Board of Directors in monitoring the Group’s risks, as well as ensuring the enforcement of risk management policies common to the entire Group and the internal disclosure of best practices for Risk Management. Risk Management Procedure REN has implemented a series of changes to its internal control and risk management systems, involving the components provided for in CMVM Recommendation II.1.1.2. It has also been guided by the norms of the International Organization for Standardization (IOS). In 2012, the company set out to design, develop and apply a homogeneous and integrated corporate risk management strategy across the entire organization, aligned and structured in accordance with the specific priorities and features of each of the company’s areas. 278 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Therefore, within the scope of the Group risk management system, the following activities were undertaken: Review and updating of risk models and the respective processing files; Review and updating of the list of greatest risks; Definition of the action plan to mitigate the greatest risks; Definition of the Key Risk Indicators (KRI); Development and entry into operation of the do Risk Management Portal. The goal of the risk management process is to contribute directly towards improving REN’s performance and complying with CMVM recommendations. Other Initiatives within the scope of Risk Management In 2012, through the ISO and the Sustainability Department, REN participated in the Project “GestãoTransparente Org – Practical Guide for the Corruption Risk Management in Organizations”. The public presentation of this project took place on 10th December. The main objectives of this project consist of developing a joint initiative to prevent corruption and promote transparency, promoting the sharing of values of integrity, transparency and responsibility, identifying and characterizing the main organizational instruments to prevention risks of corruption, developing a practical management instrument to support organizations, particularly in Corruption Risk Management, in a style of language accessible to companies and the general public. II.7. Working Regulations of Management Bodies The Board of Directors Regulations, Audit Committee Regulations and the Executive Committee Regulations are available on the REN website38 in Portuguese and English. There are no internal rules on incompatibilities nor on the maximum number of positions which can be accumulated, beyond those referred to in II.15. above. Section II – The Board of Directors p II.8. Coordination Mechanisms for Work of Non-Executive Members According to the Board of Directors Internal Regulations, this corporate body established efficient mechanisms for the coordination of the work of its members having non-executive functions, in particular in order to facilitate the exercise of their right to information, as follows39: a) W ithout prejudice to the exercising of powers not delegated to the Executive Committee, Company directors having a non-executive function assume a supervisory role of executive management; 38 www.ren.pt. 39 Cf. Article 11 of the Board of Directors Regulations. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 279 b) In order to make independent and informed decisions, the directors with non-executive functions may obtain the information they deem necessary or appropriate to perform their roles, powers and duties (in particular, information relating to the powers delegated to the Executive Committee and its performance), by requesting such information from any member of the Executive Committee, and the answer should be adequately and timely provided; c) T  he directors of the Company having non-executive functions will hold ad hoc meetings, upon convening by the Chairman of the Audit Committee, at its own initiative or upon request of two of those directors, in order to undertake an assessment of the management of the Company. In addition, all supporting documentation for meetings of the Board of Directors will be provided in a timely fashion to the non-executive members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee’s resolutions shall be always available for consultation40. Therefore, the Board of Directors considers that, through the mechanisms described above, all the conditions are established in order for the directors with non-executive functions to discharge their functions in order to make independent and informed decisions. II.9. Identification of the Main Economic, Financial and Legal Risks to which the Company is Exposed when Conducting Business When conducting business in all of its areas of operation or those of its subsidiaries, REN is subject to multiple risks. These have been identified with the aim of mitigating and controlling them. The “appetite for risk” reflects the amount of risk the company is willing to take on or to retain in pursuing its goals. REN adopts a prudent position with regard to its appetite for risk. In 2012, the Risk Management Committee, with support from risk owners, identified the various risks to which REN is exposed, thereby determining the Group’s risk profile. 40 Cf. Article 5 of the Executive Committee Regulations. 280 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The most serious risks for the REN Group are shown in detail below, with their category and subcategory: # Category Subcategory Nature Risk Change to the regulatory 1 Regulatory model and parameters Surronding REN’s credit 2 External context Environment quality / rating Financial Markets Evolution of 3 interest rates Business Occurrence of a 4 Interruption general incident Non approval of 5 investment plans Investment Projects No transfer of assets into 6 Operacional operation on schedule Processes Health and Occurrence of serious 7 work accidents Safety Information 8 Information system safety Technology Capacity to attract / retain Knowledge / 9 Human Resources skills and the know-how Skills necessary for the business Quality of information Accounting / Adequacy of the 10 Reporting for the Taxation management information Decision-Making Changes to the regulatory model and parameters The risk of the existence of changes to the regulatory model and/or regulator decisions may affect the company’s ability to run its business efficiently and is linked to the fact that the activity carried out by REN is a regulated activity. REN manages such risk by monitoring the progress of the regulatory strategy as well as European regulatory trends. Evolution of REN’s rating Changes to REN’rating could have an impact in terms of access to financing as well as the cost of such financing. REN manages this risk by building a position of sound liquidity and through efficient management of its financing needs combined with effective initiatives for communicating with both the market and the various financial agents. It should be noted that the company’s rating could be affected by any deterioration in Portugal’s rating. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 281 Evolution of interest rates The fluctuation of interest rates can have an impact on remuneration from regulated assets and on servicing REN’s debt. A change to relevant benchmarks of market interest rates could result in higher financing expenses for the Group. REN manages exposure to the risk of changes in interest rates by contracting financial derivatives, in order to achieve a balanced ratio of fixed and variable interest rate and to minimize financial burdens in the medium and long term. Occurrence of a generalized incident The company’s performance could be influenced by the occurrence of events causing an interruption in the electricity supply service and by any difficulty in restoring the service in a timely manner. The infrastructures supporting REN’s operations are exposed to a set of conditions (pollution, atmospheric conditions, fires, birds, among others), which could cause interruptions in the service. The plan for restoring service following a generalized incident implemented by REN and the organization of drills to test the ability to restore the service in the event of an incident, are some of the initiatives adopted for managing this risk. Non-approval of investment plans The existence of delays in the approval of investment plans by the Regulator or by other authorities can cause significant delays in implementing new infrastructures and/or loss of the investment made, with an impact on the quality of the service provided. REN has adopted procedures for managing this risk that involve monitoring actions by the regulatory authority and other competent entities in the process of authorizing the investment to be made. Non-entry into operation of assets within planned deadlines Current economic and financial conditions together with the difficulty in obtaining financing to allow providers of services and suppliers to do business, often results in the insolvency/bankruptcy of such companies which may compromise the entry into operation of assets within planned deadlines. The key tools to manage this risk are the supplier qualification and assessment system implemented at REN, the financial assessment of suppliers and contract workers during the market consultation process and the monitoring of corporate information on suppliers and service providers. Occurrence of serious work accidents Non-compliance with safety and operational procedures for equipment could result in the occurrence of serious work accidents with damage to people and property during work organized by REN. REN manages this risk through the safety management system, with specific training for operations involving risks and training for employees of REN’s service providers on safety awareness. Unavailability of information systems REN’s activities rely heavily on the information systems and technologies used within the Group. Therefore, the security of information systems and technologies and their capacity to meet the needs of the company are crucial to REN performing well. 282 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE To manage this risk, REN maintains its communication systems and the respective support services up to date by performing periodic inspections of the configurations of network and security equipment. At the same time, security measures are in place for systems deemed to be critical, such as the existence of redundant communications and the shielding of such systems from potentially dangerous traffic. Ability to attract/retain the skills and know-how required for the business REN’s success depends on the skills and efforts of its employees and its management teams. The continuation of the company’s success depends, to a great extent, on its ability to attract, keep and motivate skilled employees. To this end, REN is developing its human resources policy by focusing on training, ethics and the development of potential and motivation. The human resources policy also aims to constantly update knowledge and strengthen a culture of quality, both of which are indispensable for it to meet its public service mission.. Adequacy of management information REN regularly provides management information, to strictly monitor its operations. In this regard, all management information provided both for internal use and for disclosure to other organizations, is prepared on the basis of sophisticated IT systems. REN carries out initiatives that seek to continually improve the support information processes and systems that produce financial and management information. In this way, the production of accurate, reliable information allows us to ensure that the information does not contain errors that could compromise the decision-making process. II.10. Powers of the Board of Directors The Board of Directors has the powers and duties conferred by CSC and the Articles of Association41. Among these, of special note are: a) To define the Company’s goals and management policies; b) To draw up the annual financial and business plans; c) T o manage corporate business and carry out all actions and operations relating to the Company’s object which do not fall within the competences attributed to other corporate bodies; d) T  o represent the company in and out of court, actively and passively and may waive, settle or confess in any proceedings as well as establish arbitration agreements; e) T o acquire, sell or by any other form dispose of or encumber rights or assets, whether real estate or not; f) To incorporate companies and subscribe for, acquire, encumber and dispose of shareholdings; g) T o submit proposals to the General Meeting on the acquisition and disposal of own shares, in compliance with the applicable legal restrictions; h) T o determine the technical and administrative organization of the Company and the rules for internal operation, more specifically with regard to its personnel and the corresponding remuneration; i) To perform any other functions granted by law or by the General Meeting42. 41 Article 15(1) of REN’s Articles of Association. 42 Cf. Article 15(3) of the Articles of Association. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 283 With regard to the scope of delegation of powers to the Executive Committee and to matters which cannot be delegated by the Board of Directors, see II.3.1. above. In turn, the acquisition and disposal of assets, rights or shareholdings with an economic value greater than 10% of the Company’s fixed assets is subject to prior approval from the General Meeting. It should be noted that the Company’s Articles of Association do not authorize the Board of Directors to increase the Company’s share capital. II.11. Responsibility Rotation Policy and Rules on the Appointment and Substitution of Members II.11.1. Policy on the rotation of responsibilities The Board of Directors has adopted a set of general principles concerning its policy on the rotation of responsibilities on the Board, as follows: a) C oncerning the allocation of responsibilities, the Board of Directors will take into account, among others, the following factors: (i) the know-how and experience appropriate to the relevant functions, (ii) the thorough knowledge of the sector and (iii) the diversity of skills and qualifications within the Board of Directors, as a body intended to be multidisciplinary; b) T  he allocation of responsibilities will fall within the human resources culture and management policy of the Company in order to allow, whenever this is desirable and in the interest of REN, the harmonization of global practices and maximization of synergies in the several business units; c) T he Board of Directors will, on a case by case basis, rotate director’s responsibilities, whenever such rotation is in line with the improvement of corporate governance and the pursuit of the Company’s interests, more specifically when a refreshing of the adopted strategy with regards to a specific responsibility or role is considered to be positive; d) Usually, in the allocation of responsibilities to the executive members of the Board of Directors, particularly regarding financial matters and other highly complex and specialized roles, the tendency will be to give priority to the criteria mentioned on the first paragraph above, as it is considered that in such situations the experience, appropriate qualifications and, most of all, an in-depth knowledge of the Company and its business have a higher added value than rotation; e) Furthermore, with regard to its non-executive members, the Board of Directors will seek to rotate an adequate number of members, usually after the lapse of 3 consecutive terms of office, in order to contribute to the efficient performance of its functions of accompanying and monitoring the executive management. The abovementioned principles will apply in the context of the following powers of the Board of Directors: a) A ppointment of the members of the Executive Committee and its Chairman; b) G  ranting of powers to one or more directors to specifically deal with certain management matters; 40 Cfr. n.º 3 do artigo 15.º do Contrato de Sociedade. 284 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE c) A  ppointment of specialist committee members, which may be established pursuant to article 10 of the Internal Regulations of the Board of Directors; and d) R eplacement by co-option of missing directors subject to ratification in the first subsequent General Meeting, according to the applicable legal provisions. II.11.2. Rules relating to the Appointment and Substitution of Members In accordance with legislation and the Articles of Association43, the election and dismissal of members of the Board of Directors44 and the Audit Committee is the responsibility of the General Meeting. It is the responsibility of the General Meeting to elect the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors. In turn, the Chairman of the Audit Committee is chosen by the General Meeting or the Committee itself, should the General Meeting not do so 45. In accordance with the Articles of Association46, a minority of shareholders who voted against the winning proposal appoint at least one director, provided that this minority represents at least 10% of the Company’s share capital. CSC rules apply47 with regard to the substitution of members of the Board of Directors and members of the Audit Committee, given that neither the Company’s Articles of Association, nor the Board of Directors or Audit Committee Regulations have special rules on this matter. The Company’s Articles of Association48 state that the unjustified absence of any director at more than half of the ordinary meetings of the Board of Directors during one financial year, whether consecutive or non-consecutive absences, equates to the permanent absence of said director. Permanent absence must be declared by the Board of Directors, and they must also substitute the director in question. In accordance with legislation and the Articles of Association49, the Statutory Auditor is appointed by the General Meeting under a proposal of the Audit Committee. His dismissal also falls to the General Meeting. II.12. Number of Board of Directors and Audit Committee Meetings. Drawing up of the respective Minutes The Company’s Articles of Association and the respective internal regulations, the Board of Directors holds ordinary meetings at least bi-monthly, on dates established by agreement between its members for each calendar year, and extraordinary meetings whenever convened by its Chairman, by any 2 directors or by the Statutory Auditor. During the first eighteen months in its term in office, the Board of Directors shall meet monthly50. During the financial year of 2012, the Board of Directors held fourteen meetings. For each meeting the respective minutes were drawn up. The drawing up of the minutes of the Board of Directors meetings is the responsibility of the Company Secretary. The minutes shall be submitted for the approval of the Board at the ordinary meeting after that to which they refer51. 43 Article 8(2)(b). 44 Cf.

In addition to its ordinary meetings, the Audit Committee may meet whenever convened by its Chairman or by the remaining two members. For each meeting, the respective minutes are drawn up, which are submitted for approval at the ordinary meeting after that to which they refer52. In 2012, the Audit Committee held 16 meetings. II.13. Number of Meetings Held by the Executive Committee Sending of the respective meetings Invitations to Convene Executive Committee meetings are held, as a rule, once a week53. In 2012, the Executive Committee held 47 meetings, for which the relevant minutes were drawn up54. The Chief Executive Officer sends to the Chairmen of the Board of Directors and of the Audit Committee the notices to convene and the minutes of the meetings of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee provides timely and appropriate information to members of other corporate bodies upon their request. II.14. Incompatibility Rules and Independence Criteria for Executive and Non-Executive Members The Board of Directors shall include a number of non-executive members ensuring effective ability to supervise, monitor and assess the activity of the executive members. Therefore, on 31st December 2012 and on this date, twelve of the fifteen members of the REN Board of Directors were non-executive directors. Taking into account the assessment criteria of independence laid down in CMVM’s Recommendation II.1.2.3. and in Article 414(5) of the Portuguese Companies Code, the REN Board of Directors considers the following non-executive directors as independent: NAME POSITION José Luís Alvim Marinho Chairman of the Audit Committee José Frederico Vieira Jordão Member of the Audit Committee Emílio Rui Vilar Member of the Audit Committee Non-Executive Member of the José Luís Arnaut Board of Directors Furthermore, all non-executive members of the Board of Directors (in addition, naturally, to the directors that are also members of the Audit Committee) would comply, if applicable, with all incompatibility rules stipulated in paragraph 1 of article 414-A of the Portuguese Companies Code, save as provided for in subparagraphs b) and h). In light of the above, REN fully complies with Recommendations II.1.2.1 to II.2.1.3, as the Board of Directors comprises an adequate number of non-executive members and, among these, independent members. 52 Articles 8 and 9 of the Audit Committee Regulations. 53 Article 2 of the Executive Committee Regulations. 54 Cf. Article 5 of the Executive Committee Regulations. 286 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Also with regard to members of the Audit Committee, this body understands that all its members have suitable competences for exercising their respective duties, including a suitable degree and knowledge of auditing and accounting, with the Company also complying with Recommendation II.1.3.1. II.15. Rules on Gauging the Independence of Members of the Board of Directors The independence of Company directors is gauged based on the relevant rules in Article 414(5) and Article 414A(1) (with the exception of b)) in the CSC, and is pursuant to the information and declarations provided by the directors themselves. Moreover, at the Company General Meeting held on 27th March 2012, the introduction of a new provision into the Articles of Association was approved – Article 7-A, which governs the special system of incompatibilities applicable to the exercising of duties in any REN corporate body. The aim of this new proposal is to establish a system of incompatibilities relating to the potential conflicts of interest arising from the direct or indirect exercising of activities in the electric or natural gas sectors, either in Portugal or abroad. It should be noted that the system established in this provision would not apply to the members elected at the same General Meeting. It will only be fully applied for the election of members of future corporate bodies. II.16. Non-Executive Director Candidate Selection Process Taking into account that, under the law and the Articles of Association, the election and dismissal of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company is within the scope of powers of the General Meeting, and is carried out through lists of people selected by the proposing shareholder(s), with voting taking place on these lists, the shareholders have an exclusive role in this selection process, without any intervention by executive directors. The Board of Directors of the Company will only participate in said process in the event of replacement by co-option of missing directors, as described below. In this case, since it is non-delegable competence of the Board of Directors, all Directors are involved in the resolution of co-option, except in the event of conflicts of interest. In any case, in the absence of a specialized committee, concerning selection/ appointment matters, as explained in II.2. above, the continuous monitoring of matters relating to the assessment of the overall performance of the Board of Directors, as well as the analysis of the appropriate profile for the performance of the functions of REN Directors is a competence of the non-executive members of the Board of Directors, within their supervisory role. II.17. Description of the Activity of Non-Executive Directors In compliance with their competences, in 2012, the Non-Executive Directors of the Company performed their supervisory duties of the executive members in an effective manner and without detecting any constraints. Therefore, pursuant to the CSC, the Articles of Association and the Board of Directors Regulations, the Non-Executive Directors have performed the duties necessary to comply with their general duty to monitor the work of the Executive Committee. We are providing in this report, which is an integral part of the annual management report, a description of the work of Non-Executive Directors relating to their supervisory duties during 2012: a) t he exercising of duties within the Audit Committee by the three Non-Executive Directors on said Committee; b) p articipation in the meetings of the Board of Directors and the timely appreciation of matters discussed there, taking on an important role in formulating corporate strategy and in the supervision of its implementation; ANNUAL REPORT 2012 287 c) p  resentation of requests to the Executive Committee for clarifications on matters relating to the management status of the company. Of note among these matters are financial aspects, internal control and risk management, matters on governance and regulatory aspects; and d) t he permanent monitoring of issues relating to: (i) the model and principles of Company governance; (ii) the assessment of the overall performance of the Board of Directors and the analysis of the appropriate profile to perform the functions of a REN director; as well as (iii) the assessment of the performance of the Executive Directors. II.18. Professional Qualifications of Members of the Board of Directors, Information on the Professional Activities they have carried out, covering at least the previous five years, the Number of shares they hold in the Company, Date of first Appointment and Date of End Term of Office This information can be found in Annexes I and II of this report. II.19. Duties which the Members of the Board of Directors carry out in other companies, with a break down of duties in other companies of the same Group The duties carried out by the Members of the Board of Directors in other companies can be found in Annex I of this report. Section III – General and Supervisory Council, Financial Matters Committee and Fiscal Council The information required in paragraphs II.21. to II.28. of CMVM Regulation No. 1/2010 does not apply to REN, bearing in mind that the Company adopted an Anglo-Saxon model of governance. Section IV – Remuneration II.29. and II.30. Remuneration Policy for Management and Supervisory Bodies REN’s remuneration policy for 2012 takes into account the recent legal, regulatory and recommendatory rules regarding the remuneration of the members of corporate bodies, to which REN is subject, on one hand, as an issuer of shares admitted to trading and, on the other hand, up to 25th May 2012, it was a public company. The following instruments are of special note due to their importance and impact on REN’s remuneration policy for 2012: a) A  s an issuer of shares admitted to trading, REN is subject to Law No. 28/2009 of 19th June and to CMVM Regulation No. 1/2010, as well as to CMVM Recommendations; b) M  oreover, as a company of the corporate sector of the State, REN is subject to (i) Council of Ministers Resolution No. 49/2007 of 28th March, on the principles of corporate governance, and (ii) Ministerial Order No. 11420/2009 of 11th May, which develops that Resolution with regard to remuneration; 288 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE c) Up to 25th May 2012, REN was also subject to compliance with the Statute of Public Manager, approved by Decree-Law No. 71/2007 of 27th March, with its current wording, as well as to other laws which govern the setting of monthly salaries for public managers; d) D  ue to the implemented exceptional measures of budget consolidation, until 25th May 2012, temporary restrictions on the remuneration of members of corporate bodies were applicable to REN, in particular Law No. 12-A/2010 of 30th June and Law No. 64-B/2011 of 30th December, which approved the State Budget for 2012. As part of its duties, the REN Remunerations Committee approved the declaration on the remunerations policy for REN corporate bodies for 2012, annex to the 2011 report (Annex II), which was submitted to vote and approval at the annual General Meeting of 27th March 2012. As referred to above, further to the conclusion of the second stage of REN privatization, the Remunerations Committee approved new remunerations policy for REN corporate bodies, which came into effect on 1st June 2012. The REN Remuneration Committee will therefore submit a declaration on the abovementioned remunerations policy for approval at the annual General Meeting for 2012, to apply to the 2012-2014 term of office, with effect as of that date (Annex II). The abovementioned declarations cover all company officers (within the meaning of the provision of Article 248-B(3) of the Securities Code), given that the REN Board of Directors understands that those officers correspond only to the members of the company’s management and Supervisory Bodies. The Company considers that there are no other workers who are entitled to remuneration with a significant variable component, whose professional activity may have a relevant impact on the Company’s risk profile. In 2012, REN adopted a transparent and equitable remuneration system which, on one hand, respects the remuneration restrictions applicable to the public sector, and on the other, is flexible with a view to being able to adopt the Recommendations of the CMVM, as described below: a) R emuneration of the members of management and supervisory bodies includes a fixed component, determined by taking into account the policies followed by a series of national and European peers identified in Annex II; b) R emuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, including the members of the Audit Committee, is composed exclusively of a fixed component, thus is not dependent on the performance or value of REN; c) In turn, remuneration of the members of the Executive Committee includes, in addition to a fixed component, a variable component determined, essentially based on four general criteria described in more detail in II.33 below: (i) competitiveness, taking into consideration the practices of the Portuguese market; (ii) equity, in that remuneration must be based on uniform, consistent, fair and balanced criteria; (iii) assessment of performance, in accordance with duties and the level of responsibility of the person in question, as well as the assumption of suitable levels of risk and compliance with the rules applicable to REN business; and (iv) alignment of directors’ interests with the Company’s and its sustainability and creation of long-term wealth. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 289 II.31. Individual Remuneration of the Members of Management and Supervisory Bodies At the General Meeting of 27th March 2012, shareholders voted in favor of a proposal to terminate the term of office underway for the three-year period 2010-2012. It was also determined that 2012 would be the reference point for the start of new terms of office for corporate bodies, the first of which will be for the three year period 2012-2014. Therefore, new corporate bodies were elected for the 2012-2014 term of office. With regard to the period referring to the previous term of office, listed below are the remunerations of the Members of Management and Supervisory Bodies, individually and as a whole, which only includes the fixed remuneration: TERM OF OFFICE CONCLUDED ON 27/03/2012 Fixed Name Remuneration(1) Chairman of the Board of Directors (2) Rui Cartaxo 81 229.45(2) and the Executive Committee Aníbal Santos Executive Committee 61 005.10 João Caetano Conceição Executive Committee 61 005.10 João Plácido Pires Executive Committee 61 005.10 João Nuno Palma (3) Executive Committee 689.52 José Morgado The Board of Directors 6 445.32 EGF, S.A.

(2) This sum includes EUR 15 165.00 paid by the subsidiary Red Eléctrica Corporácion, S.A., a Company incorporated under Spanish Law, in which Rui Cartaxo inherently holds the office of member of the Board of Directors. (3) Resigned as Member of the Board of Directors and of the Executive Committee on 2nd January, 2012. As mentioned above, in the term of office started on 27th March 2012, the sum of remunerations paid to members of corporate bodies took into account two distinct time frames: a) Up to 31st May 2012, the rules in effect from the previous term in office were applied; b) From 1st June 2012, the new remuneration policy has been applied as approved by the Remunerations Committee elected at the General Meeting of 27th March. 290 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Therefore, the remunerations of the members of the management and supervisory bodies, individually and as a whole, which only included a fixed component, were as listed below and: TERM OF OFFICE STARTED ON 27/03/2012 Fixed Name remuneration(1) Chairman of the Board of Directors (1) Rui Cartaxo 282 540.21 and the Executive Committee João Caetano Conceição Executive Committee 224 324.19 (2) Gonçalo Morais Soares Executive Committee 224 344.67 Vice-Chairman of the Board Guangchao Zhu 47 173.63 of Directors Mengrong Chen The Board of Directors 21 506.94 Haibin Wan The Board of Directors 21 506.94 Hilal Al-Kharusi The Board of Directors 21 506.94 Aníbal Santos The Board of Directors 20 205.00 EGF, S.A.

(2) In the context of the recruitment and selection process concerning a new member for the Executive Committee for the position of Chief Financial Officer, Gonçalo Morais Soares, the reference shareholders decided to grant a supplementary remuneration to said director in the amount to EUR 100 000.00, to be paid only once, in addition to the fixed and variable remunerations paid to the directors. This supplement has accrued to the amounts referred to in the table above, thus contributing to consolidate the main goals of REN’s remuneration policy, namely the ability to attract and preserve highly qualified professionals. II.32. Alignment with Long-Term Company Interests, Remuneration based on Performance and Disincentive to Take on Excessive Risk It is intended that the remuneration of the Executive Committee be composed of a fixed component and a variable component. There should be an adequate proportionality between both components, as explained in II.33 below. In accordance with the new remuneration policy in effect since 1st June 2012, the variable component of remuneration for 2012 may include a short-term parcel (“RVCP”) and a medium-term parcel (“RVMP”), both based on a performance assessment with weighting on key individual performance indicators of the director and the performance of the Company itself, described in more detail in II.33 below. Such indicators seek to bring the interests of the executive directors closer to the long-term interests of REN and its shareholders. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 291 The main aims of the proportionality between the fixed and variable components and the limits to variable remuneration (i.e. between 20% and 120% of fixed remuneration, in a gradual manner and as better described in II.33 below) are to dissuade taking on excessive risk and to stimulate the adoption of a suitable risk management strategy. II.33. With regard to the Remuneration of Executive Directors a) and c) Reference to the fact that the Remuneration of Executive Directors includes a Variable Component, Information on How this Component depends on Performance Assessment and indication of dos Assessment Criteria The awarding of RVCP and RVMP is subject to the following common requirements:  he awarding of the variable component of the remuneration only takes T place after approval of the accounts and the performance assessment for the year to which the payment refers and only when predefined objectives have been complied with, measured against individual and company performance indicators, indexed to targets in the REN strategic plan; T  he degree of achievement of defined goals is measured through an annual performance assessment, based on a predefined model Therefore, if compliance with goals falls below 80% (minimum performance level), no payment of variable remuneration takes place. However, if compliance with goals lies between 80% and 120% or greater, the corresponding total variable remuneration will equate to between 20% and 120% of the fixed remuneration. Particularly, RVMP has the following characteristics which contribute to the alignment of the interests of REN executive directors with those of the Company and shareholders: R  VMP is set in Remuneratory Units which refer to every financial year in the term of office in which each executive director has performed duties;  ach Remuneratory Unit has a value corresponding to the REN share price E at the date the RVMP is set and this value evolves in a manner equal to that of the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) for REN shares; The abovementioned annual performance assessment for the awarding of RVCP and RVMP throughout the term of office is based on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPI), i) Average Cost of Debt; ii) Return on Invested Capital; iii) EBITDA abroad; iv) Earnings per Share (compound annual growth rate – CARG; and v) EBITDA CARG. These objective criteria are mechanisms intended to promote a proper alignment with medium and long-term interests of the Company and shareholders and shall be determined for all financial years, regardless of the existence of variable remunerations. b) Indication of the competent Corporate Bodies to conduct the Performance Assessment of Executive Directors Performance assessment of members of the Executive Committee is carried out by the Remunerations Committee, with the support of the Company’s nonexecutive directors. Of note is the role played by the Audit Committee in the verification of the quantitative elements of the assessment. 292 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE d) Explanation of the Relative Importance of the Variable and Fixed Components in the Remuneration of Directors, as well as an Indication of the Maximum Limits of each Component The fixed component corresponds to a monthly amount paid in twelve installments over the year. The annual value of the fixed component of remuneration earned in 2012 by the members of the Executive Committee is described in II.31 above. In turn, depending on the level of success in targets as referred to above, the total variable component is graduated between 20% and 120% of the fixed component. e) and f) Indication on the Deferral of Payment of the Variable Component of Remuneration, with Mention of the Deferral Period and Explanation on How the Payment of Variable Remuneration is subject to Continued Positive Performance of the Company over the Deferral Period In accordance with the remuneration policy in effect since 1st June 2012, the granting of the RVCP shall correspond to an amount up to 50% of the global variable remuneration granted in relation to each relevant year. In turn, RVMP is set in Remuneratory Units which refer to every financial year of the term of office in which each executive director has performed duties, and is structured to ensure deferral of payment and is conditioned to continued positive performance, through the following channels: Each Remuneratory Unit has a value corresponding to the REN share price at the date the RVMP is set and this value evolves in a manner equal to that of the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) for REN shares; The entitlement executive directors have to convert their Remuneratory Units is attained on a successive basis. The units are broken down into thirds and the first 1/3 is consolidated at the end of the first financial year while the remaining 2/3 are consolidated at the end of subsequent financial years, as long as the director performs executive duties in the respective financial year (except if termination occurs as a result of acquisition of a controlling position in REN); Remuneratory Units will be automatically converted into cash or, should the REN General Meeting come to deliberate, into REN shares, either partially or totally, when three years have elapsed since the date on which they were awarded. g) Sufficient Information on Criteria on which the Awarding of Variable Remuneration in Shares is based, as well as on the Maintaining, by Executive Directors, of Company Shares they have accessed, with regard to the possible signing of Contracts on such Shares There are no programs or variable remuneration plans that consist of the allocation of shares, options to purchase shares or other incentive systems based on a variation of the price of shares for members of the management or supervisory bodies or persons discharging managerial functions, within the meaning of Article 248-B(3) of the Portuguese Securities Code (except the RVMP (Medium-Term Variable Remuneration) index for the REN share price, as described above). However, the remuneration policy approved by the Remuneration Committee and which came into effect on 1 June 2012, determines that, within the scope of RVMP, Remuneratory Units can be converted into REN shares, either partially or totally, should the REN General Meeting so deliberate. h) Information on Criteria on which the Awarding of Variable Remuneration in Options is based and Indication of the Deferral Period and the Price See sub paragraph g) above. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 293 i) Identification of the Main Parameters and Basis of any System of Annual Bonuses and any other Non-Monetary Benefits There is no system of annual bonuses or any other non-monetary benefits, beyond the variable component of remuneration described above and that referred to in p) above. j) Remuneration paid in the Form of Profit Sharing and/or Payment of Bonuses and the Reasons why such Bonuses and/or Profit Sharing were granted There are no payments in the form of profit sharing and/or payment of bonuses, beyond the variable component of remuneration described above. l) Compensation paid or due to Ex Executive Directors for the Termination of their Duties during Office There are no agreements between the Company and the members of the managing and supervisory bodies providing the award of compensation in the event of directors’ resignation or dismissal from office. No other amounts are due and no other amounts were paid in 2012 as compensation, beyond the sums listed below. Taking into account the early termination of the 2010-2012 term in office, the Remuneration Committee set a compensation payment for outgoing directors, due to the reduction by one year of the term of office started in 2010. Therefore, and taking into consideration that the members of the REN Board of Directors who, up to the coming into effect of the second REN privatization stage, were subject to the State’s Public Manager Status, approved by Decree-Law No. 71/2007 of 27th March, currently in the version resulting from Decree-Law No. 8/2012 of 18 January (applicable through the fact that REN was considered, up to the end of the second privatization stage, to be a public company for the purposes of Article 3 of Decree-Law No. 558/99 of 17th December) it was deliberated to award outgoing directors with compensation corresponding to the base salary paid in the respective term of office for a period of twelve months. This decision was governed by the provisions of Article 26(4) of the abovementioned Public Manager Status55. Based on the applicable legislation, the following compensation was paid: Compensation for early termination of term of office NAme Aníbal Santos Executive Committee 229 560.00 João Plácido Pires Executive Committee 31 500.00 José Carvalho Neto The Board of Directors 29 940.00 Oliren, SGPS, S.A. The Board of Directors 29 940.00 Fernando Rocha de Andrade Audit Committee 41 304.00 Total 362 244.00 55 “ In cases of return to duties or the acceptance, within the time referred to in the previous point, of duties or a position in the civil service or with a public company, or in the case of return to duties previously carried out by managers appointed through a commission of service or special or occasional assignment, the compensation possibly due is reduced to the sum of the difference between the salary as a manager and the salary of the position of origin on the date that duties as a manager terminated, or the new salary, and the part of the compensation which may possibly have been paid shall be returned.” 294 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE m) Reference to the Contractual Limitation for Compensation to be paid for Unfair Dismissal of a Director and its Relation to the Variable Remuneration Component Upon termination of the management functions by agreement or by dismissal without fair grounds, no indemnification shall be paid if the termination or dismissal is due to inadequate performance by the director, in line with the remunerations policy approved by the Company’s Remunerations Committee. n) Sums of any nature paid by other Companies in a Domain or Group Relationship with REN The members of the corporate bodies of REN did not receive any amounts paid by other companies in a domain or group relationship with REN. o) Description of the Main Characteristics of the Complementary Systems for Pensions or Early Retirement for Directors, indicating if they were or were not, subject to Appreciation by the General Meeting There is no system of retirement benefits for the members of the managing and supervisory bodies. p) Estimate of the Value of relevant Non-Monetary Benefits considered as Remuneration not covered by the Situations above In 2012, Executive Directors were entitled to the use of a car, a cell phone, health insurance, life insurance and personal accident insurance for the performance of their duties. It is estimated that the value of these benefits is €20 000/director. q) Existence of Mechanisms which impede Executive Directors from signing Contracts which jeopardize the Reason for the Existence of Variable Remuneration Bearing in mind the objectives sought through the remuneration model stipulated herein, executive directors of the Company shall not take out contracts designed to mitigate the risk inherent to the variability of their remuneration, as stipulated in the remuneration policy approved by the Remuneration Committee. II.34. Reference to the Fact that the Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors on the Board of Directors does not include Variable Components Non-executive directors’ remuneration is exclusively composed of a fixed component, and is not connected to the performance or value of REN, meeting the applicable recommendations on this matter. Their remuneration is paid in twelve monthly installments during the year. II.35. Whistleblowing Policy Shareholders, members of corporate bodies, employees, service providers, clients, suppliers and other stakeholders in REN or Group companies may communicate to the Audit Committee any irregular practices they have knowledge of or which are duly founded, in order to prevent, stop or sanction irregularities which could cause adverse effects on the REN Group. This system covers the communication of irregular practices by shareholders, members of corporate bodies, employees or service providers of the REN Group. Communications must be submitted in writing to the head office or via electronic mail to comissao.auditoria@ren.pt, which is only accessible by the Audit Committee for this purpose. Communications must contain all the information the author has and considers necessary to the assessment of the irregularity. Communications will be dealt with confidentially, except if the whistleblower wishes to reveal his or her identification in the communication of the irregularity, which will only be disclosed for the purposes of investigations should the whistleblower give his or her consent. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 295 The Audit Committee must assess the situation described and determine or propose actions that, in each specific case, are deemed appropriate, in accordance with the Internal Regulations approved by the Board of Directors, under a proposal by the Audit Committee. The investigation process by the Audit Committee includes a preliminary stage with the aim of (i) conducting an in-depth investigation which may use contracted external consultants, (i) rejection of the communication, or (iii) presentation of a proposal for corrective measures to the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee.

Capital Structure INFORMATION REN’s share capital, in the amount of EUR 534 000 000 (five hundred and thirty-four million Euro) is represented by 534 000 000 (five hundred and AND AUDITING thirty-four million) shares with a face value of EUR 1.00 (one Euro), in the form of nominative book-entry shares, divided as follow56: a) 4 75 260 000 (four hundred and seventy-five million, two hundred and sixty thousand) class A shares, corresponding to 89% of REN’s share capital; b) 5 8 740 000 (fifty-eight million, seven hundred and forty thousand) class B shares, corresponding to 11% of REN’s share capital. Class A shares are ordinary shares that do not grant special rights to their holders, beyond the general rights inherent as a shareholder, under the terms of legislation. Class B shares are shares to be privatized and the only special entitlement they have is that they do not subject holders to the voting limitation stipulated in Article 12(3) of the Articles of Association (see I.7. above). 56 Cf. Article 4(1) and (2) of the Articles of Association. 296 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE On 31 December 2012, all of REN’s class A shares were admitted to trading on Euronext Lisbon, with the exception of 213 600 000 shares held by State Grid Europe Limited and Mazoon B.V., corresponding to code PTREL0AM0008. III.2. Qualified Holdings in Company Capital, calculated pursuant to Article 20 of the Portuguese Securities Code Qualified shareholdings held in REN’s share capital, on 31st December 2012, are listed in Annex II, which also includes the identification of shares held by members of REN’s management and supervisory bodies, as well as transactions carried out by these members of corporate bodies or people related to them. Thus, using as a reference the announcements made to the Company, pursuant to CSC Article 447, Article 16 of the Portuguese Securities Code and Article 14 of CMVM Regulation No. 5/2008, the structure of voting rights stemming from REN’s qualified shareholdings, calculated pursuant to Article 20(1) of the Portuguese Securities Code, with reference to the 9,9% date of 31st December 2012, can be summarized as follows: 17,0% 1,1% 5,0% 0,7% 2,0% 9,9% 17,0% 1,1% 5,0% 5,0% 15,0% 0,7% 2,0% 5,0% 5,0% 15,0% 5,8% 5,0% 5,8% 8,4% 8,4% 25,0% 25,0% STATE GRID OF GRID STATE CHINA EGF-GCF,S.A.

See paragraph III.1. on special rights conferred to this class of shares. In turn, according to Article 4 of the Articles of Association, the transfer of Class B shares to non-public entities, pursuant to the conclusion of a phase of REN’s privatization process, determines the automatic conversion of Class B shares into Class A shares. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 297 III.4. Possible Restrictions on the Transferability of Shares, such as Consent Clauses for Disposal, or Limitations on Ownership of Shares There are no limitations on the transferability of shares representing REN capital, which are freely tradable on the regulated market, without prejudice to the legal limitations (lock up) established within the scope of the second stage of REN privatization and applicable to shareholders who acquire their holdings in such a context.

III.8. Description of the Evolution of the Company’s share price In 2012, REN shares fell by 2.6%, a less accentuated fall than in the previous year (18%). REN’s shares have been affected by the successive downgrades of the sovereign public debt, awarded by rating agencies that, despite defining REN’s risk profile as low, considered that REN’s rating must not exceed that of the Portuguese State by more than one notch, due to the fact that the Portuguese State is a majority shareholder of REN’s share capital and that REN is a regulated company that focuses its activities in the domestic market. 57 Cf. Article 383 of the Portuguese Companies Code. 58 Cf. Article 11. 298 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE In February 2012, Moody’s announced that it would maintain REN’s rating at Ba1, placing the Company under review for possible downgrade. In the same month, Standard and Poor’s reviewed REN’s long and short term rating from “BBB – / A-3” to “BB+ / B”, as well as the rating of the respective senior non-guaranteed debt from “BBB-” to“BB+”, as a result of the downgrade in Portugal’s rating. At the same time, they removed REN’s ratings from CreditWatch, changing them to a negative outlook. Finally, in October, Moody’s decided to REN’s rating, as they considered that the additional liquidity provided by financing and the continued support of State Grid contribute significantly to mitigation of the risk for REN’s medium-term refinancing, as well as due to its reduced connection to Portugal’s rating. REN liquidity almost doubled as compared to the previous year: average daily transactions rose from around 241 000 in 2011 to 414 000 in 2012. This result was due to the contractual operations between EGF, Millennium BCP, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, duly communicated to the market, which involved more than 28 000 000 REN book-entry nominative shares. Therefore, the liquidity recorded on 8th March, 4th June and 4th December 2012, was greater than 28 000 000. If we do not consider these operations, the figure for average daily transactions was 85 054 shares. 31/DeC/2011 Euronext Lisbon TO 31/DeC/2012 CLOSE 2.055 PRICE (€) maximum 2.295 minimum 1.800 average 2.046 Volume (million) 106.0 TRANSACTIONS Average daily volume (millions) 0.414 ACCUMULATED transactions (M€) 216 89 Average daily transactions (M€) 0.85 VALUE STOCK MARKET CAP (31/DeC/12; M€) 1 097.37 variation SINCE START OF YEAR PSI20 2.9% ∆% REN -2.6% Source: Bloomberg ANNUAL REPORT 2012 299 REN vs PSI20 e Dow Jones EuroStoxxUtilities 110% 100% 90% 80% 70% 12 2 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 2/ /1 2/ 3/ 4/ 5/ 6/ 7/ 8/ 9/ 0/ 11/ 2/ /1 /01 /0 /0 /0 /0 /0 /0 /0 /0 / 1 0/ 1 /1 1 1 30 3 0 2 9 3 1 30 3 1 30 3 3 1 30 3 3 3 DJ EURO STOXX UTIL.

Dividend Distribution Policy REN’s dividend policy depends on a number of factors, including REN’s distributable profits, financial situation, financing needs (in particular with regard to capital expenditure and the investment plan), REN’s business perspectives, conditions applicable to the pursuit of REN’s activities and other factors deemed as relevant at the time of the allocation of results. Historically, with the purpose to maintain an attractive dividend that falls within the range of its peers, REN has offered shareholders an annual dividend distribution from approximately 60% to 80% of its net results, as shown in the table below: GROSS AMOUNT PAYMENT NET PAY OUT DIVIDEND YEAR (M€) TYPE YEAR RESULT RATIO PER 2011 90.25 ordinary 2012 120.6 75% 0.169 2010 89.71 ordinary 2011 110.3 81% 0.168 2009 89.18 ordinary 2010 134.0 67% 0.167 2008 88.11 ordinary 2009 127.4 69% 0.165 2007 87.04 ordinary 2008 145.2 60% 0.163 In 2012, REN distributed to shareholders, as dividends for the financial year 2011, a total amount of EUR 90 246 000.00, corresponding to a gross amount of EUR 0.169 per share and a net value of EUR 0.1268 per share (regardless of the share type), which was in line with the distribution in previous years. 0.170 90% 0.169 80% 0.168 70% 0.167 60% 0.166 50% 0.165 40% 0.164 30% 0.163 0.162 20% 0.161 10% 0.160 0% 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 DIV.

Plans to Award Shares and Share Purchase Options There are no programs or variable remuneration plans that consist of the allocation of shares, options to purchase shares or other incentive systems based on a variation of the price of shares for members of the management or supervisory bodies or persons discharging managerial functions, within the meaning of Article 248-B(3) of the Portuguese Securities Code (without prejudice to that stipulated in II.33.g)). III.11. Business and Operations with the Management and Supervisory Bodies or with Companies which are in a Group or Control Relation, outside Normal Market Conditions No business has been done between the Company and members of its Management or Supervisory Bodies or companies which are in a group or control relation, without prejudice to that referred to in Annex III on the acquisition of REN bonds. III.12. Business and Operations between the Company and those with Qualified Holdings or Entities which are in any Relation, pursuant to Article 20 of the Portuguese Securities Code, outside Normal Market Conditions Annex IV contains the description of the main elements of the business and operations carried out between the Company and the holders of qualified shareholdings and entities with which they are in any relationship. Business between the Company and the holders of qualified shareholdings or entities with which they are in any relationship pursuant to Article 20 of the Portuguese Securities Code was conducted under normal market conditions, during normal REN business, and was largely a result of regulatory obligations. III.13. Intervention of the Supervisory Body for Purposes of Prior Assessment of Business to be carried out between the Company and those with Qualified Holdings So as to facilitate control by the Audit Committee of transactions concluded or to be concluded by REN with related parties and the methodology to be adopted in the event of potential conflict of interests, the REN Audit Committee decided to propose new internal regulations to the Board of Directors to analyze and control transactions with related parties and prevent situations of conflict of interest, which were approved by the Board of Directors on 8 November 2012. Under the terms of the abovementioned regulations, transactions carried out between a Related Party59 and REN or its affiliates, which come under the situations listed below, will be submitted by the management body to the Audit Committee 60 for a prior opinion: a) T  he acquisition and sale of goods or the provision of services valued at over EUR 1 000 000 (one million Euro); b) The acquisition or disposal of shareholdings; 59 T  hat is, (a) a member of a REN managing or supervisory body or of any other company in a control or group relationship with REN, pursuant to Article 21 of the Portuguese Securities Code (“Affiliates”) or (b) any individual who, due to the post he or she holds in REN or in the Affiliates, serves in a senior or managerial capacity, or who has regular or occasional access to privileged information (“Official”) or (c) a shareholder who holds a qualified shareholding of at least 2% of REN’s share capital or of that of the Affiliates, calculated under article 20 of the Portuguese Securities Code (“Relevant Shareholder”) – or (d) a third-party body, related to an Official or a Relevant Shareholder by means of any relevant commercial or personal interest. 60 Cf. Point III(a) of the Regulations. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 305 c) N  ew loans, financing and subscription of financial investments resulting in an overall annual indebtedness exceeding EUR 100 000 000 (one hundred million Euro), except when dealing with a simple renewal of existing circumstances or operations undertaken within the framework of preexisting contractual conditions. d) A ny transaction which, though not covered by the above criteria, has a value that exceeds EUR 1 000 000 (one million Euro) or must be considered relevant for this purpose by the Board of Directors, by virtue of its nature or its particular susceptibility to giving rise to a conflict of interests. In turn, any business between a Related Party as referred to above, on the one hand, and REN or one of its Affiliates, which does not fall into any of the above circumstances, must be submitted by the management body to the Audit Committee 61 for its consideration. If the Audit Committee issues an unfavorable prior expert opinion, approval of the transaction by the Board of Directors must be particularly well-grounded so as to demonstrate that the completion of the transaction is in line with pursuing the corporate interest of REN or of its Affiliates and that the resulting advantages for them outweigh in a positive manner the disadvantages identified by the Audit Committee 62 Finally, the Audit Committee submits recommendations to the Board of Directors with regard to measures to prevent and identify conflicts of interest63. III.14. Description of the Statistical Information on Business subject to prior Intervention by the Supervisory Body The Audit Committee did not intervene in any business or operations conducted between the Company and the holders of qualified shareholdings or entities with which they are in any relationship pursuant to Article 20 of the Portuguese Securities Code, given that no situations arose in which such intervention was required under the terms described in III.13 above. III.15. Indication of the Availability on the Company’s website of Annual Reports on work done by the Audit Committee The Audit Committee draws up an annual report on its supervisory activities (including references to any detected constraints), and also submits an opinion on the management report of the Board of Directors, the financial statements, as well as on the Corporate Governance Report, which are available together with the accounting documents on the REN website (www.ren.pt). 61 Cf.

IR Activity in 2012 The environment in which REN operates has changed significantly since the first half of 2011. In a macro economic context, we have seen a slowdown in the Euro zone, with world-wide effects. Portugal was obliged to seek financial assistance, following in the footsteps of Greece and Ireland. These changes influenced demand for energy and potential domestic growth fell, which required less investment in infrastructures. Finally, the Portuguese state started the second stage in the REN privatization process, an intention demonstrated in the agreement with the Troika, in which State Grid and Oman Oil acquired 25% and 15% of REN capital, respectively. Consequently, Parpública reduced its holdings in REN from 49.9% to 9.9%. On 3 February, REN held a conference call to present the advantages of the strategic partnerships formed with the two new shareholders. ANNUAL REPORT 2012 307 In July 2012, also of note was the conclusion of the purchase of 7.5% of capital in HCB (Cahora Bassa) for EUR 38 400 000, an investment designed to reinforce Company holdings in electricity transmission projects in Mozambique. This acquisition was well received by the markets, particularly as it represented an important step in the realization of aims in the REN strategic plan. In September 2012, REN held its first retail bond issue with a value of EUR 300 000 000, maturing in September 2016. The bond issue was a success and demand exceeded supply by 300% of the initial sum, having attracted more than 18 000 new investors. In October, the China Development Bank approved the terms of a loan of EUR 800 000 000 granted to REN, within the scope of commitments taken on by the strategic partnership between REN and State Grid. This operation contributed to mitigating the Company’s refinancing risk, as well as reducing association to Portugal’s rating. Further to this operation, Moody’s announced that it would maintain REN’s rating at Ba1. The entry of the two new strategic shareholders was fundamental for REN business, making new challenges viable and led to changes in investment strategy. On 9th November, on Investor Day, the main guidelines of the new REN strategic plan were presented to the market for the period 2012-2016. The aim is for more modest national growth in order to dilute exposure in Portugal, complemented with disciplined international expansion. In addition to issues raised about the privatization process and also about its new strategic plan, the REN debt level and its maturity, plus the capacity to finance its investment plan, were constant concerns for REN investors. Therefore, these events were well received by REN investors, as was its new strategic plan, in which one of the strategic priorities is precisely financial solidity, through the reduction of debt rations, optimization of the cost of capital, extension of average debt maturity and an improvement in liquidity. During 2012, all annual and intermediate results were presented by the Until that date, his duties, were performed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Rui Cartaxo, or by the CFO and the representative for Market Relations, Gonçalo Morais Soares. All the presentations were followed by conference calls, moderated by the head of Investor Relations, Ana Fernandes. In 2012, five conference calls were held, four providing clarification on results and one on the REN privatization process, during which analysts and investors were able to put their questions directly to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the CFO. In total, the IRO answered more than 100 queries from investors and shareholders, either in person, by telephone or email. To help raise the Company’s profile, the IRO was present at several different events held in Portugal and the main stock market cities such as Madrid, London, New York, Chicago, Montreal and Toronto. In total, more than ninety meetings were held at sixteen events, organized by six different promoters, which were attended by around 120 investors. During 2012, the REN website received more than 100 new subscribers through the option “receive updates” (75 in 2011), and currently has more 308 permanent users. REN has a website exclusively for news which usually, contains all the public institutional information on the Group.
