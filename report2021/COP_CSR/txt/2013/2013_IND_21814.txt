In order to identify our priority areas, last year, we conducted a materiality assessment. Issues of material significance were identified and assessed by senior management against six materiality filters – financial impacts and risks, legal drivers, internal policy drivers, peer based performance, stakeholder concerns and opportunity for innovation. Inputs were also gathered from key stakeholders through focused questionnaires and discussions. The assessment confirmed climate change management, supply chain management, materials management, occupational health and safety and community stewardship as key material issues10 on which our stakeholders expect our response. This year, we embarked on a journey to develop a Sustainability Transformation Roadmap for Tata Motors, dependence on fossil fuels. We have also worked on which will delineate our strategy to manage sustainability reducing our energy consumption in our manufacturing with defined goals and targets. The roadmap is expected facilities through various initiatives outlined in the section to be finalized and rolled-out during FY 2012-13. on energy and climate change. Climate Change Management Supply Chain Management The auto industry has repeatedly come under the scanner Our ability to deliver vehicles of superlative quality and in for greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting impact on the desired time frame depends heavily on the quality and climate change. A majority of the carbon emissions attributed to our business are during the use phase of the robustness of our supply chain. Hence, supply chain vehicles we manufacture and consequently climate management is a key component of our functioning and is change is of utmost priority to us. We have devoted an area we pay close attention to. All our suppliers are resources to develop technologies that reduce our carbon mandated to adopt ISO 9001/TS 16949 quality emissions. We are focusing on alternate fuel and fuel management systems, and we encourage them to efficient vehicles in all geographies of our operations. We implement ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 standards as are focusing on green technologies in order to better well. In order to minimize turn-around time, reduce manage our manufacturing plants and people and also logistics cost, save fuel and reduce packaging we have safeguard ourselves against future legislation and created vendor parks near our plants in Sanand, 10 For additional information on our business opportunities and risks please refer Pg 89-97 of TML Annual Report FY 2011-12 available at http://tatamotors.com/investors/financials/financial-reports.php 21 Pantnagar and Lucknow. Our ultimate aim is to ensure that our supply chain contributes to our overall sustainability vision and strategy. Materials Management Rising costs of raw materials has huge impact on our manufacturing costs, and thus materials management is imperative for us to remain competitive. Additionally, good material management helps in resource conservation, thereby reducing the material intensity of our products. Recovering materials from waste and utilizing recycled input materials presents us with opportunities to develop innovative processes and technologies, and also contribute to a lower environmental impact. Community Stewardship Given the legacy of the Tata Group, community stewardship is part of our ethos. It helps us build on our Group heritage, secure goodwill within our areas of operation and thereby ensure our business sustainability. It also helps us build a favourable reputation with our other stakeholders like employees, suppliers, customers and investors. Our community development agenda aims to create a positive impact on the surrounding communities. We have focused our activities on education, health, employability and environment, as part of our community development agenda. Occupational Health and Safety Occupational health and safety is imperative to our continued business sustainability and for creating a safe working environment. At CVBU, we have engaged DuPont to assist us in implementing a safety management system which fosters a culture that adopts zero-tolerance towards accidents, injuries and negligence. Our PCBU division is associated with British Safety Council to implement world class safety management systems. Our near miss reporting has increased due to enhanced safety awareness and we have consistently reduced the number of reportable injuries for both employees and contractual labour. 22 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT Stakeholder Engagement non-financial performance apart from publishing We are associated with myriad stakeholders who are vital sustainability reports on our website.

Cladocerans 6 Recently, a study was carried out by Ela Foundation, Total 371 Pune, on the biodiversity in our Pune plant. The report mentioned that our plant’s biodiversity conservation efforts were laudable for the variety and number of trees and birds we are home to. Out of the total 1000 acres of land owned by Tata Motors, the factory is built over 600 acres. The remaining 400 acres is an employee residential zone with five fresh water lakes and a dense tree plantation of over 2 million trees. Today, after 50 years, the soil cover is thicker due to the action of roots and accumulated humus from fallen leaves; it retains soil moisture to support several herbs and grasses and importantly regenerates trees from fallen seeds. This can be attributed to our initial tree planting activities that began in 1965 with the inception of our manufacturing activities. The nature conservation plan was conceived by our late Chairman Mr. Sumant Moolgaokar and in his memory the 25 acres lake is named as ‘Sumant Sarovar’. There are established endemic and threatened species of trees, along with mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, amphibians, insects, arachnids, crustaceans, mollusks, and several micro-faunal elements of zooplanktons and phytoplankton’s in the lake waters.

The Report has been evaluated against the principles of Materiality, Stakeholder Inclusiveness, Completeness, Responsiveness, Reliability and Neutrality, as set out in VeriSustain, and the GRI G3.1. As part of our verification we visited the following operations in addition to the TML’s office at Mumbai, India: t 1JNQSJ 1VOF .BIBSBTIUSB *OEJB t 1BOUOBHBS 6UUSBLIBOE *OEJB t +BNTIFEQVS +IBSLIBOE *OEJB 1: www.dnv.com/cr 58 During the assurance engagement, DNV has taken a risk-based approach, meaning that we concentrated our verification efforts more on the issues of high material relevance to TML’s business and stakeholders. As part of the engagement we have reviewed the sustainability-related statements and assertions made in the Report and assessed the robustness of the underlying data management system, information flow and controls.

Conclusions In DNV’s opinion, the Report is a fair representation of the Company’s sustainability related strategies, management systems and performance. The Report, along with the referenced information in the annual report, meets the general content and quality requirements of the GRI G3.1, and DNV confirms that the GRI requirements for Application Level ‘A+’ have been met. We have evaluated the Report’s adherence to the following principles on a scale of ‘Good’, ‘Acceptable’ and ‘Needs Improvement’: Materiality: Acceptable. The methodology of materiality determination has brought out issues of significance; the materiality determination process is based on an internal process of consultation of senior representatives from various functions across the company. The process could be strengthened by more specific framework to bring out sustainability issues that reflect short, medium and long term sustainability impacts on the Company. Stakeholder Inclusiveness: Acceptable. The Company demonstrates engagements with key stakeholders through various channels. The engagement process needs to be further strengthened and documented to clearly bring out the concerns, needs and expectations expressed during engagement with key stakeholders i.e. company may evolve an issue based multi-stakeholder engagement process to fully map stakeholder expectations and needs of stakeholders. Responsiveness: Acceptable. The Company has fairly responded to identified stakeholder concerns through its policies and management systems. To improve the responsiveness the report needs to bring out in a clearer way the key topics and concerns that have been raised through stakeholder engagement activity and how Company has responded through changes in its policies and system to address such concerns. Completeness: Acceptable. Within the reporting boundary defined by the company, the report does not omit relevant information that would influence stakeholder assessments or decisions. It is evident that Company acknowledges the need for continuous improvement and is committed to expanding the reporting scope and boundary. Reliability: Acceptable. Although no systematic or material errors have been detected, DNV has identified some manual discrepancies in data which have subsequently been corrected. The company is committed to continually improve its quality of data through adoption of structured data management system. Neutrality: Good. The information contained in the Report is presented in a balanced and neutral tone. The emphasis on various topics in the report is proportionate to their relative materiality. 59 Opportunities for Improvement The following is an excerpt from the observations and opportunities reported back to the management of the Company. However, these do not affect our conclusions on the Report, and they are indeed generally consistent with the management objectives already in place. t 'VMMZSFQPSUUIFLFZNBUFSJBMBTQFDUTBOEQFSGPSNBODFJOEJDBUPSTUIBUBSFQBSUJBMMZSFQPSUFE t 'VSUIFSTUSFOHUIFOUIFNBUFSJBMJUZEFUFSNJOBUJPOQSPDFTTXJUITQFDJGJDJOQVUTGSPNQSPEVDUJPOVOJUTBOEJODMVEFUIF emerging global issues in automotive sector; t *NQMFNFOUBQSPDFTTPGDPOUJOVPVTBOETZTUFNBUJDJOUFSOBMSFWJFXBOEBVEJUPGTVTUBJOBCJMJUZEBUBNBOBHFNFOU system to further improve the reliability of reported data; t &WPMWFUIFTVTUBJOBCJMJUZUBSHFUTGPSUIFOFYUSFQPSUJOHQFSJPEBOENJEUFSNPCKFDUJWFTBOEHPBMT ZFBST SFMBUFEUP key sustainability parameters.
