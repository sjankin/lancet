This can increase access for those living in remote areas and reduce the environmental impacts associated with travel. A device moves around the meeting location, streaming 360-degree audio and lifesized video over a wired or wireless network. The system essentially allows a person to be in two places at the same time: attend a meeting, make eye contact with remote participants, whisper an aside to someone, even stop by a colleague’s office – all from a thousand miles away. Although a commercial version of the system is some years away, patent applications have been filed.

We provide several web-based systems for this, such as the HP Virtual Classroom. We estimate that in 2002 the Telework program alone saved about 2 million round-trip commutes, avoiding approximately 52 million miles of road travel and reducing CO2 emissions by 6,000 MTCE.

They consume large amounts of energy and generate a lot of heat. The cooling needed further increases energy consumption. HP Labs’ Thermo-mechanical Architecture Research Group, the hub of a cross-company grassroots group known as the ‘Cool Team’, is working to reduce energy used in cooling. The team has developed a system that uses computational fluid dynamics (the process used for airplane design). The system creates a 3-dimensional (3D) data center temperature distribution model and plans the most efficient computer and air conditioning equipment layout (see image). This reduces energy consumption by 25%, saving about $1 million a year for a data center producing 10 MW of heat. The Cool Team plans to develop ‘dynamic smart cooling’ that will automatically direct cooling to those parts of the center where it is most needed. This could double the savings. Server energy efficiency goal Energy efficiency Servers and energy use Servers are increasingly important as internet use grows. • Achieve a 200% increase in Energy-efficient products save customers money and may transactions per minute per watt They are powerful computers with multiple microprocessors reduce pollution and climate change impacts.
