How important are your hands? What kind of workplace do you want? What are the five biggest risks in your work? What can We create you do to make it safer? How do you celebrate success? These are some of the questions being explored by every team in Valmet through the Safety Dialogue a positive safety training, making it the largest training program we’ve launched to date. We create a positive safety culture together when we communicate openly and continuously about health and safety issues. The purpose of the safety dialogue culture together is to facilitate these conversations as an ongoing practice in all teams. By the end of the training, each team member should be committed to safety and be able to show it. Managers are responsible for running the safety dialogue by working through a self-facilitating activity map with their teams. All instructions are on the map, and everyone takes turns leading the discussions as the team conducts the safety dialogue. The activities in the map are grouped into three sections. Know it explores the importance of health and safety, and the kind of workplace the team wants. Believe it explores the impact of our own behavior on health and safety. Show it practices putting safety into action as a team. Each manager first participates as an employee in the dialogue with their manager. They then lead the dialogue in their own team, cascading it down the organization. The Executive Team kicked off the safety dialogue at their August meeting. When asked for his safety message to the teams about to start the dialogue, Pasi Laine, Valmet’s President and CEO, said “I hope everybody at Valmet takes care of safety personally, ensuring safe work practices and not taking risks, but we should also develop a culture where we have the courage to tell others and intervene if we see unsafe behavior around us. I think this is important.” The dialogue itself is a method based on peer learning to deepen knowledge and explore beliefs. The materials are designed for maximum interaction between team members. By being actively engaged in meaningful dialogue with colleagues, participants gain confidence and understand better how to put safety read more: into action to make Valmet and the industry safer. valmet.com/hse 45 people and performance valmet | annual review 2019 13,598 Employees globally 88% of Valmet employees responded to the OurVoice engagement survey 4,838 Spot and Special Rewards granted 46 valmet | annual review 2019 people and performance People and performance Valmet’s more than 13,000 people around the world are committed to moving our customer’s performance forward.

These new composite covers are used in press, guide and calender rolls. In the new composite roll covers, Valmet uses bio-based resin and hardener strict criteria in the polymer matrix. The reinforcing fiber and filler originate from recycled consumer plastic and glass. Depending on cover type, the content of recycled or bio-based raw materials is 75–96 percent. New materials are being tested for the bio-based continuously, and the aim is to reach 100 percent. Valmet has set strict criteria for the bio-based raw material in the covers. raw material Only renewable materials derived from non-food chain plants or plant parts are used to prevent an effect on global food production. Nor should cultivation and in the covers harvesting of plants endanger the growth of natural forests. “In the best cases, bio-based materials can be produced from plant parts that would otherwise be waste. For example, lignin, carbon black made of lignin and nanocellulose can be utilized as reinforcing fillers in roll covers,” explains Jani Turunen, Valmet’s R&D Manager for Polymeric Roll Covers. “Our customers do not have to compromise on product performance either, as the results have shown that in some applications the performance even exceeds that of the traditional offering.” Roll covers used in paper, board, tissue and pulp making need periodic renewal and thus consume tonnes of materials. A major part of the raw materials of traditional roll covers has been manufactured from fossil-based materials refined and processed from crude oil. Valmet’s R&D work focuses strongly on enhancing raw material and energy efficiency and promoting the use of renewable raw materials. Valmet is continuously investigating the opportunities to replace fossil-based materials with renewable or recyclable materials. For example, recycling and the more read more: sustainable use of ceramic and metallic roll covers are being actively researched. valmet.com/oursolutions 53 our solutions valmet | annual review 2019 Digitalization We are striving to realize the full benefits of digitalization in two customer problems were solved by the Valmet Performance Center ways: in serving our customers and in improving our internal effinetwork during the year.

The idea of human rights for every person in the world Valmet is was initially established in 1948, when the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. committed to The three pillars of the UN Guiding Principle for human rights define the different roles in their protection. The state has a “duty to protect human rights,” business has a “responsibility to respect human rights,” and the right of the United victims is “access to effective remedy.” The business responsibility to respect human rights means that a company’s Nations (UN) public commitment to respect human rights is embedded in its operations through related policies and processes. It also includes an ongoing process Guiding Principles of human rights due diligence, as well as processes for providing remedy to anyone harmed where a business caused or contributed to – through its own on Business and operations or business relationships – that harm.

Within the framework of our Sustainability360º Agenda, we have created a management system for human rights due diligence in our own operations. There are four steps in Valmet’s site-level human rights impact assessment. The first step includes stakeholder engagement activities, entailing interviews and discussions with managers and employees, as well as suppliers. Based on the interviews and other information collected, we can identify actual and potential negative impacts on people – which is also the second step in the process. Analysis of impacts forms the third step and examines what causes the impacts, and how Valmet contributes to or is linked to negative impacts on human rights. The fourth step is the implementation of the action plan to improve human rights-related routines and practices. As part of our efforts to create a high-quality system, the human rights impact assessment was piloted in 2018.
