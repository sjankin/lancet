Lantmännen Annual Report 2019 9 Chairman’s comments A good, high-quality harvest is important both to Lantmännen and farming – regardless of whether you keep livestock or grow crops. It was therefore significant that this year’s grain harvest was better than the average for many who had been affected by heat and drought in 2018. It is with both pride and pleasure that we can say that this perspective.

See also note 7. Deferred tax assets and tax liabilities Assessments are made to determine deferred tax assets and tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets, which arise mainly from unused tax losses or unused tax credits, are recognized as an asset when it is considered likely that the deferred tax assets can be utilized and offset against future taxable profits. Other assumptions regarding the outcome of these future taxable profits, as well as changes in tax rates and rules can result in significant differences in the measurement of deferred taxes.

Lantmännen always conducts annual impairment testing (usually in the third four-month period) of cash-generating units that contain goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, irrespective of whether there is any indication that the assets may be impaired. The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is determined by calculating their value in use. Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to be derived from continuing use of the asset. The estimates for the year are based on adopted budgets for 2020 and adopted strategic plans for 2021 and 2022. The calculation of value in use is also based on what management believes are reasonable market assumptions, and includes cash flow projections for the existing operations, with annual growth after 2022 assumed to be weak, i.e. about 2 percent for most operations. 102 Lantmännen Annual Report 2019 Note 9 Finance income and costs 2019 2018 MSEK Income Costs Total Income Costs Total Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Dividend 6 6 Capital gains/losses 1 1 1 1 1 7 Financial assets measured at amortized cost Interest income, receivables from members 42 42 39 39 Other interest income 54 54 42 42 96 81 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income Dividend 1) 7 7 4 4 Capital gains/losses 0 0 Impairment, reversal of impairment 0 1 1 7 5 Derivatives used in hedge accounting Interest on currency forward contracts and swaps 8 8 3 3 Ineffective portion of hedges 0 0 8 3 Other financial liabilities measured at amortized cost Interest expense, pension plans –13 –13 –12 –12 Interest expense, liabilities to members –24 –24 –20 –20 Interest expense, liabilities to the public –10 –10 –8 –8 Interest expense, borrowing –150 –150 –196 –196 Interest expenses, lease liabilities –58 –58 Other interest expenses –24 –24 –13 –13 Other borrowing expenses 0 0 0 0 Currency effects –43 –43 –40 –40 –322 –289 Total 112 –322 –210 96 –289 –193 1) Of which MSEK 0 attributable to shares sold in the financial year.

Lantmännen Annual Report 2019 149 The previous target of –40 percent for the period 2009-2020 was achieved in 2015. Lantmännen has therefore set a target for a further 40 percent reduction in emissions from its own production by 2020, with 2015 as the base year. Emissions from production show a decline of 8 percent from the previous year in absolute figures. This is a consequence of the transition to origin-labeled electricity and a number of conversions to renewable energy. Just over half of the total emissions come from use of natural gas in the bakery operations. Lantmännen Lantbruk’s emissions have increased, due to a significant need for drying after the large but wet harvest and new Finnish feed production that uses district heating, some of which comes from fossil natural gas. For emissions by Sector and Business Area, see the descriptions from page 33 onwards. In 2019, transport increased due to increased production, centralization of production and warehousing and the return of exports to normal volumes after the 2018 drought. Despite this, climate emissions remain at the same level due to a higher proportion of biofuels in the Nordic region. Emissions from shipping transport in the Agriculture Sector and the Danish bakery operations increased. As a result of improved reporting, additional transport by truck and also by sea to the US has been included. The outcome for the target to reduce climate emissions from purchased transport by 70 percent in relation to net sales in the period 2009-2030 is in line with the base year 2009. To achieve the ambitious target, we are working together with logistics partners and the industry to find solutions for fuel conversion and efficiency improvements. The 2018 outcome for the indicator has been adjusted GHG emissions, scope 1, 2 and 3 from a 4 percent reduction to an 8 percent increase.

We do not accept discrimination, intimidation, oppression or harassment in any form. Lantmännen works on long-term initiatives to improve equality in recruitment and career development. Lantmännen has implemented a tool for more objective and inclusive potential assessment. Our employee survey includes a question about whether discrimination has been experienced in the organization, and if so in what way. This is done in order to identify and manage risks and areas of improvement. Any deviations are followed up in the form of reported cases through the whistleblowing and HR functions.

Lantmännen Annual Report 2019 153 Human rights Lantmännen has a significant responsibility for human rights as a player in all stages of the grain value chain. Human rights can be affected directly and indirectly through land use, environmental impacts, in the supply chain, in production and in the marketing and use of our products. Management approach We support and respect internationally proclaimed human rights and work on the basis of the UN’s guiding principles for business and human rights, which we are integrating into our governance and processes. We work actively to ensure that our employees are treated fairly, equally and with respect, and to manage human rights risks in our operations. We expect our suppliers and business partners to act in the same way towards their employees and the people affected by the operations. This is made clear in the Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct, which reflect Lantmännen’s view on work environment and social conditions, including freedom of association, working hours, salaries, forced labor, child labor, discrimination and oppression. Lantmännen works to establish and implement procedures and systems that identify risks associated with human rights throughout our value chain. We have chosen to integrate risk screening into existing internal processes and into our Group-wide Enterprise Risk Management process. All risks in the Group’s operations are assessed on the basis of the impact on people and we use the criteria in the UN’s guiding principles for business and human rights. We endeavor to maintain an up-to-date analysis of our significant human rights risks and their management.
