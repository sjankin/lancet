Corporate Social Responsibility Pyramid JuhlerGroup 2019 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 3 A Message from the CEO We are constantly improving relations with our stakeholders as well as with the surrounding society. Our regular CSR meetings are valuable in order to create new ideas for reducing our carbon footprint as well as for improving our relations to staff, candidates and clients. We have policies in place to secure no tolerance in relation to harassment and to secure equal opportunities for all staff in regards to race, Erik Dyrmann Juhler gender and age. It is essential for us constantly to monitor the quality of our service for clients and candidates. We use Net Promotor Score internally and are active with external evaluating sites like Trustpilot. Bi-annual staff surveys makes it possible for us to determine how our staff feel about a number of elements of their employment in the JuhlerGroup: Induction, Ongoing training, management’s ability to support and motivate etc. This is valuable information that enable us to improve elements that score low in satisfaction.

JuhlerGroup 2019 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 5 We, as a multi-national recruitment organization, feel that it is important for us to have our own human rights policy within our group to indicate respect and fair employment treatment. Again, we allow each operating company to make modifications on their own human rights policy, to suit their local labour regulations. We expect each operating company to handle this policy seriously to optimise our business value and maintain consistency in our corporate citizenship.

JuhlerGroup 2019 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 7 Our Priorities In JuhlerGroup, we are aware of how vital the environment is towards life on Earth, and attempt to do our part in improving and maintaining its healthy state. We are proud to not only participate in several different The Environment sustainable initiatives annually, but also support the “Plant a Tree” campaign and invest in environmentally driven companies. Furthermore, we employ small strategies, such as promoting digital invoices to clients, to minimise the environmental impact of our operations. CEO of JuhlerGroup, Erik Dyrmann Juhler, always Employee Engagement stresses that staff are the most important assets in the company. Thus, ongoing training and regular feedback surveys are essential tools for the group. Onboarding Group provides JuhlerGroup with a HR Ecosystem, ensuring that the organisational integration of new hires is a necessary and structured onboarding approach. We believe that with this onboarding program, we can retain staff for longer, not only saving costs on staff turnover, but also helping staff adapt to the company culture swiftly so that they can start to contribute efficiently. The measurement system runs across six dimensions – culture, compliance, connections, collaboration, competence, and results, in order to demonstrate how far the new hires have come into the Onboarding process. JuhlerGroup 2019 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 8 Environmental Strategies Almost every company within the JuhlerGroup arranges and executes their own environmental conservation initiatives annually, all of which can be referred to in the ‘CSR overview of each operating company’ section of this report. Green Investments JuhlerGroup attempts to cover total electricity consumption through green investments. Nordic Solar Energy, a Danish solar cell company, has partnered with JuhlerGroup in the project of calculating how much we need to invest, in proportion to our energy consumption if we want to be CO2 neutral. Green energy production in 2017 Green energy production in 2018 581.571 kWh 880.000 kWh Saving the planet 291 ton CO2 Saving the planet 440 ton CO2 Juhler Holding A/S, the holding company of all operating companies within the JuhlerGroup, has invested in tree plantations in Latvia as a long-term investment, and expects to receive a return from this project. Both of these projects support our CSR goals and help us achieve our goal of covering 100 percent of our CO2 emissions with green investments; therefore, we invest not only for profit, but also to benefit the environment. JuhlerGroup 2019 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 9 “Plant a Tree” Campaign Tree restoration is extremely Amount of tree planted: beneficial towards the environment and surrounding communities as it can: Total: 59,857 • Improve water and air quality, soil health, and biodiversity • Provide sustainable timber, 11,800 as of 2016 fibre, and fuel • Provide food and forest products • Create rural jobs and 15,240 as of 2017 recreational opportunities • Help mitigate climate change By planting trees in our business, we 17,851 as of 2018 have been able to contribute to: • The restoration of 175,000 native trees 14,966 as at Q3 of • The development of a 2019 methodology to monitor forest cover via high resolution satellite images For 4 consecutive years JuhlerGroup has • The production of a national, supported the “Plant a Tree” campaign, long-distance restoration in which a tree has been planted for training program. every assignment filled.

(Employee handbook and contact for temp candidate shall highlight this and indicate clearly the procedure of report) • Work diversity – Gender analysis within our organisation across different age groups. • CSR reporting system – Whistle blower JuhlerGroup 2019 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 11 Social • Since 2016 JuhlerGroup has been engaged in the work between war veterans and the business community. The road from military to civil is by no means always easy for veterans who have served for Denmark in the world’s hot spots. A large group of resourceful veterans have built up unique competencies that have been tested during sometimes extreme conditions, but hey often lack guidance to translate it into competencies in business. VelkommenHJEM (Welcome Home) is an Danish organization, who wants to create better conditions for the veterans, among other things through active mentoring. • Temp Team Denmark makes its competencies available through mentoring and personal guidance. Temp Team separately completed 10 successful mentorings in 2018 and 6 successful cases in 2019. • ‘The challenges faced by the large group of resourceful veterans when they want to move to a civilian career have so far been overlooked. As a company, we can help to lift this social responsibility by, through personal guidance, contributing with our core competencies, including our knowledge of what competencies the business community demands.’ says Birgitte Sørensen, Director Temp Team Denmark. Our board member, Kim Pedersen, has been nominated to Colonel Lieutenant with certain HR responsibilities within the army. JuhlerGroup 2019 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 12 Anti-Corruption Policy and Practice Corruption definition “Transparency International defines corruption as ‘the abuse of entrusted power for personal gain’.” • Can exist in two different forms ‘true corrupt intent’ (bribery, actions that can help an organization attain unlawful benefits) and ‘necessary corruption’ (to get things done, attaining legally entitled benefits) • Mainly occurs through: ! Bribery – defined by Transparency International as “the offering, promising, giving, accepting or soliciting of an advantage as an inducement for an action which is illegal, unethical or a breach of trust. Inducements can take the form of gifts, loans, fees, rewards or other advantages (taxes, services, donations, favors etc.).” ! Embezzlement – The fraudulent appropriation of money or property for personal gain by an individual entrusted to safeguard assets in another’s interests (e.g., governments, organizations, or companies). Embezzlement can be committed by a person entrusted with private or public resources. ! Fraud – The use of deception, trickery and a breach of trust to gain an unfair or unlawful advantage. Occupational fraud entails the use of one’s occupation for personal enrichment through the deliberate misuse or misapplication of the company’s resources or assets. ! Extortion – The unlawful use of one’s position or office to obtain money through coercion or threats. One example would be when customs officials request undue ‘customs duties’ from importers as a condition to clear their goods. ! *all definitions have been extracted from GAN’s Corruption Dictionary which can be found here. The JuhlerGroup expects that all staff are committed to avoid any and all practices of corruption, unethical business practices and harassment. It is the managing director’s duty to ensure that all employees working in their company have read and comply with JuhlerGroup’s Anti-Corruption Policy. The CEO of JuhlerGroup together with all the directors across different companies pledge to comply the anti-corruption policy. We have zero tolerance for bribery, corruption and any type of harassment, with the access by conducting annual internal audit. Control and communication are by recording financial and administrative documents. Enforcing a whistle-blowing system (encouraging employees to report if they have suspicions) is in the process, meanwhile an email or letter can send to csradmin@juhlergroup.com. HQ has the responsibility to secure whistle blowing without fear of adverse consequences. JuhlerGroup 2019 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 13 Anti-Corruption Policy 1. JuhlerGroup has a zero-tolerance approach towards all forms of bribery and corruption, and is dedicated to incorporating strategies that combat these. We act ethically and professionally in all our business activities across the group. 2. This policy applies to all JuhlerGroup employees on all levels, wherever located. As well as others who act on the behalf of JuhlerGroup, including agents, representatives or freelancers, vendors, clients and other service providers. 3. The prohibition on corruption applies to the giving of anything of value not only money if it is at the cost of the company: • Cash, cash equivalents (e.g. gift cards, sales discount, under the table commission) • Payments for improper gifts, meals, travel and entertainment • Promises to pay or give anything of value • Favours, including hiring an employee due to a special relationship with one of the key personnel within the group, rather than the talent of the candidate. • Engaging a vendor or supplier from related parties without disclosing that relationship to the company or comparing the quotation in the market. 4. We shall ensure that corporate gifts are given without any intention of benefitting in business. A written record of all hospitality and gifts accepted or offered should be kept for amounts of more than Euro10 per item. 5. We should never create any record or transaction that is false or misleading, and should strive to maintain proper and accurate accounts accordingly to the Accounting Standards and Compact Act. 6. Donations or sponsorships made by the company should always be legal, ethical, and approved by the Charity Committee as well as the local director. 7. The prevention, detection and reporting of all kinds of corruption are the responsibility of the local management team. A written statement highlighting anti-corruption, should be signed by the local management team. 8. There is a confidential process for anyone wishing to report or show concern regarding anti-corruption within JuhlerGroup. An anonymous email or letter can be sent to csradmin@juhlergroup.com. JuhlerGroup 2019 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 14 Measurement of Outcomes Safe and suitable working environment According to outcomes from the Employees Satisfaction Survey, all employees rated the scores above 7 and the average score was 9, clearly indicating that employees are satisfied with current working environment. Employee engagement Ongoing training is to ensure the career path development of employee within the group or individual company. Juhlergroup conduct Employee Satisfaction Survey twice a year in June and November to measure the engagement level of all employees from the feedback of job satisfaction, quality of training, motivation and conflict level. The feedback gives management valuable actionable data that we can implement for organization growth. Due to previous surveys are anonymous, we decided to conduct an open (non-anonymous) survey in November. Anonymous survey remains to send in June every year. We hope each types of surveys not only for CSR report also is useful for local management team.

HQ will continue to closely to follow up on this data and improve the management skills. Outcome of Employee Satisfaction Survey November 2019 JuhlerGroup conducts anonymous Employee Satisfaction Surveys last few years. The downside of anonymity is that the certain respondents are dissatisfied and local management is not able to follow up to figure out how to fix that particular problem. Regular follow up from local management is extremely important for employees to stay motivated. Therefore, HQ decided to conduct an Open/Non-Anonymous Survey in November, the local management has opportunity to follow up on feedback and take tailored actions to fix employee’s issues. HQ hope could get local management support and encourage all employees to participate the Open Employee Satisfaction Survey. In November, we had 62 staffs out of 223 participated on Employee Satisfaction Survey in correspondence to the responses rate 28%.
