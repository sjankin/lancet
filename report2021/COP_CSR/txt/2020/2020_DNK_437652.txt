As a result, the profit before tax amounts to a loss of DKK 1,641 million. Adjusted for write-downs of rolling stock and other non-recurring items, DSB achieved a profit before tax of DKK 84 million. • The Long-distance & Regional train rolling stock has been written down with DKK 1,535 million, and • 11 IC4 train sets have been completely removed from operations and, as a result, written down by DKK 151 million. • The acquisition of a new electric train fleet is on schedule • High punctuality for S-trains, while punctuality for Long-distance & Regional trains is challenged • A small increase in the number of journeys sold compared to last year • The sale of Orange and Orange Free tickets has almost doubled • Increased market share for Great Belt crossings • Four ambitious goals for climate and the environment have been decided upon • In January 2019, the worst train accident in 30 years took place. It involved the death of 8 passengers, and 16 were injured, and the Accident Investigation Board of Denmark has now published its final report on the incident. “Looking forward, there are a number of external conditions that result in decreasing passenger revenue compared to the assumptions in DSB’s traffic contract with the state, and we are, therefore, writing down the value of our rolling stock.” Flemming Jensen, CEO Finances In 2019, DSB operated at a pre-tax loss of DKK 1,641 million. This negative result is overwhelmingly the result of write-downs of rolling stock for Long-distance & Regional trains. Corrected for write-downs and other non-recurring items, the result for 2019 was a pre-tax profit of DKK 84 million. The assessed value of the rolling stock is based on projected future earnings. The growth forecasts that were the basis for DSB’s traffic contract with the state have not materialised, and a reevaluation of the value of the rolling stock has, therefore, been undertaken. The re-evaluation demonstrated that the book value of the current rolling stock was too high compared to the projected future earnings, and as a result, the rolling stock has been written down by DKK 1,535 million. Additionally, an evaluation has been made of how many IC4 trains will be needed until the new electric trains are phased in. This has resulted in 11 IC4 trains being completely removed from operations and, as a result, written down by DKK 151 million. In total, DSB’s rolling stock for Long-distance & Regional trains has, therefore, been written down by DKK 1,686 million. The management’s review 3 In the coming years, we will replace our ageing diesel-driven train fleet with a modern, uniform fleet of electric trains and locomotives. Together with the required improvements of the railway infrastructure, this is expected to contribute to renewed growth in passenger turnover. The pre-tax profit of DKK 84 million, adjusted for write-downs and non-recurring item, is DKK 163 million lower than in 2018. The lower result, which is not satisfactory, is mainly due to decreasing passenger revenue, reduced traffic contract payment and increased costs of spare parts for the ageing rolling stock and also rising energy prices. The decrease in passenger revenue compared to 2018 was DKK 112 million, or 2 percent. The decrease is due to a significantly lower average price for journeys across the Great Belt, which is primarily driven by an increased supply of Orange and Orange Free tickets. The aim of the lower prices is to make trains more competitive. A large number of Orange and Orange Free tickets were sold during the last 2-3 months of the year, and at the end the year, this increase in sales has more or less compensated for the lower average price. At the same time, DSB’s market share for Great Belt crossings has increased. Looking at the fourth quarter alone, the pre-tax profit adjusted for non-recurring items was at DKK 82 million, compared to a result of DKK 130 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The results adjusted for non-recurring items for both the fourth quarter and the year are in line with previously stated expectations. Negative financial impact of the opening of the City Ring The current revenue-sharing model in the Copenhagen area means that Metroselskabet I/S receives a share of the total passenger revenue that exceeds the metro’s share of the total number of journeys in the Copenhagen area. This disproportionate share (the so-called metro double factor) has a negative impact on DSB’s passenger revenue. With the opening of the City Ring in September 2019, the impact of the metro double factor in the coming years will gradually be increased by up to DKK 200 million per year. The impact is expected to grow to somewhere in the range of DKK 350-400 million in 2021. The impact of the metro double factor in the annual report and the consolidated annual account has so far been offset in DSB’s passenger revenue without further specification. However, the growing impact of this will not provide a true and fair view of the development of DSB’s actual passenger revenue. Therefore, from and including the annual report and consolidated annual account for 2019, it will be specified so that the impact of the metro double factor can be seen as in the table below. DSB’s passenger revenue the impact of the metro double factor DKK million 2019 2018 Passenger revenue after the impact of the metro double factor 5,173 5,285 Metro double factor 226 192 DSB’s passenger revenue before the impact of the metro 5,399 5,477 double factor 4 The management’s review Customers continued growth in the sale of Orange tickets In 2019, 187.2 million journeys were undertaken with DSB, which is 0.5 million more than in 2018. The number of journeys across the Great Belt increased by 3 percent, while the rest of the traffic for Long-distance & Regional trains decreased by 1 percent. There were 111.9 million Strain journeys, which is 0.9 million more than in 2018. DSB’s market share for traffic across the Great Belt has increased by 0.6 percent in the second half of 2019 and amounted to 20.5 percent at the end of 2019. The growth is, among other things, due to the significantly increased supply of Orange and Orange Free tickets in 2019. At the same time, the second half of the year has not seen comprehensive track works in connection with the regional traffic. Finally, the increasing awareness of trains as a sustainable form of transport also contributes to this. In 2019, 2.7 million Orange and Orange Free tickets were sold for Great Belt crossings compared to 1.7 million in 2018. The idea behind Orange and Orange Free tickets is to fill empty seats on departures with spare capacity. In terms of price, the Orange Free ticket is somewhere between the Orange ticket and the standard ticket, and it is flexible if the customer needs to change the departure time. The aim is to get more people to take the train and to utilise our capacity better. Orange Free tickets can be bought until shortly before departure, and if you buy a ticket a few days before a journey, then it is possible to find a cheaper ticket. Cheaper tickets help to get more passengers on the train, and thus also contribute towards reducing congestion in the major cities as well as making the traffic more climate-friendly and sustainable. In 2019, DSB agreed upon ambitious targets for the environment and climate DSB has agreed on ambitious targets that will make a significant contribution to a greener, less congested Denmark. The train is already the climate-friendly option but we want to be more than that. We have, therefore, formulated four sustainability targets that are to be met between now and 2030: We want to be completely carbon neutral, we want to reduce our energy consumption by 50 percent, we want to avoid emitting particles from the train engines, and we want to reuse at least 90 percent of our waste. A large part of the contribution of train services towards making Denmark sustainable is to be achieved via the planned modernisation of the railway, the acquisition of electric trains and the establishment of new and modern workshops, but it is a large and complex task to ensure that DSB meets its targets on all parameters. In 2019 we have, therefore, set up a team led by a Sustainability Manager who will be in charge of the coordinated efforts on this area. The Sustainability Manager reports directly to DSB’s CEO. Opening of the new electrified high-speed line between Copenhagen and Ringsted The new electrified high-speed line between Copenhagen and Ringsted opened in May 2019. This is a key route for the Long-distance & Regional train traffic. It is an improvement of public transport which will help meet the future demands for transport and contribute to reducing congestion in the cities. The new route will improve the connections between Zealand and the rest of Denmark. With the opening of this new line, the new Køge Nord station was also opened. The intention behind the station is that it will develop into a central hub with the option to change trains to and from the S-train and with a “park and go” facility right at the motorway. The management’s review 5 Reopening of a renovated and modernised Østerport Station and the opening of the City Ring After two years of comprehensive renovation work, we re-opened a renovated Østerport Station in September 2019. Østerport Station is also one of the new connection stations for the City Ring, which was also opened in September 2019. Together with the Metro, we will help to ensure that there is less congestion on the streets of Copenhagen and the approach roads and thereby positively impact the climate. Functional public transport is a vital element in the green transition. “At DSB, we have set ambitious goals for the climate and the environment. The train is the climate-friendly choice, and the more people that we can convince to take the train instead of going by car, the greater our impact on the climate accounts.” Flemming Jensen, CEO S-trains on time punctuality is high, and contract targets are met Both customer punctuality and operator punctuality the part of punctuality that DSB is solely responsible for were, in 2019, 93.0 percent and 98.2 percent, respectively, and, therefore, in line with figures for punctuality in 2018 and above the contract targets set by the state. In the fourth quarter, customer punctuality and operator punctuality were 93.2 percent and 98.2 percent, respectively. The 300,000 daily Copenhagen S-train customers have thus arrived on time in the vast majority of cases. However, it is regrettable that some customers are negatively impacted by the necessary work involving tracks and signals. Customer punctuality for Long-distance & Regional trains is still facing challenges The customer punctuality for Long-distance & Regional trains in 2019 was 79.1 percent, which is around the same as it was in 2018. Customer punctuality is below the traffic contract’s target of 83.4 percent. Punctuality has been particularly negatively impacted by infrastructure works and delays from Sweden. Rail Net Denmark’s absolutely necessary track, signal and electrification work will, in the long term, contribute to ensuring that Denmark will have a modern, effective and climate-friendly railway – but right now and for the next couple of years it will be inconvenient to the rail travellers for extended periods. Delays from Sweden are unfortunately adversely affecting the Danish train customers to an increasing degree. When trains from Sweden arrive late at Copenhagen Central Station, they create disturbances in the entire Danish Long-distance & Regional train traffic, particularly on Kystbanen (The Coastal Line). DSB and the Swedish operator have been talking to each other about initiatives that contribute to handling these delays. In 2019, operator punctuality was 94.9 percent. This is an increase relative to 2018, and punctuality is generally stable as a result of a more robust timetable and fewer rolling stock faults. The latter can mainly be attributed to an increased focus on improving the maintenance of trains in 2019. The operator punctuality of 94.9 percent is above the traffic contract’s target of 93.4 percent. 6 The management’s review A new electric train fleet will streamline the train service and contribute to climate targets In the coming years, we will replace our ageing diesel-driven train fleet with a modern, uniform fleet of electric trains and locomotives. This will be a comprehensive renewal of the train fleet which will ensure significant improvements for our customers and which is at the same time necessary in order to realise the societal, operational budget-related and environmental gains from the electrification of the railway moving towards 2030. The new electric train fleet will thus make a significant contribution to our ambition to be carbon neutral in 2030 and to the fulfilment of the major national climate ambitions. The purchase of the new electric train fleet is proceeding according to plan, and we are ready to commission the new electric rolling stock concurrently with Rail Net Denmark’s electrification of the railway. We expect that the new Vectron electric locomotives will be commissioned in regional train traffic on Zealand from 2021, and the new coaches are planned to be commissioned in passenger operations in 2023. The new electric train sets are expected to be commissioned in passenger operations from 2024. Concurrently with the purchase of new locomotives, coaches and trains, we will establish new modern workshops, which will further contribute to an effective and stable train service. The management’s review 7 The Accident Investigation Board Denmark’s final report has been delivered 2019 was off to the worst imaginable start, as on 2 January a semi-trailer, carried by a freight train on the Great Belt bridge, got loose and collided with an IC4 passenger train coming from the opposite direction. Eight passengers lost their lives in the collision, and 18 people were injured. We have assisted the authorities with their investigation of the chain of events prior to the accident. On 18 December, the Accident Investigation Board Denmark delivered its final report on the accident in which the board states that “...based on the investigations, we conclude that the semitrailer was almost certainly loaded correctly with the kingpin in place, but the lock which should have fastened the semi-trailer to the freight train was not working correctly, and the semi-trailer was, therefore, not fastened to the flatbed railway wagon.” In connection with the report, the Accident Investigation Board Denmark also proposed a number of safety recommendations. “Denmark is viewed as one of the safest countries around the world when it comes to train operations. The accident on 2 January does not change this: Our customers should take their safety for granted but we must never do so.” Flemming Jensen, CEO Taastrup, 6 February 2020 _________________________ _______________________ Peter Schütze Flemming Jensen Chairman of the Board CEO The annual report is published in both a Danish and an English language version.

Events that have occurred after the balance sheet date No events have occurred after 31 December 2019 which, in the opinion of the management, have a significant impact on the assessment of the annual report for 2019. Other matters There are no other events which, in the opinion of the management, have a significant impact on the assessment of the annual report for 2019. 26 Results Results 27 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts Management statement on the annual report and the independent auditors’ report Management statement The Board of Directors and the Executive Board have today discussed and approved the annual report for DSB for 2019. The Annual Report is presented in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and the Danish DSB Act. We consider the accounting policies applied to be appropriate. Accordingly, the annual report gives a true and fair view of the group's and the parent corporation’s assets, liabilities and financial position at 31 December 2019 and of the results of the group's and the parent corporation’s operations and the group’s cash flows for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2019. In our view the management’s review contains a well-founded assessment of the development in the group’s and the parent corporation’s activities and financial conditions, the result for the year and the group’s and the parent corporation’s financial position in general and a description of the most important risks and uncertainty factors to which the group and the parent corporation are subject. The annual report is recommended for approval by the annual meeting.

The consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts are presented in accordance with the provisions of the Danish Financial Statements Act and the DSB Act. In our view the consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts give a true and fair view of the group’s and the independent public corporation DSB’s assets, liabilities and financial position as of 31 December 2019 and of the result of the group’s and the independent public corporation DSB’s activities and the group’s cash flows for the financial year 1 January 31 December 2019 in accordance with the provisions of the Danish Financial Statements Act and the DSB Act. Basis of opinion We have conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark as well as good public auditing practice, as the audit is carried out on the basis of the provisions in the DSB Act. Our responsibility according to these standards and requirements is described in detail in the section Auditor’s responsibility for the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts . We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Independence The Auditor General is independent of the independent public corporation DSB pursuant to section 1(6) of the Danish Auditor General’s Act and the approved auditor is independent of the independent public corporation DSB pursuant to international ethical rules for auditors (IESBA’s ethical rules) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. We have both fulfilled our additional ethical obligations under these rules and requirements. The management’s responsibility for the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts The management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and the DSB Act. Management is also responsible for such internal controls as it deems necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts, the management is responsible for assessing the independent public corporation DSB’s ability to continue operations, providing information on conditions regarding continued operation, if relevant, and preparConsolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 29 ing the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts based on the going concern accounting principle unless the management intends to liquidate the independent public corporation DSB, suspend operations or has no other realistic alternative than to do so. The auditor’s responsibility for the audit of the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts Our aim is to obtain a high degree of assurance that the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, regardless of whether this is due to fraud or errors, and to issue an auditor’s report and express an opinion. A high degree of assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with international standards on audits and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, as well as good public auditing practice, cf. the DSB Act, will always discover material misstatements when such are present. Misstatements may occur as a result of fraud or error and may be regarded as material if it can reasonably be expected that the misstatement, or parts thereof, affects the financial decisions made by the users of the accounts based on the annual accounts. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with international auditing standards and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, as well as good public auditor practice, cf. the DSB Act, we perform professional assessments and maintain professional scepticism during the audit. In addition: • We identify and assess the risk of material misstatements in the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts regardless of whether this is due to fraud or error, prepare and carry out audit procedures in response to these risks and obtain audit evidence that is adequate and suitable for forming a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting material misstatement due to fraud is higher than for material misstatement due to error, since fraud may include conspiracies, forgery, intentional omission, misrepresentation or the disregarding of internal controls. • We obtain understanding of the internal control with relevance for the audit in order to be able to prepare audit procedures that are suitable under the circumstances, but not in order to be able to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the independent public corporation DSB’s internal controls. • We determine whether the accounting policies applied by the management are suitable and whether the accounting estimates made by management and related information are reasonable. • We express an opinion as to whether the management’s preparation of the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts based on the going concern accounting principle is suitable and whether, based on the audit evidence obtained, there is material uncertainty associated with events or conditions which may give rise to significant doubt as to the independent public corporation DSB’s ability to continue operations. If we find that there is material uncertainty, we must state in our auditor’s report that the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts contain information on this or, if such information is not adequate, modify our opinion. Our opinion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may result in the independent public corporation DSB being unable to continue operations. 30 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts • We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts, including the information in the notes, and whether the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts reflect the underlying transactions and events and thus present a true and fair view of these. • We obtain sufficient and suitable audit evidence for the financial information for companies or business activities in the group for the purposes of expressing an opinion on the consolidated annual accounts. We are responsible for managing, overseeing and carrying out the group audit. We are solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the executive management on the planned scope and timing of the audit as well as significant audit observations, including any significant defects in internal control which we identify during our audit. Statement on the management’s review The management is responsible for the management’s review. Our opinion on the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts does not include the management’s review and we do not express any opinion with certainty on the management’s review. In connection with our audit of the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts, it is our responsibility to read the management’s review and consider whether the management’s review is significantly inconsistent with the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts or our knowledge obtained during our audit or in any other way seems to contain material misstatement. Our responsibility is also to consider whether the management’s review contains the required information pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act. Based on the work performed, we find that the management’s review is in accordance with the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We have not identified any material misstatement in the management’s review. Declaration pursuant to other legislation and other regulation Statement on legal-critical audit and performance audit The management is responsible for ensuring that the transactions covered by the financial reporting are in accordance with reported grants, legislation and other stipulations, as well as with agreements concluded and the usual practice. The management is also responsible for ensuring that due financial consideration is taken for the management of the funds and operations of the companies included in the annual accounts. In that context, the management is responsible for setting up systems and processes that promote frugality, productivity and efficiency. In connection with our audit of the annual accounts, it is our responsibility to complete a legalcritical audit and a management audit of selected topics in accordance with good public accounting practice. During our legal-critical audit, we verify with a high degree of certainty for the selected topics whether the examined transactions covered by the financial reporting are in accordConsolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 31 ance with the relevant provisions of grants, legislation and other stipulations in addition to concluded agreements and the usual practice. During our management audit, we assess with a high degree of certainty whether the systems, processes or transactions examined support the appropriate financial considerations applied to the administration of the funds and operations covered by the annual accounts. If we conclude that our work has given rise to significant critical comments we must report on this in this statement. We have no significant critical comments to report in this connection.

The determination of the recoverable amount is based on significant estimates in relation to future financial earnings. The impairment test performed and the estimates made are described in more detail in the note tangible assets (section 3), to which reference is made. Othe significant accounting estimates A number of accounting estimates have been used for establishing and complying with accounting practices. The measurement of the accounting estimate value of certain assets and liabilities are based on estimates of how future events will impact the value of these assets and liabilities on the balance sheet date. Estimates that are significant to delivering the accounts are made, among other things, for the life expectancy of non-current assets, the money flows from investments and the associated discounting rates, sales values, deferred provisions and contingent liabilities. The estimates and assumptions are also based on historical experiences and other factors that senior management assess as reasonable under the circumstances, but which, due to their nature, are uncertain and unpredictable. The assumptions may be incomplete or inexact, and unexpected events or circumstances may occur. Furthermore, the business activities are subject to risks and uncertainties that cannot be controlled and which may lead to the actual results deviating from these estimates. 42 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts Section 2 Operation This section concerns items that are included in This section contains the following notes: Operating profit. 2.1 Net revenue 2.2 Work performed by the enterprise The section includes information on earnings and and capitalised costs in connection with the carrying out of 2.3 Other operating income operations. 2.4 Commercial property development 2.5 Expenses for raw materials and The main events in 2019 are further detailed in consumables Results financial activities 2.6 Other external expenses 2.7 Consultancy fees excluding audit fees 2.8 Audit fee 2.9 Remuneration for Board of Directors and Executive Board 2.10 Staff costs Note 2.1: Net revenue Parent corporation Group 2018 2019 Amounts in DKK million 2019 2018 Passenger revenues distributed on business areas: 3,823 3,711 Long-distance & Regional Trains 3,690 3,802 1,483 1,483 S-trains 1,483 1,483 5,306 5,194 Total passenger revenue 5,173 5,285 3,941 4,025 Revenue from traffic contracts 4,025 4,051 10 6 Repair and maintenance of rolling stock etc. 298 303 45 50 Sale and leasing of rolling stock 50 45 9,302 9,275 Total 9,546 9,684 Parent corporation Group 2018 2019 Amounts in DKK million 2019 2018 Passenger revenue effect from Metrodobbeltfaktor 3,871 3,770 Long-distance & Regional Trains, without effect from Metrodobbeltfaktor 3,749 3,850 48 59 Metrodobbeltfaktor * 59 48 3,823 3,711 Long-distance & Regional Trains 3,690 3,802 1,627 1,650 S-trains, without effect from Metrodobbeltfaktor 1,650 1,627 144 167 Metrodobbeltfaktor* 167 144 1,483 1,483 S-trains 1,483 1,483 *If the effect of Metrodobbeltfaktor stops, DSB’s contract payments may be affected, cf.

Disposals is mainly comprised of costs for external consultants, direct salaries and purchased materials. Accounting practices Intangible assets comprise primarily development projects, including rights of use and software. Development projects are included as intangible assets if the cost price can be measured reliably and there is a sufficient degree of certainty that the future earnings can cover the sales and administration costs in addition to the development costs themselves. It is a prerequisite that the projects are clearly defined and identifiable, and that the technical feasibility, sufficient resources and a potential future market or development opportunity in the company can be indicated. Other development costs are recognised as expenses in the income statement as they are incurred. Development costs included in the balance sheet are measured at cost price less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs. The cost price for development projects include costs also staff costs and amortisation that can be directly linked to the company’s development activities. Interest and borrowing expenses on loans for financing of development projects are recognised in cost provided they relate to the development period. All other financing expenses are recognised in the income statement. After completion of the development work, development projects are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. The amortisation period is usually 3-10 years. Profits and losses on disposal are calculated as the difference between the sales price less sales costs and the carrying amount at the time of sale. Profits and losses are recognised in the income statement under Other operating income or Other external expenses. The description of costs for development projects on equity are found under accounting policies applied in section 1 under Reserve for development costs.

In 2019 an impairment requirement has been identified for rolling stock used for Long-distance & Regional lines (excluding The Coastal Line and the Kastrup Line). The need for impairment is justified by the expected development in number of journeys and the average price per journey – passenger revenues – for the period 2020-2024 is below the forecasts which was basis for DSB’s traffic contract with the state. Lines served by Long-distance & Regional trains are assessed to be the least cash flow generating units, since rolling stock does not generate stand alone cash flows. The impairment test is based on projected future earnings and the following key assumptions: • Passenger revenue in the remaining period of the traffic contract until year end 2024 • The extent and timing of track works • Total expenses – including execution of future cost reductions • Life Cycle Cost • Cost of capital • The value of the rolling stock at year end 2024. The impairment test is among other things carried out based on a budget for 2020 and a financial long term forecast for the years 2021-2024. In connection with the completed impairment test a need for write-down of rolling stock which is used for Long-distance & Regional lines has been identified, since the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. In total the impairment requirement is DKK 1,535 million for the Group and DKK 1,676 million pre-tax in the parent corporation. Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 51 Disposals for the year regarding Rolling stock can be attributed to major maintenance work, which is fully amortized, and which during the year has been replaced by the addition of similar new major maintenance work. Pursuant to the agreement concluded between the Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing and the Danish Transport, Construction and Housing Authority, DSB has, upon request from the Danish Ministry of Transport, acquired 10 train sets for leasing to the Danish Transport and Building Agency for the operation of the Coastal Line/the Øresund traffic. In connection with the financing of the train sets of EUR 40.7 million, DSB has provided the 10 train sets with a carrying amount of DKK 285 million as security. Based on previous experiences, the scrap value for rolling stock is assessed at DKK 0.

Land is not amortised. Cost includes the purchase price and costs directly related to the purchase up to the time where the asset is ready for use. With regard to own produced assets (primarily major maintenance inspections (Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of capitalised train 52 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts sets), the cost covers direct and indirect costs for materials, components, subcontractors and wages/salaries as well as borrowing cost from specific and general borrowing in direct connection with the construction of the individual asset. Costs for major maintenance inspections (LCC) of train sets are recognised separately and amortised over the useful life, which corresponds to the period until the next major maintenance inspection or when the trainset is phased out. Cost for major maintenance inspections concerning litra where the time for phasing out that litra is unknown is depreciated based on an individual assessment. Assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives based on the following assessment of their expected useful lives: Buildings 30-60 years Installations 10-15 years Rolling stock 2-25 years Operating equipment, fixtures and fittings and other equipment 3-25 years In connection with capitalisation, cost is distributed on the most important individual components (decomposition) and amortised over the useful life of this. The basis of depreciation is calculated taking into account the scrap value of the asset after the end of its useful life and reduced by any write-downs. The amortisation period and the scrap value are fixed at the time of acquisition and reassessed annually. If the scrap value exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, amortisation stops. If the amortisation period or the scrap value changes, the impact on amortisation in the future is recognised as a change of accounting estimates. Profits and losses on disposal or scrapping of tangible assets are calculated as the difference between the sales price less sales costs and the carrying amount at the time of sale or scrapping. Profits and losses are recognised in the income statement under Other operating income or Other external expenses. Properties held for sale Properties held for sale include Land and buildings that have been sold or are expected to be sold but where the transfer of risk is only expected to take place within 12 months. Properties held for sale are stated at cost price. Properties held for sale that were previously classified as tangible assets are stated at cost price minus accumulated write-downs made before the reclassification from tangible asset to Property held for sale, after which no further write-downs are made. Leasing In terms of accounting, leasing obligations are divided into finance and operating leases. Expenses regarding operational leases are recognised in the income statement over the term of the lease. Total commitments regarding operational leasing and rent agreement are disclosed under Contingent assets and liabilities in addition to Other financial obligations. Impairment of non-current assets The carrying amount of non-current assets is reviewed on the balance sheet date to decide whether there are any indications of impairment other than what is expressed through amortisation. If there are signs of such impairment, an impairment test is carried out for the relevant asset or group of assets to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. If so, a write-down is made to that lower recoverable amount. Any write-downs are recognised in the income statement. Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 53 In case of subsequence reversals of write-downs as a consequence of changes in the preconditions for the calculated recoverable value, the value of the asset is increased to the adjusted recoverable value, but not to more than the carrying amount the asset would have had if it had not been written down for impairment. 54 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts Section 4 Financing and capital structure This section describes the financing of DSB’s This section contains the following notes: activities. 4.1 Financial income and expenses 4.2 Allocation of the results The interest-bearing net debt was reduced by DKK 4.3 Investments 540 million in 2019. 4.4 Borrowing and liquidity 4.5 Interest-bearing liabilities, net 4.6 Net financial items, paid Note 4.1 Financial income and expenses Parent corporation Financial income Group 2018 2019 Amounts in DKK million 2019 2018 15 5 Interest on balances with group companies 2 2 Interest on balances with associated companies 2 2 0 0 Foreign currency exchange gains, etc. 0 0 31 5 Others 5 32 48 12 Total 7 34 Parent corporation Financial expenses Group 2018 2019 Amounts in DKK million 2019 2018 127 102 Interest on loans, debt to credit institutions etc. 105 135 1 6 Foreign currency exchange losses, etc. 6 4 128 108 Total 111 139 Financial income and expenses in 2018 were affected by income from interest on receivables from control fees that were sent to SKAT for collection.

This means that equity investments are measured at the proportionate share of the companies’ book value, calculated according to the accounting policies of the group less or plus unrealised intragroup profits and losses. Equity investments in group companies with a negative book value are measured at DKK 0, and any potential receivables from these companies are depreciated to the extent that the receivable is irrecoverable. To the extent that the parent company has a legal or actual obligation to cover a deficit exceeding the receivable, the remaining amount is recognised in Other Provisions. The net value adjustment of equity investments in group companies is shown as Reserve for net value adjustment according to the book value method in equity, to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the cost price.

In the parent corporation and the group, DKK 2,116 million of the debt portfolio was raised without state guarantee (2018: DKK 1,844 million). The remaining loans are all guaranteed by the Danish state, to which a guarantee commission is payable. The fair value of derivative financial instruments used for hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risks associated with the above Borrowing and liquidity is DKK -439 million at 31 December 2019 (2018: DKK -467 million), of which DKK -270 million is recognised in equity (2018: DKK -164 million). At 31 December 2019, derivative financial instruments with a positive and a negative fair value were DKK 39 million (2018: DKK 28 million) and DKK 473 million. (2018: DKK 523 million). Accounting practices Liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received after deduction of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan. Other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost price.

The group companies are included in the joint taxation from the time at which they are included in the consolidation and until they are excluded from the consolidation. The parent corporation is the administration unit for the joint taxation and consequently settles all payments of corporation tax with the tax authorities. The current Danish corporation tax is distributed by settlement of the joint taxation contributions between the jointly taxed companies relative to their taxable income. In this connection, any companies with a tax loss receive joint taxation contributions from companies that were able to use this loss to reduce their own tax profit. The tax for the year, which comprises current corporation tax, the year’s joint taxation contribution and changes in deferred tax, including differences as a consequence of changed tax rates, is recognised in the income statement with the share attributable to the profit/loss for the year and directly in equity by the share which may be attributed to items entered directly on equity. Current tax liabilities and receivables are included in the balance sheet as calculated tax on the taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on the taxable income for previous years and tax paid on account. Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 61 Joint taxation contributions payable and receivable are included in the balance sheet as balances with group companies.

The group’s Danish companies are jointly and severally liable for Danish withholding tax in the form of tax on dividend, royalty and interest. Any subsequent corrections of corporation and withholding taxes may increase the corporation’s liability. DSB, Kort & Godt A/S, DSB Ejendomsudvikling A/S, DSB Vedligehold A/S and Selskabet af 23.12.2014 are jointly registered for VAT and payroll tax purposes and are jointly and severally liable for payment of the companies’ aggregate VAT and payroll tax liabilities. Accounting practices Deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities. However, deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences relating to goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes and on office premises and other items, where temporary differences, apart from business acquisitions, arise at the date of acquisition without affecting the profit/loss for the year or the taxable income. In cases where the calculation of the tax value may be made according to different taxation rules, deferred tax is measured on the basis of the management’s planned use of the asset or settlement of the liability. Deferred tax assets, including the value of a tax loss allowed for carryforward and net financing expenses, are recognised as an asset at the expected value of utilisation, either through elimination of tax on future earnings or by set-off against deferred tax liabilities in the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. Deferred tax is adjusted for eliminations of unrealised intragroup profits and intragroup losses. Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rules and tax rates in the individual countries applicable according to the legislation in force at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. 62 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts Section 6 Working capital The most important items regarding working capital This section contains the following notes: include inventories, receivables, prepayments, 6.1 Inventories supplier debt and other debt. 6.2 Receivables 6.3 Prepayments (assets) 6.4 Prepayments (liabilities) 6.5 Change in working capital Note 6.1: Inventories Parent corporation Group 2018 2019 Amounts in DKK million 2019 2018 11 10 Fuel for train operation 10 11 0 0 Spare parts etc. 417 349 1 2 Sales from shops, etc. 36 36 12 12 Total 463 396 Spare parts, etc. are used for repairs and maintenance of rolling stock. For certain groups of Spare parts, etc. there is an element of uncertainty surrounding the time they are used, while emergency stockpiles are created for critical product groups with long delivery times. At 31 December 2019, the inventory has been written down due to inventory obsoleteness with a total of DKK 291 million. (2018: DKK 282 million), almost entirely related to Spare parts, etc. Accounting practices Fuel for trains and Spare parts are measured at cost according to the average cost method. Cost comprises the purchase price plus delivery costs and any processing and other costs directly or indirectly attributable to inventories. Goods for sale in shops etc. are measured at cost, calculated in accordance with the FIFO method. Cost comprises the purchase price plus delivery costs. Inventories are written down to the lower of net realisable value and cost. The net realisable value for inventories is calculated as the sales amount less completion costs and costs incurred to effect the sale. Note 6.2: Receivables Parent corporation Group 2018 2019 Amounts in DKK million 2019 2018 Trade receivables from sales and services have the following composition: 17 10 Receivables from issued control fees 10 17 115 123 Receivables, passenger revenue 123 115 88 80 Reimbursements from agencies 80 88 130 137 Others 253 249 350 350 Total 466 469 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 63 DSB is not significantly exposed to single customers, since receivables from sales and services are distributed across a significant number of customers, including private individuals, private companies and public institutions. There is no significant amount of collateral received for Trade receivables. Paid deposits are considered as collateral for receivables from leasing activities. All Trade receivables are due for payment within 1 year. Provision for losses on receivables There is an ongoing assessment of indications for loss of value for Trade receivables. In the statement of provisions for expected losses, a segmentation of the population of Trade receivables has been made. The segmentation separates the portfolio into types of customers, types of receivable and historical experiences in relation to determining losses. An average expected loss percentage is calculated based on the percentage. At 31 December 2019, provisions for losses have not been made concerning Receivables from group undertakings, Receivable joint taxation contribution, Other receivables, Prepayment, Debt to group companies, or Subordinated loan capital in associated companies. Accounting practices Receivables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to the nominal value. Provisions for expected losses are based on historical experience and is made when there is an objective indication that a receivable or portfolio fo receivables has decreased in value. If there is an objective indication that an individual receivable has lost value, there is made provisions for losses on the individual level.

Financial risks include interest rates, foreign Counterparty risk arises when counterparties fail to exchange rates, raw material prices, liquidity and fulfil their obligations. counterparties. This section contains the following notes: Interest rate risks are related to changes in financing 7.1 Interest risk interest rates. 7.2 Currency exchange rate risk 7.3 Raw materials price risk The primary currency risks relate to oil purchases 7.4 Liquidity risk and trade with international counterparties in EUR 7.5 Counterparty risk and SEK, respectively. 7.6 Market values recognized in the equity Raw materials price risk occurs in connection with the purchase of electricity and oil. As a result of its operations, investments and financing, DSB is exposed to changes in risk relating to interest, currency exchange rates, raw material prices and liquidity and counterparty risks. The financial management aims to address the associated financial risks. The overall framework is set out in the financial policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors. In accordance with this policy, DSB must monitor, calculate, administer and manage risks, in addition to continuously monitoring risk exposure and cash resources. The purpose of the financial hedging is to limit and control the impact on profit caused by fluctuations in the financial markets. There are no significant changes in risk exposure or risk management compared with 2018. Accounting practices Initial recognition of derivative financial instruments is made in the balance sheet at cost and they are subsequently measured at fair value. Positive and negative changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments are recognised in Other receivables and Other liabilities, respectively. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments which are classified as and meet the criteria for hedging of the fair value of a recognised asset or recognised liability are recognised in the income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or the hedged liability. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments which are classified as and meet the criteria for hedging of future assets or liabilities are recognised in Other receivables or Other liabilities and in Equity. If the future transaction results in the recognition of assets or liabilities, amounts previously recognised in equity will be transferred at the cost price of the respective asset or liability. If the future transaction results in income or expenses, amounts previous recognised as equity will be transferred to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item impacts the income statement. 66 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts In respect of derivative financial instruments which do not meet the conditions for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value are recognised in the income statement on an ongoing basis.

The primary interest rate exposure in this regard relates to fluctuations in CIBOR, STIBOR, NIBOR and EURIBOR. The policy is to raise all loans so that interest rate risks are only associated with CIBOR and EURIBOR. Interest rate risks are normally hedged using interest rate swaps in which variable rate loans are converted to a fixed rate. Within a 12-month period, interest rate sensitivity must not exceed DKK 100 million (with a percentage point change in interest rates), the debt portfolio must have a duration of at least 15 years, and at least 25% of the liability portfolio must be at a fixed rate. Accordingly, the weighted average duration of gross debt is 8.7 years (2018: 8.3 years). Of the financial liabilities, 100% were converted to fixed rate with maturity of longer than one year (2018: 100%). Variable rate debt is adjusted regularly during the year. Note 7.2: Currency exchange rate risk Currency risks in recognised financial assets and liabilities are hedged so that the risk is in DKK. In relation to the financial policy, risks in EUR or other currencies are only permitted if they are included in the group companies’ financing or hedging of exposure from group companies. The most significant currency exposure relates to loans in JPY, SEK, NOK, EUR and USD, which are hedged using derivative financial instruments. After hedging, DSB is not exposed to significant currency risks from financing activities. Other registered positions represent an insignificant share of the currency exposure; the future cash flow in currency is hedged 30-70% on average, as calculated for a rolling 12-month period. Currency risks associated with operations are primarily related to oil consumption. Other currency risks in relation to trade with international counterparts are limited, apart from SEK and EUR . Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 67 DSB is exposed to currency risks related to SEK as a result of a contract that has been signed to maintain the Swedish Øresund train sets and to EUR in connection to the purchase of rolling stock. The net assets in equity investments in foreign group companies is affected by currency fluctuations when translating to DKK in the consolidated financial statements. This translation risk is not hedged. DSB has no other significant currency risks.

Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 69 DSB’s policy is to always maintain sufficient cash reserves. The target is to have a cash reserve corresponding to the development in the approved budget year’s expected net debt plus DKK 200 million, though at least DKK 1.0 billion. The cash reserve is calculated as cash in bank and in hand plus access to drawing on bank facilities. At 31 December 2019, agreements were concluded on revocable bank facilities of DKK 2,500 million and irrevocable bank facilities of DKK 1,750 million, with expiry during the period 2020-2024 (2018: revocable of DKK 2,500 million and irrevocable of DKK 1,750 million, with expiry during the period 2019-2023). Of these cash resources, DKK 3,069 million is not utilised. (2018: DKK 3.417 million). Note 7.5: Counterparty risk Risk arises when financial derivative instruments are concluded to hedge financial risks or when liquidity is placed with financial counterparties. The risk is that the counterparties will fail to fulfil their obligations. All Cash in bank and in hand and agreements on financial instruments are either placed in banks or as part of agreements with financial institutions that have a minimum of an A according to Standard & Poor’s rating. Receivables from derivative financial instruments, Cash in bank and at hand and deposits amount to a total of DKK 107 million as of 31 December 2019. (2018: DKK 164 million). If the access to offsetting exposure in financial contracts with financial counterparties is recognised, the receivables from these items as of 31 December 2019 instead amounts to DKK 2 million. (2018: DKK 27 million).

Other provisions include obligations regarding civil servants on loan and compensation obligations, etc. Accounting practices Provisions are recognised when DSB, as a consequence of an event that occurred at the balance sheet date at the latest, has a legal obligation or an actual obligation, and it is likely that financial advantages must be given up to meet that obligation. Provisions are recognised and measured as the best estimate of the costs necessary to liquidate the obligations. If fulfilment of the obligation is expected to be far in the future, the obligation is measured at fair value.

DSB pays an ongoing pension contribution for civil servants, calculated as a percentage of the pensionable salary, to cover the state’s pension obligation to civil servants. Upon retirement, the state assumes the full pension obligation. The contribution rate for the ongoing pension contributions is based on assumptions about expected pension age, wage development, etc. Deviations from these assumptions, under certain conditions, can result in an adjustment of the contributions in the form of additional payment to or from the state at the time of retirement. DSB has an obligation to pay redundancy payment for three years to civil servants who are dismissed for a cause that is not the fault of the civil service, see section 32 of the Danish Civil Servant Act. DSB also has a commitment to the Agency for the Modernisation of Public Administration to pay pension costs for civil servants until the expected retirement age of 62 years. On the balance sheet date, DSB has only recognised a liability for dismissed civil servants. DSB terminated its contract in 2018 with DXC regarding data center services and SAP operations.

DSB is aware of this and continues to focus on this issue by promoting good behaviour that will benefit both customers and staff. This has unfortunately not been the case when it comes to compliance with the target for the number of signal overruns. Despite a significant focus on clarifying the causes for signal overruns and the launch of concrete activities, the number of signal overruns has increased throughout 2019. DSB continues to work on this, and via an ongoing analysis and a focus on safety targets and concrete actions plans, it will aim to meet the safety targets for signal overruns, the safety targets for significant accidents and the qualitative safety target involving safety management being a natural part of everyday life at DSB.

The Board of Directors employs and dismisses the Executive Board and specifies its terms of employment. The Articles of Association include a detailed description of the tasks of the Board of Directors. The Executive Board consists of one or more members whose appointment is registered with the Danish Business Authority. The Executive Board is in charge of day-to-day management. Corporate issues 91 Reporting on corporate social responsibility DSB’s focus on corporate social responsibility contributes to the creation of a framework within which: • The company’s customers can travel easily, safely and securely with DSB. This includes elderly and disabled customers. • An environmentally and climate-friendly public transport company benefits society, customers, employees and DSB. • There is a good working environment, where, amongst others, diversity contributes to the development of the DSB. • There is an internal pride in working for a company that makes a positive contribution to society. DSB works towards actively reducing the company’s climate impact and to promote our direct contribution towards allowing Denmark to reach its ambitious targets laid out in the binding climate act of December 2019. This part of DSB’s work with social responsibility is described in more detail under Results Sustainability. DSB complies with the UN Global Compact’s 10 universal principles, focusing on human rights and employee rights. The ethical rules require that our suppliers comply with national and international rules regarding child labour, health and safety at work, discrimination, use of forced or involuntary labour, corruption, bribery and the environment. DSB’s ethical policy also includes a Corporate issues 92 whistle-blower scheme providing good opportunities for handling any irregularities as quickly as possible. The environmental policy describes the work involved in actively reducing the company’s climate impact and is described in more detail below under Environment and climate. Additionally, DSB has a policy for working environment, diversity and communication and staff which creates the framework for proper and safe working conditions and open and honest communication. DSB also has an accessibility policy, which ensures that customers with disabilities can make use of DSB’s services. The procurement policy aims to ensure that DSB handles acquisitions in a professional manner and prevents bribery. Social responsibility is also expressed in the requirements that are made of suppliers. In connection with the signing of contracts with external suppliers, DSB ensures that they are familiar with the code of ethics to a relevant extent. Safety and security is a human right. The combined expression of DSB’s work in this context is reflected in the above policies and are documented through the activities below. Collaboration and support Since 2009, DSB has been a part of the UN Global Compact and reports annually on its work related to social responsibility. In 2018, DSB entered into a 4-year strategic partnership with the UN’s association for children, UNICEF. The purpose of the collaboration was to make it easy for DSB’s customers and employees to get involved in helping the world’s most vulnerable children, and in that manner contribute towards the creation of a more fair and sustainable future. The goal is to collect at least DKK 1 million per year in the period 2019-2021. In 2019, over DKK 1.5 million was collected for UNICEF’s work. Since 2008, DSB has collaborated with ‘Natteravnene’, a night watch group consisting of 4,000 adult volunteers who patrol the cities at night including at stations and in trains to create a safer environment. DSB provides financial support to Natteravnene. They can travel by all DSB trains free of charge when they carry out their volunteer work. In addition, DSB has added Natteravnene’s logo and colours to two S-trains. DSB collaborates with a number of aid organisations in Denmark by allowing them to collect donations for their charitable causes and to hand out material to customers at the stations. These organisations include Danmarks Indsamlingen (DR and 12 of Denmark’s largest humanitarian organisations), DanChurchAid, the Danish Cancer Society, ActionAidDenmark, Save the Children Denmark, Danish Red Cross, the Danish Refugee Council and the World’s Best News. At election time in Denmark, DSB also supports the democratic process by permitting the political parties and their candidates to distribute material at the stations in the period leading up to the election. Corporate issues 93 Safety and security It must be safe and secure to be a customer and an employee. According to ERAIL (European Railway Accident Information Links), the Danish rail network is amongst Europe’s safest. This is not least due to the fact that safety is a prerequisite for DSB, and safety is deeply integrated into the way DSB conducts its business. In the safety policy, it is stated: Our customers need to be able to take safety for granted but we must never do so! Surveillance in trains and at stations contributes to safety and security. At the end of 2019, over 2,000 cameras were installed at 143 stations and almost 4,000 cameras in S-trains. As an example, the camera surveillance is used to ensure that police and extra personnel are called in when the situation requires it, and also to help police solve crimes such as vandalism, violent assaults, pick-pocketing, etc. DSB has installed heart defibrillators in the trains and at certain stations, and additional heart defibrillators will be installed in 2020. In 2019, the heart defibrillators have been used in both stations and trains, and in several cases, this has helped save lives. In 2019, courses were held on how to use heart defibrillators. In 2020, there will also be a focus on training people how to use heart defibrillators.

In addition to being a tragic event for the individuals and their families, it also impacts DSB’s customers and employees in the form of train cancellations, delays and psychological scarring. In 2019, there were registered 27 suicides and 24 attempted suicides. Corporate issues 94 Figure 2: Customer satisfaction with security Scale 0-10 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Stations Trains In customer surveys, the customers’ perception of security in trains and at stations is monitored on an ongoing basis. The results show that customers’ perception of security in 2019 has been increasing compared to 2018 when it comes to feeling secure in a train. It is unchanged when it comes to perceptions of security in stations. The customer satisfaction levels for 2019 are • Security in trains: 8.7 • Security in stations: 8.2 Overall, the reported satisfaction for this journey was 8.0 in 2019, which is at the same level as in 2018. Every year, DSB spends large amounts to combat graffiti and to create attractive and safe environments for the customers in trains and on stations. This takes place via preventive efforts such as security guards, etc.and via targeted cleaning of trains and buildings. The targeted efforts are working. Thus, the anti-graffiti work is assessed at 8.3 on a scale of 0 to 10 in 2019. DSB is also participating in the collaboration ‘Tryg-By 2019’ (Safe City 2019) with Copenhagen’s police department and Copenhagen Municipality, and the campaign ‘Pickpockets Love Distractions’ has contributed to increasing the security levels around the ticket and payment machines and the ATMs in the Copenhagen area. Corporate issues 95 Health and safety Part of DSB’s strategy involves being an attractive workplace, and DSB supports this by, among other things, a systematic approach to the working environment. DSB has therefore chosen to be certified in occupational health and safety, and once again in 2019 it was audited by the OHSAS 18001 standard for this.. In 2020, DSB will begin working with the new ISO45001 standard. Figure 3: Industrial injuries Number 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Accidents with absence Accidents without absence DSB is continually focused on creating a better working environment and reducing the number of work-related accidents and absences. Accidents with absences declined from 158 in 2018 to 143 in 2019. Work accidents that did not result in absences have decreased from 730 in 2018 to 708 in 2019. All together, work accidents have decreased from 888 in 2018 to 851 in 2019. The decrease is the result of a strengthened systematic analysis of the causes and extent of work accidents in addition to a decrease in violence, threats and accidents involving falls resulting from a great focus and effort dedicated to these areas. When many people are bunched together at stations, kiosks and in trains, and also when it comes to ticket controls, disagreements may occur that can escalate to threats and violence against employees. DSB makes every effort to become better at preventing and managing these situations. Amongst others, this is accomplished by training employees in conflict management and collaborating with the police. In 2019, DSB has been focused on working with the new guidelines from 2018 related to the prevention and management of violence and threats. The guidelines are focused on ensuring that the employees’ health is always the top priority and that they receive support when violence and threats occur. The good results from 2018 are continuing. In 2019, a large decrease was also seen in the number of episodes involving violence and threats which led to work-related injuries. Corporate issues 96 Figure 4: Violence and threats against employees Number 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Violence and threats DSB has zero tolerance for abusive behaviour in all situations both external and internal. This applies to sexual harassment, violence, threats or other abusive behaviour. DSB’s annual work place assessment includes a follow-up report on the extent of abusive behaviour internally in DSB, and this forms the basis for a management-level follow-up. In 2019, DSB has also been working on reducing stress. This has taken place via information material, tools and courses for the managers. The proportion of employees who respond that they have experienced work-related stress was at 28 percent in the latest workplace assessment in 2018. Part of the action plans include a focus on preventing and dealing with stress. Figure 5: Absence due to sickness Number of sick days, average 10 8 6 4 2 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Number of sick days 2019 has also had a focus on reducing general absence due to sickness. In 2019 an absence policy and guidelines for how to handle absences was introduced. After several years with an average absence due to sickness of over 9 days, this has been reduced to an average of 8.7 days in 2019, which was the goal for the year. Corporate issues 97 Accessibility DSB wants to ensure that it is easy for everyone to take the train including those challenged by disabilities. DSB offers assistance for the disabled, and it can be ordered around the clock however, at least 12 hours before the planned start of the journey. Similarly, DSB has a companion scheme that allows for the disabled person to bring along a companion at a reduced price. In 2019, DSB provided disabled assistance 18,000 times and sold 60,000 disability/disabled assistant tickets. DSB makes a special effort for children who are part of a family living in separate parts of the country. DSB has trained 70 children’s guides who care for the children during the journey in a separate coach in which only the children have seat reservations. In 2019, over 16,000 tickets with children’s guides were sold. Diversity DSB wants to be an attractive workplace characterised by diversity, and it believes that a focused and prioritised effort will make the company stronger and increase its competitiveness. DSB therefore has a diversity policy with certain focus areas intended to strengthen this diversity heading towards 2020 including how it relates to trainee positions, management, ethnicity and gender. Since 2017, DSB has had about 100 refugees participate in brief job training courses (4 weeks) or industry learning courses (13 weeks). DSB continues working with these initiatives in 2020. DSB has increased the number of traineeships for apprentices in 2019, and by the end of the year, there were 71 traineeship positions for apprentices at the workshops. In addition, in 2019 DSB was also focused on recruiting office trainees and there were 29 such trainee positions by the end of 2019. Equal representation at management levels is an integral part of the staff policy. Among the Board of Directors, the gender distribution was 50/50 (not counting employee representatives), and the board’s gender distribution thus meets the target of having a balanced gender composition. At the end of 2019, the gender distribution in the director group was 29 percent female. This also applies when looking at all managers at DSB where the gender distribution is at almost the same proportion as all employees, with 26 percent being women. DSB’s goal is to have a balanced gender composition with at least 1/3 being of the underrepresented gender, which also is a part of the considerations made when recruiting for the company’s ‘green house’ for those seeking to be managers. On this basis, it was decided that 2/3 of the participants should be women. The team which completed the course in 2018/19 thus consisted of 8 men and 13 women. So far, two of the participants from the team have been appointed to management positions both of them women. Bribery DSB does not tolerate corruption, and it has clear internal guidelines for receiving gifts. The guidelines are communicated to the employees via the intranet and e-learning courses and is also a topic in the introductory training for new employees. Corporate issues 98 DSB also has an acquisition policy with a Code of Conduct that all suppliers must adhere to. DSB trades with both Danish and international suppliers as an integrated part of maintenance works, the acquisition of new trains and other activities. DSB makes a very large proportion of its purchases from known suppliers. Finally, DSB has a whistle-blower scheme that is administered by the head of internal auditing. DSB has recorded no instances of bribery taking place in 2019. Environment and climate DSB would like to be part of transitioning Denmark towards a more sustainable future, and in 2019 it has prepared a sustainability programme with four ambitious environment and climate goals for 2030: • Carbon neutral all of DSB is to be supplied with renewable energy • Reducing energy consumption by 50 percent we will increase the efficiency of energy consumption throughout DSB • No particle emissions from the train engines • At least 90 percent of waste is to be recycled i.e., turned into new resources. CO2 emissions DSB’s objective is to be carbon neutral by 2030, making all trains and other operations supplied with renewable energy. DSB’s future electrical locomotives and train sets will provide a significant contribution to reducing the CO2 emissions. As the transition is made to electrical rolling stock, new and more energyefficient workshops will be built and this will also have a positive effect. Objective 1: DSB will be carbon neutral in 2030 Tonnes 300.000 250.000 200.000 150.000 100.000 50.000 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 CO2 from other purposes for transportation (replacement buses, employee travel etc.) CO2 from other operations (buildings and fixed installations) CO2 from train operations Corporate issues 99 The total CO2 emissions in 2019 have fallen by 7 percent compared to 2018. The development is impacted by a slight reduction is DSB’s overall energy consumption together with a major reduction in the CO2 emissions from electricity production in Denmark. Energy consumption DSB’s goal is for energy consumption in 2030 to be half of what it was in 2018. The future electrical locomotives and trains will play a major part in energy optimisation and so will the new and more energy-efficient workshops. At the same time, DSB will continue to optimise the use of energy in the general operations of workshops and other buildings. Via the environmental policy and the certification of workshops and preparation centres, DSB is focusing on reducing both its impact on the local environment and reducing energy consumption. Objective 2: The energy consumption in 2030 must be half of what it was in 2018 GJ (million) 4,5 4,0 3,5 3,0 2,5 2,0 1,5 1,0 0,5 0,0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Diesel for trains Electricity for trains Electricity buildings Heating buildings 89 percent of DSB’s total energy consumption is used for train operations, which is a small increase compared to 2018. The total energy consumption of train operations in 2019 is more or less unchanged compared to 2018. However, the energy consumption of diesel train traffic has increased by 1 percent while the consumption of electricity for train operations has decreased by 3 percent. The energy consumption for purposes other than train operations has fallen by 11 percent in 2019 comparison to 2018. The development in energy consumption levels is, among other things, due to a large decrease in the consumption of electricity. DSB is continually working towards reducing energy consumption in buildings and fixed installations. In 2019, the following initiatives have had an impact on the development of energy consumption: • Over the past few years, a number of DSB 7-Eleven stores have closed, and this has had a significant impact on, in particular, the electricity consumption for general operations. In 2019, an Corporate issues 100 additional five DSB 7-Eleven stores have closed, and this has resulted in a reduction of around 3,600 GJ. • Construction work at Copenhagen Central Station, where, among other things, the passenger tunnel has been newly renovated with LED lighting, has also resulted in a reduction of the consumption of electricity. • Ongoing replacements of lights to LED lighting in workshops and in the administration buildings. • Focus on optimising the operations regarding heating plants (better management, hot water containers, piping systems and valves) at the two major workshops in Copenhagen. Particle emissions DSB’s objective is for no particles to be emitted from its train engines by 2030. This is to be achieved via using electrical rolling stock, though it requires that Rail Net Denmark continues its work on electrification. Diesel trains make a local impact on air quality in the form of particles, NOx, etc. DSB’s main focus is on a reduction of particles, including ultrafine particles. Objective 3: No particle emissions from the train engines by 2030 Particles, tonnes 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 IC4 train sets IC3 train sets Desiro train sets ME diesel locomotives MR train sets ICE train sets The total emissions of particles (calculated by mass) from diesel trains was unchanged compared to 2018, but has declined by 30 percent since 2017. This is due to the reduced traffic with the MElocomotives in the spring of 2018. DSB continues to work with installing new cylinders and nozzles and changing the settings for the nozzles on the ME-locomotives. Altogether, this will result in a reduction of particle emissions of 50 percent, which is a significant decrease in the number of ultrafine particles, a reduction of the Corporate issues 101 use of lubricating oil and a small reduction in the consumption of diesel fuel. 24 out of the 29 MElocomotives have had new cylinder units installed at the end of 2019. Waste DSB’s objective is for at least 90 percent of waste to be recycled in 2030. In order to reach this goal, DSB will be focusing on how waste management at workshops, when preparing the trains, at stations and in the administration can be optimised so that the amount of waste is reduced and waste is recycled to a higher degree than it currently is. The last 10 percent of the waste in 2030 will be waste that will require specialised treatment. The customers will play a major role in helping to sort the waste that comes from trains and stations at the source into selected fractions. Objective 4: At least 90 percent of waste will be recycled in 2030 Distribution of waste based on type of disposal, as a percentage 100% 90% 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Recycled waste Combustible waste Specially treated waste Landfill In 2019, the overall recycle percentage was 52 percent. The increase from 38 percent in 2018 is mainly due to DSB having sold or scrapped several train sets in 2019. In 2019, 47 MR train sets, 2 IC4 train sets and 3 ME-diesel locomotives have been sold or scrapped: • 6 MR train sets and 3 ME-diesel locomotives have been sold and will still be used for train operations • 2 MR train sets have been sold and will be used as restaurants • 39 MR train sets and 2 IC4 train sets have been scrapped. Two canteens have introduced a policy where employees can take food home with them based on the “too good to go” principle. That leads to a reduction of food waste and a reduction of waste in general. Corporate issues 102 Other environmental issues Oil spill by the supply facility in Nykøbing Falster At the end of 2018, diesel oil was found in a ditch. DSB was ordered to clean it up, and subsequently, it has removed the contaminated soil and water. In May 2019, DSB was also ordered by Guldborgsund Municipality to find out the cause of the oil spill. DSB has investigated the extent of the contamination and an oil separator at the supply plant will be replaced by mid 2020. Derailment of IC3 train set near Odense station On 10 January 2019, an IC3 train set was derailed during shunting. The derailment caused a diesel tank to leak, and around 600 litres of diesel oil was spilt. A small amount of oil was collected. DSB has subsequently completed an environmental technical investigation which shows that the extent of the oil contamination does not pose a risk to the current use of the area or to groundwater resources in the area.

The accounts are drawn up in accordance with the principles and methods specified in the DSB Accounting Regulations, taking into account the interpretations agreed with the Ministry of Transport and Housing. It is our view that • The Accounting Regulations have been respected in 2019, including making the necessary accounting breakdown, see Section 2 of the Accounting Regulation, such that DSB can account for the need for grants for the passenger traffic. • The model instrument and the basis of allocation used are documented in accordance with the Section 3 of the Accounting Regulations so that DSB can account for financial allocation to lines. Taastrup, 6 February 2020 Flemming Jensen Thomas Thellersen Børner CEO CFO Line accounts 113 Accounts DSB has prepared reports on the finances of train operations and the results thereof divided into activity areas in order to promote transparency. Combined with a division of operator tasks by lines, this contributes to adding transparency to DSB’s train operations in Denmark, and DSB is also continually using the line accounts to streamline operations. The following can be emphasised: • Long-Distance traffic have operated at a loss in 2019 and passenger revenue has decreased as a result of major track works in eastern Jutland and on Zealand, and this has also increased costs for replacement traffic. At the same time, the contract payments from the state have been reduced 1 • Both the regional train lines in East and West are generally loss-making and therefore require a transfer of funds from the profit-making traffic and from the contract payments from the state. The profitability of individual lines is generally derived from the extent of the service – as determined by the contract with the state – in relation to demand spread over the operational day. The lines are also generally characterised by decreasing passenger revenue. Here, the result is also affected by the reduced traffic contract payments. • In 2019, DSB’s S-train traffic generated a profit of DKK 37 million and thus contributes towards financing lines operating at a loss. The S-train traffic has seen increasing passenger revenue compared to 2018 and also decreasing costs. In 2018, there were large costs associated with replacement traffic in connection with track works on the Frederikssund Line. • Øresund traffic operated at a profit of DKK 10 million in 2019 without funds transferred from the traffic contract. There has been an influx of customers and thus increasing passenger revenue while costs have also decreased. Compared to 2018, where Øresund traffic received contract payments, the result has improved by DKK 84 million. Activity Area Accounts Public services delivered by DSB pursuant to the traffic contract are divided between Train Service, Train System, and General Obligations, see Table Table 1 . • Train Service relates to the operator task of driving trains. • Train System is a collective designation for the activities that support the task of driving trains, from operation of stations, provision of rolling stock, timetable planning and monitoring, to traffic information and sale of tickets. • General obligations are activities that are independent of the train operations, such as grants for extra costs regarding civil servants and leasing of special buildings on non-commercial terms. Train Service is furthermore divided into Long-Distance & Regional Train traffic, S-train traffic and Øresund traffic. Train System is divided into Stations, Rolling Stock and Systems & Channels. Systems & Channels include Sales Channels and Customer Service as well as Traffic Operations and Shared Functions. 1 Conditions for reducing DSB’s contract payment in Supplementary Contract 19 from the Ministry of Transport and Housing. In 2019, the reduction amounted to DKK 250 million (2018: DKK 207 million). 114 Line accounts For 2019, income before the leasing of rolling stock amounted to DKK 9,900 million. The income finances the delivered Public service traffic. In 2019, passenger revenue amounted to DKK 5,194 million, and in the financial statements regarding lines this is distributed to the Train Services 2), i.e. the passenger traffic, while the Train System tasks in the model are almost entirely financed by the income from the traffic contract. Commission revenues from sale of tickets by other operators are distributed to Systems & Channels and amount to DKK 88 million of Other operating income. Danish train passenger traffic is characterised by a strong desire for cohesion in the public transport, including an integrated and uniform customer experience for the entire journey. In order to deliver this, the public transport sector is characterised by a high degree of integration and collaboration across traffic companies and operators, in addition to shared and integrated commercial solutions such as, for example, Rejsekort, Rejseplanen, DOT and Bus & Tog. Passenger revenue has been calculated on the basis of the agreements that have been signed on revenue sharing between the traffic companies and operators. DSB handles an integrating role in the Danish train passenger traffic by, for example, co-financing the development of other traffic companies’ traffic systems and traffic offers. An example of this is the passenger revenue sharing in the Copenhagen area and the operation of contractor traffic services in central and western Jutland. The current revenue allocation model in the Greater Copenhagen area means that Metroselskabet I/S receives a share of the total passenger revenues, which excess the metro’s share of the total amount of journeys in the Greater Copenhagen area. This over-proportional share (the so-called metro double factor of 1.49) has a negative effect on DSB’s passenger revenues. Similarly, agreements on the handling of contractor traffic for the operator of the traffic in central and western Jutland Arriva Danmark. Contractor traffic means that DSB bears the costs for continuing to operate a number of departures in central and western Jutland to thereby ensure direct lines for the passengers to the rest of the country. The revenues from the contractor traffic accrue to Arriva Danmark, and DSB is compensated via contract payments from the state. Contractor traffic takes place on the three lines where DSB does not have a lot of production and thus not much passenger revenue, which then goes to Arriva instead of DSB, and the estimated amount is between DKK 3-4 million per year. In 2019, the total revenue from traffic contracts amounts to DKK 4,025 million. These revenues finance the loss-making train traffic and other activity areas based on the principles determined in the traffic contract with the state. With the vision of a market-oriented DSB, DSB has presented an ambitious plan that, together with the state’s investments in the railway infrastructure and DSB’s investments in the Train of the Future, will result in a significant financial room for manoeuvre in DSB up to 2030. This can be either used to eliminate contract payments or to drastically reduce ticket prices for the benefit of passengers and society at large. 2) This is an analytical decision, as the passenger revenues are in fact also used for co-financing for example stations, sales channels, timetable planning, traffic information, etc. If the passenger revenues were also allocated to Train System, the size of the contract payment to be allocated to these areas of activities would be reduced. Line accounts 115 Of the Income before leasing of rolling stock, Passenger revenue amounts to 52 percentage, Revenue from traffic contracts amounted to 41 percentage and Other operating income amounted to 7 percentage. In accordance with the traffic contract, the contract payment is distributed such that for Stations it reflects a risk-calculated return on the invested capital (ROIC) of 3 percentage. For Material and General obligations it reflects a covering of costs without return and for Systems & Channels it reflects a profit margin of 5 percentage. The remaining contract payment falls to Train Services. The positive result for Stations and for Systems & Channels is therefore due to the technical distribution of the contract payment. Of the total income from leasing of rolling stock, 71 percentage finances Train Services and 28 percentage finances Train System tasks while the remaining 1 percentage finances General Obligations. 116 Line accounts Table 1: The results of DSB’s Train Operations divided into areas of activity 2019 Train Services Train System General Obligations LongDistance and Regional Systems HistoriNonPublic train S-train Øresund Rolling & Chancal recurring Amounts in DKK million services traffic traffic traffic 1) Stations Stock nels 2) items 3) Passenger revenues 5,194 2,956 1,484 754 0 0 0 0 0 Revenue from traffic contract 4,025 1,653 0 0 624 315 1,411 22 0 4) Other operating income 681 175 39 24 76 68 256 35 8 Income before leasing of rolling stock 9,900 4,784 1,523 778 700 383 1,667 57 8 Leasing out of rolling stock 1,492 0 0 0 0 1,492 0 0 0 Total income 11,392 4,784 1,523 778 700 1,875 1,667 57 8 Expenses for raw materials and consumables 500 370 95 31 0 0 4 0 0 Other external expenses 5,057 2,506 482 374 372 366 886 57 14 Staff expenses 2,677 1,230 436 234 109 42 597 0 29 Expenses before leasing of rolling stock 8,234 4,106 1,013 639 481 408 1,487 57 43 Leasing of rolling stock 1,492 872 485 135 0 0 0 0 0 Total expenses 9,726 4,978 1,498 774 481 408 1,487 57 43 Profit before amortisation, depreciation and write-downs 1,666 -194 25 4 219 1,467 180 0 -35 Amortisation, depreciation and write-downs 3,557 33 10 6 138 1,425 97 0 1,848 Operating profit/loss -1,891 -227 15 -2 81 42 83 0 -1,883 Net financials 35 60 22 12 -24 -42 7 0 0 Profit/loss before tax -1,856 -167 37 10 57 0 90 0 -1,883 Tax on profit/loss for the year 437 Profit/loss for the year -1,419 Allocation in percentage Revenue from transport contract 40% 0% 0% 16% 8% 35% 1% 0% Income before leasing of rolling stock 48% 15% 8% 7% 4% 17% 1% 0% Cost before leasing of rolling stock 50% 12% 7% 6% 5% 18% 1% 1% Expenses, amortisation, depreciation, writedowns and financials 13,248 4,951 1,486 768 643 1,875 1,577 57 1,891 1) Øresund traffic includes Øresund crossing the bridge and Kystbanen and the Kastrup line. 2) General obligations (Historical) covers grants to the railway museum, civil servants on loan, own surplus civil servants, special buildings leased out on non-commercial terms as well as elimination items. 3) General obligations (Non-recurring items) is for net profits from property sales in the parent company, write-downs of properties, regulation of lifetime of properties, regulation of civil servant pension contributions, severance costs, write-downs of 11 IC4 train sets and write-downs on rolling stock as a consequence of impairment test. 4) Other operating income includes fees, compensation, rent and income from Traffic-independent activities. Passenger revenues under Systems & Channels also covers commission income from sale of tickets from other operators. Line accounts 117 In 2019, Expenses before leasing of rolling stock amount to DKK 8,234 million for Public services. Of this, 70 percentage are used for Train Services, 29 percentage for Train System and the rest for General obligations. Costs regarding leasing of rolling stock have been disregarded with respect to both income and expenses, as the rolling stock in the line accounts is regarded as neutral intercompany transfers in terms of profit/loss. It is assumed technically that the rolling stock is leased for Train Services without any return. The breakdown of train operations on activity areas is based on Public Services, which is a statement of the activities carried out by DSB under the traffic contract. The basis for breaking down the activities this way is the Line Economy Model. This model divides the profit and loss account into activities and calculates the economy of the individual line based on an estimate of the activities required in the individual areas. Expenses for Train services Most of DSBs’ expenses including depreciation, amortisation and write-downs and financial income and expenses for 2019 cover Train Services (DKK 7,205 million), distributed on Long-Distance & Regional train traffic (DKK 4,951 million), S-train traffic (DKK 1,486 million) and Øresund traffic (DKK 768 million), see Table 1. Maintenance of rolling stock and Leasing of rolling stock total DKK 3,411 million or 47 percentage of the total expenses for Train Services, while expenses for Onboard staff amount to DKK 1,587 million or 22 percentage, see Figure 1.

On-board staff 1.587 mio. kr. 118 Line accounts In the coming years, a very large number of infrastructure works will be performed in Denmark. These works are absolutely essential, and once they have been completed, they will together with the new electric trains ensure a well-functioning and sustainable train operation that will benefit DSB’s customers. During the infrastructure work, DSB’s finances are impacted to a very significant degree. In particular, this is in the form of reduced passenger revenues as the customers opt out of taking the train and use other modes of transportation, but it is also in the form of increased costs for replacement traffic. Banedanmark grants cover project costs for infrastructure works, while DSB pays the costs for replacement traffic when train operations are hindered by track closures. In 2019, DSB has spent DKK 141 million on replacement traffic. It is Rail Net Denmark that plans and carries out the infrastructure works. In accordance with the Accounting Regulations, DSB must allocate the complete costs to the activities and thereby also a part of the supporting functions, which constitute DKK 987 million or 14 percentage of the Train Services costs. The support functions include cross-sector IT functions, staff and common functions, finance and staff functions. More than half of the costs for support functions are staff and consultancy costs. The remainder includes costs for software development, licences, outsourced IT operations centre, insurance, rent and costs for consumption, marketing and depreciation/amortisation etc. Expenses for support functions are allocated to the activity areas based on the number of employees, converted into full-time employees involved in carrying out the individual activities. This means that employee-intensive activities account for a substantial part of the expenses. As a consequence, Train Services, to which the largest share of employees contribute directly as part of the train crew and indirectly in the workshops, carries a relatively large share of the expenses for supporting functions. The expenses for support functions are only variable to a limited extent in relation to the extent of Train Services. The handover of traffic to other operators thus has no substantial effect on the costs for interdepartmental IT functions or other support functions. Expenses for Train System Expenses for the Train System, excluding rolling stock, which ensures coherence in train services in Denmark, are DKK 2,220 million in 2019 including depreciation, amortisation, write-downs and financial income and expenses, see Table 1. Systems & Channels, which consists of Traffic Operations & Shared Functions and Sales Channels & Customer Service, accounts for DKK 1,577 million or 71 percentage of this while Stations accounts for DKK 643 million or 29 percentage. Sales Channels & Customer Service comprises customer-oriented activities such as ticket sales channels (personal service, digital sale and ticket vending machines), customer service, traffic information, Rejsekort (DSB’s co-financing of the travel card system) and marketing. Traffic Operations & Shared Functions includes traffic-oriented activities such as staff, rolling stock and traffic planning, traffic training, safety, monitoring and control of train traffic at the operations centres run by DSB together with Banedanmark. In line with Train services, the figures for Train systems must be calculated with the fully allocated expenses and thus carry a share of DSB’s total supporting functions.

The non-deductible proportion of incoming VAT is included in the individual items in the income statement and the balance sheet. For 2019, the non-deductible proportion of incoming VAT amounts to a total cost of DKK 519 million. DSB and a number of group companies share a common VAT registration. The non-excluded VAT is distributed to the activity areas based on the relative VAT weighting of the relevant activities. Subsequently, the non-excluded VAT matches the actual costs via the distribution model. Corporation tax is not allocated to the activity areas and lines. In the General Accounts, corporation tax is divided between Public services according to the negotiated contract and Competitive activities. The corporate tax related to Public services has been calculated as an income at DKK 437 million for 2019. Earnings for the year and statement of net contract payments Earnings for the year for Public services has been calculated as a deficit of DKK 1,419 million. At a deficit the result is deducted from DSB’s equity, and thus the owner’s the state’s value of DSB. In DSB’s contract payments the various duties tax, VAT and salaries – are deducted and returned to the state, just as DSB pays for the infrastructure costs of using the infrastructure rail tracks and fixed connections that DSB uses in train operations for Long-Distance & Regional trains. Figure 3 calculates the state’s net contract payment to DSB once these factors have been taken into account in other words, when the contract payments have been deducted from the internal distribution of resources in the sector in addition to the redistribution to other state actors. The 120 Line accounts net contract payment is thus an expression of the state’s actual payment to DSB for Train operations. Figure 3: The state’s net contract payments to DSB Amounts in DKK million Revenue from transport contracts Contribution to Banedanmark Tax on profit for the year Contribution to Metroselskabet Contribution to SKAT 4.025 226 515 519 437 3.095 107 Payroll Net revenue Metro passager VAT Infrastructure Revenue from Tax on profit tax from transport charges for the year transport contracts contracts revenue substitution The net contract payments to DSB from the state thus amounts to DKK 3.1 billion. Line Accounts The Line Accounts are primarily an internal analysis tool used by DSB to understand the correlations between operations and to analyse and optimise the financial structure of the individual lines. The information on the finances of train operations on individual lines provides a good overview of the societal priorities of Danish train operations. In a broader perspective, the line accounts are suited for demonstrating the significant extent of DSB’s activities outside the train service activities, which range from planning and monitoring of traffic, customer service and distribution systems to station operation. These are tasks that DSB also attend to on behalf of and in collaboration with the other players in the public transport in general. Line accounts 121 However, the line accounts are not suited for direct financial comparison between operators, even if such comparison only focuses on the train operation activities. Furthermore, the line accounts cannot be used as reference with respect to adjustment of expenses in connection with with giving up lines to other operators. The reason for this is partly that the line accounts reflect absorption costing and partly that DSB’s expenses, like all other companies’ expenses, are variable to different degrees depending on the production volume. This means that parts of the expenses are only vaguely or not at all correlated with the number of train or seat kilometres driven. Therefore, it applies that there is no noteworthy correlation between the extent of the train services and expenses for, e.g. sales and distribution channels, planning systems and operation centres. When DSB hands over train traffic, it means that DSB loses economies of scale and opportunities for inter-organisational synergy. The line accounts are based on the activity area Train Services reflecting the costs of operating train services. The costs are allocated to the lines in relation to their use of activities and the supporting functions are allocated to the lines based on the number of full-time employees involved in the individual activities, see Table 2 and Table 3. Positive results reflect that the line operated at a profit and can therefore be operated without any state subsidies. On the other hand, negative results reflect that the line operates at a loss and consequently financing has to be added from profit-making lines and/or government contract payments. According to the Accounting Regulations, DSB is required to also specify the individual lines, including all expenses, regardless of whether the individual expense concerns the extent of production. Therefore, costs for Train System for both Stations and Systems & Channels are broken down into lines in Table 4 and Table 5. In practice, this means the inclusion, for example, of expenses for operating stations, operating the Rejsekort system, ticket vending machines, traffic information and operations centres controlling traffic to limit delays, etc. The expenses have been broken down by lines, even though these activities do not have any direct connection with the actual economy of the train traffic on the individual line. The key figures for Passenger revenues per seat kilometre and Expenses per seat kilometre provide the best indication of how the seat capacity is utilised on the individual lines, see Table 4 and Table 5. Seat kilometres take into account the number of seats available in the individual rolling stock class and the number of train sets/coaches coupled on a line. Train kilometres, which are often used as a key figure, do not take these differences into account. The statement of seat kilometres is associated with some uncertainty, as the statement of journeys, and thus how far the individual customer travels, is to a great extent based on passenger studies based on spot checks. For example, it cannot be stated precisely how often and how far a commuter with a season ticket travels, nor what line the commuter uses (see Figure 10). Adjustments to the Line Economy Model in 2019 In 2019, the following adjustments were incorporated into the Line Economy Model: • New line definition in the Øresund region It has proved necessary to revise the definition of the line Copenhagen – Malmö to the effect that the production on the Swedish side of the Øresund border has not been included. This is made to adhere to the definition in the initial traffic contract with the state. 122 Line accounts Table 2: Line accounts for Train Services Long-Distance, Regional West and East Leasing

Line accounts Method used for preparation of line accounts As a public undertaking, DSB must satisfy a number of reporting requirements, see Figure 4. The reporting requirements each have their own background and purpose and all aim at creating transparency and control related to DSB matters. However, the requirements consider the company from different perspectives, which makes it difficult to determine the connection between the individual reports and at the same time negatively affects transparency.

DSB’s Accounting Regulations are designed to separate Public Services from Competitive Activities in order to provide an insight into the activities that are subject to contract payment and ensure that there is no illegal state support. The presentation of the General Accounts, which are reviewed by DSB's External Auditor, divides the parent company’s result into Public Services under a negotiated contract and Competitive Activities. The traffic contract covers only Public Services that are performed under the contract. These services represent a proportion of the independent public company DSB’s services. This means, for example, that DSB Vedligehold A/S is not covered directly by the Public Service obligation, but indirectly in the form of the preparation and maintenance services that are delivered and invoiced for Train Services. Kort & Godt A/S is also not covered by the Public Service obligation. The line accounts are based on the General Accounts where Public Services are separated. The activity area accounts are an attempt to segment activities with reference to the split in the traffic contract. The line accounts are a breakdown of the train operations on the lines in accordance with DSB’s Accounting Regulations. Line accounts 127 Figure 5: Elements of Train Operations Train Services covers the activities that are associated with the operator responsibilities Train Services of driving trains from A to B. Train Operations Train System covers the activities that contribute to ensuring coherence and effective Train System resource utilisation in the Danish train traffic. DSB operates trains in Denmark as a total activity, but must, in connection with the traffic contract, prepare and implement a separation of the railway operations into activities related to the actual train movements (Train Operations), and activities related to the maintenance of the production apparatus (Train System), see Figure 5. Financial model for lines The Line Economy Model provides a basis for DSB's General Accounts and Line accounts. This creates an unambiguous correlation and a complete transaction track between the individual accounts. The model creates the General Accounts setup by dividing activities into Public Services under a negotiated contract and Competitive Activities, such as, for example, renting out properties to external customers. Public Services are further divided into activity areas and the activities that DSB implements to operate the individual lines. The lines contain all accounting entries relating to Train operations, see previous definition. 128 Line accounts Figure 6: Design of the Line Economy Model Accounts Resources Activities Products Internal control External reporting Internal control Key figures for example Energy per Presentation of Main Variability and reversibility rolling stock class kilometres or Business analyses Operation per rolling stock class Activity area and line kilometres accounts Production units Train Services Capacity Lines Area, units support functions Accounting Group, Activities items support Train functions System Nontransport related Direct items activities General ObligaActivities Single items tions exposed to competition Figure 6 describes the in-principle method used in the Line Economy Model where the accounting entries are grouped and distributed via activities for lines. At the resources level, the accounts are grouped and classified according to production proximity, so that the supporting functions are distributed according to the capacity unit’s relative use of resources. The model makes use primarily of objective and systematic basis of allocation based on production information. The Line Economy Model is based on a combination of full cost allocation and activity-based cost allocation . The full cost allocation results from the Accounting Regulations requirement that all costs are allocated to the lines. Definition of lines Figure 7 shows the definitions used for the individual lines that have been adapted to the production and time table that DSB has used in 2019. The only changes compared to 2018 are that the Aalborg-Frederikshavn line transitioned to the new signal system in October 2018, and therefore it has not been possible for DSB to operate the traffic that it is committed to under the traffic contract. Instead, Nordjyske Jernbaner manages this traffic on behalf of DSB as a subcontractor. InterCity traffic between Copenhagen and Aalborg has been defined as an independent line and all InterCityLyn traffic between Copenhagen, Aarhus and Aalborg has been combined in one line. This has been defined as such due to the major track works taking place in east Jutland throughout all of 2019. It has proved necessary to revise the definition of the line Copenhagen – Malmö to the effect that the production on the Swedish side of the Øresund border has not been included. This is made to adhere to the definition in the initial traffic contract with the state. Line accounts 129 Due to the major track works around Ringsted station, it has also been necessary to add a line defined as Copenhagen Ringsted, which mainly excludes the original Copenhagen Slagelse line. Figure 7: Line definitions 2019 Long-Distance & Regional Trains • Long-Distance trains are defined as trains crossing the Great Belt (the red lines), and these consist of the lines Copenhagen Aarhus Aalborg (InterCityLyn), Copenhagen Aalborg (InterCity) and Copenhagen Esbjerg (InterCity). • The remaining InterCityLyn and InterCity lines are defined as regional trains, as in practice, this is regional train traffic as the trains stop at all stations (Aarhus Langå Struer Fredericia Vejle Struer, Struer Thisted (the tail end of the InterCityLyn line), Aarhus Hamburg and Fredericia Sønderborg). • Aarhus – Langå – Struer and Struer – Thisted are viewed as a separate lines, as DSB has an obligation according to the traffic contract to operate the lines 6 times a day, but does not receive the associated passenger revenues. 130 Line accounts • The Øresund traffic is divided into two lines (Copenhagen Helsingør and Copenhagen Malmö only to the Øresund border). • The train categories Regional East and Regional West follow the underlying train production. • International train systems, used to a great extent by local travellers on Zealand and in Jutland are defined as regional train traffic. Definition of activities and division into the activity areas Train Services and Train System The central element in the Line Economy Model is the definition of the activities carried out by DSB in the train operations. The activity definitions and groupings used support the distinction between Train Operations and Train Systems on which the Activity area accounts are based. Figure 8: ’Activities in Train Services and Train System Train operation On-board staff On-board service Preparation Cleaning (ticket inspection etc.) Maintenance of Train service (catering) Maintenance based on rolling stock kilometres travelled Other maintenance Energy Energy for train operation Train Services Track closures Replacement Major delays transport Track fees for crossing bridges Infrastructure and per train kilometres Leasing costs for rolling Leasing of rolling stock stock Cleaning Depreciation, Reparation and maintenance amortisation and writeStations Return and depreciation, downs and return on amortisation and write-downs rolling stock on buildings and areas Lifecycle cost Rolling stock Insurance Serviced and self-serviced sales Train System Operational management Commission to other sellers Staff, rolling stock and Sales Channels and Ticket vending machines traffic planning Customer Service Mobile sales Services for disabled Traffic operation Rejsekort passengers and shared functions Marketing Traffic support Traffic information Traffic training Safety Systems & Channels The basic accounting registrations do not directly support a division of the train services in accordance with the activity area perception in the traffic contract. The basic registrations are aimed at supporting the company’s current organisation and thus the most effective combined reporting. That is why the reports on activity areas are based on the basis of allocation of the Line Economy Model. Line accounts 131 Basis of allocation Development of the Line Economy Model is based on the objective that the model should reflect the revenue, cost and production structure. Since it is an allocation model, the size of revenue and costs per line will depend on the choice of activity groupings and basis of allocation. The train service activities for lines is in general distributed according to the following principles: • If the activity is performed only for operation of a single line, there will be a direct allocation to the line. • If instead the activity is carried out in order to be able to run multiple lines, the costs will be distributed to lines in accordance with an appropriate production parameter. Figure 9: The main basis of allocation for Train Services in the Line Economy Model On-board staff Time registrations by train drivers, conductors and the number of travellers Maintenance of Rolling stock class hours and rolling stock class kilometres rolling stock Energy Rolling stock class kilometres Replacement Partial journeys and directly attributed to specific lines transport Infrastructure Bridge crossings and per train kilometres Leasing Average of rolling stock Figure 9 shows the main production-based basis of allocation used in the allocation of the train service activities to the individual lines. This can be illustrated by the examples below: • The full costs of the train transport activity under on-board staff is distributed to the lines based on the locomotive driver’s time registration that is connected to the individual line via the rolling stock. • The full maintenance costs of, for example, IC3 train sets are distributed relative to the lines where IC3 train sets are used based on the number of litra kilometres that the IC3 train set has travelled. • The infrastructure costs for crossing the Great Belt are allocated in proportion to the number of bridge crossings made on the individual line in addition to how many kilometres the individual train has travelled. Distribution of passenger revenue to the lines It is not possible to directly quantify the number of journeys in DSB due to the fact that, in public transport, it is possible to ride on buses, the metro and the train without necessarily having to have a travel warrant for a specific departure. This applies to both period tickets and single journeys, since it is possible to buy an open ticket for, e.g., Copenhagen Aarhus. Thus, it is not possible to determine whether the journey is made with the long distance train headed for Esbjerg, Aarhus or Aalborg. In addition, a journey can be made across multiple operators and lines. For example, a journey from Tisvildeleje to Aarhus involving the local train from Tisvildeleje to Hillerød, 132 Line accounts S-train from Hillerød to Copenhagen H and regional train from Copenhagen to Aarhus can be made on the same ticket. Figure 10: The principles behind the allocation of passenger revenue to lines Journey Sources Journey relations Journey lines Lines Distribution of journey Distribution of journey relations Distribution of revenues to sources on journey relations on journey lines based on lines based on partial via passenger counts occupancy counts and timetables journeys Ticket sales Greater Copenhagen Division of Area journey relations on Regional journey lines, Distribution of Division of i.e. the revenue in journeys into individual lines based on departure and Øresund journey is partial destination split up into journeys one or more International journey portions Free Rejsekort The calculation is further complicated by the fact that there are currently many ticket systems and fare zones that need to be coordinated between different operators. For Long-Distance & Regional trains, DSB therefore uses a number of travel sources, see Figure 10, of which the most significant are DSB’s own ticket sales and Greater Copenhagen area travels in addition to the Rejsekort. Among other things, the journeys are assessed by passenger counts in trains and the weighing of trains which is converted to customer numbers. The methods may vary from travel source to travel source and are agreed with the other operators in a given tariff area. The trips must then be divided into travel relationships that show from where and to where the journey is made. Among other things, this is done on the basis of passenger studies 3) looking into travel patterns that provide a statistical weighting that can be used for travel sources. This means that the distribution comes with a certain statistical uncertainty relative to the size of the samples on the individual line and total population of travellers on that line. When travel relationships are established, the journey’s line must be determined in other words, which of the possible lines have been used to travel between two destinations. Since a journey can be made over several lines, it must be shared relatively between the lines. Thus, a 3) The BRIK count in the Greater Copenhagen area and the Country count, carried out by COWI for Long-Distance & Regional trains. Line accounts 133 trip can be divided into one or more partial journeys. Occupancy counts and timetables are used for dividing across travel lines. Partial journeys are used to allocate passenger revenue to lines in the overall Travel Revenue Model. In the Line Economy Model, this input is used as a basis for distributing the registered passenger revenue. There is thus a certain amount of estimation involved in the passenger revenue linked to individual lines. For S-trains, the line revenues are calculated in a separate passenger count system (APS), which allocates the passenger revenues for the eight main lines. Distribution of income from the traffic contract to areas of activity The Line Economy Model will not be broken down into the contract payment on lines, since there is no unique activity-based method by which to allocate the contract payment. For use for the Activity area accounts, DSB has chosen to allocate contract payment according to the following method: Figure 11: Principles for allocating revenues from the traffic contract to activity areas Contract payment, General Contract Obligations, Remaining Total contract payment, contract payment payment Systems & stations for Train Services Channels and Rolling Stock The contract payment to Stations is allocated so as to ensure an annual return on the invested capital (ROIC) of 3 percentage. The contract payment for General Obligations (historical) is based on cost recovery. The contract payment for Systems & Channels is based on a profit rate of 5 percentage, whereas the contract payment for Rolling stock covers all the project costs for preparation of the purchase of new electric trains for Denmark, the driverless S-trains and the future workshops, since rolling stock rental is charged to the train service activity. At the same time, the dedicated contract payment for improving the public transport network via the acquisition of double-decker coaches and improvements to EA locomotives and IR4 train sets 4 is allocated to Rolling stock. The remaining contract payment accrues to Train Services where it is distributed such that the profit ratio is identical for Long-Distance & Regional train services, Øresund Traffic and S-train traffic. If a line generates a profit without contract payments, this payment is distributed only to the loss-making traffic areas. 4 See the political agreement, “Fare reductions and investments in improving public transport” of 12 June 2012 and the political agreement “Acquisition of double-decker coaches” of 1 April 2014. 134 Line accounts In addition, it is assumed that the passenger revenues accrue to Train Services and thus, according to the model, do not contribute directly to the Train System. Distribution of leasing of rolling stock All income and expenses as well as depreciation, amortisation, write-downs and financial income and expenses for rolling stock are collected in two pools, one for Long-Distance & Regional Trains (including Øresund) and one for S-trains. However, both pools exclude costs in regards to the projects on the future trains, the future driverless S-trains and the future workshops which are thus not included. On the Long Distance & Regional train lines where dedicated rolling stock is used (Odense Svendborg, Odense Ringe, Aarhus Hamburg, Copenhagen Hamburg and Copenhagen Malmö), the line costs are accounted directly with the specific rolling stock costs. The remaining rolling stock pool is regarded as a common pool and is therefore calculated as an average rolling stock lease using the travelled litra kilometres on the individual lines. Rolling stock leasing for Strains is solely based on the actual costs for the rolling stock. Line accounts 135
