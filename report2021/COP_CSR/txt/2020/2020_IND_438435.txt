To this end, we undertake stakeholder engagement workshops to sensitise our Stakeholder Stakeholder Stakeholder Managing stakeholders on sustainability Identification Prioritisation Engagement Stakeholder issues. These workshops Expectations provide an opportunity to garner perspectives and help us strengthen our partnerships. Identification of Stakeholders For us, stakeholders include all those impacted by our organisation’s operations and those who impact our operations. The process to meet our stakeholders’ expectations is initiated by identifying and defining the distinct stakeholder categories – external and internal. This is the first step of an effective stakeholder engagement strategy.

The periodicity and engagement mode can span from one-on-one interaction on a monthly basis to annual group level meetings to enhance strategic collaborations. To formulate an effective strategy, we assess the nature and depth of the impact that these stakeholders may have on our business and the extent to which our business decisions will make an impact.

We consider these factors in the mode of engagement and devise requisite methodologies to extract results valuable for the business and the stakeholders. Our preceding detailed materiality assessment included the element of survey design for each of our identified stakeholder groups. The materiality workshops and engagement sessions were carried out with various stakeholder groups across zones/regions/locations of our SBUs. Topics of sustainable development and environmental issues ranged from the latest trends, best practices and regulatory landscapes to future scenarios. In 2018, we engaged with 1,028 stakeholders at 16 locations across India. Further, to validate the concurrency of the identified material issues during the current reporting cycle, we undertook workshops covering 278 stakeholders and received 244 sample survey responses. 42 Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited Awareness Collection Assigning building of Aggregation weightage Validation through responses of responses to of material stakeholder from target responses topics workshop group Managing Stakeholder Expectations Key Topics Modes of Engagement Our Response Management and Non-Management Employees Career progression  Annual performance reviews  We provide timely performance reviews and appraisals of opportunities for and appraisal system our employees through appropriate feedback mechanism, higher education via online performance review and appraisal system.  Education Growth Plan (EGP)  We have devised an education growth plan for our employees to enable them to fulfil their higher education ambitions.

Our findings On the basis of our methodology and the activities described above, it is our opinion that:  Nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the reviewed statements within the scope of our verification are inaccurate and the information included therein is not fairly stated;  It is our opinion that HPCL has established appropriate systems for the collection, aggregation and analysis of quantitative data such as Environmental, Health & Safety, Human Resource, Labour as well as Product and Investor related data. Alignment with the principles of AA1000AS (2008) Inclusivity HPCL has processes in place for engaging with a range of key stakeholders including socially responsible investors, Government officials, local community representatives and has undertaken stakeholder engagement activities that have served as inputs for its Sustainability report 2018-19, covering a range of topics such as Customer satisfaction, Employee welfare, Supply Chain, Community Welfare and Environment. Materiality The Report addresses the range of environmental, social and economic issues of concern that HPCL and its stakeholders have identified as being of highest material importance. The identification of material issues has considered both internal assessments of risks and opportunities to the business, as well as stakeholders’ views and concerns. The material issues were identified by a process of stakeholder engagement and interaction and the entire process was conducted through a survey in which the stakeholders were requested to provide their feedback relating to various issues. Responsiveness HPCL is responding to those issues it has identified as material and demonstrates this in its policies, objectives, indicators and performance targets. The reported information can be used by the organisation and its stakeholders as a reasonable basis for their opinions and decision-making. The company has taken various initiatives towards delivering environmentally friendly services along with occupational health and safety, appropriate measures for emergency handling, control and risk management in its operations. Impact There is no finding from our assessment that HPCL had not monitored, measured or has not been accountable for its actions related to its material topics and their effect on the broader ecosystem Evaluation against Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards Bureau Veritas undertook an evaluation of HPCL Sustainability Report 2018-19 against the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016. This included cross checking the GRI index table against all the reference documents to provide an opinion on the self-declared GRI reporting option. 132 Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited Based on our work, it is our opinion that the Sustainability Report 2018-19 has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards including appropriate consideration of the Reporting Principles and necessary indicators to meet the requirements of GRI Reporting Option “In accordanceComprehensive”. Limitations and Exclusions Excluded from the scope of our work is assurance of any information reported by HPCL relating to:  Activities outside the defined assurance period stated hereinabove;  Positional statements (expressions of opinion, belief, aim or future intention) by HPCL and statements of future commitment;  Competitive claims in the report claiming “first in India”, “first time in India”, “first of its kind”, etc;   Our assurance does not extend to the activities and operations of HPCL outside of the scope and geographical boundaries as well as the operations undertaken by any subsidiaries or joint ventures of the Company.  Our assurance of the economic and financial performance data of HPCL is based only on the audited annual report 3 of HPCL for the Financial Year 2018-19 and our conclusions rely solely upon that audited report This independent statement should not be relied upon to detect all errors, omissions or misstatements that may exist within the Report.
