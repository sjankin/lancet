Statement of goals At Featurespace we believe that operating with integrity and transparency and promoting diversity are at the heart of good business. We aim to make a real difference in the communities in which we work and are active in supporting and upholding the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact. Current Covid-19 update We have been working hard to support our team members while we have been working from home. Our leadership team hosts daily meetings to confirm priorities and to provide direction, motivation, and support for our team members. As expected, our teams have remained professional, flexible, and committed to the delivery of our business and we are proud that during this difficult time we are able to continue with business as usual. In accordance with the UK government announcements we are continuing with our current working from home practices. We continually review whether there are any of our employees whose circumstances may have significantly changed, meaning they are no longer able to work from home effectively. Should this ever be the case we will review their current working arrangements and provide suitable, compliant, safe alternatives. Page |3 UN Global Compact 2020 Statement of continued support 01 June 2020 H.E. António Guterres Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 USA Dear Mr. Secretary-General, I am pleased to confirm that Featurespace Limited continues to support the ten principles of the UN Global Compact with respect to human rights, labour, environment, and anti-corruption. With this submission of our latest Communication on Progress, we express our intent to continue advancing those principles within our sphere of influence. We are committed to making the Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company, and to engaging in collaborative projects which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Sustainable Development Goals. Featurespace submits our latest Communication on Progress to make a clear statement of this commitment to our stakeholders and the general public. We recognise that a key requirement for participation in the Global Compact is the annual submission of a Communication on Progress (COP) that describes our company’s efforts to implement the ten principles. We support public accountability and transparency, and therefore commit to continue reporting on progress annually according to the Global Compact COP policy. In 2019, we acknowledge that we did not submit our COP due to human error, but Featurespace continued to uphold the key principles throughout the year in support of the goals of the United Nation Global Compact. Sincerely yours, Ms. Martina King CEO Page |4 UN Global Compact 2020 Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights.

Protection of global human rights Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that every person in the world should be entitled to. They are based on core principles such as dignity, fairness, equality, respect, and autonomy. Underlying our values is the right that everyone should be treated with dignity, fairness, equality, and respect, and that we are committed to applying these values in our business every day, everywhere. Our commitment to respecting human rights acknowledges all internationally recognised Human Rights. That means that wherever we work in the world, we will seek to respect and uphold the fundamental human rights and freedoms of everyone who works for us or with us, and of the people and communities we work with.
