In addition to commanding the top share of the global market for printing inks, a core business since our establishment, we have succeeded in growing pigments and polymers, both derived from printing inks, into prosperous components. Today, we provide indispensable products and services to customers in a broad range of industries, including packaging, housing, automotive, cosmetics, electronics and healthcare. The DIC Group comprises 174 companies in 64 countries and territories. Approximately 60% of our consolidated net sales are generated by, and over 70% of our more than 20,000 Group employees are located at, bases outside of Japan. Accordingly, a global perspective is crucial to any discussion of the Group. In recent years, the rapid spread of advanced digital technologies, as represented by the increasing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), have brought dramatic changes to lifestyles and society, as well as to the business environment. At the same time, social imperatives related to concerns such as climate change, food safety and marine plastics have become increasingly urgent. Amid such signi¿cant changes, how do materials manufacturers contribute to society going forward Since taking the reins as CEO, I have seen this as my principal mission. Ensuring an accurate grasp of global, dynamic paradigm shifts is essential to our ability to achieve sustainable growth and also to enhance our intrinsic value. This recognition underpinned the formulation of our new medium-term management plan, DIC111, which kicked off in ¿scal year 2019. Under this plan, we will work to strengthen our business, ¿nancial and human resources strategies while taking steps to improve management ef¿ciency and strength. | A /ook Back at DIC108 (Fiscal Years 201²2018) Our previous medium-term management plan, DIC108, was positioned as the ¿rst phase in a growth scenario developed to guide the DIC Group’s evolution through to ¿scal year 2024. The plan centered on two core policies: Ensure the sustainability of businesses with stable earnings bases—e.g., printing inks, pigments and polymers—by responding to environmental concerns, promoting rationalization and making strategic investments, and create business models that address social imperatives in such areas as electronics, packaging, healthcare and decarbonization. In line with these policies, we focused on strengthening our technology development capabilities and business expansion efforts, as well as our ¿nancial base. As a consequence, both businesses with stable earnings bases and growth businesses reported steady results over the three years of the plan, underpinning record-high income in ¿scal years 2016 and 2017. However, in ¿scal year 2018 consolidated operating income declined 14.3%, to ¥48.4 billion, despite a 2.0% increase in consolidated net sales, to ¥80. billion. The principal factors behind this are the fact that efforts to revise product prices failed to keep pace with rising raw materials prices and the depreciation of currencies in European emerging economies. Consolidated ordinary income decreased 14.%, to ¥48.7 billion, and consolidated net income attributable to owners of the parent fell 17.0%, to ¥32.0 billion. Nonetheless, we declared a full-term dividend of ¥12 per share, an increase of ¥.0 from ¿scal year 2017, as a consequence of which our dividend payout ratio exceeded 30.0% in the ¿nal year of DIC108. As demonstrated by our performance in fiscal year 2018, our profitability relies heavily on existing core businesses, meaning that our business structure is vulnerable to macroenvironmental conditions, including rising prices for raw materials. This underscored our recognition of the urgency of transforming our business portfolio so that it’s able to withstand demand declines in mature markets and repositioning DIC on a growth trajectory by creating new businesses with the potential to become mainstays. It also clari¿ed what we need to do as we move toward this new growth trajectory. In ¿scal year 2019, risks arising from economic trends in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and worldwide—a consequence of trade friction between the PRC and the United States—and from ¿nancial market Àuctuations attributable to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union continue to warrant caution. Nonetheless, we will continue working to revamp our business structure, reinforcing its ability to withstand macroenvironmental changes and drive continuous, robust growth while at the same time applying our inherent talent for resolving issues to our efforts to implement the strategies of DIC111. Our forecasts for the period include consolidated net sales of ¥80.0 billion and consolidated operating income of ¥2.0 billion, up .% and 7.%, respectively, from ¿scal year 2018. Consolidated operating income reached record highs in two consecutive years (Àscal years 201 and 201), but was signiÀcantly below our original target in Àscal year 2018, owing to rising raw materials prices Achievements • Reorganized production system in line with demand trends in mature markets (publication inks and polymers) • Growth in functional pigments business exceeded target • Strengthened foundation of electronics business through capital and business alliance with Taiyo Holdings Co., Ltd. • Realized continuous growth in net sales and record-high income (fiscal year 2017) • Dividend payout ratio exceeded target, thanks to efforts to maintain/improve financial balance Challenges • Reform business structure to offset further demand declines in mature markets (publication inks and general processed products) • Establish robust business foundation that is impervious to fluctuations in raw materials prices, taking into account the decline in profitability in fiscal year 2018, a consequence of rising raw materials prices • Create new mainstay businesses to compensate for shrinking demand for publication inks to reposition DIC on a growth trajectory • Steadily implement strategic investments DIC Report 2019 8 Promoting business portfolio transformation and an improved management infrastructure with the aim of achieving consolidated net sales of 10 trillion in fiscal year 202 | Realigning Businesses by Illuminating the Relationship Between Social Value and Economic Value As a ¿rst step in formulating DIC111, we recon¿rmed our vision for the DIC Group in the future. Become a unique global company that is trusted by society by providing value (safety and peace of mind, color and comfort) DIC’s future vision Two strategies for business portfolio transformation ● A company that possesses a wide range of global Social value No. 1 businesses that evoke our distinctive “Color & Target Areas • Sustainability Comfort” brand slogan • Contribution to markets ● A company that realizes corporate value through the promotion of diversity, thereby earning respect and admiration from the global community ● A company that works with employees, customers Economic value and shareholders to create value and build an even • Growth • Profitability more attractive DIC brand • Capital efficiency To ensure that we realize this vision, we established the Intrinsic Value Working Group, comprising mid-tier and young employees, through which we promoted extensive debate and discussion aimed at better de¿ning the value that DIC provides to society, identifying the challenges we must address and determining how best we can contribute to further sustainability through our operations. This process led us to review existing businesses from the twin perspectives of “social value” and “economic value” and to advance business portfolio transformation in a manner that addresses key imperatives arising from social changes such as the spread of digitization and environment, safety and health (ESH)-related issues, including those affecting the global environment and food supplies. Leveraging our position as a manufacturer of ¿ne chemicals, we have sought consistently to provide functionality and added value to society in a multitude of forms, thereby helping make people’s lives more convenient. We have also always maintained an awareness of the negative aspects of our operations, including the impact of our production activities on the environment. Going forward, we will further advance this approach with the goal of becoming an organization capable of delivering increased functionality and other features that improve convenience and of providing social value, one facet of which is environmental value. We will bolster efforts to help address ESHrelated issues—including climate change, sustainable resource use and human health—through our operations to provide enhanced value that contributes to a richer, more vibrant society. Combining economic value with social value will enable us to realize sustainable growth for the DIC Group. A natural extension of this approach is the milestone performance targets we have set for ¿scal year 202, namely, consolidated net sales of ¥1.0 trillion, operating income of ¥100 billion and net assets of ¥00 billion. Recognizing the achievement of these targets as critical to becoming a unique global company that is trusted by society, over the three years of DIC111 we will emphasize advancing qualitative reforms in existing businesses and commercializing new businesses, and on accelerating disruptive growth through strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&As).

As a company that provides complex and peace of mind products to customers in a broad range of industries, we often hear from investors that ● Color & Display they ¿nd it dif¿cult to understand our corporate direction. In that sense, I believe that it’s Color and display materials that important for us to have a business structure and message that are simple and easy for make life colorful external stakeholders to understand and at the same time to ensure that all employees ● Functional Products are on the same wavelength as we work together to confront challenges ahead. Functional products that add comfort Packaging & Graphic To date, we have pursued independent strategies for printing inks, coextruded multilayer ¿lms and adhesives. Grouping these businesses together under the heading “packaging” will bring together common issues such as food safety and food loss. Looking ahead, we will capitalize on our ability to provide printing inks, ¿lms and adhesives to marshal technologies and know-how to offer packaging materials that bring safety and peace of mind and promote the expansion of our business while at the same time helping resolve social imperatives. Presentation introducing DIC111 Color & Display This segment focuses on pigments, liquid crystals (LCs) and natural colorants as businesses that make life more colorful. In the area of pigments, we see products for cosmetics as particularly promising. We also expect growth in the market for Linablue®, a natural blue food coloring derived from Spirulina, owing to increasing concerns worldwide regarding food safety. In the highly pro¿table area of LCs, we are promoting the joint development of inks for inkjet-printed quantum dot color ¿lters (QDCFs) that use inkjet technology as next-generation display materials. Functional Products This segment centers on polymers and compounds. Guided by the concept of functional products that add comfort, we will leverage our specialized composite technologies to enhance our competitiveness in a variety of areas, including coatings and molded products, with the goal of adding comfort. This segment also includes products such as hollow-¿ber membrane modules, which allow gases but not liquids to permeate. We have also identified four priority areas for developing new businesses—Electronics, Automotive, Next-Generation Packaging and Healthcare—and have established the New Business Development Headquarters to oversee related efforts. The New Business Development Headquarters integrates three key functions—our R&D team, which encompasses mediumto long-term development; the Product Innovation Center, which is charged with bringing together core technologies; and our marketing team, which is responsible for enhancing popularity and market penetration—to seamlessly oversee all stages of new business development. 2 Value Transformation: Strengthening our corporate structure through qualitative reforms of businesses Having defined “qualitative reforms” as clarifying competitive advantages and shifting to products capable of withstanding macroenvironmental changes, we will encourage a shift to businesses with more of a focus on social value and sustainability. In the Packaging & Graphic segment, we will concentrate resources on packaging solutions and specialty inks. In the Color & Display segment, efforts will center on high-performance products, notably functional pigments, and naturally derived products. In the Functional Products segment, we will emphasize environment-friendly products and high-value-added products such as epoxy resins. Shifting to businesses with more of an emphasis on social value will also entail a Segment Value Transformation review of general-purpose products and a bold revamping of business models, including those for core businesses.

In Electronics, we will seek to apply our ink dispersion technologies in such areas as Àexible printed circuit boards (PCBs) and next-generation displays to develop functional materials that contribute to a digital society. Under the Automotive banner, we will foster businesses that make use of our composite technologies, including those used to produce carbon ¿berreinforced plastic (CFRP), which helps reduce vehicle weight, thereby improving fuel ef¿ciency. In Next-Generation Packaging, we will work to develop packaging materials that help address issues such as food safety and food loss. Recognizing the elimination of marine plastics, a result of inappropriately discarded used plastic products, as a critical challenge, we have also established a project team to promote a switch to viable alternatives and develop biodegradable materials. Our focus in Healthcare will be on developing products that leverage biotechnological processes accumulated in the cultivation of algae and contribute to health and longevity. We will also make strategic investments to expedite our entry into new markets. This will include investing in startups in related ¿elds and seeking advantageous M&A opportunities. 4 A Ànancial strategy centered on cash Áow management DIC111 places top priority on optimizing cash Àow management by working continuously to strengthen our ¿nancial health and investing in portfolio transformation. The plan budgets ¥20.0 billion for strategic investments aimed at accelerating growth. Through such investments, we will endeavor to maintain stable, appropriate dividends while at the same time ensuring sufficient risk management capabilities. We are con¿dent that this will enable us to attain the ¥70.0 billion target we have set for consolidated operating income in ¿scal year 2021, the ¿nal year of DIC111. We have adopted return on invested capital (ROIC) as an indicator of investment ef¿ciency and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA)*, used globally as a measure of a company’s pro¿tability. * Differences in interest rates and methods for calculating taxes and depreciation make it impossible to directly compare the profitability of companies in different countries and territories using simple income figures. Because it minimizes these differences, EBITDA is widely used around the world to assess the relative profitability of companies. Ensuring the DIC Group is loved and respected worldwide by maintaining effective ESG and human resources management | Strengthening Our Management Foundation Against a backdrop of rapid social change, promoting qualitative reforms in businesses and strengthening our management foundation will be crucial to our ability to respond appropriately and achieve sustainable growth. To this end, we will promote ambitious initiatives in line with three key themes. 1 Using digital transformation to reengineer business processes We are taking active steps to advance digitization, which we acknowledge will dramatically change our business processes. In production, we are using digital technologies to further automation and enhance the visibility of various data with the goal of improving quality and efficiency. In R&D, we are reengineering business processes by utilizing materials informatics (MI), which involves applying material properties databases and AI to materials science. Guided by DIC111, we launched a project that employs two main approaches to this challenge. The first is using backcasting to formulate future predictions that take into account advances in IT and other external changes. The second involves exploring how to elevate current themes and what sort of future we can create by doing so. Such initiatives will focus on, among others, advancing factory automation, discovering new chemical materials and creating new business models. 2 Human resources management Human resources management (WING) The success of our efforts to develop new business models is linked inextricably to our Work Style Reform ability to bring together the expertise and energy of diverse human resources. To this end, Reform work styles to capitalize on diversified individuality we inaugurated WING, a program with four core themes that seeks to rally our diverse human resources to enhance our responsiveness to social change and drive diversity HR Infrastructure Reform management, through which we will transform DIC’s fundamental identity. Of paramount Adopt global human resources system and unify Group system importance is to reform work styles to capitalize on individual talents, particularly by shifting the focus of evaluation from quantity to quality. At the same time, we will establish Next Management Selection a new global human resources system and a system for selecting our next management Establish system to appoint the next management team team to help us uncover new core human resources from among the more than 20,000 DIC Group employees in 64 countries and territories, as well as to ensure that we have Global Talent Development the right people in the right places. To facilitate the ef¿cient execution of these initiatives, Develop global human resources in ¿scal year 2019 we established the Human Resources Strategy Department. DIC Report 2019 11 3 Promoting ESG management, including the setting of numerical targets Recent years have reconfirmed our awareness of the fact that addressing environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related issues is crucial to realizing sustainable growth and that this is what ultimately determines corporate value over the long term. In fiscal year 2018, we established the ESG Unit to facilitate a more systematic approach to related initiatives. Group companies continue to work as one to promote a variety of efforts worldwide and have set a number of speci¿c numerical targets. In the area of environmental issues, we aim to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions across global DIC Group sites by 30% from the ¿scal year 2013 level by ¿scal year 2030. To this end, we encourage sites to introduce or switch entirely to energy from renewable sources, including solar power and biomass. In May 2019, we declared our support for the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD), pledging to disclose climate-related information in line with TCFD recommendations going forward. We also remain committed to effective stewardship of the products we provide and have stepped up efforts to develop products such as inks made with bio-derived materials and highly recyclable polystyrene. As an outgrowth of this, we introduced a proprietary sustainability index that evaluates businesses based on environmental impact and contribution to the aforementioned targets, underscoring our commitment to developing products and solutions that bene¿t both customers and markets. We have aligned this index to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Note: For more information on the SDGs, please see page 2.

In May 2018, we formulated the DIC Group Human Rights Policy, which conforms with global codes governing human rights to guide related initiatives in the years ahead. Efforts to address governance-related issues include creating a system based on Japan’s Corporate Governance Code and establishing key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure diversity in management, including the percentage of foreign nationals and women in executive positions, both of which we intend to boost to 30% by ¿scal year 202. In closing, as a manufacturer of ¿ne chemicals we continue to recognize ensuring operational and occupational safety, reducing our impact on the environment and promoting the stringent management of chemical substances as fundamental to our business activities, and to see “doing the right thing and doing it right” as the true way forward. We pledge to continue working to ensure that DIC remains a company that is loved and respected worldwide.

Transformation and Growth through Collaboration DIC Asia Paciﬁc Pte Ltd Managing Director Paul Koek The Asia Paci¿c region is a vibrant and one of the fastest growing region. It is made up of several countries, which is rich in culture, language and ethnicity. With a dynamic and professional workforce of 3,600 employees, we are presently operating in 11 countries with 19 facilities across Asia Paci¿c. The Group’s vision as embedded in the DIC111 is on the principle of sustainable growth through value transformation. This is against the backdrop where the global economy has signi¿cantly changed and the fact that globalisation itself has now taken a different meaning. All this coupled with the dawn of the Fourth Industrial Revolution has taught us that change and transformation is inevitable. The once sheltered Asia Paci¿c Region is now vulnerable but this can bring us many opportunities. DIC Report 2019 19 Messages from Top Executives at Regional Headquarters As part of the strategy to support the DIC111 in the Asia Paci¿c region, the concept of the “3 S” will be implemented. This will entail the Support and the strengthening of the functional and specialist organisations that we will need to transform into. Capitalising on the professional skillsets of our valued employees and technology, new business pillars aligned to the sustainable theme will be identi¿ed, developed and launched. The drive for business alignment through partnership and M&A’s activities will be one of our main focus. Through Specialization, the “Shared Economy” framework will be expounded, driven and implemented. Driving business ef¿ciency through the use of digital tools and analytics, will help the region to focus on “doing things right the ¿rst time” while enhancing our valued Customer’s experience and touchpoints through sustainable quality products. Capitalising on the Group’s strength in technology and aligning with the fast changing laws in the Region, DIC Asia Paci¿c group will also drive the Sustainability pillar. This will improve and embrace our outreach to our valued Customers – through “Color and Comfort”, business collaboration with our partners through our practice of the “DIC Way” and promoting “Diversity, Mobility and Transparency” in a safe work environment for our valued employees. We strongly believe that through effective collaboration with all our stakeholders, the drive to success is assured. Promoting Our New DIC111 Medium-Term Management Plan DIC (China) Co., Ltd. Chairman Shinsuke Toshima DIC (China) oversees the operations of the DIC Group in Greater China, encompassing 29 companies—including two in Hong Kong and ¿ve in Taiwan—and approximately 2,300 employees. Having set a target for regional net sales of ¥8 billion-plus for ¿scal year 2019, we recognize that achieving Value Transformation, a core policy of DIC111, is the most critical challenge we face in the rapidly evolving local economy. Accordingly, we will press ahead with decisive efforts to make qualitative changes to our core businesses, maintaining an accurate grasp of the direction of market change. While the size and potential of the market in Greater China cannot be denied, the existence of a wide range of regional business risks is another point that is often raised. Of particular note in recent years is the swift and seemingly relentless deployment of environmental regulations in the PRC, which in addition to causing considerable confusion in the market has given rise to uncertainty regarding business continuity. The DIC Group must take measures to prepare for near-future risks in a number of its businesses. However, if we look at it from another perspective this may also be a major business opportunity. That is to say, the certainty that multiple companies will drop out of the market will likely help dispel the futile, price only–based competition that currently dominates every sector as a result of overcapacity for some time. In such a market, the critical competitive strength will be brand reliability. Against this backdrop, as a member of the DIC Group—an organization strongly committed to advancing sustainability—we will actively and earnestly promote ESG-related initiatives, leveraging the trust we earn to expand our operations and contributing to achievement of the targets of DIC111. In the current ¿scal year, we established a Corporate Communications Department at DIC (China) with the aim of bolstering recognition of the DIC name and increasing the Group’s pro¿le. The new department will work with DIC’s Corporate Communications Department to promote effective branding efforts in Greater China and support the efforts of product divisions. DIC Report 2019 20 Fiscal Year 2018 DIC Group Topics Topic DIC Teams Up with Biotech Startups in the Development 1 of Naturally Derived Materials DIC and U.S. Firm Checkerspot Enter Into JDA for Advanced High-Performance Materials DIC and Checkerspot, Inc., a high-performance materials innovation company, entered into a joint development agreement (JDA) to create a new class of novel, high-performance polyols.

TOPIC DIC Receives Incentive Award in the 17th GSC Awards for its Development of Sheet-Form Heat Storage Material DIC received an Incentive Award in the 17th Green Sustainable Chemistry (GSC) Awards, conferred by the Japan Association for Chemical Innovation (JACI), for its development of a sheet-form heat storage material. Phase change materials (PCMs), which utilize the thermal properties of phase change—the process of changing from liquid to solid and vice-versa—liquefy at a certain temperature above melting point. PCMs laminated together with other materials have long been used in construction, but dif¿culties in altering size and poor workability have prompted housing builders and general contractors to call for the development of new materials. Leveraging its proprietary coating and compounding technologies, DIC developed a technology for uniformly dispersing PCMs into resin with no degradation of properties to create a thick ¿lm, thereby preventing the materials from oozing and leaking during phase change. In addition to performance comparable to that of PCMs in laminated packages, the resulting sheet-form heat storage material can be cut, bent and fastened into place with screws on-site. DIC’s sheet-form heat storage material can also be laminated together with a variety of other materials such as plasterboard Cut Fasten Bend and flooring, expanding options for use in houses and other buildings and facilitating use in walls and ceilings, which is dif¿cult with conventional products.

DIC Report 2019 29 Special Feature: Product Development Designed to Create New Value Packaging & Graphic SDGs Goals 3, 12 and 13 Water-Based Flexo Ink for High-Resolution Printing on Flexible Packaging (Marine Flex LM-R) Realizing Gravure Ink–Level High-Resolution Printing and Significantly Lower VOCs and Emissions of CO2 Value Creation Expanded use of environment-friendly water-based flexo inks in the area of food packaging The market for packaging inks today is dominated by solvent-based plastic film. Leveraging its proprietary mixing and dispersion technologies, products, which boast outstanding wettability on plastic film substrates and DIC succeeded in developing an innovative ink that achieves a high optical dry swiftly after printing. Nonetheless, demand for water-based, UV-curable density, lifting print quality to a level similar to that obtained with gravure and other environment-friendly alternatives is rising sharply, underpinned by printing. The Company also revamped the resin binder, beginning with its the need to address key social imperatives, including the lowering of volatile structure, to prevent the ink’s high density from weakening adhesion during organic compounds (VOCs), which pollute the air and impact working lamination and to increase the resolubility of ink remaining on the printing environments; the curbing of global CO2 emissions; and the reduction of plate following transfer to the print substrate, thereby ensuring the stability of energy consumed in printing. print quality. The new ink, Marine Flex LM, which was announced at a trade show in October 2016, upended many preconceived notions of flexo inks. While printing on packaging films centers on gravure printing, an intaglio printing process, and flexographic printing, a type of letterpress printing, the latter is leading the global shift toward water-based inks. The principal reason for this is that flexographic printing uses less ink than gravure printing, meaning that even when water-based inks—which dry more slowly than solvent-based inks—are used, drying requires little energy, facilitating superior productivity, i.e., high-speed printing. However, the small volume of ink used makes high-density, high-precision printing difficult, as a result of which flexographic printing has traditionally been seen as inferior to gravure printing, spurring demand for improvements. Against this backdrop, in fiscal year 2015 DIC and DIC Graphics created a Material printed using Marine Flex LM project team to develop a water-based flexo ink for use on flexible packaging for food products, cosmetics and other items, which is made primarily with DIC Report 2019 30 Special Feature: Product Development Designed to Create New Value Flexographic Printing Process ① Ink is supplied to the anilox roller ③ Ink is transferred from the flexo cylinder to the substrate ② Ink is transferred from the anilox roller to the flexo cylinder ④ Ink dries (cures) on the substrate Flexo cylinder Cushion tape Dryer (Oven, UV/EB) Plate cylinder Impression cylinder Ink supply chamber Substrate Anilox roller Nonimage element Image element A Distinctively DIC Response 6HFXULQJWKHDGRSWLRQRIDQHZZDWHUEDVHGÀH[RLQNRQWKHODEHOIRUSuntory Tennensui An innovative, environment-friendly offering, Marine Flex LM EHHQZURQJLQ-XO\WKHSURMHFWWHDPVWHHUHGLWVIRFXVWRZDUG facilitated the DIC Group’s entry into the market for packaging inks.

Since the launch of HYDRECT, I have been particularly surprised by the number of inquiries for applications that we had not even imagined. Although the greatest advantage this varnish offers is that it is an alternative to polyethylene, it cannot currently be used on some types of containers because of their shape. We are thus promoting ongoing efforts to modify the product with the aim of expanding compatibility, not only for containers but also for other applications. In April 2018, the Packaging Solution Center was established at the Tokyo Plant, where I currently work, to advance collaboration with customers in the development of packaging. Looking ahead, we will continue working closely with DIC Graphics, which operates the facility, as we take on the challenge of developing next-generation packaging materials like HYDRECT, taking inspiration from feedback received from visiting customers.

Assistant Manager, Safety and Environment Group, Hokuriku Plant, DIC Corporation Yasushi Sunada Initiatives to Prevent Electrostatic Accidents Electrostatic accidents such as fires, explosions and electric shocks occur when front-line employees at production facilities become electrically charged and energy from the accumulated static electricity is discharged, causing solvents, solvent-containing materials or powders to ignite.

As part of DIC Management School, the Group’s training module for senior management in Japan, in January 2011 a lecture was given by an outside expert on the relationship between corporate activities and biodiversity. The lecture was attended by 85 executives from corporate headquarters, as well as from plants and Group companies across the country, and prompted the launch of a wide range of related initiatives. For example, the same year brought the launch of an initiative designed to ensure an effective grasp of the relationship between the Group’s operating activities and biodiversity at all stages of its products’ life cycles, from R&D and the procurement of raw materials through to end-of-life disposal or recycling. In April 2011, experts from the Chiba Biodiversity Center, a prefectural government organization, observed the natural forest and gardens on the 30-hectare site in Sakura, Chiba Prefecture, occupied by the Central Research Laboratories and the Kawamura Memorial DIC Museum of Art, giving DIC’s biodiversity management efforts high marks and offering advice for future initiatives. From the beginning, DIC has used a closed system for circulating and reusing groundwater for the &HQWUDO5HVHDUFK/DERUDWRULHVDQGKLUHGDZDVWHSURFHVVLQJ¿UPWRHQVXUHQRZDVWHZDWHUHVFDSHGIURP the site.

To preserve the natural environment, visitors to the site are prohibited from collecting plants and wildlife and are instead encouraged to enjoy the pristine natural scenery as is. In cooperation with the Chiba Biodiversity Center, the Kawamura Memorial DIC Museum of Art established a biodiversity satellite, a special display area in a small rest cabin on the site. Designed with the aim of fostering greater understanding of the importance of biodiversity, the satellite features permanent exhibits, including information panels and other materials related to biodiversity prepared by the organization, as well as introduces rare species native to Chiba and provides information on prefectural biodiversity initiatives.

Based on a review of regulations on chemical substances with low production volumes in the early stages of development, the revision shifts the focus of regulations on production volume away from assessed hazards (hazard assessment) and toward risk when released into the environment (risk assessment). In advance of this revision, DIC promoted steady efforts to ensure preparedness, including collecting and analyzing relevant information, as well as extending information to and conducting seminars for customers and Group companies. As a member of JCIA and the Japan Dyestuff and Industrial Chemicals Association (JDICA), DIC chairs a working group charged with formulating effective responses to the new system of exceptions for low production volume substances. Employees in charge play a leading role, working with government authorities to ensure that member companies are prepared and able to implement measures without delay.

DIC Report 2019 123 Human Resources Management VOICE Thanks to the new telecommuting system, both my professional and private life are more fulÀlling. The way salespeople work has changed from back in the day and responsibilities other than visiting customers continue to increase. In addition to dealing with internal paperwork, I have to deal with environmental and legal/regulatory inquiries, so one or two days each week are taken up with deskwork. More than a few of these tasks are conducive to telecommuting. Like most other salespeople, I also work when I have a free moment between business trips and when I’m out of the office. Telecommuting allows me to focus before I leave for a business trip or when I get home, so I’m able to be much more efficient. I look forward making further use of the telecommuting system to achieve a work–life balance that suits me and helps ensure a more fulfilling professional and private life.

Ever since I joined DIC, I have felt a need for English in my work and wanted to do something about my poor English skills, but before I realized it 20 years had passed! When I was given the opportunity to participate in the second round of the Next Global Human Resources Development Program, I saw it as my last chance to study English seriously. About 80% of the 11-month program was conducted in English, so it was tough going and I spent a lot of time feeling puzzled and stressed, but under the guidance of the program’s knowledgeable, experienced and passionate instructors I not only improved my English but also acquired key skills necessary to function in a global business environment. I found the three global communication skills assessment sessions particularly useful as they helped strengthen my English-language presentation, negotiating and communication skills. I’m proud to say that I was definitely among the most enthusiastic and studious participants! The benefits of the program were not limited to improved skills. The extremely challenging nature of training encouraged participants to commiserate. As a result, we all got to know colleagues from other departments, creating a network of program participants that will surely be a valuable asset going forward. I will continue to build on what I learned in this program, as well as to polish my English so that I am ready when the opportunity to work overseas arises.

Basic Approach to Sustainable Procurement Having recognized the increasing importance of addressing global issues related to human rights, climate change and water risk, among others, as social imperatives, the DIC Group promotes socially responsible procurement practices. To ensure its extended supply chain functions in a socially responsible manner, the DIC Group established the DIC Group Universal Purchasing Policy, based on which it also formulated purchasing management regulations, in 2008 and the DIC Group CSR Procurement Guidelines, which clarify issues it expects suppliers to address, in 2009. Using the policy and guidelines, the Group promotes CSR procurement across its supply chain by ensuring that all suppliers implement improvements and initiatives necessary to ensure the sustainability of Group procurement.

DIC Report 2019 131 Sustainable Procurement | Encouraging CSR Procurement Based on the DIC Group Universal Purchasing Policy, and incorporating requirements contained in guidebooks put out by external organizations including the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA), DIC formulated the DIC Group CSR Procurement Guidelines, a series of requirements pertaining to ESG-related imperatives, including the management of chemical substances in and reduction of the environmental impact of raw materials, as well as respect for human rights across its entire supply chain. With the aim of compelling suppliers to observe these guidelines, the DIC Group conducts assessments and on-site inquiries in accordance with the DIC Group Supply-chain CSR Deployment Guidebook. (Version 2 of the guidebook was published in July 2013.) In addition to obliging suppliers to ensure the stringent management of chemical substances through the DIC Group Green Procurement Guidelines, the Group entreats suppliers to develop and release products that have less of an impact on the environment and promote green procurement themselves. The Group also encourages suppliers to lower the environmental impact of materials they procure, and of the packaging, transport, production and engineering thereof, by trimming resources and energy used in, decreasing the weight and expending the useful life span of, and reducing CO2 emissions from such materials. Such measures have proven effective in strengthening the Group’s relations with suppliers. | The DIC Group Green Procurement Guidelines In line with the DIC Group Universal Purchasing Policy, DIC formulated the DIC Group Green Procurement Guidelines, which prohibit the procurement of materials containing hazardous substances in seven categories*17KHJXLGHOLQHVPDQGDWHWKHVXEPLVVLRQRID',&5DZ0DWHULDOV6XUYH\DQ SDS and a chemSHERPA*2, as well as a DIC Group Green Procurement Guidelines Survey, when purchasing raw materials, thereby creating a system for HOLPLQDWLQJVXEVWDQFHVRIFRQFHUQ6XEPLVVLRQRID&RQÀLFW0LQHUDOV6XUYH\LVDOVRUHTXLUHG *1  6XEVWDQFHVWKHSURGXFWLRQRIZKLFKLVSURKLELWHGDVRXWOLQHGLQ$UWLFOHRI-DSDQ¶V,QGXVWULDO+HDOWKDQG6DIHW\$FW  6XEVWDQFHVGHVLJQDWHGDVFODVVVSHFL¿HGFKHPLFDOVXEVWDQFHV LQ-DSDQ¶V$FWRQWKH(YDOXDWLRQRI&KHPLFDO6XEVWDQFHVDQG5HJXODWLRQRI7KHLU0DQXIDFWXUHHWF  6XEVWDQFHVGHVLJQDWHGIRUPRQLWRULQJXQGHU-DSDQ¶V$FWRQWKH(YDOXDWLRQRI&KHPLFDO 6XEVWDQFHVDQG5HJXODWLRQRI7KHLU0DQXIDFWXUHHWF  &KHPLFDOVXEVWDQFHVWKHSURGXFWLRQRIZKLFKLVDOUHDG\SURKLELWHGDVGHWDLOHGLQ-DSDQ¶V$FWRQWKH3URWHFWLRQRIWKH2]RQH/D\HU 7KURXJKWKH&RQWURORI6SHFL¿HG6XEVWDQFHVDQG2WKHU0HDVXUHV R]RQHGHSOHWLQJVXEVWDQFHVOLVWHGLQWKH0RQWUHDO3URWRFRO   6SHFL¿HGSDUWLFXODWHVGHQRWHGLQ-DSDQ¶V$LU3ROOXWLRQ &RQWURO$FW  6SHFL¿HGSRLVRQRXVVXEVWDQFHVLQGLFDWHGLQ-DSDQ¶V3RLVRQRXVDQG'HOHWHULRXV6XEVWDQFHV&RQWURO$FWDQG  6SHFL¿HGVXEVWDQFHVGHWDLOHGLQWKH6WRFNKROP&RQYHQWLRQRQ Persistent Organic Pollutants. *2 FKHP6+(53$LVDVFKHPHGHVLJQHGWRIDFLOLWDWHWKHDFFXUDWHDQGHI¿FLHQWVKDULQJRILQIRUPDWLRQRQFKHPLFDOVXEVWDQFHVLQSURGXFWVDFURVVWKHHQWLUHVXSSO\FKDLQ',&EHJDQXVLQJ FKHP6+(53$LQODWH¿VFDO\HDU | Advance Assessment of New Suppliers ,QDGGLWLRQWRUHTXLULQJVXEPLVVLRQRIWKHIRXUPDQGDWRU\GRFXPHQWVOLVWHGDERYHDVZHOODVD&RQÀLFW0LQHUDOV6XUYH\',&FRQGXFWVFRPSUHKHQVLYH advance assessments of major new suppliers, including from a CSR perspective. | Supplier Self-Evaluation In accordance with version 2 of the DIC Group Supply-chain CSR Deployment Guidebook, the DIC Group asks suppliers to complete questionnaires, which it uses to ascertain the status of suppliers’ CSR procurement practices.

With the goal of swiftly realizing this mission, DIC has outlined two basic business development strategies in its new medium-term management plan, DIC111: “Value Transformation” and “New Pillar Creation.” In line with the strategy of Value Transformation, the Group will advance qualitative reforms in existing core businesses by shifting to businesses with differentiated high-value-added products and with more of a focus on social value. New Pillar Creation emphasizes creating new businesses by identifying areas where ESH-related issues and social changes intersect with the DIC Group’s competencies. This strategy continues to guide a number of key initiatives, several of which are described on page 135. | Designing a Framework for New Pillar Creation 7KH',&*URXS¶VVXFFHVVLQSURYLGLQJQHZSURGXFWVDQGVHUYLFHVWKDWEHQH¿WVRFLHW\DQGFUHDWLQJQHZ Priority Areas of the New businesses will depend on how well it understands the sources of its competitiveness and whether it can Business Development Headquarters swiftly and accurately identify social imperatives and needs.

FINETECH JAPAN booth VOICE We are working to create next-generation businesses that will ensure a sustainable future for everyone. In formulating our new medium-term management plan, DIC111, we held extensive discussions on how to best incorporate sustainability, represented by the SDGs, into the creation of next-generation businesses. One conclusion this process yielded was that there was a need for another scale— namely, sustainability indicators—for assessing businesses. That prompted us to revisit the question of who “sustainability” is for. Our goal is not to promote sustainability exclusively for customers, nor is it only a way for us to fulfill our responsibility as a corporate citizen. Rather, we must seek to ensure a sustainable future for everyone—the DIC Group, including the employees engaged in production, the customers who use our products, and also society, to which our products ultimately contribute. This belief will continue to guide our efforts to create nextgeneration businesses.

Accordingly, the DIC Group has introduced marketing automation designed to more effectively utilize electronic communications channels with the aim of responding swiftly to customer requests. The Group will continue working to enhance its communications with customers by ensuring its ability to address inquiries in a timely manner. | Ties with Shareholders and Investors The DIC Group has established a policy for promoting constructive dialogue with shareholders and strives to ensure fair, appropriate and timely disclosure and to communicate closely with shareholders and investors, as well as to raise awareness of its ESG initiatives.

In this environment, consolidated net sales increased 2.0%, to ¥805.5 billion, reflecting multiple factors, including the revision of sales prices and firm shipments. Operating income declined 14.3%, to ¥48.4 billion, hampered by rising raw materials prices, higher distribution costs and the depreciation of currencies in European emerging economies, among others.

Operating income fell sharply, owing to the aforementioned sales results, as well as to rising raw materials prices, higher distribution costs and other factors. The Americas and Europe Although sales of packaging inks rose, sales in North America edged down, owing to waning demand for publishing inks and news inks. In Europe, sales increased, boosted by brisk shipments of packaging inks. Sales in Central and South America were up in all product categories. As a result, overall sales in the Americas and Europe advanced, underpinned by an increase in sales of packaging inks, among others. Despite rising in local currency terms, reflecting the aforementioned sales results and expanded sales of security inks, operating income was down after translation owing to the depreciation of currencies in emerging economies, including the Turkish lira. 3 Management’s Discussion and Analysis Asia and Oceania Higher shipments of packaging inks and publishing inks bolstered sales in the PRC and Southeast Asia.

financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions Presenting set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations, and Financial in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different Statements in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. The consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese yen, the currency of the country in which DIC Corporation (the “Company”) is incorporated. Note 2: Summary of Consolidated financial statements Significant Under the control or influence concept, those companies in which the Company, directly or indirectly, is able to Accounting exercise control over operations are fully consolidated and those companies over which the Company has the Policies ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its significant subsidiaries: Sun Chemical Group Coöperatief U.A., DIC (CHINA) CO., LTD., DIC Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, SEIKO PMC CORPORATION, DIC INVESTMENTS JAPAN, LLC., DIC Graphics Corporation and 141 other companies in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (138 other companies in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All material unrealized profit included in assets resulting from transactions within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Group”) is eliminated. Investments in 26 affiliates in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (26 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017), are accounted for by the equity method. Accounting period of consolidated subsidiaries The closing date of the consolidated subsidiaries is the same as the consolidated closing date. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on hand, certificates of deposit and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have insignificant risk of changes in value. Investment securities Investment securities are classified and accounted for, depending on management’s intent, into available-forsale securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value as of the balance sheet date, with unrealized gain and loss, net of applicable taxes, reported in a separate component of net assets. Available-for-sale securities whose fair values are not readily available are carried at cost. The cost of securities sold is calculated by the moving-average method. Allowance for doubtful accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts of the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries is provided mainly based on historical experience for normal receivables and on an estimate of collectability of receivables from companies in financial difficulty. Allowance for doubtful accounts of foreign consolidated subsidiaries is provided mainly based on an estimate of collectability of receivables. Inventories Inventories are principally stated at cost, cost being determined by the FIFO method, which evaluates the amount of the inventories shown in the balance sheet by writing them down based on their decrease in profitability. Property, plant and equipment (excluding leased assets) Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Significant renewals and additions are capitalized; maintenance and repairs, and minor renewals and improvements, are charged to income as incurred. Depreciation of buildings (other than facilities attached to buildings) of the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries is calculated principally by the straight-line method. Besides, depreciation of facilities 12 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements attached to buildings and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016, is also calculated by the straight-line method. Other property, plant and equipment are calculated by the declining-balance method. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment of foreign consolidated subsidiaries is calculated principally by the straight-line method. The range of useful lives is principally from 8 to 50 years for buildings and structures and from 3 to 11 years for machinery, equipment and vehicles. Intangible assets (excluding leased assets) Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, and are amortized by the straight-line method. Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over a reasonable period not exceeding 20 years. Leased assets For the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries, leased assets related to finance leases that do not transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee are depreciated on a straight-line basis, with the lease periods used as their useful lives and no residual value. Foreign consolidated subsidiaries account for lease transactions in accordance with either the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) or IFRS. Retirement and pension plans Net defined benefit assets/liabilities are recognized for employees’ and executive officers’ retirement benefits. Pension assets are deducted from retirement benefit obligations and the net amount is recognized based on the estimated amount of payment as of the balance sheet date. In calculating retirement benefit obligations, the Company applies a method of attributing expected retirement benefits to each period on a benefit formula basis. The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries amortize actuarial gains and losses in the succeeding years primarily by the straight-line method over stated years that do not exceed the average remaining service period of the eligible employees (14 to 16 years). Past service costs are amortized in the accounting periods when they accrue. Foreign consolidated subsidiaries amortize actuarial gains and losses in the succeeding years primarily by the straight-line method over stated years that do not exceed the average remaining service period of the eligible employees (8 to 28 years). Past service costs are amortized over 2 to 28 years. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized past service costs are recorded in “Remeasurements of defined benefit plans” in net assets after adjusting income tax effect. Asset retirement obligations The asset retirement obligation is recognized as the sum of the discounted cash flows required for the future asset retirement and is recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate can be made. If a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation cannot be made in the period in which the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation can be made. Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, an asset retirement cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related fixed asset by the amount of the liability. The asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense through depreciation over the remaining useful life of the asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period. Any subsequent revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows are reflected as an increase or a decrease in the carrying amount of the liability and the capitalized amount of the related asset retirement cost. Income taxes The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income (loss) included in the consolidated statement of income. Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes. These deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws to the temporary differences. Research and development costs Research and development costs are charged to income as incurred. 13 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of translation of financial statements of foreign consolidated subsidiaries The financial statements of foreign consolidated subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements are translated into Japanese yen based on the following procedures: (1) Assets and liabilities of foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. (2) Income and expenses are translated into Japanese yen at the average rate during the year. The differences of translation are included in foreign currency translation adjustment and non-controlling interests, which are presented as separate components of net assets. Translation of foreign currency accounts Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date and any difference arising from the translation is recognized in the consolidated statement of income if hedge accounting is not applied. Derivatives and hedging activities To hedge risks associated with the fluctuations of exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts, currency options and swaps, interest rate swaps and commodity swaps. To hedge a part of the risks associated with the fluctuations of exchange rates for net investments in foreign entities, the Company uses loans denominated in foreign currencies. The Group does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments and foreign currency transactions are classified and accounted for as follows: 1) all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognized in the consolidated statement of income and 2) for derivatives used for hedging purposes, if derivatives qualify for hedge accounting because of high correlation and effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, gains or losses on derivatives are deferred until maturity of the hedged transactions. Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the contracted rates if the forward contracts qualify for hedge accounting. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred and recognized in income when the hedged transaction occurs. If interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting and meet certain specific matching criteria, they will not be measured at market value, rather the differential paid or received under the swaps will be recognized in interest expenses or interest income. Per share information Earnings per share (basic) is computed by dividing net income attributable to owners of the parent available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares issued for the period, retroactively adjusted for stock splits. The Company implemented a consolidation of shares of common stock by a factor of 10 to 1 with July 1, 2016, as the effective date. Earnings per share (basic) is calculated based on the assumption that the consolidation had been implemented at the beginning of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Earnings per share (diluted) reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock. Earnings per share (diluted) assumes full conversion of the outstanding convertible notes and bonds at the beginning of the year (or at the time of issuance) with an applicable adjustment for related interest expense, net of tax, and full exercise of outstanding warrants. Cash dividends per share presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of income are dividends applicable to the respective years, including dividends to be paid after the end of the year. Cash dividends per share applicable to the period for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, comprises interim dividends of ¥4.00 (before the consolidation) and year-end dividends of ¥60.00 (after the consolidation). If the consolidation had been taken into consideration, cash dividends per share applicable to the period for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, would be ¥100.00. From the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Company introduced the Board Benefit Trust (BBT). The shares held by the trust are recorded under net assets as treasury shares. The number of treasury shares excluded from the number of shares issued as of the balance sheet date used for the calculation of equity per share includes the number of shares held by the trust. The number of treasury shares excluded from the weightedaverage number of shares issued during the fiscal year used for the calculation of earnings per share includes the number of shares held by the trust. 14 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3: Changes in Under “Intangible assets,” “Customer-related assets,” which was previously included in “Other,” is now prePresentation sented separately from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, owing to its increased financial materiality. (Consolidated To reflect this change, ¥3,548 million presented as “Other” under “Intangible assets” in the consolidated Balance Sheet) balance sheet of the previous fiscal year has been reclassified, with ¥874 million presented as “Customerrelated assets” and ¥2,674 million presented as “Other.” Note 4: New Accounting Implementation Guidance on Tax Effect Accounting Pronouncements • “Implementation Guidance on Tax Effect Accounting” (ASBJ Guidance No. 28, revised on February 16, 2018) • “Implementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets” (ASBJ Guidance No. 26, revised on February 16, 2018) (1) Overview Implementation Guidances have been reviewed and amended at the following points, deemed necessary in transferring the control over the practical guidelines for tax effect accounting from the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“JICPA”) to the Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ), basically following their contents. (Main accounting treatments reviewed and amended) • Treatments for taxable temporary differences for investments in subsidiaries within the context of nonconsolidated financial statements • Treatments in determining recoverability of deferred tax assets in a company which was categorized as ‘Type 1’ according to the guidance (2) Date of adoption The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries will adopt these revised implementation guidances from the beginning of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. (3) Impact of the adoption of the revised implementation guidances The Company is in the process of measuring the effects of applying these revised implementation guidances in future applicable periods. Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition • “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Statement No. 29, issued on March 30, 2018) • “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No. 30, issued on March 30, 2018) (1) Overview The International Accounting Standard Board (“IASB”) and the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) jointly developed a comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recognition and issued “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” in May 2014 (IFRS 15 by IASB, and ASU 2014-09 by FASB). IFRS 15 was applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and ASU 2014-09 was also applied from annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Based on such a situation, the ASBJ developed the comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recognition and the implementation guidance and issued them together. The basic objective of the ASBJ in developing the accounting standards regarding revenue recognition, was to enhance comparability between financial statements, which is one of the points of convenience of interfacing with IFRS 15. Accordingly, the accounting standard fundamentally incorporates the basic policies of IFRS 15. Also, where there are items that should be considered to reflect the business practices in Japan, alternative policies will be added to the extent that comparability is not lost. (2) Date of adoption The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries will adopt the issued accounting standard and implementation guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. 15 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (3) Impact of the adoption of the accounting standard and implementation guidance The Company is in the process of measuring the effects of applying the accounting standard and implementation guidance in future applicable periods. IFRS 16 Leases ASU 2016-02 Leases (1) Overview The IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases, concurrently with the introduction of ASU 2016-02 into the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification. These accounting standards require lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability in the statement of financial position. There are no significant changes for lessors in these accounting standards. (2) Date of adoption Foreign consolidated subsidiaries will adopt IFRS 16 from the beginning of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and ASU 2016-02 from the beginning of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. (3) Impact of the adoption of the accounting standards The Company is in the process of measuring the effects of applying the accounting standards in future applicable periods. Note 5: Additional Board Benefit Trust (BBT) Information With regard to the compensation for executive officers, as well as directors who concurrently serve as executive officers (the “Target Officers”), the Company introduced a performance-based stock compensation plan called Board Benefit Trust (BBT) (the “Plan”) from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The purpose of the Plan is to further clarify the linkage between the compensation of the Target Officers, and corporate performance and the value of the Company’s shares. The intended result is strengthening the Target Officers’ awareness of their contributions to the mediumto long-term improvement of corporate performance and value. Accounting treatment related to the trust agreement is in accordance with “Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to Employees etc. through Trusts” (PITF No. 30, March 26, 2015).

(3) Defined contribution pension plans The required contributions borne by the Company and a number of consolidated subsidiaries in relation to the defined contribution pension plans for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, are ¥1,940 million and ¥2,042 million, respectively. Note 13: Net Assets Japanese companies are subject to the Companies Act of Japan (the “Companies Act”). The significant provisions in the Companies Act that affect financial and accounting matters are summarized below: (1) Dividends Under the Companies Act, companies can pay dividends at any time during the fiscal year in addition to the year-end dividend upon resolution at the shareholders’ meeting. For companies that meet certain criteria such as: (a) having a board of directors, (b) having independent auditors, (c) having a board of corporate auditors and (d) the term of service of the directors being prescribed as one year rather than the two years of a normal term by its articles of incorporation, the board of directors may declare dividends (except for dividends in kind) at any time during the fiscal year if the company has prescribed so in its articles of incorporation. The Company meets all the above criteria. The Companies Act permits companies to distribute dividends in kind (non-cash assets) to shareholders subject to a certain limitation and additional requirements. Semiannual interim dividends may also be paid once a year upon resolution by the board of directors if the articles of incorporation of the company so stipulate. The Companies Act provides certain limitations on the amounts available for dividends or the purchase of treasury shares. The limitation is defined as the amount 22 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements available for distribution to the shareholders, but the amount of net assets after dividends must be maintained at no less than ¥3 million. (2) Increases/decreases and transfer of common stocks, reserve and surplus The Companies Act requires that an amount equal to 10% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus) depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends until the total of the aggregate amount of legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 25% of the common stock. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and legal reserve may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that common stock, legal reserve, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus and retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts under certain conditions upon resolution of the shareholders. (3) Treasury shares and treasury stock acquisition rights The Companies Act also provides for companies to purchase treasury shares and dispose of such treasury shares by resolution of the board of directors. The amount of treasury shares purchased cannot exceed the amount available for distribution to the shareholders which is determined by a specific formula. Under the Companies Act, stock acquisition rights, which were previously presented as a liability, are now presented as a separate component of equity. The Companies Act also provides that companies can purchase both treasury stock acquisition rights and treasury shares. Such treasury stock acquisition rights are presented as a separate component of equity or deducted directly from stock acquisition rights. Note 14: Capital Stock The total amount of capital stock authorized as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, is 150,000,000 shares. The total amount of capital stock issued as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, is 95,156,904 shares. Note 15: Treasury Shares The number of treasury shares as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows: Shares 2018 As of January 1, Increase in Decrease in As of December 31, 2018 FY2018 FY2018 2018 Treasury shares: Common stock 512,293 2,642 3,900 511,035 Total 512,293 2,642 3,900 511,035 Notes: 1.

Means of financings include direct financing such as the issuance of bonds and commercial papers and liquidation of receivables, as well as indirect financing such as shortand long-term bank borrowings, the terms of which are determined based on financial market conditions and account balances at the time. Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments Receivables such as trade notes and accounts receivable are exposed to customer credit risk. In addition, some of such receivables are denominated in foreign currencies and are exposed to the market risk of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. Investment securities, mainly the stocks of customers and suppliers, are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations. Payment terms of payables, such as trade notes and accounts payable, are less than one year. In addition, some of such payables are denominated in foreign currencies and are exposed to the market risk of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. Funds needed for operations are mainly procured as short-term loans payable, whereas funds needed for capital expenditure and investment are mainly procured as long-term loans payable, bonds payable and lease obligations with regard to finance lease transactions. A part of such bank loans, bonds and lease obligations are exposed to market risks from changes in variable interest rates. Trade accounts payable and loans payable of the Company are also exposed to liquidity risk that the Company cannot meet its contractual obligations in full on maturity dates. Risk management for financial instruments The Company manages its credit risk from trade notes and accounts receivable on the basis of internal guidelines, which include the monitoring of payment terms and balances of customers by the sales and business administration departments to identify the default risk of customers at an early stage. The consolidated subsidiaries of the Company manage the exposure to credit risk on their own in accordance with their internal guidelines. Investment securities are managed by monitoring market values, the financial position of issuers and considering the relationship with customers and suppliers on a regular basis. The Group also tries to mitigate liquidity risk by arranging lines of credit with financial institutions, along with adequate financial planning. 25 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Fair values of financial instruments The following tables present the carrying amounts and the fair values of financial instruments at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Financial instruments whose fair values are not reliably measured are excluded from the tables below.

Net debt amounts are indicated in parentheses. The valuation techniques used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments and information on the marketable securities and derivative financial instruments are as follows: Assets Cash and deposits and notes and accounts receivable–trade The fair values of cash and deposits and notes and accounts receivable–trade approximate their carrying amounts as these amounts are settled in a short period of time. Investment securities The fair values of investment securities are measured at the quoted market price on the stock exchange. Liabilities Notes and accounts payable–trade, short-term loans payable and income taxes payable The fair values of these accounts approximate their carrying amounts as these amounts are settled in a short period of time. Current portion of long-term loans payable and long-term loans payable For long-term loans payable bearing a floating interest rate, the fair values of those subject to special treatment of interest rate swaps are based on present value by totaling the amount of principal and interest, together with related interest rate swaps, discounted by the interest rate that would apply if equivalent long-term loans were newly entered into. The fair values of other long-term loans payable for which a floating interest rate is applied approximate their carrying amounts, due to the fact that the market rate of interest is quickly factored in while credit status of the Company remains unchanged. On the other hand, the fair values of long-term loans payable for which a fixed interest rate is applied are determined by discounting the cash flows related to the long-term loans payable. The discount rate applied for the calculation above is the interest rate that may be currently available to the Group for loans payable with similar terms and conditions. 27 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Lease obligations (current) and lease obligations (non-current) The fair values of these accounts are determined by discounting the cash flows related to the lease obligations. The discount rate applied for the calculation above is the interest rate that may be currently available to the Group for lease obligations with similar terms and conditions. Bonds payable The fair values are measured at the quoted market prices. Derivative financial instruments Please see Note 20 “Derivative Financial Instruments” for more information. Financial instruments whose fair values are not reliably measured There are no market prices for non-listed stocks and others (carrying amounts as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are ¥29,541 million and ¥29,375 million, respectively) whose future cash flows cannot be estimated. The fair values of such non-listed stocks and others are not reliably determinable and thus excluded from investment securities. Redemption schedule for financial assets and securities The redemption schedules for financial assets and securities with contractual maturities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are summarized as follows: Millions of yen 2018 Due in 1 year Due after 1 year Due after 5 years Due after or less through 5 years through 10 years 10 years Notes and accounts receivable—trade ¥209,763 ¥— ¥— ¥— Total ¥209,763 ¥— ¥— ¥— Millions of yen 2017 Due in 1 year Due after 1 year Due after 5 years Due after or less through 5 years through 10 years 10 years Notes and accounts receivable—trade ¥226,968 ¥— ¥— ¥— Total ¥226,968 ¥— ¥— ¥— Repayment schedule for bonds payable, long-term loans payable and other interest-bearing debt The repayment schedules for bonds payable, long-term loans payable and other interest-bearing debt with contractual maturities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are summarized as follows: Millions of yen 2018 Due in 1 year Due after 1 year Due after 5 years Due after or less through 5 years through 10 years 10 years Short-term loans payable ¥29,986 ¥ — ¥ — ¥ — Current portion of long-term loans payable 49,792 — — — Lease obligations (current) 667 — — — Bonds payable — 30,000 25,000 5,000 Long-term loans payable — 94,823 24,968 — Lease obligations (non-current) — 2,431 1,798 — Total ¥80,445 ¥127,254 ¥51,766 ¥5,000 28 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of yen 2017 Due in 1 year Due after 1 year Due after 5 years Due after or less through 5 years through 10 years 10 years Short-term loans payable ¥61,385 ¥ — ¥ — ¥ — Current portion of long-term loans payable 27,677 — — — Lease obligations (current) 557 — — — Bonds payable — 20,000 25,000 5,000 Long-term loans payable — 112,017 10,000 — Lease obligations (non-current) — 1,925 2,120 — Total ¥89,619 ¥133,942 ¥37,120 ¥5,000 Note 20: Derivative The Group has entered into various foreign currency forward contracts, currency options and swaps, interest Financial rate swaps and commodity swaps. Instruments Foreign currency forward contracts and currency options and swaps are entered into to hedge the effects of exchange rate changes on receivables and payables or anticipated transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Interest rate swaps are entered into to hedge the effects of interest rate changes and to reduce financing cost. Commodity swaps are entered into to hedge the effects of commodity price changes of fuel. Loans denominated in foreign currencies are entered into to hedge a part of risks associated with the fluctuations of exchange rates for investments in foreign entities. The Group does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative transactions performed by the Group have risks due to fluctuations of exchange rates, interest rates and other factors. Because these transactions are executed with creditworthy financial institutions, the Group does not anticipate the likelihood of any losses resulting from default by the counterparties to these agreements. Internal regulation for managing derivative transactions has been established for the purpose of risk control in the Company, and all derivative transactions are performed under this regulation. The execution of derivative transactions is carried out by the Company’s finance department, and the management of risk is monitored by the Company’s accounting department. Transactions are periodically reported to the board of directors by the officer in charge of the Finance and Accounting Division. Consolidated subsidiaries execute transactions in accordance with their regulations for derivative management and periodically report the results of those transactions to the Company. 29 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Derivative transactions to which hedge accounting is not applied at December 31, 2018 and 2017 (1) Currency related Millions of yen 2018 Contract/notional Contract/notional amount due after Unrealized amount one year Fair value gain/loss Currency options: (Note 1) Selling Euro ¥ 1,205 ¥— ¥(14) ¥(14) Buying U.S.$ 1,252 — 37 37 Other 865 — 4 4 Foreign currency forward contracts: (Note 2) Selling Russian ruble 2,736 — 106 106 Colombian peso 1,549 — 18 18 Canadian $ 1,273 — 20 20 Other 380 — (8) (8) Buying U.S.$ 3,878 — (14) (14) Other 394 — 3 3 Total ¥13,532 ¥— ¥152 ¥152 Notes: 1.

The Group has seven product divisions, namely “Printing Inks,” “Pigments,” “Liquid Crystal Materials,” “Polymers,” “Liquid Compounds,” “Solid Compounds” and “Application Materials,” and each product division conducts its business. The product divisions are aggregated into five reportable segments, namely “Printing Inks,” “Fine Chemicals,” “Polymers,” “Compounds” and “Application Materials,” based on the similarity of the products and services. “Printing Inks” mainly consists of gravure inks, offset inks and news inks. “Fine Chemicals” mainly consists of organic pigments and liquid crystal materials. “Polymers” mainly consists of synthetic resins, such as acrylic, polyurethane, epoxy and polystyrene resins. “Compounds” mainly consists of polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) compounds, jet inks and plastic colorants. “Application Materials” mainly consists of industrial adhesive tapes and health foods. Methods of measurement for the amounts of sales, profit (loss), assets, liabilities and other items for each reportable segment The accounting policies of each reportable segment are consistent with those disclosed in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Segment profits are based on operating income. Intersegment sales are mainly based on market price or cost of goods manufactured.

Basic framework for internal control over financial reporting Kaoru Ino, Representative Director, President and CEO, and Masayuki Saito, Representative Director, Executive Vice President and CFO of DIC Corporation (the “Company”), are responsible for designing and operating internal control over the Company’s financial reporting and have designed and operated internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the basic framework for internal control set forth in “On the Revision of the Standards and Practice Standards for Management Assessment and Audit concerning Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (Council Opinions),” issued by the Business Accounting Council of the Financial Services Agency of Japan. Internal control aims to achieve its objectives to a reasonable extent with the organized and integrated function of basic individual elements of internal control as a whole. Accordingly, due to the inherent limitations, there is a possibility that misstatements may not be completely prevented or detected by internal controls over financial reporting. 2. Scope of assessment, the basis date of assessment and assessment procedures The assessment of internal control over financial reporting for fiscal year 2018 was conducted as of December 31, 2018, which is the end of this fiscal year. The assessment was performed in accordance with relevant assessment standards generally accepted in Japan for internal control over financial reporting. In conducting this assessment, we began by evaluating internal control which may have a material impact on overall consolidated financial reporting (“company-level controls”) and, based on the results of this assessment, business processes to be assessed were selected. We then analyzed these selected business processes to identify key controls therein that may have a material impact on the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting, after which we examined the design and operation of these controls. These procedures thus allowed us to accurately evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. We determined the required scope of assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method affiliates from the perspective of materiality or the degree to which it may affect the reliability of financial reporting. Materiality of the impact which may affect the reliability of financial reporting is determined based on potential quantitative and qualitative impact on financial reporting. In light of the results of assessment of company-level controls, we reasonably determined the scope of assessment of process-level controls. Consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method affiliates which were concluded as immaterial taking into account the degree of quantitative and qualitative impact are not included in the scope for assessment of company-level controls. With regard to the process-level controls, significant locations and business units to be tested were selected based on the changes in the scope of consolidation during the year, as well as on net sales for the previous year, with locations and business units the combined sales volume of which reached approximately twothirds of consolidated net sales being defined as “significant.” The scope of assessment at these locations and business units encompassed business processes relevant to net sales, accounts receivable-trade, accounts payable-trade, inventories and manufacturing facilities included in property, plant and equipment as significant accounts that may have a material impact on the business objectives of the Company. In addition, business processes relating to (i) greater likelihood of material misstatements, and/or (ii) significant accounts involving estimates and management’s judgment, were also identified as business processes having greater materiality, taking into account their impact on financial reporting, and were included in the scope. 3. Results of the assessment Based on the results of the assessment, we concluded that as of the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effectively maintained.
