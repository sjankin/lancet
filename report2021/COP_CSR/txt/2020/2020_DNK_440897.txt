UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Report P O M Pde LUX A p S 2019 POMPdeLUX | UN GLOBAL COMPACTCOMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT | PAGE 1 The Nature Of Our Business POMPdeLUX ApS is a Danish fashion house founded in 2006 in Aarhus. In 2015, ­Marianne Hoffmann Dyrbøl became sole owner of the company. Our vision is to be the preferred children’s brand by selling everyday luxury for children inspired by the latest trends. Besides our high-quality demands to ensure our garments can last for more generations, it has always been our goal to deliver a unique design embracing the child’s personality. Therefore, we design and produce everything ourselves from the buttons to fabrics and prints. Every style comes with a story. We have a vision to always deliver nice design, high-quality products at affordable prices as well as to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction. All products are designed in Denmark and produced by our agent’s suppliers in Turkey, China, India, Bangladesh, and Ukraine. All following our code of conduct concerning human rights, anti-corruption, environment and chemical restriction. To avoid extra cost on our salesprices, the concept is based on Business to Consumer. That is why we sell through our ­Consultants via Home Shopping events and in our online shop. To avoid garment ­wastage, we sell remaining stock in our own outlet stores. At POMPdeLUX we put an effort into acting in a socially responsible way, whether it c­ oncerns the environment, production conditions in the Far East or the conditions, which we have created at our office and warehouse in Denmark. We want to ensure healthy work surroundings, satisfied customers, and happy e ­ mployees and therefore, we are continuing to improve our performance when it comes to the company´s social responsibility. We will continue with targets in the ten principles in The UN Global Compact and will still have the focus on our performance by measuring year by year. It will help us to be engaged and act responsibly locally and globally. ABOUT US Address: Omega 7, 8382 Hinnerup, Denmark Communication of Progress (COP) information Sector : Textile Date: 16.

We mainly operate in long term relationships with a smaller group of core suppliers through agents, with whom we have cooperated for a longer time.

Our CSR-policy is covering all international labor principles and we regulate our staff according to Danish legislation and the collective agreements in our area of business. We strive to create a safe and sound workplace for permanent workers as well as all our temporary workers, and we uphold the right to collective bargaining and the freedom of association. ACTIVITIES We have occupational health and safety policy and we have worked with our working environment for several years in our Occupational Health and Safety committee. ­According to Danish legislation standards, we assess any labor-related risks or accidents at POMPdeLUX ApS professionally, and we have 4 meetings every year in the OHS committee. We condemn dangerous work, so all employees are introduced to basic Health & Safety topics upon recruitment.

For monthly paid workers flexible working hours is a possibility. We have health insurance covering all permanent employees, and everyone has a company paid pension.

Two times a month our personal hairdresser and masseur are in-house and the employees have the possibility during the working day to use their services against own payment. All permanent workers have a great possibility to buy clothes for their children at favorable prices. In autumn of 2019 we increased our focus on exercise and health for our employees with several initiatives. We encouraged our employees to include a 10min walk & talk in their lunchbreak two days a week, arranged an exercise-day with hourly exercise breaks throughout the day and weekly company paid yoga-sessions after workhours. We also encouraged our employees to participate in a ‘step counting’ competition, which was a great success that prompted both exercise and team spirit. In addition, we have introduced two desk-bikes at the office, which makes it easier for our employees to stay physically active during the day. Lastly, to make sure our employees use the most appropriate working postures, we had individual work place evalutations conducted by occupational therapists in autumn 2019. We focus on good cooperation with the staff. We educate our staff in leading positions always to involve human understanding in all decisions. We focus on good cooperation and helpfulness among colleagues by valuing the ability to corporate and work in teams. We show humanity towards our staff whenever they have an unfortunate private situation and we are confident that they will pay us back in their own way. POMPdeLUX is committed to ensuring influence on human rights and working conditions in our supply chain and we endeavor to improve our social performance in the supply chain in a valid and trustworthy way.

Our effort on restricted chemicals has contributed to a general higher awareness of avoiding harmful chemicals in our clothes, zippers and buttons. We are committed to offer our customers as many products as possible with Oeko-Tex standard 100 label, the organic label, GOTS and other sustainable materials and production methodes. Furthermore, our chemical code of conduct follows Oeko-Tex 100 class 1 values, even though they are not labeled. Our suppliers are obligated to inform if any production deviate and in which area the deviation is found. We promise to do random chemical tests made by Bureau Veritas. ACTIVITIES We uncover our resources on essential and relevant areas and strive to reduce our consumption pr. employee. Our position on transportation is clear and demands us to prevent from flying clothes to Denmark unless absolutely necessary. Good preparation is the key to the solution in that respect and we endeavor to influence our suppliers to have the same attitude. We will still have the focus on our transportation ways in 2019 and will prefer sea freight whenever possible. We strive to have as much of our clothes labeled with the health label, Oeko-Tex 100 to create confidence for our consumers. We also support the organic clothing industry by using the GOTS label on as much organic cotton products as possible. We have an organic collection of underwear/nightwear produced according to the international global standard GOTS and in 2019 we have added more products labeled with GOTS. In 2019 we also introduced styles in our collections produced in recycled polyester and Eco Vero viscose and continue to explore innovative materials and methodes in the coming seasons. Through our membership in BSCI we have implemented our policies, restricted chemicals program and the BSCI Code of Conduct in our supply chain. Additionally, we try to help our suppliers with working tools, management manual and make sure that all health and safety issues are understood. We have 100% signed commitments to our restricted chemicals program from suppliers and all our core suppliers have obtained a higher awareness on environmental challenges in general. We perform chemical testing on a random basis. POMPdeLUX | UN GLOBAL COMPACTCOMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT | PAGE 10 “ WE STRIVE TO REDUCE THE WORLDWIDE ­IMPACT, WHICH WE HAVE FROM RUNNING OUR BUSINESS POMPdeLUX | UN GLOBAL COMPACTCOMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT | PAGE 11 EFFECT FROM ACTIVITIES POMPdeLUX Aps comply with Danish environmental legislation and thus we are confident that we have no violation of environmental laws in Denmark. In 2019 our measurements of water, heating, electricity and waste are the following: (Pr. worker) 2018 2019 Water in m3 8,7 7,8 Waste in KG 425 357 Cardboard for recycling in KG 852 897 Heating in m3 401 490 Electricity in KwH 3420 4347 2018 2019 Transportation by ship/ air/truck/rail in % 63/16/8/13 71/9/16/4 % of BV with Oeko-Tex 100 36% 35% % of BV is cotton according to GOTS 7,2% 14% % of BV with both Oeko-tex 100 and 3% 6% GOTS % Organic 2019 0,5% % ECO-Vero 2019 0,71% In the second part of 2018, we moved our warehouse and administration into a new location. This move continued to be beneficial for us in 2019. We have the benefits of a joined workplace, which has meant a closer collaboration between the administration and warehouse. We act and make decisions at a higher pace than earlier and have also seen cost advantage in our consumption which also counts the consumption of CO2 and hereby a deduction of our CO2 footprint. 2019 is the first full year in our new location and therefore we can’t compare one to one with the heating and electricity consumption from 2018 to 2019. It´s very important that we don´t have any leftovers and we never destroy any garments after end of season. Instead we distribute our stock to our outlet shops, we donate and the rest we sell to a broker. In 2019 we saw a positive development in our transportation ways, with an increase of 8% of transportation by ship. In 2019 we have 100% signed commitments to our restricted chemicals program from suppliers. Overall in 2019 we succeed to uphold our promise of increasing the production of products with Oeko-Tex 100 and GOTS certification. Adding to these were our items produced in recycled polyester and Eco Vero.
