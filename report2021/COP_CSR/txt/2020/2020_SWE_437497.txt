DECISION Once our customers have decided to choose us, we sign an agreement. These are different, depending on the property type, and can vary as regards length of the contract and commitments on the tenant’s part. Leases from United Spaces are offered in a subscription format, which differs from normal leases as regards structure, flexibility and length of contract. Lease periods vary, depending on conditions. A lease in an existing property often expires after 3–5 years, whereas leases for new production are longer. Co-working via United Spaces have shorter contract lengths. 38 C A S T EL LU M ’ S D I R EC TO R S’ R EP O RT 20 19 C A S T EL LU M ’ S O PER AT I O N S NEW NEEDS The customer journey is a circular one, and when new or changed needs emerge, we can continue it together. Our size and extensive property portfolio means that the customer can remain our tenant, regardless of whether their operations grow or shrink, move to another city or expand with a new establishment. For our larger customers, there are opportunities to tailor solutions adapted to their specific needs. Examples of this kind of project are the now-completed regional office with associated stores for Ahlsell in Mölndal. With United Spaces, we can also offer our customers flexible transition solutions for those who, for one reason or another, need access to office space on short notice. TENANTS’ EMPLOYEES All together, our customers have 250,000 employees going to work every day in our premises. We see this as a unique opportunity to pursue development of premises together, regardless of whether it’s an office in the middle of the city or a strategically located logistics space close to one of the country’s major highways. For our tenants’ employees, we offer a range of different services that simplify their working day. Over the last few years, Castellum has focused on activities that promote health and are aimed at a more active lifestyle at work. Some examples of this are the WorkOut outdoor office concept and WELL certification of part of our new production. The WELL standard is based on seven concepts that affect health: air, water, lighting, sound, diet, exercise and wellness. BEING A CASTELLUM TENANT Being our tenant should be easy. We provide the premises, and want to give you the service you need in order to achieve your business goals. We have an attentive administration, and personal meetings are important to us. That is why we prioritize having our customer teams close by our customers, and it is also why we have chosen to have our own property managers. We also have general Key Account Managers for our largest tenant customers in several cities, as well as expertise as regards the public sector property customer segment. We work continually on developing our customer journey by measuring, evaluating and monitoring so as to become even better. We have our central business system, customer surveys and an ongoing customer dialogue to help us.

In this context, owning development rights in attractive locations with local zoning plans already in place is a competitive advantage, as this involves the shortest possible lead time before custom­ ers can occupy the premises. At year-end, Castellum had approximately 700,000 square meters of unutilized development rights (leasable area). A number of these include finalized project plans which can be launched relatively promptly. During the year, Castellum made several major potential projects public, and these are summarized on the following pages. The projects are characterized by their location in attractive development areas, in combination with a clear sustainability focus. Unutilized development rights are valued at MSEK 1,120 (1,154), DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS BY VALUE AND REGION equivalent to approximately SEK 1,600 (1,500) per square meter on average.

From “Jobbsprångare” to permanent employment In the autumn of 2018, trained architect Salim Soltaninejad began a four-month internship at Castellum as part of the Jobbsprånget job program. The purpose of Jobbsprånget is to bring newly arrived immigrant academics into the job market. The participants, or “Jobbsprångare,” are assigned a case worker; the internships can vary depending on the participant’s experience and expertise. After the internship concluded, Salim Soltaninejad was offered permanent employment in early 2019 and now works as an architect in Castellum’s Stockholm office.

Given this CASTELLUM'S FIVE FINANCING CORNERSTONES DIVERSIFICATION Castellum is to have a diversified loan portfolio and avoid dependence on both single sources of financing and counterparties. In addition, the maturity of various sources of financing and individual credits is to be distributed over time. Castellum will monitor and follow developments on financial markets for the purpose of acting quickly and matching the needs of the operation. At year end, Castellum's interest-bearing financing amounted to SEK 40.7 billion, of which SEK 32.6 billion came from capital market financing (an MTN program totaling 17.3 billion, an EMTN program totaling MEUR 986, and a program for commercial paper totaling SEK 5.1 billion) equivalent to 80% and the remainder comprising loans in major Nordic banks and credit institutions. As regards capital maturity structure, it totaled 3.8 years at year end and the interval for the loans ranged from 1 month to 23.0 years. LIQUIDITY Castellum will have unused credit facilities available to respond rapidly to the needs of the operations and the opportunities provided. Moreover, there will be revolving credit facilities for the purpose of reducing the need to invest the surplus liquidity. At year end, Castellum had SEK 60.6 billion in credit agreements, of which SEK 40.7 billion was unutilized. STRENGTH The Group’s financial key ratios must be strong, with a loan-to-value ratio not exceeding 50% and an interest coverage ratio of at least 200%. The strength of our property portfolio is enhanced by the quality of our cash flow as well as by the composition of our debt and interest rate portfolio. Castellum aims to reduce the risk of a sudden negative impact on net financial items, arising from changes in the general interest rate and/or the assessment of Castellum as a borrower, that cannot be offset by earnings from operating activities. The loan-to-value ratio was 43% at year end, while the interest coverage ratio for 2019 was 502%. TRANSPARENCY Castellum encourages long-term relationships with both banks and other lenders and investors; its aim is to be transparent in order to increase the relevant parties’ understanding of the Group’s operations and thereby its credit exposure. FLEXIBILITY Castellum must have flexible financing arrangements in order to support the development of operations in relation to acquisitions, divestments and project development. Our credit facilities will provide us with strong flexibility to withdraw and repay on short notice and at no extra cost. Furthermore, Castellum is to have access to flexibility, both in terms of pricing (fixed and floating) and maturities. At year end, Castellum had SEK 28 billion in credit agreements, of which SEK 20 billion was Castellum, Gothenburg unutilized.

Governance is an important component in managing Castellum sustainably and responsibly – all in accordance with the applicable laws, other rules and best practices, and customized based on Castellum’s operations. This Corporate Governance Report starts off with the Chairman’s comment, followed by information on the structure of corporate governance, shareholders and the Annual General Meeting, the Nomination Committee, the auditor, the Board of Directors and committee work, Executive Management, and compliance and internal control. 122 C A S T EL LU M ’ S D I R EC TO R S’ R EP O RT 20 19 C A S T EL LU M ’ S D I R EC TO R S’ R EP O RT 20 19 123 CO R P O R AT E G OV ER N A N CE R EP O RT CH AI R M A N O F T H E B OA R D ’ S COM M EN T Looking steadily ahead Quickly looking back, we can state that once again Castellum have been a forward-looking approach in renegotiating and has gone through a year marked by a healthy level of activity optimizing operations and active management of the debt and continued business development, with the creation of longportfolio. term sustainable shareholder value as our guiding light.

Investment issues and Strategic initiatives monitoring outcomes are the main tasks of Castellum’s Board I would like to highlight two strategic initiatives from the past of Directors. During the year, we also took the opportunity to year that will carry Castellum far into the future. visit major areas of development such as the Nyhamnen district The first consists of our resolute entry into the growing marin Malmö – where construction of properties for the Swedish ket for co-working through the acquisition of United Spaces in National Courts Administration and E.On, with an aggregate January.

The second strategic initiative covers the acquisition of Säve airport, a development area encompassing more than 3 million square meters of land close to the Nordic region’s largest harbor, industries, national transportation links and the city of Gothenburg. The acquisition was completed in December 2018 and finalized in December 2019. In addition to the obvious potential in logistics, we are seeing a great deal of interest from the business community, academia and public sector actors in creating the Nordic region’s largest hub for development in future technology, with a focus on sustainable transportation and mobility. The area will offer development opportunities of SEK 10 billion or more over the coming ten-year period. These two examples of future initiatives reflect Castellum’s focus and innovative power in the selected office and warehouse/logistics property segments. The map is being redrawn – a new decade with a new orientation In conclusion, I would like to share an activity that brought the Board of Directors and Executive Management together in a joint exercise this autumn. I have already mentioned changed customer behavior and supply chains broken open – in the form of co-working operators, for example – that are capturing customer relationships and redrawing the map for traditional property companies. New technology offers close, personalized relationships in real time with large groups of people. In order to challenge the way we think about customers and offerings, to broaden our perspective and burst the boundaries of our thinking, we enlisted the help of a few highly skilled people who counsel leading Swedish and global companies on fast-moving consumer goods and services. They served by turns as provocateurs and catalysts. Our discussions were both inspiring and pleasurable. An issue as simple as identifying who our customers or consumers of services are (now and in the future) – the signatories who sign the lease with us and/or the people who work in our buildings on a daily basis. Perhaps we’re seeing a shift from B2B via B2B2C to B2C before us, which broadens our view of offerings? The Executive Management brings the work on continued development and incorporates it into daily operations.

presented by Castellum are not defined in accordance with the IFRS accounting standards. However, the company believes that these measures provide useful supplementary information to both investors and Castellum’s management, as they facilitate evaluation of the company’s performance. It is to be noted that, since not all companies calculate financial measurements in the same manner, these are not always comparable to measurements used by other companies. These financial measurements should therefore not be seen as a substitute for measures defined under the IFRS. Unless otherwise stated, measurements that are not defined under IFRS are presented along with their reconciliation. Definitions for these measures appear on page 226. Jan–Dec 2019 Jan–Dec 2018 Average number of shares, thousand (key financial metrics related to income statement)* 273,201 273,201 Number of shares outstanding, thousand (key financial metrics related to balance sheet)* 273,201 273,201 *The number of shares from a historical perspective has been restated to take the bonus issue into account (i.e. the value of the subscription right) in the completed new share issue, and has been utilized in all calculations of metrics for SEK per share. The conversion factor is 1.15. INCOME FROM PROPERTY MANAGEMENT Castellum’s operations are focused on cash flow growth from ongoing management operations (i.e. income growth from property management), the yearly target being a 10% increase in income from property management. Income from property management also forms the basis of the annual shareholder dividend: at least 50% of income from property management. Income from property management is calculated before tax paid, as well as after the theoretical tax that Castellum would have paid on income from property management had there been no loss carryforwards.

Based on this equity, Castellum wants to create return and growth at a low level of risk. Net asset value can be calculated both long and short term. Long-term net asset value is based on the balance sheet, with adjustments for items that will not lead to any short-term payment. In Castellum’s case, these would include such things as goodwill, derivatives and deferred tax liability. EPRA NNNAV is shareholders’ equity according to the balance sheet, adjusted for the market value of the deferred tax liability.

Further, it has been assumed that tax loss carry forwards are realized with a nominal tax of 21.4%, which yields a current deferred tax liability of 20%, and that the properties are realized over 50 years where 33% are sold directly with a nominal tax of 20.6% and 67% are sold indirectly in corporate wrappers where the buyer’s tax discount is 7%, which yields a current deferred tax liability of 6%. 150 C A S T EL LU M ’ S D I R EC TO R S’ R EP O RT 20 19 FI N A N CIA L R EP O RT I N G FINANCIAL RISK Castellum’s strategy is to own, develop and manage properties at low financial risk.
