Connecting the world through air transport not only creates cultural and social value. Every single route creates wealth. According to the Danish government’s 43 intercontinental routes aviation strategy from 2017, aviation in Denmark generates growth and creates jobs worth about DKK 30 bn. 188 For Copenhagen Airport alone, one mill. additional passengers lead to about 850 new, permanent jobs. Accordingly, route development in collaboration with the airlines is a core priority for Copenhagen Airport. Together with the Ministry of Business, the Ministry of Transport, the Foreign Ministry, VisitDenmark and Wonderful Copenhagen, direct routes we have drawn up a national list of ten potential new long-haul destinations: Seoul, Johannesburg, Vancouver, Ho Chi Minh City, Manila, Cape Town, Seattle, Mumbai, Houston and Shenzhen. 24 PERFORMANCE / AERONAUTICAL BUSINESS A more comprehensive route network Norwegian’s long-haul route programme The growth in belly cargo supports airline 32 At CPH, a team of route developers is workconsisted of many different destinations and earnings, thus making passenger routes even ing continuously with the airlines to maximise relatively few weekly departures – a total of more financially sustainable.

The amortisation period is 3-5 years. Impairments The carrying amount of software and software under development is tested at least annually for any impairment beyond that expressed in amortisation charges. Where there are such indications, an impairment charge is made against the lower of the recoverable amount of the assets and the carrying amount. The recoverable amount of the asset is determined as the higher of the net selling price and the value in use. The recoverable amount of software is assessed together with other assets in the smallest group of assets, for which a reliable recoverable amount can be determined in an overall assessment. Estimates and judgements The estimated useful lives are determined based on historical experience and expectations of future use of the assets. These may prove to be unachievable, which could lead to future reassessment of their useful lives and a need for impairment. 78 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE & STATEMENTS / FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes Investments NOTE Intangible assets (continued) 3.2 2019 2018 Software Software under under DKK mill.

These estimates are based on the Company’s business plans and expected useful lives of the assets, the technical and maintenance state of the assets, and regulatory requirements. The residual value is estimated at DKK 184.7 mill. (2018: DKK 184.7 mill.) at the balance sheet date. The useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at least at every year-end based on these factors. CPH evaluates the carrying amounts in order to assess whether events have occurred that require an adjustment of these amounts because they are not expected to be recoverable. In estimating the runways’ useful lives, CPH has divided the system into three elements: foundations, surfaces and technical installations. CPH’s assessment is that each element has a different useful life. The runway surfaces have shorter lives than the foundations due to immediate wear: their useful life expectancy is 10 years. This assessment is supported by historical replacement of runway surfaces and planning for future replacement. Technical installations related to the runways are estimated to have a useful life of 15 years. It is assessed that these technical installations related to the runways do not have the same useful life as other technical installations, taking into account safety measures. Impairment The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is tested at least annually for indications of impairment beyond that expressed in the depreciation charges. Where there are such indications, an impairment charge is made against the lower of the recoverable amount of the assets and the carrying amount. In assessing the recoverable amount, CPH takes into account significant indicators of potential impairment such as purchase and selling prices, and general market conditions. 81 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE & STATEMENTS / FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes Investments NOTE Property, plant and equipment (continued) 3.3 2019 Other fixtures Property, plant Land and Plant and and fittings, tools and equipment DKK mill. buildings* machinery and equipment under construction Total Cost Accumulated cost at 1 January 8,498.6 8,228.9 1,985.6 1,893.0 20,606.1 Additions 2,051.1 2,051.1 Disposals (248.7) (127.6) (39.1) (415.4) Transferred 948.0 488.2 277.7 (1,713.9) Accumulated cost at 31 December 9,197.9 8,589.5 2,224.2 2,230.2 22,241.8 Depreciation Accumulated depreciation at 1 January 3,395.3 4,148.5 1,336.1 8,879.9 Depreciation 286.5 319.0 177.0 782.5 Depreciation on disposals (248.7) (127.6) (39.1) (415.4) Accumulated depreciation at 31 December 3,433.1 4,339.9 1,474.0 9,247.0 Carrying amount at 31 December 5,764.8 4,249.6 750.2 2,230.2 12,994.8 Of which fixed assest for operational leasing 1,737.3 693.8 148.7 2,579.8 * CPH properties have been mortgaged for a total of DKK 514.9 mill.
