The main objective of this policy is and safety management the systematic reduction of workplace accidents and the application of preventive measures on all levels of the organization and in all its processes. To system this end, Damm promotes and develops comprehensive prevention to ensure that preventive action and responsibility are managed autonomously and implicitly in all areas. Each company has its own prevention plan outlining an organizational model for the management and application of Damm’s Policy on Occupational Health and Safety. These plans define the procedures, instructions and management practices for the prevention of occupational risks, establishing the specific objectives needed for each company to work towards full homogenization and convergence in best practice and standards. In addition, alongside this prevention plan, an annual program for preventive action is established in keeping with legal obligations to provide protection from dangers and reduce occupational risks. Each company’s preventive service is responsible for developing and providing the support that management needs to apply the prevention plan, and companies always have an external health monitoring service that regularly checks employee status and aptitude. Our system for managing occupational health and safety is organized in keeping with the ISO 45001 international standard. In the 2019 fiscal year, Estrella de Levante obtained an occupational health and safety certification in keeping with ISO 45001, making it the first brewery to do so (beforehand, the company was certified using the OHSAS 19001 standard). Following its example, Alfil Logistics and Compañía Cervecera Damm developed procedures and rules for a management system that meet this standard, and completed a pre-audit for certification. Font Salem has a management system that applies the standards put forth by Spain’s National Institute on Occupational Safety and Hygiene (Instituto Nacional de Seguridad e Higiene en el Trabajo, or INSST) in order to integrate risk prevention into the production process using the corresponding prevention plan before a preventive organizational chart is defined. Annual report Damm 127 Annual report 403-2 Hazard identification, Damm has established a system for the ongoing diagnosis and evaluation of risks, where measures are planned and actions taken are reviewed. The risk assessment, and incident preventive services have a contractual obligation to apply this system. The evaluation system is determined by the company’s Health and Safety Committee, investigation and only measures recognized using objective criteria and established deadlines are accepted. To guarantee the quality of these processes, including the skills of the individuals that carry them out, those responsible for the prevention of occupational Letter from the risks are assigned a series of objectives. These objectives undergo internal monitoring by the management of the corporate area and the company’s health Executive chairman and safety committees. In addition, external monitoring processes are conducted in centres with systems for managing occupational health and safety, and an ongoing training plan in the professional skills of its technicians is maintained. 1 Using the evaluations of each identified risk, one or multiple quantitative or qualitative actions are established to reduce or control that risk. In the case of Font Salem, the prevention department carries out evaluations on the efficiency of the preventive system and its integration in the productive process. 2019 at Damm Damm provides its collaborators with different communication channels for reporting dangers or occupational hazards. Font Salem has a Safety and Hygiene Committee that processes suggestions for improvement received from the labour risk prevention suggestion box or through direct means of communication such as email. 2 Employees that are sensitive to potential hazards (injuries, ailments, etc.) must inform health vigilance services of their situation. In general, these services People will carry out an objective evaluation of the individual’s aptitude in keeping with the demands and risks of the position. The prevention service will then present a report to the organization, indicating aspects and restrictions that must be taken into account when organizing the individual’s professional assignments. Furthermore, regarding serious and imminent risks, both the preventive policy and the law allow for work to be interrupted unilaterally. Once 3 again, the prevention service will determine whether or not this work is feasible and/or establish preventive measures. In any case, hierarchical channels or communication channels of the preventive service can be used to inform the organization. The environment The processes for investigating occupational incidents, evaluating risks and determining corrective actions are initiated with the notification of dangers and incidents and, if necessary, accidents (these are accessible, transparent, and open to the entire organization). Periodically (monthly, at least), accident 4 rates are published, with a report on the most relevant cases. This is a permanent item on the meeting agenda of the health and safety committees. At Font Salem, notifications of the accidents are received by the Prevention Department, which initiates the necessary investigations together with the external Society prevention service. Periodically (monthly, at least) accident rates are published, with a report on the most relevant cases. Proposed measures to prevent them from happening again must be included. 5 403-3 Occupational health To guarantee the quality of occupational health services, these have regularly updated information to help adapt the revision protocols to identified risks. About the report services Whenever necessary, locations are visited to gain first-hand knowledge of the workplace and its requirements. 403-4 Worker participation, Risk evaluations are carried out by physically visiting the location, always with the presence and participation of the prevention delegates. Collaborators consultation, and are also consulted. All employees (internal, eventual or external) have a specific communication channel available for preventing occupational risks, such 6 communication on as a suggestion box. Forms of presenting written suggestions will vary, with different levels of openness and management in different departments. The GRI content index occupational health and author of the suggestion may be identified to offer a better response. In certain centres, the most interesting and/or relevant suggestions may be ranked safety and rewarded. At Font Salem, a Hygiene and Safety Committee exists to process suggestions for improvement. A suggestion box for Occupational Risk Prevention and other means of direct communication such as email are also available. 7 Workplace accidents are monitored and combatted using different means. At Grupo Rodilla, an exhaustive method has been established for analysing Table of contents causes and controlling corrective actions, with a greater focus on individual awareness (for store employees, etc.). Meanwhile, manufacturers (beverage for the Global Compact companies) focus more on intermediate management structures. Health and safety issues addressed in formal agreements with unions are listed below, using percentages to specify degrees: CC Damm (10 % personal protection equipment, 15 % joint business/collaborator health and safety committees, 20 % participation of workers’ representatives in inspections, audits, and investigations into health and safety accidents, 10 % training in health and safety, 15 % claiming mechanisms, 5 % right to refuse unsafe jobs, and 25 % regular inspections) and Font Salem (10 % training programs, 10 % action protocols, 30 % machines and equipment, 20 % roadways, internal circulation and pedestrian walkways, 20 % facility safety, and 10 % individual protection equipment and protection elements). At Grupo Rodilla, there is daily contact with occupational risk prevention delegates, as two of the delegates from one of the companies are part of the Human Resources Department. In addition, they hold meetings each trimester with the Health and Safety Committee, as well as extraordinary meetings to address specific topics such as psychosocial studies. 403-5 Worker training on 61 occupational health and Newly incorporated staff or staff assigned to a new position will be trained in risks, instructions and preventive measures specific to their position.
