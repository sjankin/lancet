Since 2017 the company joined the United Nations Global Compact, presenting year after year our progress regarding Human Rights and Labor Rights, environmental protection, and the fight against corruption. In 2019 the organization witnessed achievements such as bringing the World Series Of Poker to Mexico, the opening of the Grand León casino, the awarding of the Great Place to Work distinction, and the recycling in all the gaming rooms in the northern region. All these accomplishments fill us with pride and challenge us to continue operating at a level that distinguishes us from the Mexico gambling industry. Recently we have faced new challenges, such as the discussion of several initiatives in the Federal Congress that seek to improve the regulatory framework of the gaming and lottery industry. In this discussion, Logrand Entertainment Group has promoted the inclusion of public policies that encourage sustainability initiatives in the communities where the industry operates. The gaming and lottery industry in Mexico is in the midst of constant change affected by external factors, such as the decline in national and global economic growth. Therefore, the company considers its obligation to manage and innovate new practices with stakeholders, seeking to adhere to and satisfy their needs to ensure the continuity and growth of the business in a complex and volatile environment. Logrand Entertainment Group will continue to promote amongst Sergio Saide M. gaming industry participants in Mexico the generation of Social Responsibility initiatives. We are aiming to reduce the average environmental and social impacts of this industry, such as the recycling of plastics, reducing water consumption, energy consumption from renewable sources, among others.
