Certified quality management systems ensure compliance with strict standards. 30,000 mechanical, chemical, physical and fire-relevant tests were conducted in 2019 at the main testing centre in Münster, Germany. Other Armacell facilities around the world also have state-of-the-art product testing centres. Around 100 researchers and technicians at sites in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany and the USA are driving innovation in quality-oriented production, product performance, new materials and pioneering technologies. By building on the sound foundations of quality and innovation, Armacell has a growth strategy that is both successful and sustainable. 20 / ARMACELL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 OUR AREAS OF COMMITMENT Driving growth INNOVATION SUSTAINABLE GROWTH ULTRA-THIN, ULTRA-LIGHT BASED ON SOUND PILLARS ArmaGelTM production award of the Commendation of the Prime Minister.

ArmaGelTM DT gives users the benefit of effective, versatile and ultra-thin cryogenic insulation at temperatures as low as –180° C. These advances in aerogel technology were made possible by cutting-edge innovations developed at Armacell Jios Aerogels (AJA), a joint venture based in Cheonan, South Korea. Cheonan is one of Armacell’s major multi-technology sites where production of the first ArmaGelTM aerogel blankets began in 2017. The success of the ArmaGelTM product range meant the Cheonan plant had to be extended. The industrial-scale aerogel production line that began operating in August 2019 has tripled the plant’s annual production capacity to 750,000 m2 and enhanced operational safety.

The house was assembled in just 14 hours using 170 ArmaForm® panels that were laminated together without nails or spikes. The house’s eco-footprint is impressive too: 612,000 recycled PET bottles went into its construction. Building more houses out of PET will nurture Armacell’s sustainable business concept of combining environment-friendly production with customer value.
